            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Amongst which the least was the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of this Outward world, whose several powers and properties touching variously upon my tender senses, made to me such enravishing musick, and snatcht away my Soul into so great admiration, love, and desire of a nearer acquaintance with that Principle from which all these things did flow; that the pleasure and joy that frequently accrued to me from hence is plainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable, though I have attempted to leave some marks and traces thereof in my <hi>Philosophical Poems.</hi>

               <hi>Existence of God</hi> and of his Will, that <hi>we should be holy, even as he is holy,</hi> there was nothing that is truly sinful that could appear to me, assisted by such a power, to be unconquerable.

Which solicitude put me upon my first search into <hi>the Nature of the Soul,</hi> which I pursued chiefly by the guidance of the School of <hi>Plato,</hi> whose <hi>Philosophy</hi> to this very day I look upon to be <hi>more then Humane</hi> in the chief strokes thereof.

And though some over-subject to the Fanatick disease have looked upon that unexpected sally of mine as a very extravagant exploit; yet I did easily bear with their ignorance, deeming it in my silent thoughts in some sort parallel to that of the peevish Hebrew who reproached <hi>Moses</hi> for slaying of the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> not knowing that it was a preludious act to his delivering of his whole nation from the bondage of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>

               <hi>6.</hi> And I hope I may speak it without vanity, that what is discovered concerning <hi>Enthusiasme</hi> in my <hi>Enthusiasmus Triumphatus,</hi> together with that which is comprehended in this present Volume, will contribute no small share to a rightful and justifiable subduing of so dangerous a distemper, and to the slaying or at least fettering that wild Beast that the Devil himself rides upon, when he warres against the Lamb, whose Throne I have seen shaken with the pushings of this monsters horns for these many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though never clearer then now of late.

            <p>Which cannot better be done then by shewing <hi>the Reasonableness and important Usefulness of Christian Religion</hi> in the <hi>Historical</hi> sense there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and in reference to the very Person of Christ our Saviour; which I have, I hope, abundantly performed in this present Treatise: and by discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>the Natural Causes and imposturous Consequences of Enthusiasme,</hi> which I had done before in <hi>Enthusiasmus Triumphatus.</hi> Which two

            <p n="7">
               <hi>7.</hi> After this the bold impiety of this present Age engaged my Thoughts in a Subject of no less moment then the former:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The occasion and preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore against Atheisme <hi>and his</hi> Threefold Cabbala.</note> For I saw that other abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red monster, <hi>Atheisme,</hi> proudly strutting with a lofty gate and impudent forehead, boasting himself the onely genuine offspring of true Wisdome and Philosophy, namely of that which makes <hi>Matter</hi> alone the Substance of all things in the world. This misshapen Creature was first nourished up in the stie of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and fancied it self afterward grown more tall and stout by further strength it seemed to have received from some new Principles of the <hi>French Philosophy</hi> misinterpreted and perverted by certain impure and unskilful pens.</p>
            <p>Which unexpected confidence of those blind boasters made me with all anxiety and care imaginable search into <hi>the power of Matter and mere Mechanical motion,</hi> and consider how far they might go of themselves in the production of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the World. But as for the Philosophy of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> it seemed to me at the very first sight such a foolery, that I was much amazed that a person of so commendable parts as <hi>P. Gassendus</hi> could ever have the patience to rake out such old course rags out of that rotten dunghill to stuffe his large Volumes withall. But I must confess I did as much admire <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> Philosophy as I did despise the <hi>Epicurean,</hi> who has carried on the power of <hi>Matter</hi> for the production of the <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> of Nature with that neatness and coherence, that if he had been as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in other things as skilful in Mechanicks, he could not but have fancied himself to have wone that crown that many wits have striven for, that is, the honour of being accounted the most subtil and able Atheist of both the present and past Ages.</p>
            <p>This made me peruse his Writings with still more and more diligence: and the more I read, the more I admired his Wit; but at last grew the more confirmed <hi>That it was utterly impossible that</hi> Matter <hi>should be the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly essential Principle of things,</hi> as I have in several places of my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings demonstrated. And therefore having clearly vanquished this difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I betook my self with greater alacrity to the writing of my <hi>Antidote against Atheisme.</hi> To which presently after I added my <hi>Threefold Cabbala</hi> as an Appendix to the same design, being well advised what a homely conceit our high Wits have of the Three first Chapters of <hi>Genesis,</hi> though they do betray their own ignorance by their mean opinion of them.</p>
            <p n="8">

                  <hi>The urgent occasion of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Treatise, as also of his Discourse</hi> Of the immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Soul.</note> had not a dangerous Sickness, that made me suspect that the time did near approach of quitting this my earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tabernacle, urged me more carefully to bethink my self what reception I might have in the other world. And, praised be God, such was the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Soul, though then much overrun with Melancholy, that my presages concerning my future state were very favourable and comfortable, and my desire was to be gathered to that body of which Iesus Christ is Head, even he who was crucified at Ierusalem, and felt the pangs of death for a Propitiation of the sins of the world, who was then represented to me as visible a Prince and as distinct a person and head Politick as any

King or Potentate upon earth. And therefore being thus fully convinced with my self that He whose Life was ever to me the most sweet and lovely of any thing I could see or taste, was indeed even in his Humane nature made a King and Priest for ever, and constituted Soveraign over men and Angels, my Heart was full of Ioy; but withall accompanied with a just measure of shame, that I had spoken hitherto so sparingly of his <hi>Royal</hi> Office and of the homage due to so Divine a Potentate, whose Subject to my great satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction I found my self to be, and whose presence I did not at all despair of approaching in due time to my eternal comfort and honour. Which sense of things made me conceive a solemn Vow with my self, if God gave me life, to write this present Treatise. Which occasion I thought fit not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal, though I be much averse from speaking any thing over-particularly of my self, that the high-flown Fanaticks of this Age may consider more carefully what I have writ, and take heed how they either slight or revolt from their Celestial Soveraign.</p>
            <p>But I thought it very convenient before I put in execution this great design, to take again into consideration that other weighty Subject, <hi>The Immortality of the Soul,</hi> being better appointed and provided for the clearing of that Truth then I was when I first adventured upon the Theory. And thus having fully convinced my self (and I hope as many else as are capable of judging of the more choice and subtile Conclusions of Reason and Philosophy) <hi>That there is a God,</hi> and <hi>That the Soul of man is immortal,</hi> which are the two main pillars upon which all Religion stands; I advanced forward with courage, having left no Enemy behind, and betook my self with great confidence to the finishing and publishing of this present Treatise <hi>Of the Mystery of Christianity.</hi> Which I look upon as the most precious and the most concerning piece of Wisdome that is communicable to the Soul of Man, the very chief and top<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bough of that Tree of Knowledge whose fruit has neither poison nor bitterness. And therefore being come to my journeys end, I will here sit down with thanks, and enjoy my self under this comfortable shade, and do assure thee, Reader, that I am not likely to weary thy eyes with the descriptions of any further discoveries by my pen.</p>

I add also, <hi>Faithful,</hi> I having wrote impartially, setting down nothing out of any Passion, Interest or Side-taking, nor out of the spirit of opposition or vain-glory, but speaking the Truth freely without any respect to persons or factions; not minding either to sooth the one or displease the other, but delivering my message so as one that is sensible he must give account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of within a small space of time before them in the other World. And as I profess my self that I have done all things herein with a faithful heart, so I doubt not but the Effect will witness for me, that what I profess is true.</p>
            <p>For whereas some in an Hypocritical flattery of the External <hi>Person</hi> of Christ shuffle out all obligation to the <hi>Divine Life,</hi> that Mystical Christ within us, and pervert the grace of God in the Gospel to loosness and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertinisme; and others on the contrary (whether out of the power of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy that calls the thoughts inward, or the scandal they take from abuse of the personal Offices of our Blessed Saviour, (they seeing the generality of Christians make the external frame of Religion but a palliation for sin) or whether from the obscurity of some Articles of the Christian Faith) have become plainly Infidels and misbelievers of the whole History of Christ, and will have nothing to do with his Person, but look upon the Mystery of Christianity as a thing wholy <hi>within us,</hi> and that has no other object then what is either acting or acted in our selves: I have with all earnestness of endeavour and with undeniable clearness of Testimony from Reason and Scripture demonstrated the Truth and Necessity of both <hi>Christ within</hi> and <hi>Christ without,</hi> and have plainly set out the wonderful Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Goodness of God in contriving so powerful a means as the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Oeconomy of Christianity is for the renewing of our natures into the glorious image of his Son, who is the Life of God and the Soul's sure pledge of an happy Immortality. Besides that there is no Article of the Christian Faith, nor any particular Miracle hapning to or done by our Saviour or to be done by him, mentioned in the Gospels or any where else in the New Testament, but I have given so solid and rational an account thereof, that I am confident that no man that has the use of his Understanding shall be able ever to pretend any Reason against Christian Religion, such as it is exhibited in the Holy Writings themselves. And what is, if this be not, to set out <hi>a Faithful Representation of the Gospel?</hi>

            <p>Which I have not rashly termed <hi>The Everlasting Gospel</hi> of our Lord and Saviour, &amp;c. being warranted thereto by that of <hi>Daniel,</hi> who styles Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>10.</hi> As for my <hi>Discourse</hi> it self, I having adventured there to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine none of the more nice and intricate Opinions of Theology, but kept my self within the bounds of the confessed Truth of our Religion, I hope very few things will occurre that shall not be found inoffensive and perspicuously consonant to Scripture. That which I imagine most lyable to censure is, that in some matters I may seem over-copious, in others too scant. As for example, <hi>my Description of the Animal Life, my Display of Paganisme, and my Parallelisme betwixt our Saviour and Apollonius,</hi> may haply seem to some set down over-largely and luxuriantly. But truly I thought I could not be too punctuall in describing <hi>the Animal life,</hi> it being so ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable for our better understanding <hi>the Divine,</hi> whose nature and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by how much more clearly and distinctly any one conceives, and withall has a savoury and experimental rellish thereof, with the greater satisfaction shall he peruse what I have writ, and understand the Reasonableness, and be assured of the Truth and Solidity of the Christian Religion. For <hi>the Divine Life</hi> is in a manner the deepest bottome of this whole <hi>Mystery of Godliness</hi> we treat of.</p>
            <p>Moreover, The more perfect understanding of the nature of <hi>the Animal life</hi> makes us the abler to judge of the sundry Superstitions of <hi>Paganisme,</hi> wherein though by their subtil Apologies they could clear themselves from <hi>Atheisme</hi> and the <hi>worser</hi> sort of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and could make it good that it was <hi>One Eternal Deity,</hi> be he never so Philosophically defined, that was the Chief and Ultimate Object of their Worship; yet it is hereby appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that the best of them exceeds not the <hi>Animal</hi> bounds, forasmuch as they worshipped God in these rude Religions onely out of the sense of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications of <hi>the Animal life:</hi> And if I have more copiously set down how foully and sordidly they have done it, my pains therein I hope may be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to very good purpose, it being manifest thereby how just a victory <hi>Christianity</hi> had over <hi>Paganisme.</hi>

better sort of the Heathen, as <hi>Hierocles</hi> and others, in such sort that they took him to be at least as sacred a person as our Saviour himself; yet I doubt not but that by this <hi>Parallelisme</hi> of mine I have proved the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be very vain and presumptuous, and have made it appear to as many as are competent judges of what is truly divine, that <hi>our Saviour Christ</hi> does exceed the character of <hi>Apollonius</hi> (though it is very probable <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus</hi> has taken the liberty to adde more <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Perfections</hi> then he ever was guilty of) as far as <hi>Apollonius</hi> did the brute beasts.

For that also tends to the confirmation of our Religion, that she has no actual competitors but such as bear upon them their self-condemnation at the very first view. Which is easilier obtained of <hi>Mahometisme,</hi> their success and victories having made them bold and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to lay out themselves to the World. But <hi>Familisme</hi> is a more various, a more obscure and sculking monster, though she mutter in her dark hole that she has right to the dominion of the whole Earth, and that <hi>Christianity</hi> and <hi>Mahometisme</hi> are to give place to her. And therefore truely it might have been judged a defect, if I had not thus haled her out of her den into open day, that the world once having seen her may say they have enough of her, unless God out of his wrath has given them up to <hi>a reprobate sense,</hi> for their abuse of the solid Truth of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>I confess my so large Excursions and frequent Expostulations with the <hi>Familists</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> are not very ornamental to my Discourse, and may go off but heavily with such persons as peruse mens Writings more for pleasure then service, and rather for private satisfaction then for publick usefulness, which they neither intend themselves, nor do easily spy out or rellish in the intentions of others. But the publick interest of the Church of Christ being the scope and measure of my writing this Treatise, it was sufficient that I kept faithful to my own design, not heeding the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of more trim and elegant fancies, who are so nice and finical that they would not come near a sore, though they could heal it by touching it, nor approach a sick person, though the cast of their shadow were a cure.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to give an account of my so sedulous and copious Reprehensions and Convictions of these two Sects, who have an over-near affinity one with another, and were growing apace into one Body of <hi>Familisme,</hi> (which made me represent that Sect so formidable as I have) The first reason of my so industriously accosting them is the either certain knowledge or strong presumption I have that there may very well be extraordinarily sincere and wel-meaning men adhering to their way. For though the depth of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of <hi>Familisme,</hi> and I doubt of <hi>Quakerisme</hi> too, be that which every good Christian ought from his very heart to detest and abhorre, namely
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:55305:6"/>
               <hi>The slighting, nay, I may say, the utter rejecting of the Person of Christ as to his Humane nature, with all his Offices assigned to him by his Father;</hi> yet this is an <hi>Arcanum</hi> that is kept hid from their <hi>Novices,</hi> (and if a man continue conscienciously good, he may be <hi>a Novice</hi> with them as long as he lives) to whom they propound nothing but the most weighty Precepts of the Gospel, and charm their attention with finely-contrived Allegories of the History of Christ, interpreting all to a spiritual or mystical sense of things to be done in us: With which these yonglings are not a little tickled, as thinking themselves adorned with a special piece of divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and then they being marvellously sincere, and having from an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastick</hi> complexion or some better principle a very eager thirst after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all goodness and righteousness, the rellish of these Morall allusions must needs become still the more savoury to them. Whence it does appear that the best and most serious tempered men may be the easiliest drawn to the liking and adhering to so fair and cunning a Faction, and that consequently a man cannot be over-careful and solicitous in trying all means possible to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive them and set them in the right way.</p>
            <p>But then again further, Our design was not onely in the behalf of these who really deserve to be pittied, but was aimed also against their obdurate deceivers, who being deeply baptised into this accursed Apostasy from the Person of Christ, led multitudes along with them, the Kingdome swarming with those that for no good purpose so peremptorily distinguished themselves from other men, by a resolved coursness and crosness of deportment. What therefore could I do more seasonably, when not onely my self but even almost all men were afraid that this sort of people would overrun all, then to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to the eye of the world the Bottome of so damnable a Conspiracy, which was no less then Rebellion against their celestial Soveraign Christ Iesus, and the undermining or tearing in pieces of his Kingdome upon Earth under pretence of beginning the Reign of his <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>holy ones?</hi> This made me so careful and explicite in discovering the whole Mystery of <hi>Familisme,</hi> and so free and vehement in my Expostulations both with them and the <hi>Quakers</hi> in this Treatise of mine, being very impatient whatever Variegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons an ill-managed Liberty should run the Nation into, that they should ever become <hi>Pagans.</hi>

As methinks should appear plainly to any man that considers it from the description of <hi>the New Jerusalem,</hi> whose Foundation and whole Fabrick runs so upon <hi>Twelve.</hi> For truly it seems to me very unsafe and over-near the brinks of reproach to the Spirit of God, to conceit that Wisdome which dictated this Prophecy so shallow and trifling, as to mean nothing by that so industriously inculcating the number <hi>Twelve</hi> but the Churches proceeding first from the preaching of the Apostles; a Truth that no man never so destitute of the spirit of divination could misse of, or possibly think otherwise. Wherefore the meaning of the Prophecy question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less is, That after the Church has added <hi>false Fundamentals</hi> to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith, and as bad Superstructures, the time will come when it shall be again restored to its former purity: and That as the root <hi>Twelve</hi> is the Embleme of the pure Church; so there is also a root of a number that will discover that Church which is the Mother of this great Apostasy, as really in my judgement Mr. <hi>Potter</hi> in the number 666. has ingeniously demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>
            <p>But it is manifest that all the zealous Corrivals for the Government of this Nation, by either decrying things for <hi>Antichristian</hi> that in themselves are innocent and of an indifferent nature, or by obtruding Opinions that are worse then indifferent, have but shewed themselves Branches of that great Stock of Apostasy, and are too far removed from the reputed merit of either being or beginning of a Church that is <hi>purely Apostolical.</hi>

            <p>For whether we consider the excellent Qualifications of our Gracious Prince, whom Providence has so long time disciplined in the most effectual method of Prudence and Vertue, besides the express Declaration of His own Royal inclinations this way; or whether we look upon the Reasonableness of the thing it self, it being not onely recommended to us both by <hi>Precept</hi> and <hi>Prophecies,</hi> but also offering so irrefragable evidence from its own

nature of the indispensableness of the duty; there being no other possible means to reduce the World to a right Christian tenour of Spirit, and to recover it to a due strength and soundness of complexion, but by shearing off those large excrescencies of either useless or scandalous Ceremonies and Opinions, the foments of strife and palliations of Hypocrisy, men seeking by these to be excused from the most weighty Precepts of the Gospel; or lastly we take notice of the great Interest the wise and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Clergy of this Nation cannot but discover herein even in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to themselves: it is almost impossible to doubt of either endeavour or success in this so important affair.

In the third and last place, Although the exigency of the Times which then urged me to write thus carefully touching the <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Familists</hi> is now (God be thanked) changed into a more safe Scene of things, and the resettlement of our Gracious Soveraign in his Throne doth again secure the Scepter of Christ to his Church; yet I thought it fit not to ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>unge what I had wrote concerning these Sects. For for the present, It cannot but contribute considerably to an unfained composure of their Spirits and peaceful acquiescence in the known Christian Truth, their minds being more at leisure now &amp; better fitted to consider what is true then they were before, when the heat of Enthusiastick hopes of I know not what great success inflamed them and blew them up so high, that the voice of sober Reason could not well be heard in that fanatick storm and Bluster, nor an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour easily let go, which seemed a pledge of the sudden approach of so great advantages to the entertainers of it. And then for the future, So funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental a discovery of the unsoundness and madness of these Sects cannot, I think, but be very effectual for the preventing their spreading hereafter; that it will not be any longer in the power of their false Teachers to befool well-meaning men with fine words, and make them unawares countenance a Faction, the deepest <hi>Arcanum</hi> whereof is absolute rebellion against the Person of Christ and an utter abrogation of Christian Religion.</p>
            <p>Which task though others heretofore have undertaken, and I question not but with like faithful and zealous regard to the good of the Church; yet their discovery could not be so perfect, they not living in an Age of such liberty,
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:55305:7"/>
which has tempted all sorts of men to shew themselves in their own colours. Besides that what they wrote being onely concerning this Sect of <hi>Familisme</hi> in Pamphlets apart by themselves, the matter was not of such general concernment as to invite or engage men to read. But the Subject of this present Treatise being of so Universal and so Weighty importance, it cannot fail to prove a more effectual Monitour to the World of the deadly danger that lies under that fair enticing Title of <hi>The Family of Love.</hi>

                  <hi>The reason of his opposing the Familists and Quakers above any other Sects.</hi>
               </note> in that you observe me so eagerly opposing no other Sect; for the design of my Discourse leads me not to such Particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities as are controverted amongst Christians that still hold the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of our Religion: against whom I profess my self eager in nothing so much as in hearty Exhortation that they would not make their Difference of Opinion any breach of Friendship, but an exercise of their Christian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and tender forbearance one of another: not insulting over one anothers supposed ignorance, nor forcing one another to external compliance and profession of what they do not believe, by harsh Antichristian compulsions; but by calme reasoning and kind treating one another with mutuall love and patience, which is an exercise more pleasing in the sight of God then the exactest Uniformity of Opinions and Worship that the greatest Formalist can propound or desire. This is all that I find my self bound in conscience to be earnest in against such like Sects as these. But <hi>Familisme</hi> is no such Sect, nay, to speak properly, and to yield them their own boast, they are no Sect at all, I mean of Christians, but a totall Apostasy from Christianity, as you may easily understand out of what I have writ in the following Discourse. And therefore my present purpose being <hi>The Demonstration of the Solidity of the Fundamentals of Christianisme as it is apparently comprehended in the Holy Writ,</hi> it was proper and unavoidable for me to deal with all such as did oppose or undermine those undispensable Truths of our Religion; and therefore I had been wanting to the Cause, if I had not thus industriously set my self against this dangerous and mischievous <hi>Mystery of Unbelief</hi> which is ordinarily called <hi>Familisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as I have not spared them, so there is no Sect that has stoln away any one Essential of Christianity, whether appertaining to <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Speculation,</hi> but I have bid them battel, and I hope rescued the prey out of their hands and led them Captive into the Truth; at least they have not escaped their share of chastisement for their committing of so hainous a crime. And this is all that I could in reason attempt, unless I would break all the Lawes of Method, and make useless Excursions beyond the set limits of my Discourse.</p>

                  <hi>His excuse for being less accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Daniels weeks.</hi>
               </note> But there are other Omissions I must confess that may seem more justly liable to that imputation. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in that I have not endeavoured to clear <hi>the Prophecy of Daniel's weeks</hi> to that accuracy, as to bring the Passion of our Saviour to <hi>the middle of the last week,</hi> as the Prophecy seems most naturally to imply; but have contented my self with that Chronological account of <hi>Funccius</hi> that suffers it to fall in the last day of the week. But as I have already intimated in the place, there may be that latitude of the meaning of <hi>the middle of the week,</hi>
               <pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:55305:8"/>
that it may signifie any time of the week begun and not yet expired. In which sense <hi>Funccius</hi> his account is <hi>within a year or thereabout</hi> of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act completion of the Prophecy. Which is so near the matter, that one may easily suspect that it is some mistake in their computations that it does not happen just according to the Prophecy, so little time being easily misreckoned in so large an account. Besides, it was sufficient for my purpose onely to take notice and to make evident, That this Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> is understood of the <hi>Messias,</hi> and That the weeks are long ago expired. For by this alone we may demonstratively conclude That he is already come; which was the onely thing pertinent to my present Subject. And lastly, for thy further sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, as the task thou expectedst had been too laborious for me to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, so thou thy self wilt hold it needless when thou shalt understand with what accuracy and solidity it is already perfected by the learned Master of our Colledge Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> in his publick Lectures in the Schools: wherein he has undeceived the world, misled too long by the over-great opinion they had of <hi>Joseph Scaliger,</hi> and taking <hi>Funccius</hi> his <hi>Epocha</hi> has demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated the Manifestation of the <hi>Messiah</hi> to have fallen out at the End of the sixty ninth week, and his <hi>Passion</hi> in the <hi>midst of the last,</hi> in the most natural and proper sense thereof. Which demonstration of his is in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of as much price and worth in Theologie, as either <hi>The Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Bloud</hi> in Physick, or <hi>The Motion of the Earth</hi> in natural Philosophy, as I have already noted in its proper place.</p>

               <hi>19.</hi> Again, I may haply seem unto thee defectuous in that I have so expressely professed my hope and expectation of Better times in the Church, and yet not gone about to produce that copiousness of Arguments that might have befitted the management of so desirable a Truth. But I have to answer for my self, That that subject was too big for my hands, especially being as full already as they could grasp; and That the Theory also was not essential to the scope of my present Discourse; and lastly, That certain friends of mine (whose more then ordinary skill and happy rellish of the best and choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest things has made them fit undertakers of so usefull a design) will, I hope, ere long gratifie the world with their excellent performances in that subject. The promotion of which Opinion cannot but be profitable to the Church of Christ, provided the case be rightly stated, namely, That these good Times, which we expect and hope for, will not be the exaltation of this or that Sect. For the childish conceit of some is, that the future prosperity of the Church will be nothing but the setting up this Forme or that Opinion, and so every Faction will be content to be <hi>Millennists</hi> upon condition that Christ may reign after their way or mode, that is in Calvinisme, in Arminianisme, in Papisme, in Anabaptisme, in Quakerisme, in Presbytery, in Episcopacy, in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency, and the like. <hi>But the true happiness of those days is not to be measured by Formalities or Opinions, but by a more corroborated Faith in Christ and his Promises, by Devotion unfeigned, by Purity of Heart and Innocency of Life, by Faithfulness, by common Charity, by comfortable provisions for the poor, by chearful Obedience to our Superiours, and abundance of kindness and discreet condescensions one to another, by unspotted Righteousness and an unshaken Peace, by the removal of every unjust yoke, by mutual forbearance, and bearing
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:55305:8"/>
up one another as living stones of that Temple where there is not to be heard the noise of either axe or hammer, no squable or cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour about Formes or Opinions, but a peaceable study and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of provoking one another to love and good works.</hi> Provided this be the <hi>Idea</hi> of those happy Ages to come, the inculcating of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in my judgement cannot but be very useful, it bearing along with it both a detection and reprehension of the degeneracy of the present Age, and a warmth and encouragement to hasten those good times by endeavouring to correct our lives according to this Pattern we have of them.</p>
            <p n="20">
               <hi>20.</hi> That also will be accounted a Defect by some,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>That this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course was mainly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of a Christian in his private capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
               </note> that I have said no more of <hi>Publick worship,</hi> and nothing at all of <hi>Church-government.</hi> But I must again answer, That it was beside my Scope to meddle with such things. To which I may adde, That the world is full of such Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, and as much said already as either Wit or Zeal can excogitate. My design was onely to represent Christianity in the Fundamentals thereof, with that purity and clearness as might most of all conciliate belief and strengthen our Faith in the most necessary points, such as concerned every private Christian to believe and to live accordingly; to the end that though the iniquity of the times should have proved such that he knew not whither to turn him or whom to joine withall in any publick worship or profession, yet he might rest satisfied in this, that he was immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably grounded in the saving Truths of the Gospel, and was able to give an account of his Faith to himself and to as many as were fit to receive it; and living uprightly might not be affraid to find himself alone, knowing that every single man is a Church, if his Body once become the Temple of the Holy Ghost. My onely solicitude therefore was to corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate that Faith that is plainly propounded to us out of the Scripture, which is sufficient to Salvation, and to exalt that Life that has lyen dead and buried for these many Ages under a vast heap of humane Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, useless and cumbersome Ceremonies and unpeaceable Opinions: not at all doubting but that if the Life of Christ were once awakened in the world, he that clothes the lilies of the field and adornes the birds of the aire with their severall comely and orderly-disposed colours, will not be wanting to such a Church as has the principle of life in it self; but that it will grow up into such an external forme and comeliness in all points as most befits and are the most proper results of those Vitall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in it. Whenas the best <hi>Externals</hi> without these are but as the skin of an Animal stuffed with wooll or straw.</p>
            <p n="21">
               <hi>21.</hi> But besides that it was beyond my scope,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>What points he had most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably touched upon if his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign had urged him to speak any thing of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
               </note> it was also above my abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to give judgement concerning the curiosities of Church-government, it depending upon studies too tedious and voluminous for the strength of my Body, as also very little gratefull to the rellishes of my Mind, whose Genius has irresistibly carried me captive into another country and a quite different scene of Speculations and Objects. All therefore that I could with confidence and safety have pronounced is, That in general Church-government and Discipline is as assuredly <hi>jure Divino</hi> as the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate; and, it may be, should have adventured to adde, That in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian polity the power of appointing and ordering things in the Church is
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:55305:9"/>
lodged in the Supremacy of every such Body Politick, and that all degrees <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> are but Under-ministers to this Supreme Power, who is Head of all next to Christ.</p>
            <p>That this Supreme Power is to regulate the affairs of the Church as near to the <hi>Prescripts</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of the <hi>Apostolick</hi> times as they can guesse, unless those <hi>Practices</hi> and <hi>Prescripts</hi> may be conceived to have been founded upon such a constitution of the Church as is not in the present affairs of this or that part of Christendome which is concerned.</p>
            <p>That if the External forme of Church-government were of such mighty consequence, as that this ought to be called <hi>Antichristian,</hi> that reputed <hi>jure Divino,</hi> and that it were essential to a true Church to have such or such a kind of Government rather then another, Christ would have left more express command and direction concerning it; that the Church might not be liable to erre in so fundamental a matter.</p>
            <p>That the main end of Church-government and Discipline is the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing and promoting the Christian Life and an holy observation of such Precepts of Christ as do not make men obnoxious to the secular Law by the transgressing of them, to keep out also Idolatry and every errour or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious practice that tends to the supplanting or defeating the Power of the Gospel; and that therefore we ought rather to be solicitous about managing this government to the right end, then disturb the peace of the Church by over-scrupulous examination of the exteriour frame thereof.</p>
            <p>That if Christ had left an exact Platforme of Government, and the Church kept to it; if the above-said end were not aimed at in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, but in stead of being a countenance and encouragement to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Godliness it should be directed to the upholding of useless or mischievous Opinions, scandalous Ceremonies and ensnaring Inventions of men; the more exactly they kept to this outward platforme of Christ, the more plainly they would discover themselves to be Antichristian, (that is, a pretended Christian power against the reall interest of Christ) and that conjunction of the Horns of the Lamb with the voice of the Dragon would more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Revelat. 13.11.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>That Church-discipline and Government is as a Fort or Castle, of excellent use if it be in the hands of the faithfull souldiery of Christ, or as a safe Vessell for precious liquour, or as restringent and corroborative Physick where there is an unexpected evacuation of the serviceable supports of life. But if Traitours to the Kingdome of Christ get possession of this Castle, poison be mingled with this precious liquour, and foul and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant humours be lodged in the Body; it were more desirable the Castle were ruined, the Vessell broken, the Physick cast down the sink, and the Body left free to the course of Nature, then that things so hatefull and pernicious should be continued and conserved by them: that is to say, It were better that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion were left to support it self by the innate evidence of its own Truth, then being sophisticated with vain lies and wicked inventions be forcibly maintained for other Ends then it was intended for, nay be made to serve contrary Ends, and prove a Mystery of tyranny and ungodliness: and that therefore the first and chief point is to make a right choice of the Object of this Church-discipline, which is to comprehend nothing but what is sound
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:55305:9"/>
and purely Apostolicall, that is, the indisputable Truths of our Religion, such as we are sure to be the mind of Christ and his Apostles; namely the generally-acknowledged Articles of the Christian Faith, and plain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable Duties of Life. For these are such as deserve to be held up with all possible care and strictness, other things so gently recommended that no consciencious man may be pinched thereby.</p>
            <p>That nothing can conciliate more authority to the Church nor more assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red peace and tranquillity, then to deal <hi>bonâ fide</hi> with the People; and not to make them more foolish and superstitious then they would naturally be, and then to pride and please our selves in the sweet rellish of that false sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction we find in feeling our power over them, and in fansying our selves such marvellous Church-polititians, that we can by crafty delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions lead about those whom we should make it our business to undeceive and free from all vain mistakes, and set before them the naked Truth and pure light of the Gospel, whereby they may become really good, and therewith bear a more unfeigned respect to the Ministery and shew more sincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Church, then they can by being kept to that blind way of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring outward Formalities and useless Opinions and Ceremonies, out of which cannot arise so natural a tie of love and honour to the Priest as by his discovering his faithfulness to his Charge in shewing them the very truth and substance of the Religion he ministers to them, and by being instrumental in deriving of the same Christian spirit upon them which he ought to have in an higher measure himself.</p>
            <p>That they may well hazard goodly Structures of Truth by building them upon doubtful and controvertible Foundations; such is the setting such a kind of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> or <hi>Presbytery</hi> upon the <hi>Basis</hi> of <hi>a Divine right;</hi> besides their making themselves thereby obnoxious to the suspicion of a design of unmerciful riding and galling the people when they have once by this device so safely lockt themselves into the saddle: As if that were not true which I noted before, That the exactest plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme of Church-Government, by directing or using of it to other Ends then it was instituted by Christ, did become thereby the more perfectly Antichristian.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Episcopacy</hi> simply in it self is not Antichristian, as appears even out of that Book which Fanatick Hot-spurres so much abuse to the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the Church, I mean the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> compared with the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Church-history concerning this ancient Government, which was in use when the Church was most exactly <hi>Symmetrall.</hi> And therefore if this or that Forme of Government were essential to the purity of a Church, <hi>Episcopacy</hi> would not have obtained in that State when she was most pure, if it had been Antichristian. From whence it also necessarily followes That <hi>Presbytery</hi> is not <hi>jure Divino.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That if any Mode or Platforme of Church-government be <hi>jure Divino,</hi> I should sooner venture upon Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi>'s way then any, which in my apprehension he has made out with much solidity and freedome of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is not onely truely serviceable to the design of Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in generall, but also very accommodate to the present constitution of things, it being such a mixture of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> and <hi>Presbytery</hi> together,
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:55305:10"/>
as may justly, if they would be modest and ingenuous, satisfie the expectation of both parties.</p>
            <p>That upon an account of Reason and of the nature of the Thing it self, <hi>Episcopacy</hi> joined with <hi>Presbytery</hi> is better then <hi>Presbytery</hi> alone; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as it is easier to find one man fitted for so sacred an office then many. And there is more ingenuous shame and sense of honour in a single person then in a multitude, whose number makes them more bold and daring to pass any thing, such as if it were in the power of one single person to stop, he could not in point of reputation and self-security fail to use his Negative voice. But where the power is in a Multitude without any restraint, there cannot but be the hazard of very gross transactions, they bolstering up one another by reflexion upon their numerosity; and every man, in shuffling off the odiousness of the miscarriage to the rest of the lump, conceits himself to bear a very inconsiderable share of either the shame or danger of whatever is voted. Wherefore there must be a great deal of either Ignorance or Malice to style that Function <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian,</hi> that is thus recommended to us both from the practice of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church and the light of Reason.</p>

Wherefore whosoever has not a very venerable esteem of these peculiar Servants of Christ, ought to suspect himself that he is also guilty of some latitant averseness or enmity to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it self; unless that he can clearly deprehend that his disrespect or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust arises from the over-long continued fraud and Histrionical imposture of such Functions in the Apostatized Church; the gayest Idol being more odious and contemptible then the rudest and most unpolished piece of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that pretends to be nothing but what it is. Which yet will not excuse him from doing his outward respect to such personages, much less encourage him to personall revilements, a disorder that S. <hi>Paul</hi> to an high Priest in a Religion superannuated could not allow himself in. Otherwise where they are not Idols, but fill out their titles, I think no man, unless it be out of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy or want of judgement, will conceive their Dignities and Revenues ill placed. For supernatural Miracles having ceased, there is but this one moral Miracle left that I know, to awaken the world into a serious belief of the Truth of Christian Religion, namely a Bishop refulgent with honour and overflowing with wealth, and yet exemplarily humble, meek and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, not thinking himself over-great for the personal discharge of his Office he is intrusted with, nor so lull'd asleep in ease and affluency as to let fall the Scepter of Christ out of his hands to be taken up by such as cannot wield it with that paternall affection and judgement that a true Bishop and carefull Watcher over the Souls of men would be sure to do.</p>

Bishop as I have hitherto described, and that rules his own family well, not allowing any scandalous servants to attend him, but being a pattern in himself and in all his house of unblamable Godliness and Christianity; that makes his Visitations in his Diocese in his own person, and vibrates that sacred thunder and lightning, the truely-dreadfull sentence of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, by no other arme but his own, nor to any other aime then the dissipating of Vice and Wickedness and all Rebellion and Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the known and acknowledged Lawes of Christ; that inflicts no Mulcts but what are bestowed in relief of the poor of the respective Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish and the needfull repairs or comely adornings of the Church; that is watchfull, prudent and compassionate, and has the art and patience of conversing with the meanest capacities, and the skill and sagacity of finding out the reason where he findes the End of the Gospel notoriously defeated in any place; that has counsell in readiness and fit applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whether the Pastour or his charge be discovered to be in fault; that exhorts every where to sobriety and brotherly-kindess, and is dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to pluck up or prevent the growth of such Opinions as serve the end of Sin, and encourage men to leudness; that gravely and severely rebukes the bold offender, and affectionately bewails the failings of the weak, and chearfully expresses his sincere joy whereever he finds a people live orderly and unblamably, and gives the best countenance and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he can devise for the furthering the same; I say, I could not have forborn to pronounce, that to decry such a Bishop as this for <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> were an unpardonable piece of <hi>Antichristianisme;</hi> and to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure against his Visitations, to repine at the annuall return of the Sun, by whose warmth all things live and flourish.

Romane Church after this her Apostacy will be certainly damned. The concocting or ruminating on which sad sentence cannot but be to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne nature like the eating of <hi>the little book</hi> which contains the Visions of this Apostacy, <hi>bitter</hi> in the stomack, though the first pleasures of unriddling these prophetick aenigmes may be <hi>as honey</hi> to the mouth. And to speak freely, for a man to be easily contented that another should be damned, is no good sign that himself is in the way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That was a witty decision of <hi>Solomon</hi> in defining her to be the true Mother that could not endure that the Child should be divided and killed. And whatever Church is cruell and remorsless in either Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall persecution or the Eternall damnation of such men as believe in Christ according to the plain and easie meaning of the Scripture, and live accordingly; she may approve her self to be an imperious Harlot, but no discerning spirit will ever take her for the true Mother, that new Ierusalem, which is the Spouse of Christ or Wife of the Lamb. Wherefore those are very weak Christians that are so low-belled by this terror as to be taken up and captivated by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and acknowledge her the mother-Church by force of that Argument that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates the contrary: to say nothing of their disingenuous abuse of the Charity of the Reformed Churches.</p>
            <p>But for my own part I confess that for sureness I had rather exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise my Charity in wishing them Converts from Popery, then express any great confidence of their being safe in that Religion. Not that it is possible for me (who cannot infallibly demonstrate to my self that all that lived under <hi>Paganisme</hi> are certainly damned) to imagine that all that have gone under the name of <hi>Papists</hi> have tumbled down into Hell. But the case is much like that in Shipwrack on the sea, or Pestilence in a City where we will suppose not a house free; no man can pronounce that it is impossible that such or such a person should escape, nor that any of them are in any tolerable safety. The danger is alike to them that adhere to the Apostate Church: for though there be a possibility of some mens being saved by an extraordinary or miraculous Providence, they breaking through all those impediments and snares that are laid in their way, and attaining to a Dispensation above the Church they live in, (as haply some under Paganisme did;) yet it cannot be denied but that the Oeconomie of that Church naturally tends to the betraying of Souls to Eternall destruction; that falling out which our Saviour said of old of the <hi>Pharisees, They compass sea and land to make one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felyte, and when he is made, he becomes twofold more the child of the devil then themselves.</hi> For he will not stint his Hypocrisie in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by the measure of their gain that invented the forme, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it for their End, but for his own, namely that he may excuse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from all reall holiness by keeping to the observation and profession of their vain inventions. <hi>And thus are the Commandements of God made of none effect by their Traditions.</hi> In brief, the whole frame of that Church is fashioned out so near to the ancient guise of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Paganisme,</hi> or else to the liveless and ineffectual forme of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daisme,</hi> (both which Christ appeared on purpose to destroy, as either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

or ineffectuall to Salvation, and does explicitly recommend to the world a pure and spirituall worship, that we should worship the Father <hi>in Spirit and in truth;</hi>) or lastly is so full of Contradictions and Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities in their feigned Stories and imperiously-obtruded Opinions; that the natural result of being born under such a Religion or of turning to it, is either to become a besotted Superstitionist to believe or do any thing that others will have him to do, (which is a sign the Spirit of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has not yet passed upon him, and that there is no life nor light in him,) or else (which is too frequent) to turn down-right <hi>Atheist;</hi> it being so grosly discernable that the Tenents of their Church are impossible, and their Practices fraudulent, fitted chiefly for filthy lucre, and their Ceremonies useless, thankless and ridiculous. And therefore if any be saved in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they are such as are not truely <hi>of it,</hi> but <hi>above it,</hi> and fend for themselves as well as they may by some pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sleights of <hi>Prudence</hi> accompanied with an impregnable <hi>innocency</hi> of Spirit, and readiness of doing all possible good they can; they sparing their own lives and liberties upon no other account then that, and out of a perswasion that he that commanded them to be <hi>wise as Serpents</hi> as well as <hi>innocent as Doves,</hi> has given them no commission inconsiderately and to no purpose to betray themselves into the power of his usurping Enemy.</p>
            <p>But for others that are <hi>perfect Papists,</hi> and swallow down all that Church proposes to them, without chewing or distasting any thing; it is a Demonstration there is no Principle of life in them, but that they are like dead earthen pitchers, which receive poison and wholesome liquors with a like admittance. And if there be no principle of life, there is no seed of Salvation in a man. For it is most certainly true, and the Scripture it self doth witness to it, That <hi>unless a man be born from above, he cannot see the kingdome of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</hi> This is the <hi>new Creature</hi> that is created in <hi>wisdome, righteousness</hi> and <hi>true holiness.</hi> The first of which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> expunges, in that it gives no leave to a man never so regenerate to judge for himself, but he must say as the Church sayes, right or wrong: and for the other two all their superstitious Ceremonies put together adde nothing to them, but rather stifle and sufflaminate them. Again, S. <hi>John</hi> tell us, That <hi>he that hates his brother, is in the dark, and walketh in the dark, and knows no whither he goes.</hi> But others may know it, as appears by another saying of the same Apostle, <hi>Every one that hates his brother, is a murderer; and no murderer hath eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life abiding in him.</hi> But on the contrary he affirms, That <hi>Love is of God,</hi> and that <hi>he that loveth, is born of God, and knowes God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to apply the Case to these Rules, If <hi>Love</hi> be an <hi>essential Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> of a <hi>Regenerate</hi> soul, and <hi>Hatred</hi> of <hi>Errour, Darkness</hi> and <hi>Eternal Death;</hi> or, to come yet closer, If <hi>Hatred</hi> it self be <hi>Murder;</hi> what will <hi>Murder</hi> it self be, added thereunto? And if any thing be <hi>Murder,</hi> I demand whether this be not, namely to take away the life of a member of Iesus Christ who does fully and freely profess the Ancient and Apostolick Faith according to the Letter or History of the New Testament,
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:55305:12"/>
and does seriously compose his life according to the Precepts therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and does onely declare against and reject the Contradictious Opinions and Idolatrous Practices that have no ground at all in Scripture nor Reason, but are quite contrary to both. I say, if this be no <hi>Murder,</hi> there is no Murder in the world: and how guilty the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is of this Crime, all the world knowes. Wherefore this being one of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of that bloudy Church, and he that is a perfect Papist being of one mind and suffrage with his Church in all things, (for she will be held no less then <hi>Infallible</hi>) 'tis apparent that no through-paced Papist can ever go to heaven while he is such; this <hi>murderous disposition</hi> being a demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he is not born of God, but of him that was <hi>a murderer from the beginning.</hi> For <hi>Love</hi> being the very <hi>Heart and Center of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> if there be no Antipathie in us against that which is so contrary to the deepest Principle of the <hi>Divine life,</hi> it is a sign there is none of that Life in us.</p>
            <p>Wherefore this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> cannot be made harsh or odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by the Opposer's surmise, there being a capacity of being saved in such as I have above described, though of the Papall denomination, which are as it were <hi>the Woman in the wilderness.</hi> And for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity of being saved in the other, there wants no Apocalypse to reveal the certainty thereof. Nor do I know a more uncharitable opinion in the World, then that which promises them Salvation that are so far from Charity themselves, that they are professedly persecuters and murderers of the innocent, nay of the sincere and faithful members of Christ.</p>

                  <hi>The Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Reply to the foregoing Answer, with a brief Attempt of satisfying the same.</hi>
               </note> That there are as many snares and impediments in the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> to true Holiness, if not to all Holiness, in the Opinions of <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidianisme</hi> and <hi>Eternall Decrees;</hi> and as great a demonstration of their utter insensibility of that Principle of the Divine love into which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true Christian is regenerated, in their doctrine of <hi>Absolute Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and inevitable damnation of innumerable myriads of men, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence determining them upon all the wayes and means thereto; as in the <hi>Romanists</hi> either censuring all out of their Church to be in a state of perdition, or in their inflicting a Temporal death upon them that gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say the Articles of their Church. For what is this in comparison of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing content that all the World in a manner should be adjudged to everlasting torments for doing such things as they were from all Eternity decreed to do, nor could any way possibly avoid it?</p>
            <p>This Objection I must confess is very shrewdly levelled at the mark; nor can I well undertake within the narrow limits of my now almost-ended Preface, to make a full and direct Answer to the things themselves: Onely I shall return thus much.</p>
            <p>First, That all of the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> are not <hi>Solifidians,</hi> nor hold any thing concerning the Divine Decrees inconsistent with either the Goodness of God or the Advancement of Godliness; and that for my own part I am one of that number.</p>
            <p>And then Secondly, They that do, do not profess themselves <hi>infallible</hi> in their opinion, nor judge others to be in a damnable condition that are not
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:55305:13"/>
of it; and therefore do not low-bell men into their own errour by either uncharitable censurings or bloudy persecutions, nor become incorrigible themselves upon pretence of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> but are in a fair way of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the Truth when it shall be rightly and advantageously proposed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Their errours are not so many nor managed with that meditated craft and design as in the old Apostate Church; they being not invented to serve some avaritious or ambitious end, but fallen into (if I may so speak) by chance, upon reading some passages of Scripture, (that looked upon alone may seem to favour their Conclusions) and by reason of the obscurity of the things themselves such as have puzled contemplative men in all Ages and Places.</p>
            <p>And fourthly and lastly, If they have made their own Inventions and argumentative Conclusions Articles of Faith, it is because they are not yet sufficiently cleansed from the corruption they contracted under the Mother of Apostasy: which mainly consists in this, <hi>in adding the falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deductions of humane Reason to the infallible Articles of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Apostolick Faith.</hi> So that whatever hazard of Salvation there is in the Reformed Churches, it is by reason that they do still <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize,</hi> and do not clear up into a certain and uncontroverted Apostolick purity, exhibiting nothing for <hi>Fundamentals</hi> but what is expresly so in the Text it self, without the slipperyness of humane Ratiocination. Which certainly as it is their Duty, so is it also their greatest Interest, and the most effectuall way for Peace and Righteousness upon Earth.</p>

               </note>28. As for that abusable Opinion of Imputative Righteousness, that I have shewn my dissatisfaction touching that point, (which ordinarily the worst of men most of all build upon; though I do not deny but well-meaning and piously-disposed persons may also heedlesly take up the forme) I hope the judicious will not misconstrue it, nor take it ill that I have been so free and faithful as to discover the danger and groundlesness of this overmuch Idolized doctrine. For indeed it is a very <hi>Idol,</hi> that is <hi>Nothing,</hi> as the Apostle describes an <hi>Idol</hi> to be; I mean nothing of it self but a mere Phrase, if you prescind it from what is comprized in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins through the bloud of Christ shed upon the Cross.</hi> For this <hi>Remission of sins</hi> contains in it such a reconciliation with God, that we are safe from all the Effects of his wrath both concerning this state and that which is to come; that is to say, we shall not be punished by his withholding his Grace from us here, or that Glory which is expected in the other Life. For these deprivements being the results of sin, if we were not secured from them, our sins were not remitted; which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> Now I appeal to the judgement and conscience of the most zealous assertour of <hi>Imputative Righteousness,</hi> if he can find any thing more comprized therein then <hi>such a remission of sins</hi> as we have defined; and whether when he talks of being cloathed with Christs righteousness in this imputative sense, he can understand any thing but being as it were armed and defended from the wrath of God and all the ill consequences thereof. For if this Righteousness we are thus cloathed with were a Righteousness that really kept us (suppose) from Envy, from Drunkenness, from Adultery, and made us Charitable, Sober and
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:55305:13"/>
Chast; it were not then imputative, but inherent. From whence it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears that if you prescind it from <hi>remission of sins</hi> through the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christ on the Cross, this Phrase of <hi>Imputative Righteousness</hi> has no signification at all; and that therefore there is no loss or damage done to our Religion, if it be not accounted a distinct Article from the remission of sins in the bloud of Christ. For it cannot afford any true and useful sense distinct there-from, nay I may say any that is not very mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and dangerous, and such as tends to that loathsome and pestilential errour of <hi>Antinomianisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if you will understand by it <hi>Remission of sins;</hi> I do again appeal to the sagacious, if there may not yet be a great deal of fraud and hypocrisie in making choice of such an Expression as does easily insinuate to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many a needlesness of seriously endeavouring to be really righteous, (we being so warmely secure by the imputation of anothers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) and does omit such circumstances of the <hi>Meritorious cause</hi> of the <hi>Remission of our sins</hi> (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Bloud of Christ hanging upon the Cross) as are not onely the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest pledge of that inestimable favour of God, but the strongest engagement imaginable and greatest endearement of our affections to Christ; that we may be the more willing to mortifie our corruptions for his sake, and to eschew Sin, which was so hateful to God, that he would not remit it without the atonement of the most precious bloud of his onely-begotten Son. Which admirable artifice of the Divine Wisdome and unspeakable power of the Gospel in the Passion of Christ for the remission of sins is very cunningly and fraudulently declined in this new Phraseology of <hi>Imputative Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> which is but a dry Scene, and works not at all upon our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, unless to a carelesness and dissoluteness of life. And therefore I cannot but set the easie entertainment of such a pretended doctrine upon the same score with the rejectment or neglect of the Anniversary Celebration of the Crucifixion of Christ, though it was a Solemnity of more importance then any Festival of the Year. As if the tendency of Reformation were to slur and defeat the chiefest arts of the Gospel, and cut away the strongest ties to the most indispensable duties of a Christian.</p>
            <p n="29">29. But the last and greatest Exception I presage will be against what I have wrote for <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi>

                  <hi>His Defence for so expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring himself for a duly-bounded liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
               </note> especially considering what a foul face of things the late pretence to this right had superinduced upon this miserably-distracted Kingdome. But this aggravation will really be found to have no weight, if indifferently examined. For if every Right should be forfeited, or rather be accounted no right at all, because it has been contended for in an undue manner, or brought much calamity and confusion upon a nation; not onely <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> but all <hi>Civil Rights</hi> also, nay the Gospel of Iesus Christ it self, would be forfeited; Warre, Bloudshed and Confusion being as frequently introduced upon these pretences as upon any. Besides, there was not a <hi>simple Permission</hi> of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conscience, but an <hi>Encouragement</hi> and <hi>Fomenting</hi> of Sects and Factions, and an unworthy prostitution of this Sacred Right to the base Political designes of ambitious persons; they that were in power conniving at the most uncouth and unseemly miscarriages out of a sense and conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that they had no right to rule, and a desire of making their usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:55305:14"/>
as sweet to the people as they could, by forbidding them nothing but disobedience to themselves. So that the gross disorders that had grown and were still growing more and more upon us, are not to be imputed so much to Liberty of Conscience, as to the unhinging of all Civill government, and removing of the ancient and undoubted Soveraignty over the People. And lastly, what I have defined concerning Liberty of Conscience, to those that would abuse that Right, will seem rather the taking of it away then a patronizing of it. But I must confess I have endeavoured as well to establish it upon its justest and clearest grounds, as to circumscribe it within its due limits.</p>
            <p>Which performance of mine cannot but be distastful to two sorts of men. The one are such as being very cold at home, letting their Hearts freeze to the indispensable duties of a true Christian, which is to be conformable to the life of Christ in Humility, holy Love and unspotted Purity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, do in stead thereof with zeal scalding hot seek to hale and force other men by externall compulsion to a Conformity to their foolish and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Opinions and Ceremonies, loving to order other folks with great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and Lordliness, to make amends, as they think, thereby for their own disorder and conspicuous impotency in not being masters of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. When as yet they exercise the worst of Vices even in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whereby they would make an atonement for their other gross miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages. For what is it but a notorious <hi>specimen</hi> of Pride thus to force others to acknowledge their Wisdome by making them profess to be of their opinion? and what but Injustice and barbarous Cruelty to afflict men for what they cannot help, and in what they do not sinne? and what but plain Rebellion against God to wrest his Scepter out of his hand by which he rules in the consciences of men, and to usurp this Empire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themselves? To say nothing how often they sacrifice here also to Mammon and the belly. But to have such enemies as these to our Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion I hope will be thought one Argument added to the rest of the truth thereof; nor ought I to be over-solicitous if what I have writ scandalize those that in their principles and practices are so scandalous.</p>
            <p>To the other sort I ought to bear a more tender respect, to those, I mean, that out of no corrupt principle, but out of a sincere affection to Christian Religion, dislike our Plea for Liberty of Conscience, as being afraid that Christianity it self will be prejudiced thereby. But to these I answer, That as I highly commend their care and solicitude for the best of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, so I must humbly crave leave to dissent from their judgements in managing the Interest thereof. For I dare pronounce, That there is nothing would make so much for the Interest of Christianity, as if this Right of Liberty of Conscience were known and acknowledged all over the world. For then assuredly by how much more manifest the Truth and Authority of every Religion is, by so much more certainly would it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail; as we may observe that every Religion by how much more false it is, by so much the more severely and tyrannically it is suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by external violence. Wherefore if it could be agreed upon to take away this external support, false Religion and vain Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition would sinke, those bladders and bulrushes being taken from
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:55305:14"/>
under them, and that onely would be found to swimme whose innate Truth was able to bear it up of it self. And such certainly is the naked Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Christian Religion, devested of those many encumberments of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inventions both false and useless, wherewith it is so laden, that it could not chuse but sink notwithstanding any externall support, did not the force of the undeniable Truths therein bear up all that luggage which Ignorance, Hypocrisie and Covetousness has cast upon it. How free and quick passage then would it have if this burden had once sunk from it, and it were restored to the Primaevall purity thereof? Surely, That Religion that got ground so fast, though cruelly persecuted and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, could not but make admirable progresses, might it but once upon equall termes grapple with other Religions. I am prone to believe that it would not be long till all the Kingdomes of the Earth would become the Kingdomes of the Lord and his Christ.</p>
            <p>So great an Interest has the True and Primaevall Christianity in this common Right of Liberty of Conscience; which though Christians might imagine extendible no further then to themselves, yet to be so streight to one another as not to acknowledge that mutual Right, seems enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously harsh and unchristian. For we all agreeing in the Truth of the Scriptures, which certainly are sufficient to Salvation, (since the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of what is plain in them will not fail to carry a man to Heaven,) what an unreasonable thing is it that there should be that hatred and persecution against those that God so well approves that he will save them, and Christ so dearly loved that he gave his life a ransome for them? Again, there being also a necessity, as I have said, in the <hi>Persecuted</hi> of thinking as he does, and an uncertainty in the Opinions that the <hi>Persecutour</hi> would promote, as being demonstrable by neither Reason nor Scripture; how unwarrantable an action is it to do a certain injury for an uncertain conceit? To all which you may adde, That the Love of Knowledge is but the work of the Devil: how much more then is bitter Zeal and brawling about it? but the depretiating of humane devices tends much to the exaltation of true Sanctity, that mask of Hyprocrisie patcht up of empty Opinions and Formalities being by this means torn off and leaving the face bare, that their Complexion may be more discernable how pure and sincere it is, or how unsound, cadaverous and deformed. And lastly, a mutuall agreement of bearing with one anothers dissents in the <hi>Non-fundamentals</hi> of Religion is really a greater Ornament of Christianity then the most exact Uniformity imaginable, it being an eminent act or exercise of <hi>Charity,</hi> the Flower of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian graces, and the best way, I think, at the long run to make the Church as Uniforme as can justly be desired.</p>
            <p>For if true Christian Love could once get the rule in the Hearts of men, the Apostle will undertake for her that she shall <hi>do nothing unseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> For <hi>Charity</hi> is indeed the Mother of Unity and bond of Perfection; and he that is really spirited thereby, I dare promise for him that he will never oftentate his Sanctimony by a pretended queziness of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as if he had a more delicate sense and a more peculiar discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:55305:15"/>
in things appertaining to Godliness then others have. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a good round force would urge him to, out of love to himself and his own safety, he would not fail of his own accord to comply therewith, out of the love of Order and the Reverence he bears to the authority of the Church he lives under. Nor on the other side would the Church ever offer to obtrude upon her children what is either false or use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. For they both of them being once imbued with that Divine sense we speak of, cannot but be well assured <hi>That neither Circumcision nor Uncircumcision availeth any thing; but Faith working by Love.</hi> And whosoever walketh by this Rule, peace be upon him and upon the true Israel of God.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Very legitimate <hi>Mystery</hi> comprehends in it at least these Four <hi>Properties. It is a piece of Knowledge,</hi> First, <hi>competently Obscure, Recondite and Abstruse</hi>: That is, It is not so utterly hid and intricate, but that, in the Second place, <hi>It is in a due measure In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>It is not only Intelligible, what is meant by it; but it is evidently and certainly True.</hi> Fourthly and lastly, <hi>It is no impertinent or idle Speculation, but a Truth very Usefull and Profitable</hi>: We may well add also, <hi>for some Religious End.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This <hi>Obscuritie</hi> and <hi>Abstruseness</hi> makes not only the <hi>Mystery</hi> more <hi>solemn</hi> and <hi>venerable</hi> to those to whom it is communicated, but <hi>hides</hi> it also from their eyes that are <hi>not worthy</hi> to partake thereof.

For which reason the Etymologists give also this Notation of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that it is from <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="4">4. But there is afterward a clearer manifestation and a fuller satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> then becomes <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, being now more firmly ascertained of the <hi>Truth</hi> which he did but obscurely apprehend before. From which <hi>Clearness</hi> and <hi>Certainty</hi> of the thing represented there necessarily arises <hi>a full and free assent</hi> of his Understanding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further doubt or hesitancy; the Proverb being made good in this case, That <hi>Seeing is Believing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. But that there may not be a mere dry <hi>Belief</hi> without any love or liking of the Object thereof, we added also that this <hi>Mystery</hi> is not only <hi>certainly True,</hi> but very concerningly <hi>Usefull</hi> and <hi>Profitable</hi>; which though the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> it self does not implie, yet another in the same language and of the like sense does, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. <hi>Initiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into sacred Mysteries.</hi> The <hi>Usefulness</hi> whereof a <hi>Platonist</hi> admirably well describes, not without a verbal allusion, in this manner, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Which, if we would render it in our more familiar language, sounds thus; The scope or aim of all Religious My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries is the bringing back faln man into his pristine condition of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and to lead him again to that high station which he then first forsook when he preferr'd his own Will and the pleasure of the Animal life before the Will of God and that Life and Sense which is truly Divine.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Wherefore not to dwell too long on the threshold, we conclude briefly and in general, that a <hi>Mystery</hi> is a piece of Divine knowledge <hi>measurably Abstruse,</hi> whereby it becomes <hi>more Venerable,</hi> but yet <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible</hi> that it may be <hi>Communicable,</hi> and <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Certain</hi> that it may win <hi>firm Assent,</hi> and lastly <hi>very Usefull</hi> and <hi>Effectual</hi> for the <hi>perfecting</hi> of the Souls of men, and restoring them to that <hi>Happiness</hi> which they anciently had faln from; that so near a Concernment may as well gain upon their <hi>Affections</hi> as the Evidence of <hi>Truth</hi> engage their <hi>Understandings</hi>; and so the whole man may be carried on to a devout embracement of what is exhibited unto him by the knowledge of his Religion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. What we have thus Generally proposed we shall now applie more Particularly, and more fully prosecute those <hi>Four primary Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> in that <hi>Grand Mystery of Godliness</hi> which we call <hi>Christianity:</hi> distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting our Discourse into these <hi>Four main Parts</hi>; The First whereof shall insist somewhat upon the <hi>Abstruseness</hi> and <hi>Obscurity</hi> of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Second upon the <hi>Intelligibleness</hi> of it, the Third upon the

                  <hi>Certainty</hi> of it; and the Fourth on the <hi>great concerning Usefulness</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

               <p n="1">1. THat there is a <hi>considerable Obscurity and Abstrusenesse in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion</hi> is easily made evident as well from the <hi>Cause</hi> as the <hi>Effects</hi> of this <hi>Obscurity.</hi> For besides that from the common nature of a <hi>Mystery</hi> Christianity ought to be <hi>competently Obscure and Abstruse,</hi> that it may thereby become <hi>more Venerable</hi> and more safely removed out of all danger of contempt; we cannot but see what a <hi>speciall</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity there is in the matter it self, to have so holy and so highly-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a <hi>Mystery</hi> as our Religion is, <hi>Abstruse</hi> and <hi>Obscure.</hi> For that Divine wisdome that orders all things justly ought not to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate those precious Truths in so plain a manner that the <hi>Unworthy</hi> may as easily apprehend them as the <hi>Worthy</hi>; but does most righteously neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the <hi>Sensuall</hi> and <hi>Careless,</hi> permitting every man to carry home wares proportionable to the price he would pay in the open market for them: And when they can bestow so great industry upon things of little moment, will not spare to punish their undervaluing this inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Pearle by the perpetual losse of it. For what a palpable piece of <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> is it for a man to excuse himself from the study of Piety, by complaining against the <hi>Intricacies</hi> and <hi>Difficulties</hi> of the Mystery thereof; whenas he never yet laid out upon it the tenth part of that pains and affection that he does upon the ordinary trivial things of this world?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thus are the careless voluptuous <hi>Epicure</hi> and over-careful Worldling justly met with. But not they alone. For the <hi>Obscurity</hi> of this <hi>Mystery</hi> we speak of is such, that all the knowledge of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Geometry</hi> can never reach the Depth of it, or rellish the Excellency of it; nor all the <hi>skill of Tongues</hi> rightly interpret it, unless that true Interpreter and great <hi>Mystagogus,</hi> the Spirit of God himself, vouchsafe the opening of it unto us, and set it on so home in our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, that it begets <hi>Faith</hi> in our Hearts, so that our Hearts misgive us not in the profession of what we would acknowledge as True. For as for the outward Letter it self of the Holy Scriptures, God has not so plainly delivered himself therein, that he has given the staff out of his own hands, but does still direct the <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>single-hearted,</hi> while he suffers the <hi>proud</hi> searcher to lose himself in this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55305:17"/>
field of Truth. Wherefore <hi>disobedient</hi> both <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry</hi> are turned off from obtaining any certain and satisfactory Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this Divine Mystery, as well as <hi>Worldliness</hi> and <hi>Voluptuousness.</hi> According as our Blessed Saviour has pronounced in that devout Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor are the Wicked onely disappointed, but the Godly very much gratified by the <hi>Intricacy</hi> of this sacred <hi>Mystery.</hi> For the Spirit of man being so naturally given to search after Knowledge, and his Understanding being one of the chiefest and choicest Faculties in him, it cannot be but a very high delight to him to employ his noblest endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the divinest Objects, and very congruous and decorous they should be so employ'd. Besides, the present <hi>Doubtfulness</hi> of Truth makes the holy Soul more devout and dependant on God the onely true and safe guide thereunto. From whence we should be so far from murmuring against Divine Providence for the Obscurity and Ambiguity of the Holy Scriptures, that we should rather magnifie his Wisdome therein; We having discovered so many and so weighty Reasons why those Divine Oracles should be Obscure: The wicked thereby being excluded; the due Reverence of the Mystery maintained; and the worthy partakers thereof much advantaged and highly gratified.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For what can indeed more highly gratifie a man, whose very Nature is <hi>Reason,</hi> and special Prerogative <hi>Speech</hi>; then by his skill in Arts and Languages, by the Sagacity of his Understanding, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious comparing of one place of those Sacred pages with another, to work out, or at least to clear up, some Divine Truth out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to the unexpected satisfaction of himself and general service of the Church; the dearest Faculty of his Soul and greatest glory of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture acting then with the fullest commission, and to so good an end, that it need know no bounds, but Joy and Triumph may be unlimited, the Heart exulting in that in which we cannot exceed, viz. the <hi>Honor of God</hi> and the <hi>Good of his people?</hi> All which gratulations of the Soul in her successful pursuits of Divine Truth would be utterly lost or prevented, if the Holy Scriptures set down all things so fully, plainly and metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically, that our reading and understanding would every where keep equal pace together. Wherefore that the Mind of man may be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily employ'd and taken up with a kind of Spiritual husbandry, God has not made the Scriptures like an artificial Garden, wherein the Walks are plain and regular, the Plants sorted and set in order, the Fruits ripe, and the Flowers blown, and all things fully exposed to our view; but rather like an uncultivated field, where indeed we have the ground and hidden seeds of all precious things, but nothing can be brought to any great beauty, order, fulness or maturity, without our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry; nor indeed with it, unless the dew of His grace descend upon it, without whose blessing this Spiritual Culture will thrive as little as the labour of the husbandman without showres of rain.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>1.</hi> The <hi>Obscurity</hi> of the Christian Mystery argued from the Effect, as from the Iews rejecting their Messias; <hi>2.</hi> From the many Sects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Christians; <hi>3.</hi> Their difference in opinion concerning the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>4.</hi> The Creation, <hi>5.</hi> The Soul of Man, <hi>6.</hi> The Person of Christ, <hi>7.</hi> And the Nature of Angels.</head>
               <p n="1">1. HItherto we have argued the <hi>Obscurity</hi> of the Christian Mystery from the <hi>Reasons</hi> and <hi>Causes</hi> thereof, whereby we have evinced <hi>That it ought to be Obscure,</hi> and that therefore in all likelyhood it is so. But the <hi>Effects</hi> are so manifest, that if we do but briefly point at them, it will be put beyond all doubt That it is so indeed.</p>
               <p>Let us now instance in some few. Why are the <hi>Iews</hi> yet unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or rather why did they at first cast off their Messias; but because the <hi>Prophesies</hi> in Scripture were so <hi>Obscure,</hi> that they had taken up a false Notion of him and of the Condition he was to appear in? For they expected him as a mighty Prince that should restore the kingdome to <hi>Israel,</hi> and that Victory, Peace, Prosperity and Dominion should be accumulated upon the <hi>Iewish</hi> nation by his means. Which opinion I conceive the <hi>Lowness</hi> of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> dispensation under which they lived, that perpetually propounded to them worldly advantage as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their obedience, and the <hi>Obscurity</hi> of the <hi>Predictions</hi> of the <hi>Messias,</hi> engaged them in. For they being either <hi>Figurative</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorical,</hi> or mingling sometimes the state of his <hi>Second</hi> coming with his <hi>First</hi>; their eager eye being so fully fixt upon what sounded like worldly happiness, they could mind no other sense but that in these Enigmatical writings: Which yet proved <hi>clear</hi> enough to as many as God had prepared, and belonged to the election of Grace. But he might, if it had pleased his Wisdome so to do, have made all things so <hi>plain,</hi> that we should not need at this day to expect the calling of the <hi>Iews,</hi> but they might have been one Body with us long since. But their Rejection is a greater assurance to us of the Truth of our Religion, we being able to make it good even out of those Records that are kept by our professed Enemies. Besides a man can no more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally require, that all <hi>Israel</hi> should have flowed in at the first appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Christ, then that his Second coming should be joyned with his First, or his First drawn back to the next Age after <hi>Adams</hi> fall, nor that more rationally, then that Autumne should be cast upon Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and both upon Spring. The Counsels of God are at once, but the fulfillings of them ripen in due order and time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But though we let go the <hi>Iews,</hi> and contain our selves within the compass of those that either are or would be accounted <hi>Christians,</hi> their Opinions and Sects both have been and are so numerous, that the very mention of so confessed a Truth may sufficiently evince the Obscurity of those Divine Oracles to which they all appeal. I will
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55305:18"/>
instance only in things of greater moment, which will be a sure pledge of the certainty of their innumerable dissensions in smaller matters.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wherefore to say nothing of that more intricate Mystery of the <hi>Triunity</hi> in the Godhead, where the curious Speculators of that diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Theory are first divided into <hi>Trinitarians</hi> and <hi>Anti-Trinitarians,</hi> and then the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> into <hi>Heterusians, Homousians</hi> and <hi>Homoeusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> we shall see them disagreeing not onely in the <hi>Distinction of the Persons,</hi> but concerning <hi>the Essence</hi> it self: Some affirming God to be Infinite, others Finite; some a Spirit, others a Body; othersome not onely a Body, but a Body of the very same shape with mans. Of which opinion the Aegyptian <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> were so zealously confident, that they forced the Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> out of fear of his life to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to their gross conceit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Again concerning <hi>the Creation of the world,</hi> some affirme That God made it of <hi>Matter</hi> coaeternal with, and independent of, himself: Others that he created it of <hi>Nothing:</hi> Others that he made it not at all; but that it was made, as some would have it, by good Angels, others, by the Devil.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Concerning <hi>the Soul of man,</hi> some say it subsists and acts <hi>before</hi> it comes into the <hi>Body</hi>; Others onely <hi>in the Body,</hi> and <hi>after</hi> the solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body: Others in the <hi>Body alone</hi>; Others not there neither, as holding indeed no such thing as <hi>a Soul</hi> at all, but that the <hi>Body</hi> it self does all: Which some hold shall rise again, others not; but that the whole Mystery of Christianity is finished in this life.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Concerning <hi>Christ,</hi> some were of Opinion that he was onely God appearing in humane shape; others onely man: others both; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers neither.</p>
               <p n="7">7.

               <p>If we would ease our Apprehension here by the help of our <hi>Phansy,</hi> we might compare the First to Simple and pure Light; the Second to Light variegated into Colours, as in the Rainbow; the Third to those Rayes of light (for all is Light) that receive and carry down these Colours to the ground, and impress them and reflect them from some standing pool or plash of water. Again the First Hypostasis is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Essentially the Good, Causally the Intellect.</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:55305:19"/>
The Second is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Essentially Intellect, Causally Soul, Participatively the Good.</hi> The Third is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Essentially Soul,</hi> that is <hi>Love and Operation, Causally Matter and the World, Participatively the Good and Intellect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Now for <hi>the Union of the Three Hypostases,</hi> we shall understand the accuracy thereof by degrees. As first, That the proper life and energie, as I may so say, of each <hi>Hypostasis</hi> is not contein'd within it self, but, like a vocal and audible Sound in a still silent Night, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually re-ecchoes through the whole Deity: Or as when a Song of Three parts is sung, each Musician enjoys the harmony of the whole.</p>
               <p>But this I must confess looks more properly like <hi>Communion</hi> then perfect <hi>Union:</hi> we step therefore a degree further, and affirme, That as <hi>Body and Soul</hi> is conceived to make up one man, and this Individual Body and this Individual Soul to make up this Individual man: so these <hi>Three Hypostases</hi> to make up one Individual Deity, their Union and Actuation one of another being infinitely and unspeakably more perfect then in any other Being imaginable. And as the Motions of the Body are perceptible to the Soul of man, and the Impressions of the Soul upon the Body would be perceptible to it, if it had of it self a Faculty of <hi>Perception:</hi> So likewise by this ineffable close Union and mutual Actuation of the <hi>Three Hypostases,</hi> all their proper Energies become fully perceptible to one another. And the Life of the first so infinitely and unexpressibly gratifying the Second, and Both the Third by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable necessity and congruity of nature, it is evident they can have but <hi>One Will,</hi> which is as it were the <hi>Heart,</hi> the <hi>Centre</hi> or <hi>Root of the Deity,</hi> the <hi>Eternal Self-originated Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thirdly and lastly, These <hi>three Hypostases</hi> are not <hi>One</hi> onely by this <hi>actuating Union</hi> which may seem to admit of a real separability; but there is also a <hi>real Unity</hi> or <hi>Identity</hi> in them: the distinction among them being, as <hi>Tatianus</hi> speaks, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, like the Rayes of the Sun in respect of the Sun; or, if you will, as the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, Rayes and Surface of a Globe, which implyes a Contradiction to be conceived without them; or, as the Faculties of the Soul are to the Soul, which are as inseparable from her as she is from her self.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Union</hi> therefore <hi>of them all,</hi> and <hi>the Emanation of the Second and Third from the First</hi> being so <hi>Necessary, Natural,</hi> and <hi>Inevitable,</hi> (For the First can be no more without the Second, or the Second with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Third, then the Sun can be without his Rayes, or the Soul without her Faculties;) there is no scruple, say they, but we may call all this <hi>the Godhead</hi> or Deity, the Second and Third coming so unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly out of the <hi>First</hi> Root, and being so inseparable from it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is nothing here properly <hi>Creature</hi>; Creation being a free act: and if not <hi>Creature,</hi> what can it be but <hi>God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And since from these Three are all things that are made, and in their hands is the guidance of all things; Nothing less then <hi>Divine Adoration</hi> can of right belong unto them. For though there may be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55305:19"/>
some allay of Excellency in their descent from the First, yet they being all our <hi>Creators</hi> and <hi>Governors,</hi> none ought to fall short of Divine worship.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This is a brief Summe of the <hi>Platonists</hi> Doctrine concerning the <hi>Triunity of the Godhead:</hi> Which, as it seems in it self <hi>Rational</hi> enough, so it is not obnoxious to several bold cavils that over-daring Wits make against the Sacred Mystery of the <hi>Trinity</hi>; alledging against Distinction of Persons without difference of Essence, That there are only Three Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Notions attributed to one single and individual nature: and against Three Essences of the same Nature, That it looks like an unnecessary and groundless repetition, and That that great <hi>Chasma</hi> betwixt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> will be as wide as before; That it is unconceivable but, the Last being of the same nature with the First, that it should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>Prolifical,</hi> and so <hi>in infinitum:</hi> That <hi>these Three</hi> must of necessity be Three Gods, if any of them be God; because they are all exquisitly of the same Kind; whenas in the <hi>Platonick Triad</hi> the First is only the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as some have also ventured to affirm in the <hi>Christian Trinity.</hi> Now I say all being so easy and unexceptionable in the <hi>Platonical</hi> speculation of this Mystery, it seems almost impossible but that if the <hi>Fathers</hi> had borrowed this Notion of the Trinity from the <hi>Platonists,</hi> they would have explain'd it in this more facile and plausible way.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But you'l object, That though it may seem more Rational in it self, yet it might not be so happily applied to Places of Scripture; and that's the reason why the <hi>Fathers,</hi> though they took the <hi>Mystery</hi> from <hi>Plato</hi> in the gross, yet did not particularly explain it after the way of the <hi>Platonists.</hi> But without doubt there is not only no place of Scripture that plainly clashes with the above-described Mystery, but sundry Places that may be very speciously alledged for it. It is plain that as the <hi>Second Hypostasis</hi> in <hi>Platonisme</hi> is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, so it is in <hi>Christianity</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as if <hi>Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Intellect</hi> were acknowledged his proper Character in both. They might also plausibly enough draw to their sense what Christ speaks, John 14.28. <hi>My Father is greater then I</hi>; and what he utters concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Spirit, chap. 16.14. <hi>He shall glorifie me; for he shall receive of mine, and shew it unto you.</hi> Wherefore, I say, the <hi>Fathers</hi> being every way so fairly invited to bring the <hi>Platonick</hi> Notion of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> into the Church, assuredly if themselves had been <hi>Platonists,</hi> and had fetched the Mystery from that School, they would not have failed to have done it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Secondly, Admit that the ancient Fathers were <hi>Platonists,</hi> and brought the Mystery of the <hi>Trinity</hi> into the Church of the Christians, it does not straight follow That it is therefore a <hi>Pagan</hi> or <hi>Heathenish Mystery: Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> having not received it from <hi>Pagans</hi> or <hi>Heathens,</hi> but from the learned of the <hi>Iews,</hi> as sundry Authors assert; the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves in long succession having received it as a Divine Tradition; and such is <hi>Platonisme</hi> acknowledged to be by <hi>Iamblichus,</hi> who sayes it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And assuredly if there had not been some very great reason for it, men so wise and profoundly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55305:20"/>
knowing as <hi>Pythagoras, Plato, Plotinus</hi> and others, would never have made so much adoe about it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Thirdly and lastly, I say it is not only <hi>impious,</hi> but <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>foolish,</hi> to asperse that <hi>Mystery</hi> with the reproch of <hi>Paganisme,</hi> that is so plainly, to them that be not prejudiced, set down and held forth in the Holy Scripture. For the very <hi>Forme of Baptisme</hi> prescribed by our Saviour evidently enough denotes <hi>Three Divine Hypostases.</hi> Of the <hi>Father</hi> there is no question. Concerning <hi>the Divinity of the Sonne</hi> we shall speak more fully in the Second point we proposed. That <hi>the Holy Ghost</hi> is not a mere Power, Property or Attribute of God, but an <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> one free enough from being swai'd by Tradition or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of any Church, and (as himself conceits) a very close and safe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herer to Scripture, does grosly enough acknowledge, while he makes it <hi>some created Angel</hi> that bears the sacred Title of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and undergoes those Divine functions that are attributed to him.</p>
               <p>But we need not maintain Truth by any mans Error, it being suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently able to support it self; and therefore we will make use of no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, but what Scripture it self offers us. And this <hi>Forme of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme</hi> affords us something to the evincing that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is not an <hi>Attribute,</hi> but an <hi>Hypostasis.</hi> For sith that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is to give up a mans self to the Discipline, Government and Authority of this or that Person; it is the most natural sense to conceive that <hi>all Three</hi> mentioned in the Forme are <hi>Persons,</hi> we being so well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that two of them are.</p>
               <p>But there are other passages of Scripture that will make the point more clear. Rom. 15.13. <hi>The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Now if the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> were but a <hi>Power,</hi> not a <hi>Person,</hi> what a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Tautology would it be? for the sense would be, <hi>through the power of the holy power.</hi> Again, John 16.13. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> are very ill Syntax, were it not that there is a <hi>Personality</hi> in the Holy Spirit, which by what follows is most undeniably evident; <hi>For he shall not speak of himself: but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak.</hi> To <hi>receive of one</hi> and <hi>communicate to others</hi> by way of <hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>speaking,</hi> what can that belong to but a <hi>Person</hi> or <hi>Hypostasis?</hi> To this you may adde also Mark 13.11. <hi>Whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not you that speak, but the Holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that this <hi>Hypostasis</hi> is not <hi>a created Angel,</hi> amongst other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons the <hi>Conception of Christ</hi> may well argue, it being more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous That that spirit that moved upon the waters and created the world, should form that holy <hi>Foetus</hi> in the womb of the Virgin, then that any created Angel should apply himself to that work; for he had not then been <hi>the Son of God, but of an Angel,</hi> as in reference to his birth in time.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Besides, this <hi>one Individual Spirit</hi> in Scripture in represented as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where ready <hi>to sanctify, to regenerate, to distribute various gifts and graces to the Church, to have spoke by the mouth of the Prophets, to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55305:20"/>
be a</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>a discerner of the thoughts of the heart. Baptisme</hi> also and <hi>Benedictions</hi> are imparted in his name; he is also <hi>called to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> which is a piece of <hi>Divine worship:</hi> all which seems <hi>more naturally</hi> to be understood of him whom we properly call <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> then of any particular created <hi>Angel</hi> whatsoever.</p>
               <p n="10">10. We shall onely adde one place more, which will put all out of doubt to them that do not doubt of the Text it self; 1 John 5.7. <hi>There are three witnesses in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit: and these three are One.</hi> What can be writ more plain for the proof of the <hi>Triunity of the Godhead?</hi> But for those that suspect the Clause to be supposititious, I shall not trouble my self to confute them; that task being performed so solidly and judiciously by a late Interpreter, that nothing but Prejudice and Wilfulness can make a man depart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied with so clear a demonstration. Wherefore secure of this Point Concerning <hi>the Trinity,</hi> we go on to the next concerning <hi>The Divinity of Christ.</hi>

                  </gap> to be true, in what fitter, more significant or better-becoming way could it be expressed then already it is in the Beginning of that Gospel? Wherefore to interpret it in any other sense, is to delude themselves, and to abuse the Scripture through the prepossessions of their own Prejudice. Of which violence they do thereto they cannot well be sensible, they thinking they have full commission to distort it into any posture, rather then to let it alone in that which so plainly points to a Mystery which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55305:21"/>
they hold impossible and self-contradictious. For so has their bold and blind reasoning concluded aforehand concerning <hi>the Trinity,</hi> and <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Christ.</hi> But to those that are indifferent this Text bears such evidence with it, that it cannot but settle their belief.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For why should the Euangelist omit the manner of Christ's <hi>Birth</hi> as he was <hi>Man,</hi> but that he was intent upon his <hi>Eternal Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> as he was <hi>God?</hi> Or why should he not call him by that name that was given him at his <hi>Circumcision,</hi> or by the name of <hi>Crist</hi> or the <hi>Messias</hi> who was a Person expected in time, but that his thoughts were carried back to that of him which was from all Eternity?

                  </gap>, <hi>His emanations are from the Beginning, from the dayes of Eternity.</hi> Which agrees well with what Christ professes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.<note place="margin">John 8.58.</note>

                  </gap> for if he was <hi>before Abraham,</hi> there is little question but he was before all things; and that of the Psalmist is but his due attribute, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Before the mountains were brought forth, or the Earth was formed, even from everlasting to everlasting Thou art God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now for <hi>the Posture of things,</hi> after the Evangelist has twice as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted That <hi>he was from the beginning</hi>; that you may not mistake and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55305:21"/>
think he means <hi>the beginning of his Ministry,</hi> as the Messiah, he tells you, according to the Doctrine of the Jews, That <hi>all things were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him:</hi> and at the tenth verse, that you may have no subterfuge, he sayes, That <hi>even that world that was made by him knew him not:</hi> which excludes all Moral and Mystical interpretations, and shews plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that wicked men, though not their wickedness, are his Creation, and consequently all the world besides. And the Author to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews is a farther witness of this Truth, citing that of the Psalmist concerning the Son of God, <hi>Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the Earth, and the Heavens are the work of thy hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is yet another argument of <hi>the Divinity of Christ,</hi> which I need not prove, it being acknowledged even by our Adversaries, and it is <hi>Religious worship due to him,</hi> which I conceive is due to none but God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> and <hi>Divinity of Christ</hi> we have hitherto proved out of <hi>the Scriptures,</hi> and might adde many places more; but <hi>the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Nature of the thing it self</hi> shall be the last Confirmation. <hi>That Christ is to be worshipped</hi> is acknowledged of all hands. But <hi>to worship</hi> one that is not God, is to relapse into the ancient rites of the Pagans, who were <hi>Men-worshippers</hi> and eaters of the sacrifices of the dead. For <hi>Iupiter, Belus, Bacchus, Vulcan, Mercurius, Osiris</hi> and <hi>Isis,</hi> and the rest of the Gods of the Heathen, what were they but <hi>mere men,</hi> whose <hi>Benefactions</hi> extorted <hi>divine honours</hi> from <hi>Superstitious</hi> posterity after their Death? Wherefore Christ ought not to be <hi>a mere man,</hi> but <hi>God,</hi> that is, he ought to be <hi>really</hi> and <hi>physically united to the Deity</hi>; it being present not by <hi>Assistance</hi> onely but by <hi>Information</hi>; that as <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> are <hi>one Man,</hi> so <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> may be <hi>one Christ.</hi> But if there were no <hi>Trinity,</hi> but <hi>One Hypostasis</hi> in the Deity and the Humanity of Christ thus joyn'd with it, How could he be <hi>a Sacrifice for sin,</hi> there being none beside himself to whom he should be offer'd? or How could he be <hi>sent by another,</hi> when there is none other to send him? and the <hi>Son of God</hi> out of the bosome of his <hi>Father</hi> could not be said to suffer, but he that is offended to be sacrificed to pacifie himself: which things are very absurd and incongruous.</p>
               <p>But you'l say, the Absurdity still remains in <hi>the Second Hypostasis.</hi> For was not <hi>Sin</hi> as contrary to <hi>Him</hi> as to the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Third,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently He as much offended? and therefore He dying in our nature, was sacrificed to pacify Himself. In answer to this I admit that all <hi>Three Hypostases</hi> were <hi>alike offended</hi> at Sin, and withall <hi>alike compassionate</hi> to Sinners. Which <hi>Compassion</hi> was in the Deity towards Mankind before the Incarnation and Death of Christ. But the formal Declaration and visible Consignation of this Reconcilement was by Christ according as he is revealed in the Gospel, whose Transactions in our behalf are nothing else but <hi>a sweet and kind Condescension of the Wisdome of God in this Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> accommodating himself to our humane capacities and properties, to win us off in a kindly was to <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> And therefore all the <hi>Three Hypostases</hi> being alike offended at Sin, and alike prone to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Sinner and recover him to <hi>Obedience,</hi> contrived <hi>such a way of declaring their pardon,</hi> as might shew their highest <hi>dislike of sin,</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55305:22"/>
                  <hi>win most upon the Sinner</hi> by moving his affections to a serious <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Remorse.</hi> Wherefore the Divine complotment was this; That the <hi>Eternal Son of God</hi> should be made <hi>Flesh,</hi> and to testifie the Hatred of God to Sin and his Love to mankind, should be sacrificed for an Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the sins of the world: Then which a greater Engine can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imagined to move us to an <hi>Abhorrence of sin,</hi> and to the Love of his Law that thus redeemed us and wrought our reconciliation with the Father. To whom being, as I may so say, the Head in the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and of all things, and having in his Paternal right the First power of punishing and pardoning, this Pacification is naturally directed. For it is as if a Father of a Family or the Prince of a Nation having a minde to pardon some Malefactor, that he might not seem too prone to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and so encourage men to Rebellion, should plot with his Eldest Son to be an earnest Intercessor in the behalf of the party, when yet the Son disrelisheth the crime of him he intercedes for as much as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did. There is the same Reason in the Intercession of Christ with the Eternal Father, saving that it was with more earnestnesse and greater agony, even unto death, and of farre higher consequence. But that such an Intercession and Pacification as this should be made up in the solitary Scene of one Person, is impossible.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Wherefore the denying of either <hi>the Divinity of Christ</hi> or <hi>the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> seems a Subversion of the Christian Religion. And not onely so, but that Fanatical piece of Magnificency of some Enthusiasts, who would make <hi>their Union with God the same with that of Christ's.</hi> For then were they <hi>truly God,</hi> and <hi>Divine Adoration</hi> would belong unto them; or if not, it is a sign they are not God, and that therefore Christ is not: Either of which confounds or destroys our Religion. But if you demand what the Difference is betwixt the Union of Christ and Ours with the Divinity, I have intimated it before. In one the <hi>Divinity</hi> is <hi>Forma informans,</hi> in the other but <hi>Forma assistens:</hi> in the one it is as <hi>Lux in Corpore lucido,</hi> in the other as <hi>Lumen in Corpore diaphano.</hi> The Divinity in Christ is as the Light in the Sun; the Divinity in his Members as the Sun-shine in the Aire.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And this distinction and due distance being kept, which some saucy and high-flown Enthusiasts do not observe, there is yet scope and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement enough for them to strive to be full as good as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; I am sure farre better then they are: there ordinarily being no difference betwixt them and the meanest Christians, but that their Tongues are swelled with greater tumor and turgency of speech, and their Minds filled with more vain phantasyes and exorbitant Lunacyes; whenas the other speak conformably to the Apostolick Faith, and with less noise live more honestly. But that no less <hi>Union with God</hi> then <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Physical Deification</hi> must make them <hi>Good,</hi> is a sign they are <hi>stark naught,</hi> and that Pride has laid wast their Intellectuals. For is not that Spirit that created and framed all things able to reforme us unto the most unblamable pitch of <hi>Humility, Self-denial, Dependency upon God, Love of our neighbour, Obedience to Magistrates, Faith, Temperance</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> without being any more <hi>Hypostatically</hi> united with us then with the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55305:22"/>
Earth, Sea, Sun, Moon and Starres, and the Natural parts of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Wherefore we conclude <hi>That to assert, That the Union of any true Christian with God is the Same with that of Christ's, is a bold, useless and groundless Opinion, and inconsistent with and destructive of the Christian Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. We have seen How <hi>Necessary and Essential to Christianity the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Divinity of Christ is,</hi>

                  <hi>and</hi> consequently <hi>of the Trinity,</hi> without which the other cannot be rightly conceived: and therefore we do not onely disapprove of those frivolous slanders and cavils that would brand that Sacred Mystery with the infamous note of <hi>Paganisme</hi>; but highly magnifie and humbly adore the Providence of God that that Truth should be kept so long warme and be so carefully polished by those Heathens that knew not the main Use thereof, or to what end the Tradition was delivered to the ancient Patriarchs, Prophets or holy Sages of old in either <hi>Aegypt</hi> or <hi>Iudaea,</hi> from whence <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> had it, and prepared those parts of the World where their Philosophy had taken foot-hold, to an easy reception of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: but this we have glanced at elsewhere.</p>

               <p n="1">1. WE proceed now to the Third and Last Point propounded, which is <hi>Concerning the state of Souls departed,</hi> which we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert <hi>not to sleep,</hi> that is, not to be void of all Operation and Sense of Joy or Punishment, but that they have a Knowledge and Apprehension of their own condition, be it Good or Bad. Which Article I hold as undoubtedly True, though not so indispensable, as the Two former, and though not so Necessary, yet exceeding Convenient to be entertain'd: It being a great Abater to our zeal and fervency in Religion to think that in the end of our life we shall be dodged and put off by a long sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and comfortless <hi>Sleep of the Soul</hi> under the sods of the Grave for many hundreds, if not for some thousands, of years.</p>
               <p>Besides, an indulgence to such a Dulness and Heartlesness of Spirit,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55305:23"/>
as to be content to intermit the Functions of Life for so long a time, may at last work the Soul into a sottish mistrust of ever being awaked, and make her conclude the <hi>Mystery of Christianity</hi> within the narrow verges of this mortal life; as <hi>David George</hi> and other <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> did, who were more in love with many Wives then with any Article of Faith that promised such pleasures as might not be reaped in this Flesh.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But we are here to deal (not with such vain <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> but) with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely-devoted Sons of Reason, who pretend not to dictate but demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate out of Scripture <hi>the Sleep of the Soul</hi>; confidently suggesting to the better gaining Proselytes to their own, that the contrary opinion is not <hi>Christian</hi> but <hi>Heathenish,</hi> derived from the Philosophy of <hi>Plato</hi> (which the Greek Fathers had imbibed) and thence introduced into the Church of Christ. To the First of which I answer, That our Adversaries De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations for <hi>the Sleep of the Soul</hi> are but their own Imaginations and Dreams upon the mistaken Text. It is beside my scope to insist long on this matter: I shall onely give you a tast of the weakness of the rest of their Arguments by proposing and refuting of those that seem the strongest. Their main proof is from the whole tenor of the 15 of the 1 Cor. and more particularly from the 32 verse; <hi>If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not?</hi> Hence they think may certainly be concluded, That the Soul before the Resurrection of the Body has not the Perception or Enjoyment of any thing; otherwise the very Remembrance of those sufferings for Christ might be a solace for <hi>Paul</hi> when he was out of the Body.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But to answer this Difficulty with the fuller satisfaction, let us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise some few things to prepare the way to it: As first, That the <hi>Schemes of speech in Prophets and men inspired</hi> are usually such as <hi>most powerfully strike the Phansie</hi> and most strongly beat upon the <hi>Imagination,</hi> they describing things in the most sensible, palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and particular representations that can be. According to which Figure the <hi>General Resurrection</hi> is set off by mens awaking out of the dust of the <hi>Earth</hi> and coming out of the <hi>Graves,</hi> when as yet many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands have wanted Burial, their bones rotting on the surface of the Earth, and as many thousands have had their intombement in the <hi>Waters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Secondly, That the Holy Writers do not pen down their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions in so strict a Scholastick Method, that they keep precisely and punctually to one Title; but by a <hi>free vibration of Phansie</hi> give a touch here and a touch there, according as they were moved and actuated by that Spirit that exhibits more to their Minds at once then their Tongue has leasure orderly and distinctly to utter; and are more earnestly taken up in making good the main and most usefull scope of their discourse, then to satisfie mens Curiosities in particular Niceties.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thirdly, That many Words in Scripture have a lax and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous sense, and that therefore they are to be understood according as Circumstances and Likelyhood of Truth determine: and that these Termes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55305:23"/>
signifying <hi>the raising up again of a Body out of the grave,</hi> sometimes <hi>mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vivificating of the Body,</hi> or <hi>recovering a Person to life,</hi> other sometimes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is the very same with the Jewes <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, Rom. 9.17. with <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which may imply a kinde of jogging or stirring up which is used to recover or prevent ones falling into a swoon; and God is the grand Author of Life and Motion, as the Apostle speaks.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Fourthly and lastly, That the <hi>Corinthians</hi> being a people given notoriously to the pleasures of the Flesh, there is no question to be made but the Temptations of the place had also drawn away some Members of the Church there at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and made them also <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Now there being nothing that does so much extinguish all Hopes and Apprehensions of <hi>a Life to come</hi> as Carnal and Sensual pleasures; it is very likely that those corrupted members fell away in their own judgments from the belief of any <hi>Reward after this life,</hi> and so with <hi>Himeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> or with the <hi>David-Georgians</hi> and our modern <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> allegorized away the real meaning of the <hi>Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> or the <hi>Blessed Immortality</hi> into a mere <hi>moral</hi> sense, under pretence whereof they might ostentate themselves more <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>knowing</hi> Christians then the rest; and yet with less fear and remorse of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence indulge to themselves all loosness and liberty of enjoying every tempting pleasure of this mortall life.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Wherefore to the present Argument I answer in general out of this last and the foregoing Premiss, That the purpose of the Apostle in this 15 to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> is to shew <hi>That there is a Life after the death of this Body, and a Blessed Immortality to be expected.</hi> A palpable <hi>pledge</hi> whereof was <hi>God's raising of Christs body out of the grave,</hi> and exhibiting him alive to his Disciples. Which was a Sign very signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant and expressive of the thing; this <hi>Blessed Immortality</hi> mainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in being clothed with those <hi>Heavenly, Ethereal</hi> and <hi>Paradisiacal bodies</hi> which Christ will bestow upon those that belong to him at the last day.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Out of the First I answer, That though S. <hi>Paul</hi> speak in such a Phrase as fixes our Imagination on the Earth only, as is plain from that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of seed sown and rotting in the ground (for men sow not seed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Water) yet in whatsoever Element the Souls or Bodies of the Saints be found, <hi>Earth, Water</hi> or <hi>Air,</hi> nay though we should grant
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55305:24"/>
with some that sundry Souls of holy men act in Aery vehicles in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval betwixt their Death and the Day of Judgment; yet it is no more prejudice to them, then to those that are found alive in the flesh; For none are excluded from the enjoyment of their <hi>glorified bodies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Out of the Second and Third I answer, That S. <hi>Paul</hi> might very well have Three conceptions <hi>vibrating</hi> in his minde, while he wrote concerning this Mystery: the one more <hi>Simple</hi> and <hi>General,</hi> of the Life and Subsistency of the Soul out of this Earthly Body; the other more <hi>Special,</hi> of a <hi>Blessed Immortality</hi>; and the Third <hi>most Determinate</hi> of all, which represented the <hi>manner of this Blessedness,</hi> in being invested with <hi>glorified</hi> bodies. And out of this General I shall direct a more Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar answer to that of the 32 of this Chapter, where <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may be either interpreted, <hi>if the Souls of just men deceased obtain not their glorified or heavenly Bodies:</hi> (For though it were granted that they did in the mean time live and act in <hi>Aery vehicles,</hi> yet that State and Region, as the Earth, being common to good and bad, they had yet obtained no <hi>peculiar</hi> reward for their hardship and toil here) Or else, which is the more safe sense by far, it may be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted at large of <hi>the life and subsistency of the Soul after its departure,</hi> according to the last signification of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the third Premiss. And thus is the strength of the main proof of the <hi>Psychopannychites</hi> ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly enervated.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But there are other places of Scripture which they misapply to the same purpose, as the Answer of our Saviour to the <hi>Sadducees</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion concerning the Resurrection, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob; God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</hi> Hence our Adversaries would conclude That the Souls of the departed do not live; because if they did, our Saviour's argument would be invalid for the Resurrection. For if <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Spirit were now alive, God might be his God, though his Body never rise. But this is easily satisfied out of the second Premiss: By <hi>Resurrection</hi> there being understood a <hi>Life hereafter,</hi> and the Opinion of the <hi>Sadducees</hi> being <hi>That there is neither Angel, nor Spirit, nor Life to come,</hi> he does not exactly tie himself to that particular circumstance of <hi>a blessed Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality</hi> that consists in the enjoyment of <hi>glorified Bodies</hi>; but answers more at large concerning <hi>the subsistence of Souls of men departed,</hi> that they are and live, and that therefore there are Spirits; and so handsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confutes the <hi>whole Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Sadducees</hi> by that citation out of their own <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> and a skilful application thereof.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THE third and last way of proving <hi>the Sleep of the Soul,</hi> is from such Passages in Scripture as seem to joyn the <hi>Hour of our Death</hi> immediately with the <hi>Day of our Resurrection,</hi> as in 2 Cor. 5. Where the Apostle seems to intimate that there does nothing intercede be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the solution of our <hi>Earthly</hi> Tabernacle, and being clothed with the <hi>Heavenly</hi>; which not being till the Day of Judgment, it is a sign that the Soul is in no condition unless that of <hi>Sleep</hi> till then. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in 2 Tim. chap. 1. and chap. 4. In the former he speaks of his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 1. v. 12. Chap. 4. v. 8.</note> which he intrusts God with till <hi>that Day,</hi> and prays that <hi>Onesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi> may finde mercy at <hi>that Day:</hi> and in the latter he speaks of <hi>a Crown of righteousness</hi> that the Lord the righteous Judge will give him at <hi>that day,</hi> as if all were defer'd till then. But in my conceit it is a weak kinde of Argument, Because the Souls of the Saints receive not their <hi>great reward</hi> till the <hi>Day of Iudgment,</hi> that therefore they receive <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all</hi>; nay that they are in a worse state then in this life, as having lost all Sense of Existence or Being. <hi>Their</hi> opinion to me seems more tolerable then this, who, though they do not presently mount them up in their <hi>Ethereal Chariots</hi> to Heaven, yet permit them to move and to act in their <hi>Aereal Vehicles</hi> at a less distance from the Earth. But that <hi>Last day</hi> being a day of that high Solemnity, dreadful Glory and Majesty, it is no wonder that for the better moving of the Minds of men, he so often mentions that time without taking any notice of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Space: For thereby it also seems more nigh, as a distant Object does to the sight, no visible thing coming between.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now for the second to the Cor. 5. chap. There be two waies of clearing that difficulty there: The one of <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> in which a late learned Interpreter of our own does also insist, expounding (as they may well) the third verse (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) thus, <hi>If so be we shall be found in the number of those that are still clothed with these Earthly bodies, not stript naked of them by death.</hi> This Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> going afore makes still the more war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable; as also that following phrase, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is used by the Apostle in a parallel case. This Exposition utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys all the force of the <hi>Psychopannychites</hi> Argument taken from this place: For whereas the Apostle seems to speak as if immediately upon the solution of this <hi>Earthly,</hi> they were to be invested with a <hi>Heavenly</hi> Tabernacle, (which is mainly to be gathered out of the second and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55305:25"/>
fourth verses) it is only upon the supposition that <hi>the day of the Lord</hi> might come while they were yet clothed with flesh.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But because this Interpretation may seem to be something dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to the Apostle's Knowledge, as if he were pendulous and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether <hi>the day of Iudgment</hi> might not be in his time; which some men will not bear: I shall propound another, that they may take their choice. The former seems to have a special advantage in the proper sense of those two words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and if we can but come off well here, we shall carry on the rest handsmooth. We premise therefore thus much concerning the meaning of those two words, That as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies simply <hi>to put on a garment,</hi> so <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per signification of the word. And as <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> may signifie <hi>to put on an inward garment,</hi> so <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="4">4. Being thus fitted for the purpose, we shall now briefly para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase the six first verses of the 15. chap. which they alledge against us, thus;
<list>
                     <item>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note>1. <hi>For we know, that if this Earthly and Mortal Body of ours were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, that yet we have an Heavenly one whose Author and Maker is God.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>And for this cause is it that we groan so earnestly to be clothed also with our Heavenly Body within this Earthly:</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. <hi>Because we being thus clothed, when we put off our Earthly Body, we shall not be found naked, nor our Souls left to float in the crude Air.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. <hi>For we that are in these Earthly Bodies groan earnestly being bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, not as if we had a desire to be stript naked of all Corporeity, or that we should be presently rid of these Earthly Bodies before God see fit; but that we may have a more Heavenly and Spiritual clothing within, that morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity may be swallowed up of life.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>5. <hi>Nor do we arrive to this pitch by our own power, but it is God who works upon us</hi> (as I said) <hi>both Body and Soul, and frames us into this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by the operation of his holy Spirit, which he has given as a pledge of our Eternal Happiness.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>6. <hi>And therefore we are alwaies of a good courage, not discontented at any thing. For whether we be in this Earthly Body, it is tolerable, as being our usual and natural home; or whether we go out of it, which is most desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we shall then go to the Lord, our inward man being so fitly clad for the journey.</hi>
                     </item>

                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:55305:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>5. That this is the genuine sense of these verses, the 16 verse of the Chapter immediately going before will further confirm, where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith, <hi>That though his outward man perish, yet his inward man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed day by day,</hi> which is, <hi>Though his Earthly Body be in a perishing and decaying condition, yet his Spiritual and Heavenly gets strength and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth every day more and more.</hi> Now <hi>the Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Attainment of the Heavenly Body</hi> being all one, it were worth the while to enquire into the meaning of the Apostle, Philipp. 3. v. 11. where he professes his unwearied endeavours to <hi>attain to the Resurrection of the dead</hi>: where presently it follows, <hi>Not as if I had already attained it, or as if I were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready perfected.</hi> For if he meant not this <hi>Inward Spiritual body</hi> inveloped in the <hi>Earthly,</hi> he need not tell the <hi>Philippians</hi> that he had not yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd it. But the Point in hand is sufficiently plain already.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We have seen what <hi>weak</hi> Demonstrators the <hi>Psychopannychites</hi> are against <hi>the Life and Operation of Souls out of the Body,</hi> in their appeals to Scripture: We shall now see how improbable their aspersion is of the Opinion being a <hi>Pagan</hi> or <hi>Heathenish</hi> invention derived, as they say, merely from the School of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and from thence intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the Church.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="8" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>1.</hi> That the Opinion of the Soul's living and acting immediately after Death, was not fetched out of <hi>Plato</hi> by the Fathers, because they left out <hi>Preexistence,</hi> an Opinion very rational in it self, <hi>2.</hi> And such as seems plausible from sundry places of Scripture, as those alledged by <hi>Menasseh Ben Israel</hi> out of <hi>Deuteronomy, Jeremy,</hi> and <hi>Job. 3.</hi> as also God's resting on the seventh day. <hi>4.</hi> That their proclivity to think that the Angel that appeared to the Patriarchs so often was Christ, might have been a further inducement. <hi>5.</hi> Other places of the New Testament which seem to imply the Preexistence of Christ's Soul. <hi>6.</hi> More of the same kinde out of S. <hi>John. 7.</hi> Force added to the last proofs from the opinion of the Socinians. <hi>8.</hi> That our Saviour did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, or at least not disapprove the opinion of Preexistence. <hi>9.</hi> The main scope intended from the preceding allegations, namely, That the Soul's living and acting after death is no Pagan opinion out of <hi>Plato,</hi> but a Christian Truth evidenced out of the Scriptures.</head>
               <p n="1">1. AND I think it is not hard for a man to prove that this sinister conceit of theirs is almost impossible to be true. For if the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers by vertue of their conversing so much with <hi>Plato</hi>'s wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings had brought this opinion, <hi>of the Souls living and subsisting after death,</hi> into the Christian Religion, they could by no means have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>the Preexistence of it afore,</hi> which is so explicite and frequent a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Platonists</hi>; especially that Tenet being a Key for some main Mysteries of Providence which no other can so handsomly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55305:26"/>
and having so plausible Reasons for it, and nothing considerable to be alledged against it. For is it not plain that the Soul, being an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible</hi> and <hi>Immaterial</hi> Substance, can not be <hi>generated?</hi> Now if it be <hi>created</hi> by God at every effectual act of Venery, (besides that in general it is harsh that God should precipitate <hi>immaculate Souls</hi> into <hi>defiled Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>) it seems abominable that by so special an act of his as <hi>Creation,</hi> he should be thought to assist Adultery, Incest and Buggery. Of this see more at large in my Trestise <hi>Of the Immortality of the Soul,</hi> Book 2. chap. 12, &amp; 13.</p>
               <p>But they'l still urge, That it was not the Unreasonableness of the Opinion, but the Uncompliableness of it with Scripture, that made them forgoe the Preexistency of the Soul, though they retained her Subsistency, Life and Activity after death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But it had assuredly been no hard matter for them to have made their Cause plausible even out of Scripture it self. The Jewes would have contributed something out of the Old Testament. <hi>Menasseh Ben Israel</hi> cites several places to this purpose, as Deuteronomy 29.14, 15. insinuating there, that God making his covenant with the <hi>absent</hi> and the <hi>present,</hi> that the Souls of the posterity of the Jewes were then in Being, though not there present at the Publication of the Law: For the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of the Covenanters into <hi>absent</hi> and <hi>present</hi> naturally implies that they Both are, though some here, some in other places.

He renders it, <hi>Nosti te jam tum natum fuisse, Knowest thou that thou wast then born, and that the number of thy daies are many? Then,</hi> viz. from the beginning of the Creation, or when the Light was made (a symbol of Intellectual or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material Beings). The Seventy also plainly render it to that sense, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>I know that thou wast formed then, and that the number of thy years are many.</hi> The Author of <hi>the Book of Wisdome</hi> (who though he be not Canonical, yet is acknowledged a very venerable Writer) speaks out plainly concerning the Soul of <hi>Solomon,</hi> chap. 8. v. 19, 20. <hi>For I was a witty childe, and had a good Spirit: Yea, rather being good, I came into a body unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.</hi>

Moreover, their inclination to think that in sundry of those <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions of Angels</hi> to the ancient <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> it was <hi>Christ</hi> himself that appeared, would further have enticed them to retain this Doctrine of Preexistence of Souls, that that opinion of Christ's appearing then might be more entire and determinate; as it would be also in those that hold <hi>Melchisedec</hi> that blessed <hi>Abraham</hi> to have been <hi>Christ:</hi> which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

                  <hi>Cunaeus</hi> looks upon as true; nor can <hi>Calvin</hi> look upon it as <hi>strange,</hi> if he do but hold to his own words in his readings upon <hi>Daniel, In eo nihil est absurdi, quòd Christus aliquam speciem humanae naturae exhibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret antequam manifestatus esset in carne.</hi> And that the <hi>Angel</hi> that led the Israelites into the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was <hi>Christ,</hi> seems plainly asserted 1 Cor. chap. 10. v. 9. <hi>Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted him, and perished by Serpents.</hi> But Christ is a complexion of the Humane nature with the Divine. Consider also Hebr. 11.26. which seems to implie that the Soul of the <hi>Messias</hi> was a Patron and Protector of the <hi>Holy seed</hi> betimes, and had a special relation to the <hi>Iews</hi> above any other Nation. And therefore when he came into the world, (i. e. was born, brought up and conversed among the Jews,) he might the more properly be said to come to <hi>his own,</hi> though his own knew him not, John 1.11.</p>
               <p>And verily that the Soul of the <hi>Messiah</hi> was in Being before he took upon him our flesh, the most easie and natural meaning of 1 Joh. 4.2. seems also to import, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Here S. <hi>Iohn</hi> seems to cabbalize, as in several places of the Apocalypse, that is, to speak in the language of the Learned of the Jews: For the genuine sense is, <hi>He that confesses that Iesus is the Messiah come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the flesh,</hi> or <hi>into a Terrestrial Body, is of God</hi>: Which implies that he was, before he came into it. Which is the doctrine of the Jews, and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed so exactly according to their sense, that themselves could not have uttered it more naturally and significantly, and therefore, might they say, it is unnatural and violent to put any other meaning upon it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Again, He being happily (before the Generation of men and the peopling of the earth) <hi>the Messiah Elect,</hi> (as I may so speak) united also with the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and resplendent with Celestial glory and beauty amongst the Angels in Heaven; this Hypothesis will give a very easie and natural sense to sundry places of the New Testament that otherwise seem very obscure. As that of Philipp. 2.6, 7, 8. For it has racked many mens minds to conceive how an <hi>Exinanition of himself</hi> can belong to the Eternal and Immutable God by becoming man; which the Text seems to point at. But it may very properly belong to the Soul of the Messiah, who was yet truly God by a <hi>Physical union</hi> with the Godhead. So likewise John 17.4, 5. <hi>I have glorified thee upon earth, for which purpose I was sent down thither. And now, Father, bring me up back again to thy self, that I may again enjoy that Glory which I had with thee in the Heavens, before the world and Generations of men were.</hi> This is the easie meaning of those two Verses: For that this is to be understood of the <hi>Humanity</hi> of Christ, <hi>Grotius</hi> is so confident, that he is fain to turn <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>which I was to have,</hi> or <hi>which I was designed to have, before the world was.</hi> But this present gloss needs no such distorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or force done to words, but is very natural and genuine.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Again, John 6.38. <hi>I came down from Heaven, not to doe mine own will, but the will of him that sent me:</hi> and chap. 3.31. <hi>He that comes from Heaven is above all:</hi> and yet clearer, chap. 16.28. <hi>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world; again I leave the world,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55305:27"/>
and go to the Father.</hi> But clearest of all, chap. 3.13. where speaking of his <hi>Ascension</hi> (and that was <hi>Local</hi>) he mentions also his <hi>Descension,</hi> which it is most natural to understand in the <hi>same</hi> sense. <hi>No man hath ascended up to Heaven, but he that came down from Heaven, even the Son of man who is in Heaven</hi>; i. e. whose mind and conversation is there, though his Personal and visible presence be here on earth, as <hi>Grotius</hi> also interpreteth these last words. To all which you may adde John 6.26. <hi>What if you shall see the Son of man ascend where he was before?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. These Scriptures which we have cited bear so strong towards a <hi>Local descending</hi> from, as well as <hi>ascending</hi> up to, Heaven, that some have thought that Christ was, besides his <hi>Ascension</hi> after his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> bodily taken up into Heaven, and that he there received instructions from God, and was then sent down to publish the Gospel. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly so notable a Transaction of Christ then in the flesh would never have been omitted by the other three Evangelists, nor so slightly and obscurely intimated by this.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But this Evangelist flying higher then to be kept within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of the time since his Incarnation, it had been very easie for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to have pleaded for the Preexistence and Descent of the Soul of the Messiah from Heaven into an Earthly Body from those passages of Scripture which we have quoted. And to make all sure, they might have further alledged for this opinion of the Soul's Preexistence, that it was at least unreproved, if not approved of, by our Saviour himself; as appears out of John 9. where he being asked by his Disciples, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was the blind mans own fault, or his parents, that he was born blind (which question plainly implies a Preexistence before this life) he seems to admit, it is certain he does not reprehend, the Hypothesis: No more then he does, Mark 8.27, 28. or Matthew 16.14. where his Disciples telling him, that some took him for <hi>Elias,</hi> others for <hi>Ieremias,</hi> or for some one of the old Prophets or other; he there again admits or not gainsaies the opinion of the Jews concerning the Preexistence or Transmigration of Souls, (as <hi>Grotius</hi> himself acknowledges that of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie</hi> to be referred <hi>ad</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,) but passes to a questioning of them, whom they thought him to be.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I conclude therefore, there being such plausible pretensions to prove the Preexistence of Souls, not only out of Reason but Scripture it self, if the Fathers had been imbued with that Heathenish and Pagan opinion (as our Adversaries term it) of the Soul's being able to act after the death of the Body, from the Philosophy of <hi>Plato,</hi> it had been even impossible for them to forgoe the latter part concerning the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existent life of the Soul before she comes into these Bodies; which is the thing I have all this while driven at.</p>

               <p>And I conceive that of 1 Pet. 3. v. 18, 19, 20. is none of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, if Prejudice and Violence wrest it not out of its genuine sense, which any man may easily apprehend to be this; <hi>For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, (that he might bring us to God,) being put to death as to his Body or Flesh, but yet safe and alive as to his Soul and Spirit.

               <p n="2">2. That solid interpreter of Scripture <hi>Iohn Calvin</hi> expounds it in the main according to this Paraphrase; only for <hi>being alive as to his Soul or Spirit,</hi> he reads it, <hi>vivificatus Spiritu,</hi> meaning by Spirit the Spirit of God. But it is plain that the Antithesis is more patt and punctual as we have rendred it, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is as warrantably interpreted <hi>to be alive as to be made alive</hi>: as <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>There is also another slight difference betwixt us, in that he had rather have <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> translated a <hi>watch-tower</hi> then a <hi>prison</hi>: Which we should easily admit, who alledge this place against the <hi>Sleep</hi> of the Soul; but he acknowledging also that the other sense is good, we have not varied from the common Translation. The greatest discrepancy is, that he conceives that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is put for <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, a Dative for a Genitive absolute: but I leave him there to compound that controversie with the Grammarians. The truth is, the learned and pious Interpreter thought it more tolerable to admit that the Apostle writ false Syntax then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound Doctrine; the fond opinion of the Papistical Purgatory being a worse <hi>Soloecisme</hi> in Religion, then to Latinize in Greek, or put a false Case, is in Grammar.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But this being too loose a Principle, &amp; wholy unsatisfactory to our
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55305:28"/>
Adversaries, to phansie the Holy Writers to <hi>soloecize</hi> in their language, when we do not like the sense; he had better have taken some other course more allowable to save us from the peril of Purgatory: and in my judgment there are two, either of which will suffice to fence us from the Assaults of the <hi>Romanists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The first is, By observing a latitude of sense in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> notes in his <hi>Metaphys.</hi> lib. 4. cap. 12. the particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in composition does not only signifie <hi>perfect privation,</hi> but also <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> from whence we may well translate <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>who in times past were not so obedient</hi> or <hi>so believing as they should be</hi>; and who were so bad, that they might be punished in their bodies and perish in the Deluge, but yet so good, that at length they must attain to an higher degree of eternal life by Christ's <hi>preaching to the dead,</hi> as is also intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the following chapter of this Epistle ver. 6. Wherefore acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging but Two states, <hi>viz.</hi> of either <hi>Hell</hi> or <hi>Paradise,</hi> we say, that these <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> were in the very lowest degree of Paradise, in which they were kept as in an inferior Mansion, which was as a kind of prison or close custody unto them, (their desires aspiring higher,) till there was made a great accession unto their happiness upon Christ's appearing and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching unto them. And this is the very sense that <hi>Calvin</hi> aims at in his Commentarie upon this place.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But there is yet another Interpretation, which we will propound in the second place, as free from the fear of any Purgatory as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and requires no immutation at all in our foregoing Paraphrase. We'll admit therefore that these <hi>Disobedient</hi> Souls were in <hi>Hell,</hi> not in the lowest Region, but in the more tolerable parts thereof: It does not at all from hence follow, because Christ in his Spirit exhibited himself to these, preached to them, and prepared them by the glad tidings of the Gospel, &amp; after carryed them to Heaven with him in Triumph as a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous spoil taken out of the jaws of the Devil, that there is any Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of Hell now, much less any Purgatorie. For there were two nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble occasions for this, such as will never happen again: For it respects the Souls of them that were suddenly swept away in the Deluge, and the <hi>Solemnity</hi> of our Saviours <hi>Crucifixion</hi> and <hi>Ascension</hi>; He even in the midst of Death undermining the Prince of Death, and at his <hi>Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> victoriously carrying away these First-fruits of his Suffering, and presenting them to his Father in the highest Heaven. But to expect from this, that there should be still continued a daily or yearly releasment out of <hi>Hell</hi> or <hi>Purgatory,</hi> is as groundlesly concluded as if, because at the solemn Coronation of some great Prince all the prison-doors in some City were flung open, Malefactors should infer, that they will ever stand open all his whole Reign.</p>
               <p>Thus we see how safe also the easy and obvious sense of this place is; which I thought fit to rescue from the torture of other more learned and curious Expositors, that it might be able to give its free suffrage for the Confirmation of a Point so usefull as this we have in hand. For it is plain that if Christ <hi>preached to the dead,</hi> they were <hi>not asleep</hi> at so concerning a Sermon.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:55305:28"/>6. Again, 2 Cor. 5. v. 8. <hi>We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the Body, and to be present with the Lord.</hi> Here <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> plainly intimates a going out of this Mortal Body, not a change of it into an Immortal one: therefore we may safely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that this courage and willingness of the Apostle to die implies an enjoyment of the presence of Christ after death before the general Resurrection: Else why should he rather desire to die then to live, but that he expects that <hi>Faith</hi> should be presently perfected by <hi>Sight,</hi> as he insinuates in the foregoing verse? But assuredly better is that enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is onely by <hi>Faith,</hi> then to have no enjoyment at all; as it must be if the Soul cannot operate out of this Body.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A like Proof to this and further Confirmation of the Truth is that of Philipp. 1.21, 22, 23, 24. where the Apostle again professing his courage and forwardness to <hi>magnifie Christ in his body, whether by life or by death,</hi> uses the like Argument as before; <hi>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. But if I live in the flesh, it will be worth my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; yet what I should chuse I wote not. For I am in a strife betwixt two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ; which is far better: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, to abide in the flesh is more needfull for you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. The genuine sense of which Place is questionless this; That while he lived, his life was like Christ's upon Earth, innocent, but encumbred with much hardship and affliction, bearing about in his body the marks of the Lord Jesus; but if he died, he should then once for all seal to the Truth of his Martyrdome, and not onely scape all future troubles (which yet the love of Christ, his Assistance, and Hope of Reward did ever sustain him in) but, which was his great gain and advantage, arrive to an higher fruition of him after whom he had so longing a desire. But if <hi>to be with Christ,</hi> were <hi>to sleep</hi> in his bosome, and not so much as to be sensible he is there; it were impossible the Apostles affections should be carried so strongly to that state, or his judgement should determine it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>so exceedingly much better</hi>; especially his stay in the flesh being so necessary to the <hi>Philippians</hi> and the rest of the Church, and what he suffered and might further suffer in his life, no less a Testimony to the Truth, then Death it self.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Fourthly, Those phrases of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.13. <hi>Yea I think it meet, so long as I am in this Tabernacle, to stir you up and put you in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance: Knowing that I must shortly put off this Tabernacle,</hi> &amp;c. And so vers. 15. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in all likelyhood alludes to the same; as if his Soul went out of the <hi>Body</hi> as out of a <hi>Tabernacle.</hi> All these Phrases I say seem to me manifestly to indicate that there is no such necessary Union betwixt the <hi>Soul</hi> and the <hi>Body,</hi> but she may act as freely out of it as in it; as men are nothing the more dull, sleepy or senseless by putting off their cloaths, and going out of the house, but rather more awakened, active and sensible.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Fifthly, Hebr. 12.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.9.</note> There God is called <hi>the Father of Spirits,</hi> the Corrector and Chastiser of our Souls, in contradistinction to our <hi>Flesh</hi> or Bodies: and then vers. 22. lifting us up quite above the consideration of our Corporeal condition, he brings us to the Mystical mount Sion, the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55305:29"/>
City of the living God, the Heavenly Jerusalem, and to <hi>an innumerable company of Angels, to the Universal assembly, and Church of the first-born which are inrolled in heaven, and to God the Iudge of all, and to the Spirits of just men made perfect.</hi> Now I demand what <hi>Perfection</hi> can be in the <hi>Spirits of these just men</hi> to be overwhelmed in a <hi>senseless Sleep:</hi> or what a disproportionable and unsutable representation is it of this throng Theatre in Heaven, made up of Saints and Angels, that so great a part of them as the Souls of the Holy men deceased should be found drooping or quite drown'd in an unactive Lethargie? Certainly as it is incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in it self, so it is altogether inconsistent with the magnificency of the representation which this Author intends in this place.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Sixthly, Matth. 10.28. The life of the Soul separate from the Body is there plainly asserted by our Saviour. <hi>Fear not them that kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul; but rather fear him who is able to destroy both Body and Soul in Hell</hi>; i. e. able, if he will, to destroy the life both of Body and Soul in Hell-fire, according to the conceit of those whose opinions I have recited in my Treatise <hi>Of the Immortality of the Soul,</hi> Book 3. chap. 18. or else miserably to punish or afflict both Body and Soul in Hell, the torments whereof are worse then Death it self. For as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <hi>perire</hi> signifie to be <hi>excessively miserable,</hi> so <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="1">1. WE have yet one more notable Testimony against our Adversaries. Our Saviour Christ's Soul and the Thief's upon the Cross did subsist and live immediately upon the death of the Body, as appears from Luke 23.42, 43. <hi>And he said unto Iesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy Kingdome. And Iesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise:</hi> As if he should thus answer, Thou indeed beggest of me that I would be mindfull of thee when I come into my Kingdome, but I will not deferre thee so long; onely distrust not the unexpected riches of my goodness to thee: For verily I say unto thee, That this very day shalt thou be with me in

               <p n="5">5.

               <p n="1">1. WE have at length passed through the most dark and doubtful part of our journey, and have given what Account we were able of the most <hi>Obscure</hi> and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse</hi> points in Christianity: We begin now to enter into a more lightsome Region and easier prospect of Truth, the day breaking upon us and the morning-light tinging the tops of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, from whence we are ascertain'd of a further and a more full disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of that <hi>Grand Mystery</hi> we seek after; which the Spirit of God in the plain Records of Scripture will afterward so ratifie and confirm, that to those that have a judgment to discern, it will be secured from all future controversie. But in the mean time we are to contemplate the <hi>Reasonableness and Intelligibleness</hi> thereof from some chief Heads or eminent and known <hi>Aphorisms</hi> in Philosophy and free Reason, which will no less gratifie our Understanding in this present pursuit after Truth, then the pleasant reflections of the Sun's beams from the tops of the hils do the eye of the early traveller. But we shall only rehearse, not insist much upon the proof of these <hi>Conclusions,</hi> they being either so fully and irrefutably demonstrated in other writings (See my Treatise <hi>Of the Immortality of the Soul,</hi> and my <hi>Antidote against Atheism</hi>) or else of that Evidency in themselves, that they want nothing but simple per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception for their Demonstration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The First and Chiefest is <hi>The Existence of God,</hi> that is, <hi>of a Being both infinitely Wise, Good and Powerful.</hi> Which, it is manifest, cannot be <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Body,</hi> grinde it as thin as you will in your Imagination; and therefore he must be <hi>a Spirit, Omnipresent, pervading and penetrating all things.</hi> Which <hi>Conclusion</hi> is so agreeable to the <hi>Natural Faculties of our Mind,</hi> if we were once acquainted with them. (For some men are become even strangers to the better part of themselves) that any thing contrary or on this side of this Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ition will certainly lie very unevenly and untowardly in our Conception.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For whereas it is impossible but <hi>Something must be of itself</hi>; is it not far more congruous to our Reason That that be of itself whose very Nature and <hi>Idea</hi> importeth so much, then that not only This
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55305:31"/>
should not be at all, but also some other thing should be of itself, whose nature imports no such matter. Wherefore it is most easie and most suitable to the Dictates of our own Faculties to admit <hi>the Existence of God.</hi> From whence we are enabled to give a rational account of the most considerable Objects that fall under our Contemplation. For if any man will dare to assert <hi>That Matter exists of it self,</hi> his Assertion is at randome, nor can he render any Reason for it, there being no such thing conteined in the <hi>Idea</hi> thereof. But if he asserts <hi>God to exist,</hi> and any should further demand How it comes to pass, the very <hi>Idea of God</hi> represents his Nature to be such, <hi>that he cannot fail to be.</hi> For the <hi>Idea of the most Absolute and Perfect Essence</hi> cannot but represent it to our minds to be such as has <hi>the most Absolute and Perfect relation to Existence.</hi> From whence it follows, if we believe our own Faculties, <hi>That he does exist.</hi> Otherwise, when our Faculties tell us That <hi>Necessary Existence</hi> belongs to him, we shall notwithstanding affirm That it does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto him, (as certainly it does not, if he exist not at all;) which is a palpable Contradiction.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But what a madness were it in a man to deny the <hi>free Dictates of his own Reason</hi> in a Point not only so <hi>plain</hi> in itself but so <hi>serviceable</hi> and <hi>delightfull</hi> in the <hi>Contemplation</hi> of the Works of <hi>Nature</hi> and that <hi>Corporeal Matter</hi> of which they are made? For as for the Existence of the <hi>very Substance of Matter,</hi> we cannot be at a loss in the search of the <hi>Cause</hi> thereof, though it contein no reason of its Existence in its <hi>Idea.</hi> For though every part thereof be independent of the rest and separable, and therefore there might have been a <hi>Want</hi> of <hi>Matter</hi> in the world, or it may be an <hi>Overplus</hi>; yet neither of these have fallen out: but how <hi>Matter</hi> came to be produced <hi>such,</hi> and <hi>so much,</hi> as it is, we have already found out a true and sufficient Cause, <hi>an Omnipotent Deity,</hi> that can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any thing that implies no Contradiction; and such is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction or Emission of <hi>Matter</hi> into Being.</p>

               <p>BUT we proceed to that which is most curious and admirable, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>The Contrivance of this Matter into such various forms of living Creatures,</hi> wherein there is such excellent and accurate Wisdome and Skill discovered, that it is utterly impossible that <hi>the mere motion of the Matter</hi> should ever reduce it, without an Intellectual Guide, into such perfect <hi>form</hi> and <hi>order.</hi> But to call the <hi>First Cause</hi> of all this, <hi>Nature</hi> rather then <hi>God,</hi> is to talk either very ignorantly or very humorsomely.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55305:31"/>
For if they make <hi>Nature</hi> a <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>unknowing</hi> Principle, how can she keep so constant a tenor of such cunning artifice in all kinds of living Creatures? But if they will admit in her <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Skill,</hi> it is then a frivolous and an humorsome controversie, whether the First Principle of all things should be deemed a <hi>God</hi> or a <hi>Goddess,</hi> and be called <hi>Deus</hi> or <hi>Natura.</hi> But they that are not wilfully ignorant, may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>That there is That Order and Contrivance in the works of Nature,</hi> that the First Original cannot but be <hi>Intellectual</hi> or <hi>Rational</hi>; and <hi>That all things are ordered for the best purpose and greatest happiness of the Creation.</hi> So that what we find in the <hi>Idea of God,</hi> that is, <hi>Infinite Wisdome and Goodness,</hi> we find also reflected from <hi>the Objects of Nature,</hi> and can thence with a great deal of the highest Devotion and pleasure, both further confirm that <hi>Innate Notion</hi> we have of God, and ease our Minds in resting in so full and sufficient a Cause of those exquisitely-fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Phaenomena</hi> that daily appear unto us in the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And verily the <hi>Species</hi> of things are so excellently-well provided for, that it has extorted an acknowledgment of a <hi>General Providence</hi> even from such men, as if their <hi>Intellectuals</hi> would have permitted them, their <hi>Morals</hi> would scarcely have upheld them from sinking into the dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest degree of <hi>Atheisme.</hi> But seeing things so framed in Nature as they are, they could not but affirm That they came from an <hi>Intellectual Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> which is <hi>God</hi>; allowing him an ineffable happiness in contemplating of Himself and His own <hi>Wisdome</hi> in forming of the World and the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kinds of Creatures therein; but phansying him withall so <hi>fatally</hi> affixed to his own seat, that he cannot bow himself to look so low as to take notice of any Particular or Personal carriages of men, nor stretch forth his arm either to <hi>reward</hi> or <hi>punish</hi> them. An Opinion that seems either to arise out of a desperate inability of giving a Reason of sundry accidents that happen to particular Creatures in the world, or else out of a tender regard to their own Interest; they being afraid of any other God then such as they have promised themselves will act nothing above or contrary to the ordinary and known course of Nature, which, as they think, is a very certain assurance of future Impunity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But to me it seems impossible that so excellent a Being as the Deity is, should be ignorant of any thing that implies no Contradiction to be known. And therefore our Second Assertion shall be, <hi>That there is a very exquisite Particular Providence reaching to every Individual thing or Person in the world:</hi> It being as easie for God to see <hi>all</hi> things, as to see <hi>any one</hi> thing; his <hi>Perception</hi> being <hi>Infinite,</hi> and therefore <hi>Undistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable</hi> and <hi>Indefatigable.</hi> Now his <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> being no less im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense, it will necessarily follow That there is not any thing that befalls the meanest Creature in the whole Creation, but that it was suitable to the <hi>Goodness</hi> of God either to <hi>cause</hi> it or <hi>permit</hi> it. For though it may seem at the present harsh to that particular Being, yet at the length it may prove for its greater Advantage; at least it may be deemed good for the Universe, as <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> solidly and judiciously ever and anon does suggest: and I think he is but a shallow Philosopher that cannot maintain this Cause against all Atheistical surmises and cavills whatsoever.</p>

               <p n="1">1. MY Third Assertion is, <hi>That there are Particular Spirits or Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Substances.</hi> Which will easily flow from what is so firmly proved already, <hi>That there is one Omnipotent, Omniscient and infinitely-Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign Spirit, which we call</hi> GOD: who therefore acting according to his nature, we cannot doubt but that he has created innumerable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Spirits to enjoy themselves and their Creatour. Which are either <hi>purely Immaterial,</hi> having no communion at all with Matter, with the Greeks again divide into <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, into pure <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects</hi> or <hi>Minds</hi> and simple <hi>Unities:</hi> or else such as (although according to their very <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Essence</hi> they be <hi>Immaterial,</hi> yet) have <hi>a propertie of being vitally united with, and also affected by, the Matter.</hi> To these Spirits, for want of a better term, I must take the boldness to abuse a known word to a greater latitude of sense, and give the name of <hi>Souls</hi> to them all, because they do vitally actuate the <hi>Matter,</hi> be it <hi>Aethereal, Aereal,</hi> or <hi>Terrestrial.</hi> Whether there be not also a middle sort betwixt these <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>pure Intellects,</hi> a man may well doubt, which differ from <hi>Intellect</hi> in having an immediate power of moving the <hi>Matter,</hi> and from <hi>Souls</hi> in not being vitally joined therewith, but acting merely as <hi>Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent Formes,</hi> such as the <hi>Aristoteleans</hi> phansie their <hi>Intelligencies</hi> to be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the Existence of the <hi>Three first Orders</hi> we have intimated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready a considerable Argument which reaches all the Orders of Spirits indifferently. The last Order falls not only under the knowledge of more <hi>abstracted Reason,</hi> but also under <hi>Experience</hi> it self. For that there is a <hi>Spirit</hi> in the Body of Man is evident to us, because we find such <note n="*" place="margin">See my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise <hi>Of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul,</hi> Book 2. chap. 2, 4, 5, 6.</note> Operations in us as are incompetible to <hi>Matter,</hi> if we more closely and considerately examine them. This Spirit that thus acts in us is called a <hi>Soul.</hi> But that there is some such analogical Principle in the Aereal or Aethereal <hi>Genii,</hi> the actions and conditions of some of them do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm. For if their Nature were not such as we have described, that is, if they did not inhabit and vitally actuate corporeal Vehicles, how could they ever sin or fall? For it is out of the conjunction of these two Principles, <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Vehicle,</hi> that there ever could be brought in any inward <hi>Temptation, Distraction</hi> or <hi>Confusion</hi> in any of the Orders of the <hi>Genii</hi> or Angels. But <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Simple Abstract</hi> Beings seem utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Impassible,</hi> and therefore <hi>Impeccable.</hi> Wherefore it is very highly probable That all <hi>fallen Angels,</hi> which we ordinarily call <hi>Devils,</hi> are of the <hi>Fourth Order</hi> of Spirits which we have described.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:55305:32"/>3. Which Spirits of the <hi>Genii,</hi> fallen or not fallen, notoriously differ from these Spirits of men, in that they are not capable of informing an Humane or Terrestrial Body, and therefore bear themselves above them as a Superior Being, and out of their pride and scorn have ever since their fall, either by fraud or force, universally entangled poor contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible Mankinde in sundry performances of Idolatrous worship unto them; which they could not have done, if men were not <hi>lapsed</hi> as well as they. Wherefore the <hi>Pagans Superstitions</hi> and the History of <hi>Witches</hi> will make good that there are <hi>Devils,</hi> and that they are of that nature we speak of.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And I think this being evinced, no man will question but that there are also <hi>Good Angels</hi> to conflict with and moderate the <hi>Bad.</hi> For God will not let the great <hi>Automaton</hi> of the Universe be so imperfect, as to be forced to step out perpetually himself to do that which some Noble part of his Creation might perform; nor set those things one against another that are quite of another kinde. Besides, those Philosophers that have wrote of these things with most judgment, do not easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That there are any other created <hi>Intellectual</hi> Beings but such as are capable of being vitally united with some <hi>Vehicle</hi> or other. Which, if it were true, is nothing prejudicial to us, the admission of <hi>the Three First Orders</hi> being little or nothing serviceable to our design. And lastly, it is improbable but that, the <hi>Fall</hi> of the Angels being from a Free principle, as some <hi>fell,</hi> so others <hi>stood,</hi> and that there has ever been since their fall both <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Bad</hi> Angels in the world, in that sense as I have explained the Nature of the <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>Genii,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Bad.</hi>

               <head>CHAP.

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. WE add Fourthly, <hi>That these Angels before their Fall had a twofold Principle of Life in them, Divine</hi> and <hi>Animal</hi>; and that their <hi>Fall</hi> consisted in this, <hi>In leaving their obedience to the DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINE LIFE, and wholy betaking themselves to the ANIMAL LIFE without rule or measure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Fifthly, <hi>That this Rebellion had an effect upon their Vehicles, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55305:33"/>
changed their pure Aethereal Bodies into more Feculent and Terrestrial,</hi> (understanding <hi>Terrestrial</hi> in as large a sense as <hi>Cartesius</hi> does, which will take in the whole Atmosphere.) They have forfeited therefore these more resplendent mansions for this obscure and caliginous <hi>Air</hi> they wander in, and have now in their polluted <hi>Vehicles</hi> less of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> then the meanest Regenerate Soul that dwels in these Tabernacles of Earth: and that of the Prophet is most true of them, that <hi>their Sun is gone down at mid-day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Sixthly, <hi>That the Destruction of these Aethereal Vehicles was not an utter Extinction of life to them, but onely an Exclusion from the life and pleasures of that Supernal Paradise which they enjoyed in those Heavenly Vehicles.</hi> For that they now <hi>live</hi> and <hi>move</hi> and <hi>act</hi> is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, in that the whole World rings of their exploits and villanies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Seventhly, <hi>That the Souls of men,</hi> which are as much <hi>Immortall</hi> (they being <hi>Spirits</hi>) as those of the faln Angels are, <hi>are not devoid of life after the death of this Body.</hi> For as the Souls of the fallen Angels descended from <hi>thinner</hi> to <hi>thicker,</hi> without the loss of Sense and Life; so do our Souls ascend from <hi>thicker</hi> to <hi>thinner</hi> habitations, with the like (if not greater) security of <hi>acting</hi> and <hi>living</hi> after the Death of the Body.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Which we shall the easilier believe, if we consider how <hi>contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> and homely a thing that <hi>Organ</hi> is which is the ultimate and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate conveigher of whatever we perceive in the outward world (and which is most remarkable) in which alone the Soul has any <hi>Sense</hi> at all of any thing that arrives to her cognoscence. <note n="*" place="margin">See my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise <hi>Of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul,</hi> Book 2. chap. 7. sect. 16, 17, 18. and chap. 8. throughout.</note> Which (if it be not <hi>the Animal Spirits within the Brain,</hi> which makes most of all for us) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess with <hi>Cartesius</hi> I think it most probable to be the <hi>Conarion,</hi> then which nor <hi>Water,</hi> nor <hi>Air,</hi> nor <hi>Aether,</hi> nor any other Element else seems more Simple and Homogeneal. So that the advantage seems not to be in the nature of that Organ, but it is because the Soul by those lawes that brought her into the Body, has placed her <hi>Centre of Perce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> there.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Which little Pavilion of the <hi>Soul's Centre of Perception,</hi> being of so gross consistence as it is, and becoming thereby less <hi>Passive</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable</hi>; it was very requisite that there should be that curious frame of the external Organs of the <hi>Eye,</hi> the <hi>Ear,</hi> the <hi>Nose</hi> and other parts, to strengthen those motions and impressions that they transmit; so that they may be able forcibly enough to strike upon the <hi>Conarion,</hi> or at least strike through the Organs, and penetrate to the <hi>Animal Spirits in the Brain,</hi> supposing them the most inward and immediate Organ of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. And that the Conformation of the external Organs of Sense is such, that they are to admiration fitted to this end, is a thing so well known amongst the Anatomists, that I need not insist on the proof of it: as it is also among Physitians, That none of the external Organs have any Sense at all in them, no more then an <hi>Acousticon</hi> or a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>optrick</hi> glass. From whence is discovered the Unreasonableness of their Despair, that conceit that when the Soul is devested of her <hi>Organical Body,</hi> she can have no <hi>Sense</hi> nor <hi>Perception</hi> of any thing. For this <hi>curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55305:33"/>
Organization</hi> tends to nothing else but the proportionating the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of Motion to the difficulty of its passage through the <hi>Nerves,</hi> or to the grossness of the consistency of the <hi>Conarion.</hi> Which Organical contrivance therefore may not be at all needfull in the Soul separate from the Body, the <hi>Centre of Perception</hi> being placed bare in a more tender and passive Element, such as <hi>Air, Aether,</hi> and the like. So that it will be the greatest wonder in the world, that the Soul should <hi>sleep</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death, so small a thing being able to <hi>waken</hi> her.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Besides, it is not Unreasonable but that She and other Spirits, though they have no set Organs, yet for more distinct and full perce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of Objects may frame the Element they are in into temporary Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization, and that with as much ease and swiftness as we can <hi>dilate</hi> and <hi>contract</hi> the pupil of our Eye, and bring back or put forward the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalline humor.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And not only to respect the Natures of Humane Souls but also the Will and Purpose of God, there was never any yet that pretended to knowledge in Philosophy, that denied <hi>the Immortality of the Soul</hi> in this sense which we contend for, but they deni'd first <hi>a Particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence</hi>; which for my own part I think it is impossible for any one to deny that will diligently and indifferently search into the matter. And therefore this Seventh Assertion may very well stand, <hi>That the Souls of men are Immortal, and act and live after Death.</hi> Of this Subject I have wrote more lately and more fully in my Treatise <hi>Of the Immortality of the Soul,</hi>

               <head>CHAP. V. 1. <hi>The Eighth Assertion,</hi> That there is a Polity amongst the Angels and Souls separate, both Good and Bad; <hi>and therefore Two distinct Kingdomes, one of Light and the other of Darkness:</hi> 2. <hi>And a perpetual fewd and conflict betwixt them.</hi> 3. <hi>The Ninth,</hi> That there are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite swarms of Atheistical Spirits, as well Aereal as Terrestrial, in an utter ignorance or hatred of all true Religion.</head>
               <p>THE Eighth Assertion is, <hi>That every Angel, Good or Bad, is as truly a Person as a man, being endued also with Life, Sense and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>; whence they are likewise capable of <hi>Ioy</hi> and <hi>Pain,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore coercible by <hi>Laws.</hi> And <hi>mutual Helps</hi> being able to procure what <hi>Solitude</hi> cannot, they must of necessity be <hi>Sociable</hi> and hold together in <hi>Bodies Politick,</hi> and obey, for either hope of advantage or fear of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. Out of the whole masse therefore of the <hi>Angelical</hi> Nature (taking in also according to <hi>Philo the Souls of men,</hi> be they in what <hi>Vehicles</hi> they will) there arise since their <hi>Fall</hi> two distinct <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> the one of <hi>Darkness,</hi> (whose Laws reach no further then to the Interest of the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal life,</hi>) the other of <hi>Light,</hi> which is the true Kingdom of God, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55305:34"/>
here the <hi>Animal life</hi> is in subjection, and the <hi>Divine life</hi> bears rule; as the <hi>Divine life</hi> is trodden down in the other Kingdom, and the <hi>Animal life</hi> has the sole Jurisdiction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now the inward life and spring of Motion in each Kingdom being so different, it follows that these two Kingdoms must alwaies be at odds, and that there must be a perpetual conflict till victory. Which we shall still more easily conceive, if we admit what is very reasonable, That <hi>the Kingdom of Light</hi> reaches from Heaven to Earth, that is, That as there are found on the same surface of the Earth Animals both <hi>wilde</hi> and <hi>gentle, harmless</hi> and <hi>poisonous,</hi> and men <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad, pious</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious</hi>; so likewise even in the same Regions of the Air, that there are scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Spirits of both Kindes, <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> Subjects of the <hi>Kingdom of Darkness</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom of Light.</hi> In the order of those <hi>Aereal An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> the ancient Philosophers ranked the <hi>Souls of men deceased</hi> whether Vertuous or Wicked, unless they had reached to an extraordinary and Heroical degree of Purity and Perfection; for then they conceited that they were carried up to those more high and Aethereal Regions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Ninthly, <hi>That there are infinite swarms of Atheistical Spirits, as well Aereal as Terrestrial, belonging to the Kingdom of Darkness, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther absolutely deny God, or at least particular Providence</hi>; and look upon the <hi>Divine life</hi> as a <hi>tedious</hi> and <hi>troublesome</hi> phansie and destitute of all future reward: and if there be any present contentment in it, they reckon it amongst such as accrews to men mad and distracted, whose Imagination makes them many a fools Paradise to please themselves in; and so, say they, does this Religious Lunacy to them that are tainted with it; it having neither any real Object nor solid fruits but what a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled Phansy mocks their superstitious minds withall. And though these Rebels may be well enough seen in the knowledge of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Mathematical</hi> subtilties, as also in all manner of Craft and <hi>State-policy,</hi> yet their desires being so fully lulled asleep to all Divine things, they can neither excogitate ought themselves, nor allow of any Reasons from others, whereby they might be brought off from that state of Darkness and Rebellion they are in, to the true worship of the living God. Nay it is probable they are obdurated to that height of boldness, that they think themselves able to grapple with the Powers of <hi>the Kingdom of Light</hi>; and that Superiority was theirs of old, and is yet their due, and may come into their hands again; and that their Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is the elder brother, though cast thus low by the envy of the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: which was the wilde conceit of the <hi>Euchites, Ophites,</hi> or <hi>Sata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. NOW, in the Tenth place, it is very uncouth and unusual that so resolved and unreconcileable opposition as there is betwixt the <hi>Two Kingdomes</hi> we speak of, should not end at last in some signal overthrow, with Victory on the one part or other. But besides, the undeniable right and justness of the cause which the Powers of the <hi>Kingdome of Light</hi> contend for, will not onely procure of Him that fits Judge an End to their toyle and conflict, but they will certainly carry it on their side, and that not onely in a still, Mystical, Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical sense, (which these Atheistical Spirits will have no sense at all of nor any perception; for they will resolve all into <hi>Nature, Policy</hi> and <hi>good Fortune,</hi> it may be into some more then ordinary influence of the Starres that begin to set <hi>a golden Age</hi> on foot again; so little would a Reign of righteous men upon Earth convince the obdurately wicked) but by a powerful Miraculous appearance, whereby they shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in their outward Senses; there being nothing else left for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence to work upon; the Divine life and touch of Conscience being utterly lost in them, and their Reason being perfectly lulled asleep to whatsoever concerns the true Knowledge of God and duties of Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

The <hi>Aristoteleans</hi> indeed dissent, but upon such weak grounds that it is not worth the while to confute them. But <hi>Cartesius</hi> his Philosophy is so favourable to this Opinion, that necessarily it inferrs it.

               <head>CHAP. VII. 1. <hi>His Twelfth Assertion,</hi> That there will be a Visible and Supernatural deliverance of the Children of the Kingdome of Light, at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration of the World. 2. <hi>The Reason of the Assertion.</hi> 3. <hi>His Thirteenth Assertion,</hi> That the last vengeance and deliverance shall be so contrived, as may be best fit for the Triumph of the Divine <hi>life over the Animal life.</hi> 4. <hi>Whence it is most reasonable the Chieftain of the</hi> Kingdome of Light <hi>should be rather an Humane Soul then an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.</hi> 5. <hi>His last Assertion an Inference from the former, and a brief Description of the General nature of Christianity.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. MY Twelfth Assertion is, <hi>That there shall not onely be a sensible and palpable Overthrow of the Kingdome of Darkness,</hi> (such as themselves shall feel with a vengeance, a whirlwind of destruction ratling about their ears, as I may so speak; the visible wrath of God seizing upon their external persons,) <hi>but there shall be also a visible deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the other Kingdome from this storme of fire and brimstone, from this fierce anger of God and the rorings and boilings of incensed Nature against the Wicked.</hi> For who can imagine the horror, the stench, the confusion, the crackling of Flames of Fire, those loud murmurs and bellowings of the troubled Seas working and smoking like seething Water in a Caldron, the fearfull howlings and direfull grones of those rebellious Ghosts, who besides the general defacement of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they heretofore took pleasure in, are in an unexpressible torture of Body, with an unimaginable vexation of Minde; <hi>Self-love</hi> then (the centre of the Animal life) proving the depth and bottom of Hell, as being inflamed and boiling up with the highest indignation and vengeance against it self, that when it had so many opportunities, it provided no better for its own happiness; being now convinced that there is a Special Providence over the Good, and that Righteousness has its Eternal Reward? For in that day shall all the Faithful renew their strength, and shall mount up with wings as Eagles, and be carried far above the reach of this dismal Fate; that is, they shall ascend up in those <hi>Heavenly Chariots</hi> or <hi>Ethereal Vehicles</hi> (the ancient Philosophers speak of) and so enter into Immortality and Eternal rest.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But if there were not this <hi>Visible deliverance of the Powers of the Kingdome of Light,</hi> the Powers of the contrary Kingdome, let them suffer what they would, they would imagine it a piece of blind and inevitable <hi>Fortune,</hi> as well as partial Earthquakes and Inundations and particular Conflagrations, which have destroyed Towns and Countries heretofore; and therefore deem their ill condition a fad <hi>Calamity</hi> indeed, but no <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</hi> Which will seem the more probable if we consider that <hi>Epicures</hi> and <hi>Atheists</hi> themselves admit of a <hi>Final Destruction</hi> of the World, as you may see in <hi>Lucretius,</hi> who speaking of the <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Sea</hi> and the <hi>Heavens,</hi> presages thus of them,

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. My Thirteenth Assertion is, <hi>That this palpable and visible Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which Divine Providence is to make betwixt the Evill and the Good, will be, and is, so wisely contrived, that it shall</hi> not onely be a manifest <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Confutation</hi> of <hi>Atheists</hi> and <hi>Epicures,</hi> and an undoubted Revelation of God's Existence and Soveraignty in the world, but <hi>in a speciall manner for the high Honour and Triumph of the Divine life over the Animal life.</hi> Which through so many Sorrows, Afflictions, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, scornfull Reproaches of the Wicked, their cruel and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous usages, shall at last with all the Embraces of her be enthroned in Everlasting Peace and Glory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And that this may be done more exquisitely, That Wisdome that contrives all for the best, was to lay aside all those things that seem so goodly and precious to the <hi>Animal</hi> life, such as are, The <hi>outward Power</hi> and <hi>Pompe</hi> of the world, <hi>Highness of Rank, Transcendency in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Knowledge, Beauty, Birth, bodily Strength,</hi> or whatsoever <hi>the Animal life,</hi> divided from <hi>the Divine,</hi> takes pleasure in, and can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form by it self: all this, I say, was to be laid aside in the choice of that Person by whom this great conquest over the <hi>Kingdome of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> was to be atchieved; as it is written, <hi>He has no pleasure in the strength of an horse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm 147.10, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>neither delighteth he in any mans legs: But the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of the Lord is in them that fear him and put their trust in his mercy.</hi> Which I onely cite for illustration sake, it being undeniably true in it self, That God preferres his own <hi>Glory,</hi> that is <hi>the Divine life,</hi> or <hi>the Image of himself</hi> shining in his Creatures, before any Natural accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment whatsoever. Thus therefore it was to fare in the choice of <hi>the Chieftain of the Powers of the Kingdome of Light:</hi> As if some great Prince being highly displeased at the general <hi>Luxury, Rebellion,</hi> and <hi>Persidiousness</hi> of his Nobles, to shew how little he esteemed the <hi>Highness of their Ranks</hi> in respect of <hi>true Vertue,</hi> should take some one of the <hi>Lowest</hi> of the Commons, yet indued with eminent <hi>Prudence, Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Valour,</hi> and set him next to himself in <hi>Honour, Trust</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> in the administrating the affairs of his Kingdome: So the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty passing by those more Superior Orders of Angels, that his high esteem of <hi>the Divine life</hi> might be more apparent and conspicuous, was to make his choice in the rank of <hi>Humane Souls,</hi> and to lay the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon some one, who being designed to that Office from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, should win notorious victories against <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Darkness,</hi> and rescue at last all such as the Devil has held cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, into the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Lastly therefore (to make an end at length of my <hi>Preparatory
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55305:36"/>
Assertions</hi>) the <hi>main Mystery of Christianity</hi> consists in this, That it is a wise contrivance of Providence upon the lapse of Men and Angels, to slur and defeat all the Pride and practices of the Devil and his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, and to reduce all Penitent and Regenerate Souls to that Glory and Happiness they heretofore forfeited and fell from: Or, if you will briefly, but more significantly, thus; <hi>Christianity is that Period of the VVisdome of God and his Providence, wherein the Animal life is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably insulted or triumphed over by the Divine.</hi>

            </div>
            <div n="8" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>1.</hi> That not to be at least <hi>a Speculative Christian</hi> is a Sign of the want of common Wit and Reason. <hi>2.</hi> The nature of the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Animal</hi> life, and the state of the World before and at our Saviour's coming, to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into before we proceed. <hi>3.</hi> Why God does not forthwith advance the Divine life and that Glory that seems due to her. <hi>4.</hi> The First Answer. <hi>5.</hi> A Second Answer. <hi>6.</hi> A Third Answer. <hi>7.</hi> The Fourth and last Answer.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WE have now laid down such <hi>Conclusions,</hi> either so Evident from themselves, or Demonstrable from Reason, or so Allowable by the Authority of the wisest men that have been in the world and yet uninterested in Christianity; that, the hardest difficulties thereof being resolvable into these, it will appear that it is not only an <hi>Indisposition</hi> to all Religion whatever, but the <hi>Want of Common Wit</hi> and the laudable parts of a man, that keeps any one off, at least from being <hi>a Speculative Christian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There are only Two things more for a further Preparation to be proposed to our view, before we come to a Particular application of the several Branches of Christianity to the foregoing Theorems. The One is <hi>Concerning the</hi> Animal <hi>life and the</hi> Divine; The other is <hi>Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Condition of the World upon these times, and before the Prince of the Kingdome of Light began that great enterprise of redeeming of lapsed mankind out of the bondage of Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Concerning the First it is likely some will be forward to enquire, <hi>What is this Animal life,</hi> and <hi>what the Divine,</hi> that this must so pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pously triumph over the other? and why, if the one be so much more pretious in the eyes of God then the other is, does he not without so long <hi>ambages</hi> and tiresome circumstances enthrone her at once, giving her her due honour without delay, and mistaken and lapsed Souls that happiness they are capable of, without so tedious and irksome trouble?</p>
               <p>The rudeness and unmannerliness of this latter Question, or rather bold and unskillful Expostulation, provokes me beyond the laws of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to dispatch it before the former; especially we wanting nothing further to answer it then what is supposed in the very Expostulation, viz.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55305:37"/>
That the <hi>Divine life</hi> is more transcendently excellent and precious then the <hi>Animal life</hi> is.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But as Transcendent as it is, if we understand it aright, that of it which is kept from us, is not any thing of it self, but an high and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous modification of our own Minds, whereby we become unspeakably Good and Happy, and are made thereby capable of enjoying God, the Highest Good that is conceivable. But <hi>the Divine life</hi> in God is <hi>impas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,</hi> and cannot by any means be disturb'd, diminished, or incommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any way: and That Life in us, viz. that Divine modification of our Souls, when it is not in us, is not at all, and therefore by not being bears no calamity, nor indeed being in us does it feel any either pain or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, gratification or discontent. For it is the Soul it self that has the sense of all, and 'tis She that feels this <hi>Divine sense</hi> or <hi>life</hi>; but there is no <hi>Sense</hi> feels it self, else there would be as many <hi>Persons</hi> as <hi>Senses.</hi> Wherefore <hi>the Divine life</hi> it self is not injured, troubled, nor pain'd by any impatiency or expectance of that Honour and Triumph that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Secondly, That estate that the Souls of the Blessed at last arrive to, which is the crowning of the <hi>Divine life</hi> in them with Glory and Immortality, is so <hi>Excellent</hi> and <hi>Transcendent a Condition,</hi> that it is very just and congruous that no free Agent should ever arrive to it but through a competent measure of <hi>Tribulation</hi> and <hi>Distress,</hi> as a <hi>Tryal</hi> of that Loyal affection he owes to so fair and lovely an Object. And if the Waies of Providence be something tedious and tiresome in bringing the Souls of men to this haven of rest and quietness; yet because we are so certainly and highly rewarded at the last, if <hi>Self-love</hi> do not blind our eyes, we cannot but confess that the whole progress was very beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and decorous, and that things were carried on as they ought to be: as <hi>Aristotle</hi> notes of <hi>Poetical History,</hi> where laborious and calamitous Vertue ever at last attains to Victory and Glory. And therefore in that regard the Philosopher prefers the reading of <hi>Epick</hi> Poets before <hi>Historians,</hi> because they write of Affairs <hi>as they ought to be,</hi> but Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians only <hi>as they are,</hi> which do often seem not to be so well as they should be. But Fools and Children, as the Proverb is, are unfit Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators of things in motion and transaction, they knowing not at all whither they tend. And it is no wonder if the stupid World be much amuzed at <hi>Providence,</hi> till that great <hi>Dramatist,</hi> God Almighty, draw on the Period towards the last <hi>Catastrophe</hi> of things. For then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Heaven and Earth will ring with this <hi>Plaudite</hi> or Acclamation, <hi>Verily there is a Reward for the righteous; doubtless there is a God that judges the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is a wayward and impatient Temper in us, that we will neither expect nor approve that Method in the full course of Providence, which the most curious and judicious Phansies have set out to the great Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our Faculties, though but in feigned History: as if Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane contrivance could be more just and exact then Divine Wisdome it self. Wherefore I say again, That assuredly at the last, <hi>Passive and Perseverant Vertue</hi> shall ascend her Triumphant Chariot, and be drawn
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55305:37"/>
through the wide Theatre of the world in all imaginable pomp and glory.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Thirdly, There is not only a due price set upon the Reward by this long Trial and Probation; but there are <hi>Peculiar Vertues</hi> very <hi>noble</hi> and laudable that are exercised therein, which might for ever have lien asleep without this occasion: Such are <hi>Heroical Fortitude,</hi> unconquerable <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> sedulous and watchfull <hi>Prudence,</hi> dexterous and subtile <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and clear and solid management of <hi>Reason</hi> against the perverse suggestions or more impudent declarations of the Sophisters of <hi>the dark Kingdome.</hi> Besides, we are in a more sensible School of profound <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie</hi> and Submission to the will of God in all things, and have the opportunity cast upon us of so strong <hi>Trials</hi> of our <hi>Loyaltie</hi> in the times of Desertion, that the remembrance of that <hi>Fidelitie</hi> cannot but make us find our selves far more dear to God, and raise an ineffable Joy and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to our Minds, that we have had such Occasions to shew our <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> and <hi>Constancy</hi> to him whom our Soul loveth. Wherefore from the going on thus by degrees there seems to arise a <hi>natural</hi> accrewment of greater Happiness. But to require of God, that he should at once command the Soul into that state that it is thus kindly to ripen into in succession of time, is to expect that the Seasons of the Year should be thrown headlong one upon another on an heap, and that there neither should be Buds nor Blossoms (though they have their peculiar Use, Beauty and Fragrancy) but that it should be <hi>Autumne</hi> all the year long; as I have answered already in the like case. But the <hi>Divine Wisdome</hi> is the best dispenser of his <hi>Goodness,</hi> who to set all the Powers of Nature aworking, brings in Monsters as well as <hi>Hercules</hi> into the world, that <hi>Valour</hi> may have a proportionate Object. And were not the <hi>Kingdome of Darkness</hi> it self some way usefull, and did not some Homage or other to the high Soveraignty of Divine <hi>VVisdome</hi> and Goodness, I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, it would not subsist one moment, but be quite exterminated out of Being.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Fourthly and lastly, There being nothing detrimented but our selves (if we be detrimented) by this delay of our Happiness, as I have already demonstrated, and our selves being lapsed and revolted from God; it is very just that we do a very competent Penance in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard; that that Divine excellency that we are to return to, may not be dishonoured by so vile and cheap a prostitution, and too easie and sudden reconcilement. For though God be at once reconciled to us in his Son, yet it does not excuse us from undergoing a due order of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties before we enjoy the full fruit of Reconciliation. And this is no new Doctrine, but what the Apostles themselves have taught, <hi>That through much tribulation and affliction we are to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>; and, That <hi>whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth, and scourgeth every Son whom he receiveth.</hi> Therefore there is no returning to our lost Happiness or being received again into the favour of God but in a <hi>durable</hi> way of <hi>Nurture</hi> and <hi>Trial.</hi> So that we see sufficient reason why Providence should not bring on all that Happiness of the Faithful at once, which at last will fall to their shares; but use some <hi>Delay</hi> and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55305:38"/>
                  <hi>Circumstances</hi> (as the Expostulator presumptuously cals them) before all things be finished and compleated.</p>

               <p n="1">1. NOW to return to what we should have spoke of first, <hi>The Animal Life</hi> and <hi>the Divine,</hi> and to declare What they are, not in a scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Philosophical way, but so far forth as will serve for use and the guidance of our lives; we say first in General, That the <hi>Animal life</hi> is that which is to be discerned in <hi>Brutes</hi> as well as in <hi>Men,</hi> which at large consists <hi>in the Exercise of the Senses, and all those Passions that Nature has implanted in them,</hi> either for the <hi>good</hi> of them in <hi>particular,</hi> or for the <hi>Conservation</hi> of their <hi>Species.</hi> Which will be better understood, if we instance in some, wherein, as in the rest, the Wisdom of God in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is easily to be traced. Whence it will likewise appear That there is simply no <hi>Evil</hi> but <hi>Good</hi> in the <hi>Animal</hi> life it self; but that our undue use of, or immoderate complacency in, such Motions is the only <hi>Sin:</hi> which is plain in the outward Senses. But we shall chiefly, though ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry briefly, consider the Passions of the brute Creatures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The general <hi>Root</hi> of these questionless is <hi>Self-love,</hi> which though it sound odiously (as it ought to do taken in the worst sense) amongst men, yet it is a right and requisite Property of life in every brute Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. For they not being indued with the larger and more free Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Understanding,</hi> if that intense love which each bears to it self should have been equally carried forth to the rest of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, what a puzzle and distraction would it have made in every single Animal? care and solicitude being so redoubled upon external considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the behalf of others, that it would force them every one to be regardless of its own safety and welfare; or at least make them less able to provide for it, they having their Animadversion fixed elsewhere, and upon such as they cannot by reason of distance of place or like dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage conveniently succour. And thus their Affection would prove as well fruitless to others as unprofitable to themselves, it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directed thither nor concentred there where it may do most good, viz. to themselves; whom yet they are alwaies most able and most in readiness to help and assist, they being nighest at hand and most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to themselves. Wherefore it is upon very just grounds that every Animal should bear the strongest love towards it self, because it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55305:38"/>
able to attend its own welfare then another's, or can be attended by another.
<q>
                     <l>Nec tam praesentes alibi cognoscere Divos.</l>
                  </q>
There is therefore no Vitiosity in <hi>Self-love,</hi> as it is a mere Animal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but it is a warrantable Principle of life implanted by God in Nature for the good and welfare of the Creature.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And the <hi>Root</hi> having no poison in it, the <hi>Branches</hi> in themselves are pure and innocuous. Which <hi>Branches</hi> are all the <hi>Animal Passions,</hi> such as <hi>Anger, Fear, Sorrow, Ioy,</hi> all the necessary <hi>Desires</hi> of the Body, to keep it in Being, such as are <hi>Hunger,</hi> and <hi>Thirst,</hi> and <hi>Sleepiness.</hi> Nor does the effect or influence of <hi>Self-love</hi> rest here in providing for the Individual; but that <hi>Wisdom</hi> that works in Nature has so contrived it, that these brute Creatures when they seek their greatest content and pleasure, they do then the most serviceable act that can be done to the Universe, which is the <hi>Conservation</hi> of those <hi>Species</hi> of Animals which are so perfect, that they cannot be continued in the world without this manner of propagation, which is by union of Male and Female.</p>
               <p>It is not my purpose to make an exact enumeration of all the <hi>Animal affections,</hi> much less to declare the Use of them; in which Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence does as plainly appear, as in the Anatomy of the parts of the Body, and therefore gives Testimony that they are all <hi>good in their kinde,</hi> as being inserted into the <hi>Animal Nature</hi> by so Wise and so Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign an Artificer.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I will only mention some few of the more refined <hi>Passions</hi> that are observable in some Brutes: such as are, <hi>The sense of Praise and glory, The strength of natural affection, The exercise of craft and subtilty for self-preservation, Their real and effectual Policy for common safety,</hi> and <hi>an obscure Imitation of some acts of Religion.</hi> We shall not make any tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Excursions upon these Particulars; we will only name some Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, as a pledge of the Truth we intimate. As for example, That there is <hi>the sense of praise, glory and victory in Brutes,</hi> is evident in the <hi>Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock, Elephant, Horse,</hi> and in <hi>Cocks</hi> of the game. That there is <hi>natural affection</hi> in them to their young ones, almost all Creatures witness; but of <hi>reciprocal affection</hi> of their young to them that brought them forth the most eminent Example is in the <hi>Stork,</hi> whence <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is to do the duty of an affectionate childe to his aged Parent. <hi>Gratitude</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of another kind is very conspicuous in other Animals, in <hi>Dogs</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, who have often interposed their lives for the defence of their Masters, and have had so deep a sense of Sorrow at their death, that they have thereupon voluntarily pined away themselves and died. So that these very <hi>Brutes</hi> seem to have arrived to that <hi>Pharisaical perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> that reached no further then <hi>loving their friends,</hi> or <hi>doing good to those that did good to them.</hi> As for the <hi>Craft</hi> and skill in shifting for one, as they say, and saving a mans own carkass, though we might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in many others, yet I shall content my self in only naming that one Animal so well known for his wiles and subtilties, the <hi>Fox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. And for <hi>Political order and government,</hi> the exactness thereof in the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55305:39"/>
                  <hi>Commonwealth of Bees</hi> is not only noted by great Naturalists, such as <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> but vulgarly known to every Countreyman that has Hives in his garden; where he may observe, how some one Bee by his humming, as by the sound of a Trumpet, awakes the rest to their work; how fitly the whole Company distribute the several tasks of <hi>Mellification</hi> amongst themselves; how severe punishers they are of <hi>Drones,</hi> ejecting them out of their Hives; how loyal they are to their King or Captain, moving as he moves, and sustaining him with their own bodies when he is weary with flying; how wise they are to keep themselves from being dispersed in a storm of winde, by taking little pieces of Stones in their feet to ballast their light Bodies: which is also reported of the <hi>Cranes,</hi> though they be not agreed to what end; some affirming that the Stones they carry in their claws are to discover, when they fly, whether they fly over water or dry ground; for by letting them fall, by the distinction of the sound they will discern which it is. But I believe they may as easily discover it by their sight, and therefore I should rather think that the use of these Stones is the same with those of the <hi>Bees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. But that which seems more <hi>Political</hi> in the <hi>Cranes</hi> is this, that they have one Captain amongst them, who, when they rest upon the Earth, watches over the whole company, holding a Stone in one foot, that if he should by chance be overcome by drowsiness, the falling thereof might waken him: the rest in the mean time sleep with their heads un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their wings; but if any danger approach, the Captain gives notice by crying out, and so away they fly. This office of <hi>Precedency</hi> they have by turns, and that as well in the <hi>Air</hi> as on the <hi>Earth</hi>; and he that is placed in the van and cuts the Air first, in due time retires. As is also eminently observable in the <hi>Sicilian Staggs</hi> in their passing through the streight betwixt <hi>Sicilia</hi> and <hi>Calabria,</hi> which they were wont to doe in Summer-time to seek new pastures: He that follows lays his head on the hinder part of him that goes before; he therefore that goes first comes back into the rear when he is weary and easeth his head upon the hindmost: Which they do by turns, and so the weight of their horns proves no great impediment to their swimming.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That also is very exquisite <hi>Policy,</hi> which <hi>Apollonius</hi> in his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels into <hi>India</hi> observed in the <hi>Elephants</hi> while they passed the River; the least went first, and so proportionably the rest followed, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test passing over the last of all. Which order <hi>Damis</hi> his disciple and fellow-traveller disallowing as rude and inept, his master <hi>Apollonius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms him of the right reason thereof, shewing him how they were now in chace and hunted after, and being in retreat, according to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary discipline the strongest were to march last. Besides, if the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test had marched foremost, the weight of their bodies would have made the passage more deep, and more difficult and inconvenient to the lesser that should follow.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Wherefore it is evident that <hi>Political Wisdom</hi> is a <hi>Branch</hi> of the <hi>Animal life</hi> and such Vertues as are comprehended under it, such as <hi>Political Iustice, Temperance, Fortitude</hi> or <hi>Courage, a sense of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55305:39"/>
Fame,</hi> or <hi>Glory</hi>; with several other Affections that are contain'd in the <hi>Political Spirit,</hi> and which are discoverable in several other brute Animals, as well as in the <hi>Elephant</hi>: but I must not expatiate.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. <hi>1.</hi> That there is according to <hi>Pliny</hi> a kind of <hi>Religion</hi> also in Brutes, as in the <hi>Cercopithecus; 2.</hi> In the Elephant. <hi>3.</hi> A confutation of <hi>Pliny</hi>'s conceit. <hi>4.</hi> That there may be a certain Passion in Apes and Elephants upon their sight of the Sun and Moon, something a-kin to that of Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in man, and how <hi>Idolatry</hi> may be the proper fruit of the <hi>Animal life. 5.</hi> A discovery thereof from the practise of the <hi>Indians, 6.</hi> whose Idolatry to the Sun and Moon sprung from that Animal passion. <hi>7.</hi> That there is no hurt in the Passion it self, if it sink us not into an insensible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the First invisible cause.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THE last Affection we named was <hi>Religion,</hi> or rather the shadow of it. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> figure out the rising of the Moon by a <hi>Cynocephalus,</hi> who sympathizeth so with that Planet, that while she is in Conjunction that Creature loseth its sight, being blind till the Moon hath recovered her light: The menstruous flux of the Female is also exactly in the <hi>Interlunium.</hi> Whence the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Priests kept these Animals in their Temples for the more exact observation of the course of the Moon, and made them Hieroglyphicks to represent the rising thereof; drawing a <hi>Cercopithecus</hi> in this posture, viz. standing upon his hinder feet, and lifting up his fore-feet toward Heaven, with his face directed up to the Moon. And <hi>Pliny</hi> does plainly affirm that they do <hi>Novam Lunam exultatione adorare.</hi> Which yet I must confess I look upon to be no more an act of <hi>Adoration,</hi> then the fawning and leaping of a Dog at the return of his Master, or the manifold incurvations or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of his body at his feet. Whence the Criticks endeavor to give a reason of the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which signifies <hi>Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The same Author, amongst other Properties of the <hi>Elephant,</hi> saies there is this in him also, <hi>Religio siderum, Solisque ac Lunae vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio,</hi> a religious observance of the Stars, and Veneration of the Sun and Moon; and that in <hi>Mauritania,</hi> every New Moon when it begins to shine, the <hi>Elephants</hi> repair to the river <hi>Amilus,</hi> where, after a solemn purification and washing of themselves, having first done their saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Moon, they return into the woods.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the two great Luminaries of the world have a very strong influence upon all sublunary bodies is very plain, and upon some more peculiarly then others; and yet without any suspicion of <hi>Religion</hi> in them. For what <hi>Religion</hi> can there be in the <hi>Heliotropium</hi> that winds about so with the Sun? Or what so early <hi>Devotion</hi> is that in the <hi>Cock,</hi> whom yet <hi>Proclus</hi> will needs phansie to sing his <hi>Morning-hymn</hi> to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55305:40"/>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> or the <hi>Sun</hi> at the first sense of his rayes at break of day? Or what <hi>Evening-Devotion</hi> is that in <hi>Crows</hi> or <hi>Rooks,</hi> that a man may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve roosting on the tops of trees with their bills turned toward the Sun setting? The general life and motion in the world has (as I said) its particular effect according to this or that Animal. And so the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the <hi>Moon</hi> that is received with so much exultation by the <hi>Cercopithecus,</hi> with so solemn a shew of devotion by the <hi>Elephant,</hi> is notwithstanding barked at by the <hi>Dog,</hi> as the <hi>Sun</hi> is cursed by a certain people of <hi>Libya</hi> for his troublesome heat. But I think no man that is not very rash will admit, that that kinde of <hi>Ape</hi> and the <hi>Elephant</hi> do any more by their actions and gestures <hi>adore</hi> the <hi>Moon,</hi> then the <hi>Dog</hi> by his <hi>barking</hi> does <hi>blaspheme</hi> her.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I will not deny but in <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Elephants,</hi> and such like brute Creatures that bid nearer towards humane perfection, that the sight of the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> may sometime cause a strange kind of Sense or Impress in them, some uncouth confounded Phantasm consisting of <hi>Love, Fear,</hi> and <hi>Wonderment,</hi> near to that <hi>Passion</hi> which in us is called <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> So great power have the more notable Objects of Nature upon the weak Animal senses. And therefore though <hi>Religion</hi> be not, yet <hi>Idolatry</hi> may be the <hi>proper fruit of the Animal life,</hi> as is handsomly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable in the Worship of the Sun and Moon.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For what the <hi>Apes</hi> and those <hi>Elephants</hi> in <hi>Mauritania</hi> do, the same is done by the <hi>Idolaters</hi> of the <hi>East-Indies</hi> in the two Islands of <hi>Tidor</hi> and <hi>Ternate,</hi> where they sing hymns to the rising Sun, and pray to the Moon by night for the increase of Children, Cattel and the Fruits of the Earth: conceiving these Two to be the great Deities of the world, the <hi>Sun</hi> the <hi>Male</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> the <hi>Female,</hi> and that these Two begat the <hi>Stars,</hi> which they look upon also as petty Deities.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That they sought out a <hi>First Cause</hi> on whom the Order, Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and Government of the world should depend, proceeded from the Sagacity of the <hi>Superior Faculties</hi> of their Souls: but that they so vainly pitched upon the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> proceeded from the brutish ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and dull astonishment of the <hi>Animal Senses</hi> in them. Which Animal propensity and enticing Power of these Objects are lively set down in <hi>Iob.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 31.26, 27, 28.</note> 
                  <hi>If I beheld the Sun when it shined, or the Moon walking in brightness; And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth has kissed my hands: This also were an iniquity to be punished by the Iudge; for I should have denied the God above.</hi> Wherefore, as I said before, though Religion be not, yet <hi>Idolatry</hi> may rightly be deemed the fruit of this Animal passion, which is <hi>a natural Veneration of glorious asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing Objects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Not that it is any hurt to be sensibly struck with the most illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, but that we should not sink so far in or stick so fast there, as not to proceed further to the knowledge of him who is <hi>Invisible</hi> and cannot be seen with the Outward eyes of the Body. Otherwise <hi>Transportation of minde</hi> and <hi>Wonderment</hi> at the more noble Objects in the world is so far from having any harm in it, that it is an usual Property of the <hi>Philosophical</hi> and <hi>Religious Complexion,</hi> and has
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55305:40"/>
its great pleasure and use. As there is indeed some use and advantage in all the <hi>Animal</hi> affections; and therefore if we relinquish any of them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be for an higher good, we are made thereby more maimed and imperfect.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>1.</hi> Of a <hi>Middle life</hi> whose Root is <hi>Reason,</hi> and what <hi>Reason</hi> it self is. <hi>2.</hi> The main branches of this <hi>Middle life. 3.</hi> That the <hi>Middle life</hi> acts according to the life she is immersed into, whether <hi>Animal</hi> or <hi>Divine. 4.</hi> Her activity, when immersed in the <hi>Animal life,</hi> in things against and on this side Religion. <hi>5.</hi> How far she may goe in Religious performances.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WE have now competently set out the Nature of the <hi>Animal life</hi>: but before we pass to the <hi>Divine,</hi> it will be needfull to us to take notice of a <hi>Middle life</hi> or <hi>Facultie</hi> of the Soul of Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Animal</hi>; which if we might name by the general Principle or common Root thereof, we may call it <hi>Reason:</hi> Which is <hi>a Power or Facultie of the Soul, whereby either from her Innate Ideas or Common Notions, or else from the assurance of her own Senses, or upon the Relation or Tradition of another, she unravels a further clew of Knowledge, enlarging her sphere of Intellectual light, by laying open to her self the close connexion and cohesion of the Conceptions she has of things, whereby infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one thing from another she is able to deduce multifarious Conclusions as well for the pleasure of Speculation as the necessity of Practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. From this single Facultie or common Root of emproved Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge shoot out many Branches: but I shall name only some main ones; such as are <hi>The skill of Natural Philosophy, of Arithmetick</hi> and <hi>Geometry; the Power of Speech,</hi> whether merely <hi>Grammatical,</hi> or also <hi>Rhetorical; A capacity of Civil Education,</hi> and <hi>an ability of discoursing and acting also after an exteriour way in matters of Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This is a short Description of the <hi>Middle life</hi> which is neither <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> nor <hi>Divine,</hi> but is really (what the Astrologians phansy <hi>Mercurie</hi> to be) such as that with which it is conjoined, whether <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Bad, Divine</hi> or <hi>Animal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. For if <hi>Reason</hi> be swallowed down into the <hi>Animal life,</hi> it ceases not to operate there, but all her operations then are tinctured with that life into which she is immers'd: So that she will be active there, either in <hi>crafty contrivances</hi> for the getting of Wealth, or in <hi>merry wiles</hi> for the enjoyment of <hi>Pleasure</hi>; or else be plotting designs to satisfie <hi>Ambition</hi>; or at least be perpetually taken up for the getting of a necessary livelihood. Nor doth she contain her self within the bounds of mere dry <hi>Action,</hi> but, according to the Genius of the party, discovers her self in the Power of <hi>Speech</hi> and <hi>Eloquence</hi>: She enabling some to write very sage <hi>Political Discourses,</hi> employing others in framing out <hi>very curious Conclusions</hi> in Matters of <hi>Religion</hi>; others she busies as much to excogitate all the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55305:41"/>
                  <hi>Cavils</hi> they can against the <hi>Religion</hi> they are born under, and indeed against the whole profession of <hi>Pietie</hi> in general, endeavouring to make <hi>the Belief of a God and his Providence</hi> ridiculous to the world. Sometimes she further associates to her self the help of <hi>Poetry,</hi> the more winningly to recommend her own Conceptions to those to whom she communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates them. Hence are so many melting <hi>Elegies</hi> upon the unexpected death of some famous <hi>Beauty, Triumphant Songs</hi> upon <hi>cruell</hi> and <hi>barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Victories</hi> in <hi>bloody warre, Impure Sonnets</hi> to that polluted Goddess the terrestrial <hi>Venus,</hi> wild <hi>Catches</hi> that applaud and encourage exorbitant abuses of the blood of the Grape.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Nor is this all that <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Phansy</hi> can do, while they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired merely from the <hi>Animal</hi> life with a competent advantage from <hi>Education</hi> and <hi>Complexion</hi>: but they will also adventure to compose <hi>Devout Hymns</hi> in honour of the Saints, to the blessed Virgin especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, nay to Christ himself, and to the Holy and Eternal Trinity; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to us the Pleasures and Riches of <hi>Paradise,</hi> though they never came there, nor it may be never will do. And if these things may seem more slight, because <hi>Poetical,</hi> those more seeming Substantial per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances in solid <hi>Prose,</hi> I mean <hi>ardent</hi> and <hi>prolix Praiers, long</hi> and <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Preaching,</hi> backed with much affection and winning Eloquence, I must pronounce of these also, That they may, and do too often, arise from no higher a Principle then what we have described, and are the Results of such Powers as may reside in the <hi>mere Natural</hi> man.</p>

               <p n="1">1. AND now I have advanced <hi>the Animal life</hi> so high, by adding this <hi>Middle Nature</hi> to it, that you may perhaps marvail upon what I shall pitch that may seem more precious and desirable, unless it be some <hi>wonder-working Faith,</hi> whereby a man might cast out Devils and command mountains to remove and be carried into the midst of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55305:41"/>
the Sea. But it is so far from proving any such like priviledge that the Tumour of the natural Spirit of man would please it self in, that I am afraid when I shall describe it, he will have no relish at all of it, scarce understand what I mean; and if he do, yet he will look upon it as a dry insipid Notion without any fruit or pleasure therein. But however I will declare it to him as well as I can; and that nothing may be wanting, I shall First give a short glance at <hi>the Root of this Divine life</hi> also, which is <hi>an Obediential Faith and Affiance in the true God,</hi> the Maker and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of all things. From <hi>this Faith</hi> Apostate Angels and lapsed Mankind are fallen; but the Soul of the <hi>Messias</hi> ever stood upright, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding through the deepest Temptations that humane Nature could be encumbred with.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But this Holy and <hi>Divine life</hi> to such as have an eye to see, will be most perceptible in the Branches thereof, though to the <hi>Natural man</hi> they will look very witheredly and contemptibly. These Branches are Three, whose names though trivial and vulgar, yet if rightly understood, they bear such a sense with them, that nothing more weighty can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the tongue of men or Seraphims: and in brief they are these, <hi>Charity, Humility,</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi>; which, where-ever they are found, are the sure and infallible <hi>marks</hi> or <hi>signes</hi> of either an <hi>unfallen Angel</hi> or a <hi>Regenerate Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These we call <hi>Divine Vertues,</hi> not so much because they imitate in some things the Holy Attributes of the Eternal Deity, but because they are such as are proper to a Creature to whom God communicates his own nature so far forth as it is capable of receiving it, whether that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Angel,</hi> and so becomes <note n="*" place="margin">a divine Man.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <note n="*" place="margin">a divine Daemon.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is <note n="*" place="margin">a divine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.</note>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For such a Creature as this (and Christ was such a Creature in the highest manner conceivable) has conspicuously in it these three Divine Vertues, namely, <hi>Humility, Charity</hi> and <hi>Purity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. By <hi>Humility</hi> I understand such a Spirit or gracious property in the Soul of man or any Intellectual Creature, as that hereby he does sensibly and affectionately attribute all that he has or is or can do to God the Author and Giver of every good and perfect gift. This is the highest piece of Holiness, and the truest and most acceptable sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice we can offer to God, thus lively and freely to acknowledge that all we have is from him: From whence we do not arrogate any thing to our selves, nor contemptuously lord it over others. In this Grace is comprehended an ingenuous <hi>Gratitude,</hi> which is the freest and most Noble kind of <hi>Iustice,</hi> that is, A full renouncing of all Self-dependency, a firm and profound Submission to the Will of God in all things, and a Disgust or at least a Deadness to the glory of the World and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause of men.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By <hi>Charity</hi> I understand an Intellectual Love, by which we are enamoured of the <hi>Divine Perfections,</hi> such as his <hi>Goodness, Equity, Benignity,</hi> his <hi>Wisdome</hi> also, his <hi>Iustice</hi> and his <hi>Power,</hi> as they are graciously actuated and modified by the forenamed Attributes. And I say that to be truly transformed into these <hi>Divine Perfections,</hi> so far forth as they are communicable to Humane nature, and out of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55305:42"/>
real sense of them in our selves, to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>admire</hi> God in whom they infinitely and unmeasurably reside, is the truest and highest kind of <hi>Adoration,</hi> and the most grateful <hi>Praising</hi> and <hi>Glorifying</hi> God that the Soul of man can exhibit to her Maker. But in being thus trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into this Divine image of <hi>Intellectual Love</hi> our Mindes are not onely raised in holy <hi>Devotions</hi> towards God, but descend also in very full and free streams of dearest Affection to our fellow-Creatures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in their good as if it were our own, and compassionating their misery as if it were our selves did suffer; and according to our best judgement and power ever endeavoring to promote the one and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the other. And this most eminently conteins in it whatever good is driven at by <hi>Civil Iustice</hi> or <hi>Moral Honesty.</hi> For how should we injure those for whose real welfare we could be content to die?</p>
               <p n="5">5. By <hi>Purity</hi> I understand a due moderation and rule over all the Joyes and Pleasures of the Flesh, bearing so strict an hand and having so watchful an eye over their subtil enticements &amp; allurements, and so firme and loyal affection to that <hi>Idea</hi> of Celestial Beauty set up in our Mindes, that neither the Pains of the Body nor the Pleasures of the <hi>Animal</hi> life shall ever work us below our Spiritual Happiness and all the competible enjoyments of that life that is truly <hi>Divine.</hi> And in this conspicuously is contain'd whatever either <hi>Moral Temperance</hi> or <hi>Fortitude</hi> can pretend to. For ordinarily he is held <hi>Temperate</hi> enough, that can but save his brains from gross sottishness and his Body from diseases; but this <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> respects the <hi>Divine life</hi> it self, and requires such a Moderation in all the affairs of the Flesh, that our Bodies may still remain unpolluted Temples and meet Habitations for the Spirit of God to dwell in and act in, whether by way of Illumination, or Sanctification and Animation to interiour duties of Holiness. And as for <hi>Fortitude,</hi> it is plain that this <hi>Purity</hi> of the Soul having mortified and tamed the exorbitant lusts and pleasures of the Body, Death will seem less formidable by far, and this mortal Life of lesser value.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But the greatest <hi>Fortitude</hi> of all is when <hi>Love</hi> proves stronger then <hi>Death</hi> it self even in the deepest and most bitter sense of it: and not so much the weakness and insensibleness of the Body, nor yet the full carreer or furious heat and hurry of the naturall Spirits makes <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> more tolerable; but the pure courage of the Soul her self ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated onely by an unrelinquishable Love of the <hi>Divine life,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever design is imposed upon her by that Principle.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Example of this <hi>Fortitude</hi> is admirable in our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and transcends as much the general Valour recorded by the Pens of Poets and Historians, as the valour of those <hi>Heroes</hi> does exceed the salvage fierceness and boldness of Bears, Wolves and Lions. For a man to encounter Death in an exalted heat and fire of his agitated Spirits, is not much unlike a mere drunken fray, where their blood being heated with the excesse of Wine, the Combatants become unsensible of those mortal Gashes they make in one anothers bodies. But to fight in cold blood, is true valour indeed, and the greater, by how much more the occasion of the enterprise approves it self noble, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55305:42"/>
the parties are not at first engaged by any rage or passion. For then they sacrifice their lives but to a rash fit of Choler, or at least to, that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in them, <hi>Pride,</hi> which they for the better credit of the business ordinarily call <hi>The sense of Honour</hi>; else they could willingly upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoughts save themselves the pains and danger of the Combate.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But to speak of <hi>Valour</hi> more lawfull and laudable, which is to meet the enemy in the field, where their minds are enraged and heightned by the sound of the Drum and the Trumpet, (which are able to put but an ordinarily-metall'd man out of his wits) it is yet counted a very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and honourable Act, if a man in this hurry and tumult of his Spirits makes his sword fat with the blood of the slain, and mows down his Enemies on every side as a Sacrifice to his Country and Friends, I mean to his wife and children, and all that are near unto him. Which yet may be parallel'd with the Courage and Rage of Wolves and Tigres, who will fiercely enough defend their young by that innate valour and animosity in them, without help of any external artifice to heighten their boldness. But the <hi>Valour</hi> and <hi>Fortitude</hi> of the ever-blessed Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our Salvation has no parallel, but is transcendently above what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can be named. For what comparison is there betwixt <hi>that Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi> which is inspired from the pomp of Warre or single Combat, from the heat and height of the Natural Spirits, from the rage and hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an Enemy, or from the love to a Friend; and <hi>such a Fortitude</hi> as being destitute of all the advantages of the <hi>Animal life,</hi> nay clogg'd with the disadvantages thereof, as with a deep sense of <hi>Death, Fear, Agony</hi> and <hi>Horror,</hi> yet notwithstanding all this, in an humble Submission to the Will of God and a dear Respect to that lovely Image of the <hi>Divine life,</hi> wades through with an unyielding constancy, and this (which is not to be thought on without astonishment and amazement) not to rescue or right a Friend, but to save and deliver a malevolent Enemy?</p>
               <p n="9">9. We have seen how <hi>Iustice, Temperance</hi> and <hi>Fortitude</hi> are in a supereminent manner comprehended in the <hi>Divine life,</hi> which taking possession of the <hi>Middle life</hi> or Rational powers, must needs beget al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the Soul the truest ground of <hi>Prudence</hi> that may be. For this <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine life</hi> is both the <hi>Light</hi> and the <hi>Purification</hi> of the Eye of the Mind, whereby Reason becomes truly illuminated in all Divine and Moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments. <note n="*" place="margin">See further of this, Book 8. chap. 11.</note> Which <hi>Mystery</hi> though it cannot be declared according to the worthiness of the matter, yet some more external intimations may serve for a pledge of the Truth thereof. As for Example, in that it does remove <hi>Pride, Self-interest</hi> and <hi>Intemperance</hi> that clog the Body and cloud the Soul, it is plain from hence, of what great advantage the <hi>Divine life</hi> is for the rectifying and ruling our Judgements and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings in all things.</p>
               <p n="10">10. I have endevoured according to the best of my Abilities briefly to set before you <hi>the Excellency</hi> of that <hi>Life</hi> which we call <hi>Divine.</hi> But it is impossible by words to conveigh it to that Soul that has not in her in some measure the Sense of it aforehand. Which if she have, it is to her <hi>the truest Key to the Mystery of Christianity</hi> that can be found; and in this light a man shall clearly discern how decorous and just a

thing it is that <hi>This Life</hi> which is transcendently better then all, should at last after long Trials and Conflicts triumph over all; and that for this purpose Jesus Christ should come into the world, who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Finisher of this more then Noble and Heroical Enterprise.</p>

Of which this seems to be the sad effect, that the Soul of man had quite forgot his Creatour, being fully plunged and immersed into the very feculency of the Material world. For that Faculty in him whereby he is capable of Corporeal joy, which is the <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Cabbala Philosophica</hi> on Gen. chap. 2, and 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Mystical Eve,</hi> had grown so rampant and lawless, that it had quite devoured and laid waste those more noble and delicate Senses of the Mind; and had so intimately joyned him in love and dependance on the <hi>Matter,</hi> that his Soul having forsaken God her true <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Husband,</hi> by a lively adhesion stuck so close to this gross Corporeal Fabrick, this outward sensible Universe, that in this near and affectionate conjunction with it, she made good in the Mystery that which is said in the Letter concerning <hi>Eve,</hi> after she was driven out of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55305:43"/>
Paradise, <hi>She brought forth her first-born Cain,</hi> whose birth in the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical</hi> sense is nothing else but that false conceit that the reason of his name imports, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>I have got a man,</hi> or <hi>an husband, who is the very Iehovah,</hi> according to the most easie and natural mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the particle <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This therefore is the First and most Fundamental mistake of <hi>lapsed Mankind,</hi> that they make <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Matter</hi> the only true <hi>Iehovah,</hi> the only true Essence and first Substance of whom all things are, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge no God but this Visible or Sensible world. And therefore stop not here, but naturally proceed to the Birth of <hi>Abel,</hi> which <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> interprets <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>sorrow.</hi> Which certainly the Soul of man in this condition is abundantly obnoxious to. But the word may as well, and does more ordinarily, signifie <hi>Vanity,</hi> according to that of the Apostle concerning the Heathens and their Religion, that they were grown <hi>vain</hi> in their imaginations. And so that came to pass which the Author of that pious Book entituled <hi>The Wisdom of Solomon</hi> so sadly complains of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Surely vain are all men by nature, who are ignorant of God, and could not out of the good things that are seen, know him that is; nor by considering the works, acknowledge the work-master: But deemed either Fire or Wind, or the swift Air, or the Circle of the Stars, or the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Water, or the Lights of Heaven, to be the Gods that govern the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Charge is laid home by this Writer upon Universal Paganism. But it is but a just thing to give them a little scope to plead for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that thereby Truth may be the better discovered and the more firmly established, and the Natural state of Mankind, before Christ came into the world, be more fully understood; which is the present busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in hand, and the last Point we propounded by way of Preparation to our main work.</p>
               <p>The Crime they are accused of here is <hi>Polytheism,</hi> which necessarily includes in it <hi>Atheism.</hi> For to say There are more Gods then one, is to assert There is none at all; the notion of God, in the strictest sense thereof, being incompetible to any more then One. Wherefore the Heathen being <hi>Polytheists</hi> in profession, by undeniable consequence are found <hi>Atheists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. But here some of them apologize for themselves after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; affirming that they acknowledged <hi>one only Supreme Deity,</hi> viz. the <hi>Sun</hi>: and that the several worships which were exhibited were to this One, though under <hi>several names,</hi> by reason of the <hi>several powers</hi> or <hi>virtues</hi> observed in him. This is the plea of <hi>Macrobius,</hi> and he manages it under the person of <hi>Vettius Praetextatus</hi> very handsomly and wittily, reducing from either Properties of Nature, allusion of Names, the likeness of Statues or Images, the conformity of Ceremonies, or testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Oracles, no less then sixteen Deities of the Heathen (that to the vulgar seem <hi>distinct</hi>) to this <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> namely <hi>Apollo, Bacchus, Mars, Mercury, Aesculapius</hi> and <hi>Salus, Hercules, Isis, Serapis, Adonis, Attin, Osiris, Horus, Nemesis, Pan, Iupiter, Saturnus.</hi> And I doubt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55305:44"/>
not but with the like windings and turnings of wit and imagination he may reduce the worship of the rest to the same Deity; he having let fall an ominous word taken out of the mouths of the Ancients at the very entrance of the Discourse, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which if it be well followed, will not fail to make good That the Heathens worship was terminated upon <hi>one Supreme Object,</hi> which <hi>Macrobius</hi> will have to be the <hi>Sun.</hi> And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all, for a fuller confirmation thereof, with a double citation.

               <p n="5">5. That the <hi>Sun</hi> is the Supreme <hi>Numen</hi> of the Heathens, may be further evinced from the Ceremonies and Worship the <hi>Indian Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> did to him, who were also called the <hi>Priests of the Sun,</hi> whom <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus,</hi> that industrious restorer of Paganism, so loudly extols, and so far preferrs before the <hi>Babylonian Magi, Gymnosophists</hi> and all the Wise men of the world besides. But the circumstances of his entertainment there according to <hi>Philostratus</hi> is an argument only of their being more able <hi>Magicians</hi> or <hi>Conjurers</hi> then the rest of the world, not more <hi>truly Wise,</hi> as we that worship the true God must of necessity conclude. For what else can we gather from that black swarthy Page with a golden Anchor in his hand and a Crescent like the Moon shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon his forehead, that met <hi>Damis</hi> and <hi>Apollonius</hi> in the way, told them their purpose aforehand, and conducted them to the <hi>Magi</hi>? What from that ever-smoaky Mount, guarded or enveloped with a perpetual thick cloud or mist, so that these Sages could not be found without
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55305:44"/>
some such black guide of their own sending, nor their Habitation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, though there be neither man nor ditches to defend them? What from their manner of entertainment of this zealous Greek that traversed so great a part of the world to find them out? whom they received at a banquet where wine and viands were conveighed to the table without the help of the hand of any Mortal. What from their Hymns and frantick dances in a round by way of Divine worship done unto the <hi>Sun,</hi> when striking the ground with a rod, the earth would rise in waves under them, while they danced thus and sung their Morning Songs to their supposed Deity as he appeared above the Horizon? What, I say, can be gathered from all this, but that they were a Conventicle of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or Conjurers? though I will not deny but they might be the most accomplished Priests that Paganism at that time could vaunt of, and the fittest Instructers of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> whose purpose was with all care and diligence to restore the Heathenish rites, and thereby stop the growth of Christianity.</p>
               <p>And surely the Devil made <hi>Paganism</hi> as desirable and lovely as he could in those notable ornaments of Wit and Manners and other more miraculous accomplishments that were found in that person. But his constant <hi>devotions</hi> he did to the <hi>Sun,</hi> though they shew him to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry skilful and orthodox <hi>Hierophanta</hi> in the Pagan Superstition; yet his ignorance in Philosophy demonstrates him no genuine <hi>Pythagorean,</hi> but that he did craftily abuse that name and profession, the better to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his Heathenish design.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It seems those Spirits that the <hi>Indian</hi> Magicians and <hi>Apollonius</hi> were acquainted withall, were either very <hi>Envious</hi> or very <hi>Ignorant,</hi> or at least <hi>Philostratus</hi> that wrote their Story. For in the opening of their Mysteries such things fall from them as are inconsistent with the most Essential parts of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Philosophy and Truth it self. But as for this of making the <hi>Sun</hi> the Supreme <hi>Numen,</hi> these lapsed Spirits being haply as much concerned in the benefit of it as we Mortals (as <hi>Homer</hi> intimates,

it is not improbable but being fallen so low from the true God, that themselves make this the Object of their Worship from whom they finde the most sensible good, and are kept from that utter darkness that a sad fate at the long run may bring upon them.</p>
               <p n="7">7.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But not only this obvious Attribute of <hi>Unity</hi> is wanting to this Pagan Deity, but several others also that are as necessarily included in the Notion of a God: such as are <hi>Sprituality, Immensity, Omnipotency, Omnisciency</hi> and the like. For <hi>the reflexion of his beams</hi> is a demonstration that <hi>Light is a Body</hi>; and therefore unless all Bodies were <hi>Light</hi> or at least <hi>diaphanous,</hi> he cannot be <hi>Immense,</hi> but he must be excluded by other Bodies. And hence he is not <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> no not so much as in his most eminent Property. For he cannot illuminate both sides of the Earth at once, nor free his own face of those importunate spots that ever and anon lie upon it like filth or scum maugre all the power of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as <hi>Scheiner</hi> and <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> have diligently observed. He is also so far from being <hi>Omniscient,</hi> that he has no knowledge at all, a Body being uncapable, of <hi>Cogitation,</hi> as the <hi>Cartesian</hi> School judiciously main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and I have fully demonstrated in my Book <hi>Of the Immortality of the Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But <hi>Cardan</hi> attributing <hi>Understanding</hi> to this Luminary, writes more like a Priest of the Sun (as indeed both himself and his Father have been suspected for Magicians) then a man of Reason or a sound Philosopher. But that the charge may not seem incredible, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his own words. <hi>Cumque Sol luceat intellectu,</hi> saies he, <hi>qui ei
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55305:45"/>
est tanquam anima; si ab eo secedere posset Intellectas, non aliter luceret Sol quàm Terra:</hi> That is, <hi>And whereas the Sun shines by Understanding, which is to him as a Soul; if so be that Understanding should recede from him, the Sun would shine no otherwise then the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which he plainly makes <hi>Visible light</hi> and <hi>Intellect</hi> all one. From whence yet it would follow That the Sun discerns nothing done in the dark, and that therefore he is not <hi>Omniscient,</hi> and that a Glow-worm or Rush-candle are better witnesses what is transacted in the Night then he can be. For if <hi>Visible light</hi> and <hi>Intellect</hi> be all one, every new-lighted Lamp or Taper will prove an <hi>Intelligence:</hi> So vain is this Supposition, that the Sun is the supreme <hi>Numen</hi> of the World.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But there is another sort of Apologizers for Heathenism, that frame their Defence more cautiously, averring only in general That the <hi>various Rites</hi> done to <hi>Particular Deities</hi> were meant to <hi>One Supreme Cause of all things,</hi> though they have the discretion not to venture to name him. For the proof whereof they alledge, First, that when they invoked any particular Deity that was proper for them then to invoke, the Priests afterwards added an invocation of all the Deities in general, as <hi>Servius</hi> notes upon that of <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Diique Deaeque omnes, studium quibus arva tueri.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that all the Deities were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, there were <hi>Altars</hi> that were consecrated to them all in general, with such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions as these,
<q>DIS DEABUSQE OMNIBUS, and DIBUS DEABUSQE OMNIBUS,</q>
and the like.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that they had one common Feast for them all, which was called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or rather <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> notes.</p>
               <p>Lastly, The <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> a people more infamous for <hi>Polytheism</hi> and variety of Religions then any nation under the cope of Heaven, yet their Priests are observed more compendiously to do their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to certain Spheres or round Globes, whereof there was one in every Temple, but kept very close from the sight of the vulgar; the Priests reserving the knowledge of the Unity of the Object of their worship as an <hi>Arcanum</hi> only belonging to themselves.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But that <hi>This One Object of Worship</hi> was not the true God, but the <hi>Material World,</hi> the very figure they make use of does most naturally intimate; and I have noted above that <hi>Mundus</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Philosophy is one and the same.

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, That they account the World or Universe to be the same with the prime God or First Cause of all things.</hi> Him the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> worshipped under the name of <hi>Serapis</hi>; who being asked by <hi>Nicocreon</hi> King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> what God he was, the Oracle gave this Answer,

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THE last and best sort of Apologizers for Paganisme are those who profess one Eternal Spiritual and Intellectual Being, the Governour and Moderatour of all things. Such as <hi>Plutarch</hi> a Pagan Priest defines <hi>God</hi> to be, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Wherefore God is a Mind or Intellect, an Abstract Forme or Being, pure from all Matter, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intangled from whatever is passible.</hi> Which he sets down according to the mind of <hi>Socrates, Plato,</hi> and his own. The most subtil therefore and ingenious among the Heathen defend themselves thus;</p>
               <p>We acknowledge (say they) One Eternal Deity, infinitely Holy and Benigne, Omniscient, Omnipotent, which is the First Cause and Original of all things in the world, as well Spiritual as Corporeal; and that there is nothing in the world but what is a Manifestation of the Presence and precious Attributes of this one Deity. And therefore we look upon the vast capacity of the wide Universe as a most august and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55305:46"/>
most Sacred Temple of His Divine Majesty, who fills and possesses every part thereof: every appearance to our outward Senses, every motion and excitation within our own bodies, every impression up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Mindes, being nothing else but so many Manifestations of either the Wisdome, the Goodness, the Power, the Justice, or the Wrath of that One God; whose <hi>appearances</hi> we are every where ready to adore.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether therefore our Eyes be struck with that more radiant lustre of the <hi>Sun,</hi> or whether we behold that more placid and calme beauty of the <hi>Moon,</hi> or be refreshed with the sweet breathings of the open <hi>Aire,</hi> or be taken up with the contemplation of those pure spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling lights of the <hi>Starres,</hi> or stand astonished at the gushing down-falls of some mighty <hi>River,</hi> as that of <hi>Nile,</hi>or admire the height of some insuperable and inaccessible <hi>Rock</hi> or <hi>Mountain,</hi> or with a pleasant hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and chilness look upon some <hi>silent Wood,</hi> or solemn <hi>shady Grove</hi>; whether the face of Heaven smile upon us with a chearfull bright azure, or look upon us with a more sad and minacious countenance, dark pitchy Clouds being charged with Thunder and Lightning to let fly against the Earth; whether the Aire be cool, fresh and healthful, or whether it be soultry, contagious and pestilential, so that while we gasp for life we are forc'd to draw in a sudden and inevitable Death; whether the Earth stand firm and prove favourable to the industry of the Artificer, or whether she threaten the very foundations of our buildings with trembling and tottering Earth-quakes accompanied with remugient Echoes and ghastly murmurs from below; whatever notable emergencies happen for either Good or Bad to us, these are the <hi>Ioves</hi> and <hi>Vejoves</hi> that we worship, which to us are not <hi>many</hi> but <hi>one God,</hi> who has the onely power to save or destroy: and therefore from whatever part of this magnificent Temple of his, the World, he shall send forth his voice, our Hearts and Eyes are presently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected thitherward with Fear, Love and Veneration.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor does our Devotion stop here, or rather stray only without, but those more notable <hi>Alterations</hi> and <hi>Commotions</hi> we find within our selves, we attribute also to him whose Spirit, Life and Power filleth all things. And therefore those very <hi>Passions</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Wrath,</hi> on the former whereof dependeth all that kindly sweetness of affection that is found in either the friendship of men or love of women, as on the latter all the pompe and splendour of warre; these, with the rest of the <hi>Passions of the Soul,</hi> we look upon as the Manifestations of His Presence, who worketh every where for our <hi>Solace, Punishment,</hi> or <hi>Trial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor can we omit those more noble Communications of His and Heavenly emanations into our Minds, such as are <hi>Wisdome, Iustice, Political Order,</hi> and the like; all which, with the former and an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable companie more which we have passed by, the Religion of our Ancestours fram'd into <hi>Personal Gods</hi> and <hi>Goddesses</hi>; calling Wisdome, <hi>Minerva</hi>; Justice, <hi>Dice</hi> or <hi>Themis</hi>; Political order, <hi>Eunomia:</hi> to <hi>Love</hi> is to be referred <hi>Cupid</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi>; to <hi>Wrath, Mars</hi> and <hi>the Furies.</hi> That Power which shaketh the Earth is termed <hi>Enosichthon.</hi> The Sea they

call <hi>Neptune</hi>; the Aire <hi>Iuno</hi>; the Sun <hi>Apollo</hi>; the Moon <hi>Diana</hi>; the Earth <hi>Vesta</hi>; the Corne <hi>Ceres</hi>; Wine <hi>Bacchus</hi>; and so of the rest.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Of which certainly there can be no other Reason, then that the ancient Instituters of Paganisme were so Enthusiastically transported in the single contemplation of every Divine power or Manifestation in the world, that being rapt with admiration of the great consequence thereof, they were resolved in their Devotional thoughts and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to dwell on every one singly alone, and not to huddle up all those Excellencies in one general worship; they having so reverent esteem of every Attribute of God, that they thought it sufficient of it self to constitute a Deity. And therefore they understood by these <hi>Personal Appellations,</hi> whether Male of Female, (for God, say they, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>one and the same</hi> Deity under <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That manifestation</hi> of himself in the world, according to which they gave him a proper name, as if he were a different person; when as it is but with him as with the Ocean, who changes his name according to the Coasts he beats upon.

as <hi>Dionysius</hi> notes in his Geographicall Poem.</p>

And if they took into their Religious consideration the worship of the <hi>Genii</hi> or Spirits, whether such as whole appearance was so horrid and terrible that it caused <hi>affrightment,</hi> or such as whose benign aspect was accompanied with a more pleasing wonderment and <hi>joy</hi>; these they look'd upon also as eminent manifestations of that One Eternal Deity which runs through all things, giving life and Being to all, whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

The same Apology we may make for that <hi>Honour</hi> we do to the deceased <hi>Heroes,</hi> whose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble persons and refined Spirits the Divine excellencies more illustriously shone through then ordinary. For in truth we do not so much worship them as God shining through them; as he that bows to the Sun or Moon through a glass-window, intends not his obeisance to the glass, but to those Celestial Luminaries; nor do we bow our body to those Luminaries, but to God who to us appears through all things.</p>

               <p n="1">1. NOW according to the various appearances of This One Divinity, that puts forth it self every where, our Ancestors instituted vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Religious Rites and Ceremonies, appointed sundry sorts of <hi>Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> built <hi>Temples,</hi> set up <hi>Altars</hi> with several inscriptions, and erected <hi>Images</hi> proper and significative of that or this Divine Power, which at set times and places they were to worship. To which Religious Customes under which we were born we submitted our selves without being obnoxious, as we conceive, to any just imputation of <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. For we worshipped not those <hi>Images</hi> which were thus erected, no more then any other Nation does the Holy Volumes of their Law or Religion, when either they pray out of them, have them read, or use them in the administring of an Oath. For that reverence that is done, is not done to the Book, but to him whose Word it is said to be, to him whom they pray to or swear by: and those <hi>Images</hi> to us are not unlike the Religious <hi>Books</hi> of others, they being very expressive of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of the exertion of that Divine Power which we at any time adore. As you may see in the <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>Iupiter, Aeolus, Ceres, Apollo</hi> and the rest.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For <hi>Iupiter,</hi> who was their God of <hi>Thunder,</hi> as he bore in his left hand a royal Scepter, his right hand was charg'd with <hi>Thunder,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Poet,
<q>
                     <l>— Cui dextra trisulcis</l>
                     <l>Ignibus armata est —</l>
                  </q>
                  <hi>Aeolus,</hi> the God of the <hi>Winds,</hi> he was made standing at the Mouth of a Cave, having a linnen garment girt about him, and a Smiths bellows under his feet: at his right hand stood <hi>Iuno</hi> covered with a cloud, putting a Crown upon his head, as having given her Kingdome to him; and on his left hand stood a Nymph up to the middle in Water, which <hi>Iuno</hi> gave him to wife. Which Image is very significative of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Causes</hi> of the <hi>Windes,</hi> and so intelligible, if we do but take notice that <hi>Iuno</hi> is the Aire, that it wants no further explication.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Ceres</hi> was made in the figure of a country-woman sitting upon
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55305:48"/>
an Oxe, having in her right hand a Plough-share, and a basket of Seeds hanging from her arme, in her left hand a sickle and a flayle: <hi>Iuno</hi> the Goddess of the Aire and of the Clouds was on one side, and <hi>Apollo</hi> or the <hi>Sun</hi> on the other; intimating how the warmth of the <hi>Sun</hi> and kindly showrs are to second the labour of the Husbandman, or else nothing will prosper.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The figure of <hi>Apollo</hi> or the <hi>Sun</hi> was thus; His Image had a Youthful countenance: in his right hand he held a Quiver of arrows and a Bow, in his left an Harp; under his feet was a terrible Monster, in the form of a Serpent having three heads, <hi>viz.</hi> of a Wolf, of a Lion, and of a fawning Dog: on the Top of his head was a golden Trivet, and about his temples a Crown of Twelve precious stones. The meaning whereof, though it may seem abstruse at first sight, yet if you consider it a while, it very fitly sets out the nature of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and of <hi>Time</hi> whose knowledge depends on him, and of <hi>Knowledge</hi> which depends on <hi>Time.</hi> His <hi>Bow</hi> and <hi>Arrows</hi> signify nothing but the <hi>dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his Beams</hi> from so far a distance, whence he is called <gap reason="foreign">

So that it is apparent how strange soever the use of these <hi>Images</hi> may seem, that it was no other then that of <hi>Books</hi>; they raising our minds (and it may be with a greater advantage of devotion and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) into the sense and consideration of that <hi>Divine Power</hi> which we were to adore.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Wherefore that imputation is very unjust that would charge us with <hi>Idolatry properly so called,</hi> as if we did worship the Idols themselves. But to use <hi>Images</hi> in Divine worship, (there being that convenience of them which we have alledged,) we question not but that it is lawfull in it self, where there is no Command from God to the contrary. And where his Command is most express, as it is to the Nation of the Jews, yet it is very well known that there was also there a religious use of <hi>Images</hi>; as is plain in the <hi>Cherubims</hi> that covered the Mercy-seat, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55305:48"/>
the <hi>Brasen Serpent</hi> which they were to look up to in the wilderness. For through that did the Almighty exert his healing power upon those that were stung with fiery Serpents. <note n="*" place="margin">See further of this, Book 8. chap. 15.</note> For such Effects as these are not from Nature or Art, but from the efficacie of Religion, as the very word <hi>Telesme</hi> does plainly bewray. Now it seems to us a thing incredible that God should command any thing absolutely evil in it self, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore undeniable but that the use of Images in Divine worship is not in it self evil.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Nor does that which is mainly and most ordinarily alledged against <hi>Images</hi> in Religious worship (viz. That it is impossible to represent God by any outward figure) seem of any weight at all to us. For neither do we admit that these <hi>Images</hi> are intended for <hi>Figures</hi> and Representations of God, but only for the <hi>Sensible</hi> setting out to our sight the <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Objects</hi> of those <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Attributes</hi> which we adore in him: And if we did admit it, yet we have wherewith to defend our selves. For it we are not to use <hi>Images</hi> in Divine worship, because they cannot set out the Nature of God as he is in himself, we are not at all to <hi>think</hi> of him when we <hi>worship</hi> him; the <hi>Thoughts</hi> concerning his very Nature or Person which we frame of him (though haply they be not without some truth) having yet as little similitude with him whom we worship, as the Imagination of a man born blind hath with the glorious Image of the Sun: He feels indeed the comfortable Effects of his presence upon his body, but his Eyes did never see, nor can his Mind conceive how illustrious he is to look upon.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To this purpose the most witty, cautious and subtile sort of the Pagans apologize for themselves: nor are we to envy them, if they hit upon any thing more weighty and substantial in their Apologie. For Christianity is so excellent in it self, that we need not phansy any Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons worse then they are, the better to set off its eminency. Besides, the more tolerable sense we can make of the affairs of the ancient Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, the easier Province we shall have to maintain against prophane and Atheistical men, to whom if you would grant, That Providence had utterly neglected for so many Ages together all the Nations of the world, except that little handfull of the <hi>Iews,</hi> they would whether you would or no from thence infer, That there was no Providence over them neither, &amp; consequently no God; it being a thing incredible, that there should be any Providence at all in things of the highest concernment, unless it dispread it self further then into such an inconsiderable part of the World as some imagine. But that the Heathen were not so utterly destitute of means as some would make them, S. <hi>Paul</hi> seems largely enough to declare in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1.19, 20.</note> And that their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not so horridly desperate, he may perhaps seem to intimate from that favourable expression in his Speech to the <hi>Athenians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 17.30.</note> where he saith, <hi>God connived at the times of their Ignorance.</hi> But I had almost forgot my self, my design being not to apologize for the Heathen, but to answer what they apologize for themselves: which I shall doe very briefly.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>1.</hi> An Answer to the last Apology of the Pagans; as first, That it concerns but few of them, <hi>2.</hi> and that those few were rather of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, then pure Pagans. <hi>3.</hi> That the worship of Images is expresly forbid by God in the Law of <hi>Moses. 4.</hi> That they rather obscure then help our conceptions of the Divine Powers. <hi>5.</hi> That there is great danger of these Images intercepting the worship directed to God. <hi>6.</hi> He referrs the curious and unsatisfied to the fuller Discussions in Polemical Divinity.</head>
               <p n="1">1. FIrst therefore we are to consider that what has been here alledged in defence of the Pagans, concerns but very <hi>few</hi> of them, the generality of them being <hi>Idolaters</hi> in the grossest sense, as is manifest out of the complaints of <hi>David,</hi> Psalm 135. as also out of the Epistle of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> and other places.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, It is questionable whether those few, such as <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, Socrates, Plato, Plotinus, Plutarch,</hi> and the like, are to be reputed <hi>mere Pagans,</hi> or whether they came nearer to the nature of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, having been imbued with the Knowledge of that one Eternal Spirit which is the Creator and Governor of all things, by conversing with the <hi>Iews,</hi> or by conversing with them that had conversed with them. And that they had the Knowledge of Him by the communication of some such hidden Tradition or <hi>Cabbala,</hi> seems manifest in that these more holy and more expert men in Divine Mysteries amongst the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then taught also the <hi>Triunity,</hi> as well as the <hi>Immateriality, of the Godhead</hi>; I mean the First and Chiefest of them, such as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato:</hi> which being a reach above humane wit, and a thing so usefull to be taken into <hi>Christianity,</hi> is to me a strong Argument that it was none of their own invention, but that they had it either from those that were <hi>inspired</hi> themselves, or had received it from those that were <hi>inspired.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>The making of graven Images</hi> and <hi>falling down before them</hi> is a thing expressly forbidden to the people of God in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion where himself thought fit to appear in the framing of it; which is an evident sign of the faultiness of the Use of <hi>Idols</hi> in Divine worship.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, The pretended serviceableness of Images for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing the people and the setting out to them the nature of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power which they are to adore, seems very questionable. For the presence of so strange an object before their eyes striking the outward Sense so strongly, may rather hinder the inward operation of their Mind from more pure and genuine conceptions of God, then at all further them in the framing of them; and as <hi>Memory</hi> is too often lost by the use of <hi>writing,</hi> so the power of Imagination as to Divine things may be spoiled and enfeebled by these false props of external repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fifthly and lastly, There is a great danger, of which the Jealousie of God seems very sensible, that these Vice-Royes and Representatives
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55305:49"/>
of the Divine Majesty, as they would have them to be, may prove trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous to the highest Soveraignty, intercepting and keeping to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves all those Praiers and Praises, all those immolations and sacrifices that are offered by the people. For the unskilfull Multitude seeing the Priest sacrifice and all the people pour forth their devotions with their eyes fixed on the Idol, set upon some high place, carved into all the members and organs of life and sense so artificially that he seems to sight to be a living Person, are easily driven through the weakness of their wit to imagine him to be such indeed, and to adore him as a living and powerfull Deity, such as is able to doe them good or hurt according to his own pleasure, as <hi>Grotius</hi> well observeth out of S. <hi>Augustine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. But if this our Answer shall seem liable to a further Replie, I shall remit the disputacious, to the mercy of School-Divines, and the rack of Polemical Theology, my self being better employ'd in laying on a charge upon universal Paganisme so evidently true, that the craftiest and most refined wits of them all shall not be able to elude it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>1.</hi> A new and unanswerable charge against Paganisme, namely, That they adored the Divine Powers no further then they reached the <hi>Animal</hi> life, as appears from their <hi>Dijoves</hi> and <hi>Vejoves, 2.

               <p n="1">1. THat heavy accusation of <hi>Polytheisme, Atheisme</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> which was laid upon the Heathen you have already heard, and with what sleights of wit they have endeavoured to defend themselves, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that in the varietie of their worships, it is but one Eternal Deity that they adore according to the Manifestations of his presence who worketh all in all. The Charge we shall lay upon them now is not, I confess, so grievous, but more devoid of all shew of any solid Answer whereby they may quit themselves thereof. And in brief it is this, viz. That though we should admit that they did worship one Eternal and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal Deity, infinitely Wise, Good and Powerfull; yet it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>that they worshipped him only in such manifestations of him that nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest concerned the</hi> Animal <hi>life</hi>; that is, in such as were most <hi>dreadfull</hi> and <hi>terrible,</hi> or alse most <hi>pleasing</hi> and <hi>agreeable thereunto.</hi> Hence it is, as I said before, that they had their <hi>Vejoves</hi> as well as <hi>Dijoves,</hi> both which was but <hi>Apollo,</hi> or the <hi>Sun</hi> who is the visible <hi>Diespiter</hi> or <hi>Lucetius</hi>: but because he also sometimes by the soultry heat he causes in the Aire raises also Plagues and Pestilences, he was worshipped also under the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55305:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
name of <hi>Vejovis,</hi> whose Temple was of old to be seen in <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Image holding Arrows in his hand as being ready to hurt; as you may see in <hi>Gellius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The horrour of <hi>Thunder</hi> also made them worship <hi>Iupiter</hi> under the notion or title of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, of <hi>Iupiter altitonans,</hi> as the <hi>Latines</hi> call him; and the Scripture it self forbears not to call <hi>Thunder the voice of God.</hi> The fore-named Critick adds to this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as the Greeks would style him) <hi>Averruncus</hi> and <hi>Robigus</hi>; the latter whereof, he saies, is to be pacified for the security of our Corn, the other for the safety of our selves. But the former seems rather a general name belonging to every Divine Power that is to be attoned to keep off mischief, then to any one particular Manifestation of the wrath of God in the World. Such as is a <hi>Storm</hi> or <hi>Tempest</hi> at Sea, whom the <hi>Romans</hi> made a particular Deity after their Consul <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Scipio</hi> had escaped the danger.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Te quoque, Tempestas, meritam delubra fatemur,</l>
                  <l>Cum penè est Corsis obruta classis aquis.</l>
               </q>
               <p n="3">3. Such instances as concern the <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>gratification of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Life</hi> are innumerable; but some we must produce, that thereby you may the better judge of the rest. And it seems their God <hi>Pan,</hi> by whom, as his name denotes, they understood <hi>the Universe,</hi> was a very pleasant Spectacle to them, both by his picture, and other conceits they had of him. For why was he pictured with a <hi>Pipe</hi> in his hand and a <hi>laughing</hi> countenance? why were the Nymphs imagined to <hi>dance</hi> about him at the sound of his musick? but that they did acknowledge that all things in the world are ordered with an excellent Congruity and Harmony; so that the Inhabitants thereof, that is, the <hi>Souls of living creatures,</hi> which are the <hi>Nymphs</hi> here mentioned, being touched every one with the sense of what is most gratefull and agreeable to it self, are conceived to skip and dance for joy. That they meant the <hi>Material</hi> or <hi>Visible World</hi> by <hi>Pan,</hi> is apparent as well from what they write of his birth and <hi>amours,</hi> as from other observables in his Image.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For he is said to be the Son of <hi>Mercury</hi> or <hi>Hermes,</hi> which is the Divine <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Now the <hi>Universe</hi> being but <hi>one, Pan</hi> is rightly exempted from that rabble of Sweet-hearts that the other Deities are feigned to have had; for there is no body for him to love, only the reflection of himself from the Minds of men that contemplate him. This, when his Nature is returned most truly, and the Order of things and Ends of Providence are rightly understood, is his beloved Nymph <hi>Syrinx</hi>; if more rudely and brokenly reflected, his Wife <hi>Echo,</hi> of whom was born <hi>Iamble</hi> a tattling gossip full of ridiculous stories and old-wives tales, full of scoffs and cavils and misrepresentations of those things that are observed in the World. By which reputed Daughter of <hi>Pan</hi> may be well understood the false Sects of Philosophy &amp; vain Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions that ever abounded in all Ages, which though they may please the ignorant, yet seem either idle or impious to them that know better.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:55305:50"/>5. But it is most manifest by his Image, that they understood the <hi>Universe</hi> by him. For what could be meant by his <hi>acute horns</hi> and the Hispidity or <hi>Hairiness</hi> of his skin, but the <hi>Effluvium</hi> of Particles or the Rayes of things, burring out from all Bodies that act at a distance? which is most conspicuous in the Lights of Heaven, which are so far removed, and which yet we see, as also all other Objects of sight, by virtue of a <hi>Pyramid,</hi> whose <hi>Basis</hi> is in the <hi>Object,</hi> and <hi>Cuspis</hi> is in our <hi>Eye.</hi> These in general are the <hi>horns</hi> of <hi>Pan:</hi> and the bright <hi>Redness</hi> of his face denotes that colour in the Sky; as his prolix <hi>beard</hi> the <hi>streaming light</hi> of the Sun and Moon; and his being clothed with the <hi>spotted skin</hi> of a Leopard the <hi>Stars</hi>; it may be also the <hi>spottedness</hi> of the Sea and the Earth, the one with Islands and the other with Flowers. That he is partly <hi>Man</hi> and partly <hi>Beast,</hi> denotes the comprehension of all living creatures as well Irrational as Rational; and that he stands on the feet of a <hi>Goat,</hi> that the <hi>Species</hi> of things could not subsist without proclivitie to lust, of which the <hi>Goat</hi> is a notorious emblem. And that he is made <hi>laughing,</hi> signifies that the whole World is <hi>Res ludicra,</hi> as that merry Prophet <hi>Mahomet</hi> speaks; to whom we may adjoin the suffrage of the Poet who makes man's life a <hi>Stage-Play.</hi>

So they sacrificed a <hi>Dog</hi> to <hi>Diana</hi> for his bold barkings at the <hi>Moon,</hi> a <hi>Goat</hi> to <hi>Bacchus</hi> for brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing on the <hi>Vine,</hi> a <hi>Sow</hi> to <hi>Ceres</hi> for rooting up her <hi>Corn.</hi> Such obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reasons as these brought in an infinite number of Ceremonies, which will not be worth the while to run over. The <hi>Nature</hi> of the Deities themselves which the Pagans worshipped being a sufficient Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the sense and meaning of their Religion, and that it reached no further then <hi>the Animal life.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. We have named the most eminent <hi>exteriour Manifestations of the Divine Power in the World:</hi> we shall now give a few instances of the <hi>Interiour.</hi> And the most notable, I conceive, are those Two <hi>Natural Passions</hi> of <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Love</hi>; which Powers they adored under the names of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> The Schoolmen would call them the <hi>Irasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> and <hi>Concupiscible,</hi> to which Two they reduce the rest of the <hi>Passions</hi> of the Minde: but we cannot insist upon these things.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There are also other <hi>Interiour</hi> Deities, as I may so call them, such as <hi>Pallas</hi> or <hi>Minerva, Mercurius, Eunomia,</hi> and the like: all which reach no further then the <hi>Middle Life</hi> I speak of, and are the improvements of mans <hi>Reason</hi> in the <hi>knowledge of Nature, the discipline of War, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Iustice, skil in Trades and Traffick,</hi> the <hi>Invention of Letters,</hi> of <hi>Musick,</hi> of <hi>Architectonicks,</hi> and (if you will) of all kinds of <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> (an instance whereof you have in that Precept of the Oracle, that bad them double the Cube;) which because they may be in us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any sense of the <hi>Divine life</hi> at all, I think we may also venture to call <hi>Animal</hi> or <hi>Natural.</hi> For as for him that is the best accomplish'd in these, yet that of the Apostle may be still true of him, <hi>Animalis homo

               <p n="5">5. That <hi>the Religion of the Romans,</hi> in which we have chiefly instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced hitherto, <hi>reached no further then the Animal life,</hi> is plain. The <hi>Greeks</hi> differ'd little or nothing from them, their <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> being intended to Twelve of those Deities which were acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and such as we have named already. And for the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> it is evident also that their Religion was no better, if not worse; their <hi>Serapis</hi> being the same with <hi>Pan</hi> or the <hi>Universe,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the concession of his own Oracle; and their <hi>Osiris</hi> and <hi>Isis</hi> but the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Moon,</hi> Deities scarcely left out of the worship of any Heathens. It is true there is a People in <hi>Africk</hi> that <hi>curse</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> by reason of his immoderate Heat; but it is the stronger argument where the comfort of his rayes is felt, (and in what nation are they not?) that the rude people did as much <hi>bless</hi> him and <hi>adore</hi> him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The River <hi>Nilus</hi> was a great God with the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> too, as <hi>Ganges</hi> with the <hi>Indians,</hi> they both of them fattening the Soil by their overflowings. The Divinity of <hi>Nilus Apollonius</hi> also that rambling <hi>Greek</hi> did supersti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For such were the living creatures, Birds, Beasts, and Creeping things, to which they did divine honour; nay you may add Trees and Plants, <hi>Onyons</hi> and <hi>Garlick</hi> not excepted, as every one casts into their dish.</p>
               <p n="7">7. What we have said of <hi>Rome, Greece</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> may be made as manifest concerning the Religion of all the parts of the world beside, as of <hi>Arabia, Persia, India, China, Tartary, Germany, Scythia, Guinea, Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> and in the New-found world, as in <hi>Virginia, Mexico, Peru</hi> and <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silia.</hi> But it would be as tedious as needless to harp so long on one string by so voluminous an Induction; and it is more warrantable to be sparing then over-lavish in so copious and confessed a matter. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reads those Writers, which are numerous enough, that can inform them in this inquiry, he will assuredly find, <hi>That the Religion of the Heathen reached no further then the Objects of the Animal life</hi>; and that though they may go under several names, yet that they are the same things every where, viz. <hi>Wrath, Lust</hi> and <hi>Sensuality</hi>; or such things as are in subserviency to these, as <hi>Corn, Wine,</hi> and other Requisites for the necessities or delights of Man; as also those Powers that have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon these, as the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars, Fire, Water, Air,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We may adde to these <hi>Inanimate</hi> things, <hi>Eminent</hi> persons whom they could not but acknowledge as their great Benefactors. Such were their <hi>Law-givers, Kings</hi> and <hi>Commanders</hi> that fought their battels suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully; the <hi>first Inventours of Arts</hi> or any useful contrivance for the convenience of life. Wherefore the most subtil defenders of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Pagans, let them elude the charge of <hi>Idolatry</hi> as well as they

can, or <hi>Polytheism,</hi> yet they can never avoid the imputation, <hi>That their serving of God in the Heathens Ceremonies, is not any thing more then the acknowledging that Power that is able to gratifie or grieve the Spirit of the mere Natural Man.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>1.</hi> That <hi>Judaism</hi> also respected nothing else but the Gratifications of the <hi>Animal life,</hi> as appears in all their Festivals. <hi>2.</hi> That though the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were held in that low dispensation, yet <hi>Moses</hi> knew the meaning of his own Types, and that Immortality that was to be revealed by Christ. <hi>3.</hi> That their Sabbaths reached no further then things of this life; <hi>4.</hi> Nor their Sabbatical years and Iubilees; <hi>5.</hi> Nor their Feasts of Trumpets; <hi>6.</hi> Nor their Feast of Tabernacles; <hi>7.</hi> Nor their Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost; <hi>8.</hi> Nor lastly their Feast of Expiation.</head>
               <p n="1">1. AND truly that the absolute Transcendency of the <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> may be the better understood, I cannot here omit that <hi>Iudaism</hi> does very much symbolize with <hi>Paganism</hi> in this point we are upon. For though the <hi>Iewes</hi> were very right and orthodox in this, in that they did direct their worship to that One and only true God that made Heaven and Earth, and is the Author and Giver of every good gift; and that without the offence and scandal of <hi>Idolatrous</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: yet under this dispensation of <hi>Moses,</hi> he seems <hi>openly</hi> to promise nothing more to the people of the <hi>Iewes</hi> then the <hi>present enjoyments of this Natural life,</hi> nor threatens any thing but the <hi>plagues</hi> thereof, as seems manifest, <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 28. where the <hi>Blessings</hi> of <hi>obedience</hi> to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> his Law, and the <hi>Cursings</hi> of <hi>disobedience</hi> are largely set down.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not but that I can easily believe, that <hi>Moses</hi> himself understood the Mystery of <hi>Immortality,</hi> and the <hi>Promise</hi> of those <hi>Eternal joyes</hi> to be revealed by the <hi>Messias</hi> in the fulness of time, as also the meaning of all the <hi>Types</hi> that refer unto him; and that his <hi>Successors</hi> also in that nation, their <hi>Holy Men</hi> or <hi>Prophets,</hi> had some measurable Knowledge thereof: But my meaning is, that the <hi>Generality</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi> were locked up in this <hi>lower</hi> kind of <hi>Dispensation,</hi> and that <hi>Moses</hi> his Law in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals</hi> thereof drives at no higher then thus; as is apparent from all the <hi>Festivals</hi> thereof, they none of them concerning any thing more then the <hi>enjoyments</hi> and conveniences of <hi>this present life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. For as for their <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> they were but a Memorial of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this visible world, the belief whereof the <hi>Sadducees</hi> embraced as well as others, though they denied that there was either <hi>Angel</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi>; for there is not any mention of the Creation of any such thing in the external letter of <hi>Moses,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Appearances of Angels</hi> they look'd upon as only present <hi>Emanations</hi> from God, which ceased as he disappeared.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And for their <hi>Sabbatical year,</hi> as also the year of <hi>Iubilee,</hi> which
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55305:52"/>
was celebrated at the end of seven times seven years, besides that they are not without a reflection upon the Creation of the World, which was compleated at the seventh day, wherein therefore God rested; the other reasons, according to the Text of <hi>Moses,</hi> reach no further then the things of this present life. For as concerning the <hi>Sabbatical year,</hi> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept runs thus: <hi>Six years thou shalt sow thy land, and gather the fruits thereof; but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest, and lye still, that the poor of thy people may eat: in like manner thou shalt deal with thy vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard and with thy olive-yard.</hi> And for the <hi>Iubilee,</hi> it is evident that it had a secular use, for the releasment of Servants, and restoring of lands to their first owners who were necessitated to sell them. Those <hi>Feasts</hi> therefore were instituted in order to a <hi>Political good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Their <hi>Feasts of Trumpets</hi> and their <hi>New-Moons</hi> seem indeed to have an higher use, to call the people together to hear the Law: but I told you before that the <hi>Blessings</hi> and <hi>Cursings</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> were merely Temporal. And for their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> and of <hi>Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> they were in reference to what is Good or Evil to this life of the Flesh.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Their <hi>Feast of Tabernacles</hi> was instituted in remembrance that the Children of Israel dwelt in <hi>Tabernacles</hi> and <hi>Boothes,</hi> when God brought them out of the land of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> As also their <hi>Passeover</hi> was a more particular representation of the manner of their delivery out of the hands of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi>; as you may see <hi>Exodus</hi> the 12.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Their <hi>Pentecost,</hi> that is, the fiftieth day after the Passeover, in this they offered <hi>two wave-loaves</hi>; as upon the second day of the Passeover they offered <hi>a sheaf of the first fruits of their Harvest</hi>: so that those So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities respected merely the Fruits of the Earth.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And lastly, as for the <hi>Feast of Expiation,</hi> wherein the <hi>Scape-goat</hi> carried away the sins of the people and the evils deserved thereby into the wilderness; being, as I have already intimated, that those plagues or evils denounced in <hi>Moses</hi> his Law be but of a secular consideration, it is plain that this particular Ceremony in the Religion of <hi>Moses,</hi> in the letter thereof, reaches no further then the <hi>Pleasures</hi> or <hi>Aggrievances</hi> of this mortal life: It being reserved for Christ alone to bring the most certain and most comfortable News of that Eternal Joy which we shall be made partakers of with him for ever in the Heavens,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.10.</note> who was <hi>to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Death, and to bring Life and Immortality to light through the Gospel,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>1.</hi> The Preeminency of <hi>Judaism</hi> above <hi>Paganism. 2.</hi> The Authors of the Religions of the Heathen, who they were. <hi>3.</hi> How naturally lapsed Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind fals under the superstitious Tyranny of Devils. <hi>4.</hi> The palpable effects of this Tyranny in the Nations of <hi>America. 5.</hi> That that false and wilde Resignation in the <hi>Quakers</hi> does naturally expose them to the Tyranny of Satan. <hi>6.</hi> That their affectation of blinde impulses is but a preparation to Demonical possession, and a way to the restoring of the vilest Superstitions of Paganism.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WHat shall we say then? is there no real difference at all betwixt <hi>Iudaism</hi> and <hi>Paganism</hi>? Yes a great deal. For though they both seem to agree in this, that they neither reach further in their End then the gratifications of the <hi>Animal life</hi> (it being indeed incredible, that their Souls, that are so low sunk that they cannot see beyond <hi>this present state,</hi> should emerge to so <hi>high a pitch of Sanctification</hi> as is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by that <hi>life</hi> we call <hi>Divine:</hi>) yet <hi>Iudaism</hi> has the <hi>preeminence</hi> far above <hi>Paganism.</hi> First, In that those rich discoveries of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel are so exactly adumbrated and shadowed out in the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Types, that a man may be assured that they were prefigured by them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That the worship of God according to the Rites of <hi>Moses</hi> is more pure and devoid of all suspicion of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which the Religion of the Heathen was not, as has been already declared.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Lastly, In that God himself was the Institutour of the Religion of the Jews, whenas the Rites of the Heathen were found out and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed either by <hi>Angels,</hi> as some would have it, such as were the Overseers and Guardians of severall Nations and Countreys, (who if they were <hi>good,</hi> the Inhabitants of the earth it seems revolted from them, and corrupted their primitive institutions so long ago, that the knowledge of them never arrived to or hands;) or else at the best they were but the <hi>better sort of lapsed Spirits,</hi> or <hi>crafty Political men,</hi> or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and malicious Devils.</hi> And so far as History will give us light, all the Religions of the World, saving those of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> have no better Authors then those of the Three last kinds, as you may gather out of what has been already spoken; and too many of them, I suspect, have been ordained by the foulest and wickedest of all the lapsed crew.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For Mankinde being so much sunk and fallen from God by the temptation of the Devil, like a Bird or prey he follows his prize, and hunts there where his game is most, hovering over the sons of men, whom he having struck down to the earth, lets not his hold go, but having once seized upon them, keeps them as long as he can within his own power; it falling to his share to domineer over men as naturally as wicked men to circumvent and domineer one over another, I mean the more powerful and subtle over the more weak and unwise.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:55305:53"/>4. Of which the whole <hi>New-found World</hi> seems to be an ample Testimony; there being very few places in <hi>America,</hi> but such as were discovered to be palpably and visibly under the power of the old Serpent, their religious Rites and Ceremonies being as uncouth and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and more bloody and cruell then those that Witches are known to be tied to here. For the mind of these Apostate Spirits is, that the <hi>Remnant</hi> of the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> and <hi>Light of Reason</hi> in man should be quite obliterated, and that mankind should be wholy their Vassals, and that they should forget the Nobleness of their own condition, and stoop to whatsoever they require of them, which are commonly such things as become none but Mad-men and Beasts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And therefore it is a very dangerous and false kind of <hi>Resignation</hi> in those that would pretend to a more then ordinary pitch of Religion, to bid adieu to the Rules of <hi>Humanity</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> under the pretence of the exercise of <hi>Self-denial.</hi> For thus giving away their own Will in those things that are laudable and good, they give room for the Devil to enter and to possess them Soul and Body, and to drive them to the most vile, sordid, the most uncivil and ridiculous, nay the most wicked and impious, actions that Humane Nature is liable to; as is too much already found in some of that <hi>Fanatick</hi> Sect of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of crucifying the Dictates of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Humanity</hi> and every thing they find their Spirit carried to, smother that Lamp of God in them: and being thus got in the dark, are the scorn and laughing-stock of Satan, that sworn enemy of mankind the Devil; and delusive Spirits, like so many <hi>Ignes Fatui,</hi> lead them about in this bewildring Night that they have voluntarily brought upon themselves, by not making use of that Talent that God already had given them, but flinging of it away as an unholy thing.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This is true of several of them by their own Confessions; and things of a like Nature to these are evident in most of them, whether themselves will confess it or no: but let them pretend what they will, most certain it is, That <hi>that Spirit</hi> that leads them from the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> from the use of <hi>Reason,</hi> from <hi>common Humanity,</hi> from their <hi>Loyalty to Christ</hi> that died for them, and whom God has exalted above all powers and principalities whatever, either amongst men or Angels; <hi>that Spirit,</hi> I say, that seduces them from such indispensable points as these, is none other then he that seduced man at first, and would again bring him into a slavish subjection to himself by despoiling of him ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly of all those <hi>tender touches of Spirit,</hi> and warrantable suggestions of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Natural Conscience,</hi> or the laudable Customes of his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to act merely upon <hi>blind impulses,</hi> of which no account is to be given, that thereby he may be the easier possessed by him, and be hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to any vileness of wickedness, to any cruelty or uncleanness with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out stop or resistance; and that the <hi>Law of Christ</hi> being extinguished, the most <hi>foul</hi> and <hi>barbarous forme of Religion</hi> amongst the <hi>Gentiles</hi> may be restored. For the virulent enmity of this Sect against the Ministers of the Gospel is no obscure argument that they are acted by the Envy of the Devil, whose Kingdome already has in part, and shall still fall

more and more by the hand of our Saviour: whose <hi>Triumphs</hi> that we may see how <hi>just</hi> they are, we must not passe over <hi>Paganisme</hi> so favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably as we have, but discover the beastly and bloody Tyranny of Satan upon the Nations of the Earth in his more execrable Rites and Ceremonies, the abominableness whereof demonstrates That they had no other Institutour but himself.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Now how <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>universal</hi> his <hi>Dominion</hi> was before Christ came into the World, we shall easily understand if we consider that he had one Hemisphere entire, <hi>viz. America</hi> with the adjacent Islands; and this other wherein we live, and that contains those three great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents, <hi>Europe, Asia</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> (saving the little that that handful of the people of God did possess,) what of it was not his?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This Family</hi> therefore <hi>of the Faithful</hi> has in all Ages been, as our Saviour speaks, <hi>The light of the World</hi>; though never so visible and so spreading as after his coming: and it is not to be doubted but <hi>Wise men</hi> of several Nations communicating with the <hi>Iews,</hi> whether in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine</hi> or <hi>Aegypt,</hi> carried something away with them whereby they might better the Laws and Rites of those Countries wherein after they did for any time reside. So that if the Examples of the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of Satan, or the <hi>Impurity</hi> of his <hi>Institutions</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> be not so <hi>many,</hi> nor so <hi>heinous</hi> and <hi>abominable</hi> in <hi>these Parts</hi> of the World as in the <hi>other Hemisphere,</hi> it is not to be referred to any <hi>Tolerableness</hi> of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55305:54"/>
his <hi>Malice</hi> or <hi>Wickedness,</hi> but to the <hi>Efficacy of that Light</hi> whose ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance very oft is so gratefull and congruous to the Soul of man, that though it have been nursed up in vain and unclean Superstitions, and bloody and beastly Rites of a false Religion; yet so soon as a <hi>purer Forme</hi> is propounded, with confidence it closeth with what is <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and resisteth the power both of a bad Custome and an ill Master at once.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I speak not this as if the Knowledge of God in the ancient <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> had any such considerable influence upon the Inhabitants on this side of the Earth, as that we were at a loss for examples of what was sufficiently abominable amongst the nations; but that if we may seem to have been in any <hi>more tolerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> then the <hi>Americans,</hi> that it may not be imputed to any <hi>Remisness</hi> in that Hater and Contemner of Mankind, but to the <hi>Providence of God</hi> and the <hi>Power of Truth,</hi> the light whereof at so great distances, and so many reflections and refractions, is not without some Effect.</p>

Her lascivious and obscene Ceremonies.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THE First that comes to my thoughts is the Mother of the Deifyed Rabble, <hi>Cybele, mater Deorum,</hi> the celebration of whose Rites had so much villany and debauchedness in it, that the more ingenuous of the <hi>Roman</hi> were ashamed of the Office. The Priests clad in party-coloured coats danced antick dances, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about their heads ilfavouredly, and keeping time with their hands upon their breasts to the tune of the tabret, pipe and cymbals, footed it thus from house to house through the streets, begging mony of the people to the use of <hi>Cybele</hi> the Mother of the Gods. From whence they were called <hi>Metragyrtae</hi> as well as <hi>Menagyrtae</hi>; but
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55305:55"/>
they were such noted Beasts and Drunkards, that their gross misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours gave an occasion to that by-word, <hi>Circulator Cybeleius,</hi> whereby they understood a lewd dissolute villain, given wholly up to drunkenness and debauchedness.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I cannot name the <hi>Bacchanalia,</hi> but your phansies will prevent me, where it seems (and it is the complaint of that sober Writer <hi>Livy</hi>) that though the Title of the Feast be <hi>Bacchus,</hi> yet the conlusion is promiscuous Lust and <hi>Venery,</hi> nay violent force and fightings and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Murders. For the opportunities of Night, and the mixture of men and women together of several ages and orders, and the incitation of Lust through the intemperance of Wine made them transgress all the bounds of Shame and Modesty; so that with unresistible violence they would force whom they could, and falling out about their prey, wound and kill one another; the noise and grones of the dying parties and the shreeks of the ravished women not being heard by reason of the rattling and tinckling of their Tabrets and Cymbals which sounded all the while: so that it seems the Romans as well as the <hi>Sicyonii</hi> worshipped <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But to let that goe uninterpreted;</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Priapus,</hi> what a filthy Deity was he? His Image so obscene, as you may see in the Poets, that no chast pen would describe it after them, though their description be but a testimony of the truth of the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. To this impure God they sacrificed an <hi>Asse:</hi> the reason <hi>Ovid</hi> in his <hi>Fastorum</hi> tells at large; but it is so lascivious, that it will be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent only to have hinted it. It seems the God was in love with the Nymph <hi>Lotis,</hi> who lying with the rest of the Rural Deities in the grass in a moon-shine night, and being fallen asleep, <hi>Priapus</hi> by stealth intended to have deflowred her: but when he was over-near the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrating of his Villany, old <hi>Silenus</hi> his Asse chanced to bray so rudely and loud that he wakened the Nymph and defeated the God of his lewd purpose, debarring him of his desired pleasure, and exposing him to the derision of all the Rural Deities by the mishap.
<q>
                     <l>Omnibus ad lunae lumina risus erat.</l>
                  </q>
And therefore the Heathens sacrifice an Asse to <hi>Priapus,</hi> as a reiterated revenge upon that Beast for doing him so great a displeasure.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some such Reason as this the same Prophet of the Heathens, as I may so call him, gives of mens running up and down <hi>stark naked</hi> in the <hi>Lupercalia,</hi> which were celebrated to the honour, or rather dishonour, of <hi>Pan, Lycaeus, Faunus</hi> or <hi>Sylvanus</hi>; for it is nothing but a memorial also of his defeated lechery. For <hi>Hercules</hi> having retired into a wood with his wife <hi>Omphale,</hi> a fair and goodly person and richly attired, this Rural God by chance espying her, fell in love with her, watched where they took up their lodging, and silently stole into the Cave by night: where <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Omphale</hi> having changed garments, he lying in his wives clothes, and she in his Lions skin, made the lustfull God mistake so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily, that it cost him, besides the shame, the bruising of his Body against the sides of the Cave, where the enraged Heros cast him, discharging himself of so uncouth and unsutable a Bed-fellow. And this is the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55305:55"/>
Reason why <hi>Sylvanus</hi> will have his Ceremonies performed by naked men in detestation of that deceit and mistake that may ly under clothes.
<q>
                     <l>Veste Deus lusus fallentes lumina Vestes</l>
                     <l>Non amat, &amp; nudos ad sua sacra vocat.</l>
                     <l>The God abus'd by cloths that hinder sight,</l>
                     <l>Unto his Feasts the naked doth invite.</l>
                  </q>
So lascivious are the Rites, and so frivolous the Theology of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Pagans.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Flora</hi> is a name that sounds more innocently, but yet her Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities are not performed without shameless wantonness and uncivil mirth; lewd Harlots being appointed to run up and down naked, pleasing the Spectators with their obscene gestures and Meretricious disportments.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Their Goddess <hi>Venus</hi> can be no sooner mentioned then suspected, and that deservedly. For though <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Plotinus</hi> acknowledge a Twofold <hi>Venus,</hi> the one <hi>Heavenly,</hi> the other <hi>Popular</hi> and <hi>Carnal</hi>; yet that Distinction in the true meaning thereof seems only to be lodged amongst the better sort of Philosophers, the people doing their devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to that <hi>lower</hi> Deity, as it appears by the Epithets they give her, and the Ceremonies they perform to her. For <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> which the <hi>Argivi,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which the <hi>Syracusans</hi> worshipped, can be no other but that Power which is the President of Lust, as the meaning of those unchast Epithets does plainly demonstrate. And that <hi>Venus</hi> which was worshipped at <hi>Cyprus,</hi> the <hi>Phallus</hi> which was shewn amongst other of her Ceremonies evidently declares her Nature to be of the same kind.</p>
               <p n="7">7. There was indeed an <hi>Urania,</hi> a Celestial <hi>Venus,</hi> she is called the <hi>Queen of Heaven</hi> in Scripture, <hi>Venus Mylitta</hi> in Prophane writers, (<hi>Mylitta</hi> signifying <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as if it were from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) which was worshipped as well in some parts of <hi>Africk</hi> as in <hi>Babylonia</hi>; but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of her name, which we have already told, as also the manner of her Ceremonies, do manifestly shew that she was but that Popular <hi>Venus</hi> we spoke of before. For young Women sate in her Temple, their places being distinguished by certain lines or threads, which any stranger that would make use of their bodies, broke, and so carried her apart that he had a mind to deal with from the rest, and gave her a piece of mony for a requital; and after this superstitious kind of fornication she was permitted to marry whom she pleased. The better sort of Women made their abode near the Temple in certain Waggons covered like Tents: from whence the abomination was called <hi>Succoth Benoth,</hi> and the Goddess her self <hi>Benoth</hi> for shortness, whence the <hi>Criticks</hi> with great probability derive the Latine word <hi>Venus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. This <hi>Venus</hi> which was worshipped so in several places, is conceived by some to be the <hi>Moon,</hi> as by <hi>Philochorus,</hi> who affirms her to be sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to, if by men, in womens apparel, if by women, in mens apparel: Which Planet is rightly called the <hi>Queen of Heaven,</hi> and under the name of <hi>Hecate</hi> is also <hi>Maleficarum Venus,</hi> as <hi>Selden</hi> notes. <hi>Astarte</hi> also is the same <hi>Numen,</hi> served by her impure Priests, men of filthy and effeminate
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55305:56"/>
manners. The abominableness of the Worship of this Goddess of Lust is lively set out by <hi>Eusebius</hi> in the life of <hi>Constantine, Nemus erat &amp; delubrum extra publicam viam spurco</hi> Veneris <hi>daemoni in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te verticis montis</hi> Libani <hi>in fruticeto positum. Erat hîc malitiae Schola omnibus lascivis, ubi viri non viri muliebri morbo daemonem pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabant.</hi> And besides this, it was, as he sayes, the Rendezvous of all lewd persons, men and women given to wantonness, where they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted adultery, fornication and Sodomy with impunity, because no man of any repute would come amongst them.</p>

THat so villainous doings are found under so bad a title as this Goddess bears, may seem less marvel; but such Solemnities as have had the greatest fame for <hi>Mysteriousness</hi> and <hi>Sanctity</hi> are not found clear of this course kind of filthiness. We will instance in one example for all, in the <hi>Sacra Eleusinia</hi> instituted to the honour of <hi>Ceres,</hi> whom one would expect that she should approve her self an honest country Matron; whenas some of the sights to be seen in her Temple (as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they made those Mysteries) were but the ensignes of a Bawdy-house, which was the cause I suppose that made <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Demonax</hi> not care to be initiated.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But what by the power of delusive Spirits or the fraud of the Priests, that caused unexpected flashings of light and astonishing thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings, besides other strange sights which they exhibited to them that were come to an <gap reason="foreign">

Thus filthy and impure is the Religion of the Pagans all over, whose nasty Ceremonies had not been recorded by the pens, nor uttered by the mouths of the holy Fathers, had not necessity done violence to their modesty. Nor will I detain you any longer in so unsavoury a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, though we might travail further in this mire, relating to you the unclean customes of <hi>Candu</hi> in <hi>Tartary,</hi> where they prostitute their Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, their Daughters, nay their own Wives to strangers by way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to their Idols: Of <hi>Calecut</hi> in <hi>Malabar,</hi> where the King strains cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie with the High Priest, and will needs have him reap the <hi>primitiae</hi> of the pleasures of his new-married Bride; in that City also is there a Temple dedicated to the <hi>Ape,</hi> an animal of noted lechery: Of <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singa,</hi> where women prostitute themselves to get mony for their Idols: Of the whole Continent of <hi>America,</hi> where besides that their common Lust and Venery has no bounds, they also offer their Daughters to be deflowred by their Priests, and dedicate young Boyes to Sodomy; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly at <hi>Old Port</hi> and <hi>Puna</hi> in <hi>Peru,</hi> where the Devil so far prevailed in their beastly devotions, (as <hi>Purchas</hi> relates out of <hi>Cieza</hi>) that there were boyes consecrated to serve in the Temple, and at the times of their Sacrifices and solemn Feasts the Lords and principal men abused them
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55305:57"/>
to that detestable filthiness; and generally in the Hill-countreys the Devil under shew of holiness had brought in that vice. For every Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or principal house of Adoration kept one man or two or more, which were attired like women even from the time of their childhood, and spake like them, imitating them in every thing; with whom under pretext of Holiness and Religion their principal men on principal daies had that hellish commerce.

In the kingdome of <hi>Narsinga</hi> and <hi>Bisnagar</hi> there is an Idol to which they make long Pilgrimages, and when they appear before him, come with their hands bound, or with ropes about their necks, or with knives sticking in their arms or legs, or else cut their flesh, and cast the pieces into the Idol's face. The Idol being drawn in solemn proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the more Zealous of the people lye in the way to be squeezed to death by the wheels, as both <hi>Balby, Odoricus</hi> and <hi>Linschoten</hi> write. I might add other examples of this kinde, but I will not overmuch transgress my proposed Method, not intending for the present to speak of any cruelties of Satan but such as are on this side <hi>Murther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. In <hi>Zeilan</hi> they make Pilgrimages of incredible tediousness; For having travailed many hundred miles, they are fain to wade near twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty miles together in stinking mire, besides their clambering up an Hill of many miles ascent by the help of ropes and hooks and bushes that they are to take hold of: and when they are got up to the top, and have fed their eyes with the print of his foot that was their ancient Law-giver, they compleat their penance with pricking and cutting their own flesh.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In <hi>New-Spain</hi> they sought pardon of their Idols by whipping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves on the naked shoulders, and taking up earth and eating it. In <hi>Peru</hi> they lay prostrate on the ground before their Idols, the more Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous not sparing to pluck out their own eyes in a blinde devotion. In <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> when they sacrific'd, they were wont to thrust a consecrated hook down their throats to fetch all out of their stomachs; which done they sate round their Idol in an antick posture, wry-necked and cross-legged, praying for the acceptance of their Sacrifice.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Priests and religious at <hi>Mexico</hi> were wont to rise at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, having cast incense before their Idol, to retire into a large place where many lights were burning, and there with lancets and bodkins to pierce the calves of their legs near to the bones, anointing their Temples with the bloud. They would also slit their members in the midst in a frantick pursuance of a thankless Chastity. They whipp'd themselves also with cords full of knots, besides their tedious and destructive fastings. These sad Ceremonies they also used in <hi>Peru,</hi> where they swinged themselves with stinging Nettles, and struck themselves over the shoulders with hard stones.</p>
               <p>These and the like abuses (that you may meet withall in Writers) which Satan has put upon Mankind, are a demonstration of his great contempt and hatred of us. But we shall come nearer now to make good
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55305:58"/>
that charge, which our Blessed Saviour, who came to destroy his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, most justly has laid upon this Usurper, <hi>That he was a Murderer from the beginning:</hi> which is most evident from that execrable custome of <hi>Sacrificing of men to him</hi> under what account or title soever: which was an abomination practised of old in most parts of the World, as the Testimony of Historians will make good.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THE knowledge of this is fresh concerning the <hi>Americans,</hi> as that they in <hi>Virginia</hi> sacrificed Children to the Devil, as also in <hi>Peru</hi> for the health and prosperity of the <hi>Ingua,</hi> and for success in war. The same they doe in <hi>Brasilia.</hi> The People of <hi>Guiana,</hi> of <hi>Paria</hi> and other adjacent parts do not only sacrifice men, but some of them after feed upon the sacrifice. The Priests of <hi>Nicaragua,</hi> as <hi>Purchas</hi> relates out of <hi>Gomara,</hi> after the Ceremony of a mournful sound and going thrice about their Captives, of a sudden rip up their Breasts with certain knives of flint, and then after the distribution of the Body to the King, their high Priest and him that took the Captive in war, they set their Heads upon Trees, under which they sacrifice also other men and children.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In <hi>Florida</hi> the Devil appears to them and complains that he is thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty: But nothing quenches his thirst but the bloud of men. <hi>Acosta</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of the <hi>Mexicans,</hi> that their Priests would tell their Kings that their Gods died for hunger: the meaning whereof was, that they must forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with go out to war to get Captives for Sacrifices to their Gods.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In <hi>Peru,</hi> at the Inauguration of their new <hi>Ingua,</hi> they sacrificed two hundred children; they either cut off their necks, anointing themselves on the face with their bloud, or drowned them and so buried them with certain Ceremonies. And the <hi>Mexicans</hi> also are reported at a Feast which they keep in their Canaoes on the Lake, to drown a Boy and a Girl, to keep the Gods of the Lake company. They of <hi>Peru</hi> would also sacrifice Virgins out of their Monasteries, as the same Author writes: and ordinarily any <hi>Indian</hi> of Quality, and those too of mean sort, would sacrifice their first-born to redeem their own life, when the Priest pronounced that they were mortally sick.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Mexicans</hi> indeed, if <hi>Acosta</hi> does not them overmuch right,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55305:58"/>
sacrificed only Captives to their Idols. But they were unmercifully lavish of the bloud of their conquered enemy, their Sacrifices being often repeated, and they sacrificing at least forty or fifty at a time, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them to ascend to the top of an high Terras in the Court of the Temple, where the chief Priest (as also his assistants) being clad in most ugly and diabolical dresses to astonish the people, opened the Breast of the Captive with a wonderous dexterity, pull'd out the <hi>Heart</hi> with his hands, and shew'd it smoaking to the <hi>Sun,</hi> to whom he did offer this heat and fume of the Heart, and then cast it at the Idols face, and with a spurn of his foot tumbled the Body of the Sacrifice down the stairs of the Temple.</p>
               <p n="5">5. So prodigal was their abominable Religion of <hi>humane bloud,</hi> that some daies they have sacrificed five thousand or more, and in divers places above twenty thousand, as <hi>Acosta</hi> relates from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of the <hi>Indians.</hi> There is one nasty piece of Cruelty that he saies was used in <hi>Mexico,</hi> which was the flaying of a Slave, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling another man with his skin, who was to go dancing and leaping through all the houses and market-places of the City to beg money for the Idols; and they that refused to give, he was to give them a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="6">6. This is ill enough; but that something worse in <hi>New-Spain,</hi> where they flay'd a woman, and covered a man with her skin, who was to dance about the streets two daies together. So <hi>despightfully Cruel and Tyrannical</hi> has the <hi>Rule of the Devil</hi> been in the New-found Pagan world; and yet we shall not finde him much better in the Old.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Gaffarel</hi> indeed, though he will admit that certain <hi>Persian</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies seated in <hi>Samaria</hi> sacrificed their children to <hi>Adramelech</hi> and <hi>Anamelech</hi> the Gods of <hi>Sepharvaim,</hi> yet he will not allow by any means that Children were <hi>sacrificed</hi> to <hi>Moloch,</hi> but onely <hi>februated:</hi> and this he does in favour to the Jews whom he would not have to stand guilty of such a detestable piece of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> But it is beyond all excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion plain, that they did <hi>sacrifice their sonnes and daughters to Devils, Psal.</hi> 105. and <hi>Iosephus</hi> himself acknowledges of <hi>Achaz,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for the mitigating of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barousness of their ancient rites. And it is not unlikely but that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this cruelty was quite laid aside, there was first a seldomer use of it, and that at last it vanished into simple <hi>Februation</hi>; which is the best way I know to save <hi>Solomon</hi>'s credit, and vindicate him from the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion of so barbarous a piece of Idolatry, though he reigned long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Achaz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That this Custome of <hi>sacrificing Children</hi> spread it self out of <hi>Syria</hi> into <hi>Europe</hi> I cannot say: but it is likely that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had it from thence, they being a Colony of that nation; and <hi>Lactantius</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them with this cruel Superstition, that they used to sacrifice men to <hi>Saturn</hi>; and that, being overcome by <hi>Agathocles</hi> King of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> and suspecting their God was angry with them, they sacrific'd <hi>ducentos no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilium filios, two hundred noble-mens sons</hi> at once. This abomination of <hi>sacrificing</hi> their children <hi>Ennius</hi> also had noted of old,
<q>
                     <l>Poeni sunt soliti sos sacrificare puellos.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Cretians</hi> also as well as the <hi>Syrians</hi> sacrificed to <hi>Saturn,</hi> however they took up the custome. But a further evidence that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had theirs from the <hi>Syrians</hi> is that the name of the God they sacrificed to was called <hi>Amilcas,</hi> as <hi>Selden</hi> notes out of <hi>Athena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> which comes very near to <hi>Moloch</hi> or <hi>Milcham,</hi> and that they used also drums and pipes to drown the noise and cries of the sacrificed. <hi>Porphyrius</hi> out of the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Chronicles tells us that this <hi>Saturn</hi> the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> call <hi>Israel,</hi> who was their ancient King, and sacrificed his onely-begotten son to deliver his Kingdome from a present danger of warre.

But though that way that <hi>Selden</hi> recites out of <hi>Porphyrius</hi> were true, I do not see that this occasion should need to have any influence on remoter parts in <hi>Europe,</hi> they of <hi>Peru</hi> without any such invitation being lavish of the blood of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in sacrificing them to the Devil. But if it had, it were no excuse, but a greater reproach to them and their ill Master, that God's refusall of so high and rigorous an homage (though he had an indisputable right to it) could not binde their hands from either offering or receiving such bloody sacrifices.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Wherefore, without any such animation or emulation, I believe, the Apostate Spirits every where full of <hi>Scorn</hi> and <hi>Cruelty,</hi> did of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves set up such abominable Rites in most parts of the old world. As here in <hi>Britain,</hi> where they were wont to sacrifice Captives to foretel things to come, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> writes. <hi>Strabo</hi> affirms the same of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitani,</hi> who for the same purpose sacrificed their Captives to <hi>Mars. Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> writes the same concerning the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and <hi>Suetonius</hi> of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans; Eusebius</hi> of the <hi>Thracians,</hi> who sacrificed men, to be better ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of their success in warre: and <hi>Tacitus</hi> concerning the <hi>Isle of Man</hi> near us, saith, that it was the seat of the <hi>Druids</hi> who were great <hi>Men-sacrificers,</hi> which they performed in Woods. <hi>Lucos saevis supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus sacros,</hi> that Author calls them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Neither were the <hi>Greeks</hi> free from this <hi>bloody Superstition.</hi> For <hi>Aristomenes Messenius</hi> sacrificed three hundred men to <hi>Iupiter Ithemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> The <hi>Arcades</hi> also sacrificed Boyes to <hi>Iupiter Lycaeus,</hi> and the Inhabitants of <hi>Chios</hi> a Man to <hi>Diomedes.</hi> The <hi>Locri</hi> were commanded by their Oracle, for the asswaging of a Pestilence, so send every year two Virgins to <hi>Troy,</hi> which had their throats first cut, and then were burnt in sacrifice to <hi>Pallas Trojana:</hi> And <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> the butchering of her (under the pretence of marriage) by the hand of the Priest at the altar of <hi>Diana</hi> in <hi>Aulis,</hi> is notoriously known, and lively set out by <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius,</hi> with this <hi>Epiphonema</hi> at the end of the Narration,

                  </q>
The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> also sacrificed Men to <hi>Mars. Phylarchus</hi> affirms all the <hi>Greeks</hi> to have done the like.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Pliny</hi> boasts that the <hi>Romans</hi> were free from those cruel and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Superstitions: but if he mean they were alwayes so, it will be found but a boast. For of old they <hi>sacrificed men</hi> to <hi>Saturnus</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter Latialis,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Lactantius</hi> have noted; and it was usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all with them to give men to be devoured by Beasts in their great
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55305:60"/>
Festivals, which they celebrated to this or the other Deity. Besides, they are said to have sacrificed at Rome <hi>two Greeks</hi> and <hi>two Gaules,</hi> a Male and Female of each, every year. And throughout <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> those barbarous Sacrifices were very frequent according to <hi>Pliny's</hi> own Testimony, and were not abrogated at <hi>Rome</hi> till about six or seven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years <hi>ab urbe condita.</hi>

                  </gap> also, that is, the Souls of men departed this life: but there was something special in their <hi>Birth,</hi> in that they were conceived to be born of some Goddess impregnated by a man, or of some woman impregnated by some God.

Which that you may not suspect to be only the levity and credulity of Poets to report such things, I can inform you that S. <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> the Historian write the same of a race of Horses in <hi>Cappadocia.</hi> Nay, which is more to the purpose, <hi>Columella</hi> and <hi>Varro,</hi> men expert in rural affairs, assert this matter for a most certain and known truth.</p>

Wherefore if the free Air by the advancing of the pleasure of the Spirits of these Animals, or actuating them by a volatil Salt, will fill them so full of life and joy, that it will make their Wombes blossome, as I may so say, and after bring forth fruit; why may not an Aiery Spirit transforming himself into the shape of a Man, supply his place effectually, he being able, as Witches have confessed, to raise as high pleasure and indeed higher then any man can doe; and so to loosen the body into a transmission of such principles and particles as will prove in their conflux in the wombe vital and prolifical? Which may be the easilier admitted, if we consider that the Seed of the Male gives neither Matter nor Form to the <hi>Foetus</hi> it self; but like the Flint and Steel on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sets the Tinder on fire, as Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> expresses it. So that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Gods, when they would have to doe with women, needed no such <hi>ambages</hi> as ordinarily men imagine, viz. first to play the <hi>Succubi,</hi> &amp; then the <hi>Incubi,</hi> that is, first to receive the Seed of man, having transformed themselves into the shape of a woman, &amp; then to transfuse the Seed into the womb of a woman, after they had changed themselves into the form of a man. For it is not the Matter of the Seed, but a gratefull contact or motion fermenting or spiriting the place of conception, that makes the Female fruitfull.

               <p n="1">1. I Have now omitted nothing of considerable moment to our present purpose, having laid down by way of Preparation such Grounds as will inable us to give a solid account of whatsoever occurrs in the <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Christ,</hi> whatsoever happen'd to him, was done or is to be done by him, from his <hi>Birth</hi> to his <hi>Visible return to Iudgment.</hi> For besides that there are no <hi>Effects so Miraculous</hi> there recorded, as to exceed the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of those <hi>Invisible Powers</hi> which we have demonstrated to be in the world; so the <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of every thing will be easily illustrated by what we have discovered concerning the <hi>Nature and End of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi> which is to advance the <hi>Divine life</hi> upon Earth, and to bring the partakers thereof to Eternal happiness, and in the mean time to redeem the world out of the dominion and tyranny of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and to bring in the Worship of <hi>Christ</hi> as the lawfull owner of all Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Heaven and in Earth: and that not by external force and violence, but by the wonderfull Wisdom of God discoverable in the Gospel; there being such winning compliances and condescensions to the Faculties of Man, and so powerfull endearments upon his Affections, that at the first hearing it is able to carry away the ingenuous captive into obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it, with joy in their hearts and tears in their eyes, their whole man melting into an easie pliableness to this new gracious law in the sense of so great Joy, Love and Sorrow: besides their being surprized with a just slighting or indignation against the Religions they were formerly ingaged in, for either their beggerly Elements or abominable Sacrifices and Ceremonies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For whatsoever is defective in any, Christ makes a full supply; and where their Rites are execrable and detestable, he treads quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary there to both the foul <hi>obscenities</hi> and bloody <hi>cruelties</hi> of Satan. But what <hi>Propensions</hi> in Mankind were more warrantably natural, he gratifies them in a truer and higher manner then ever they were yet in the World. So that of a very truth <hi>Christianity</hi> is not only the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatment</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>Iudaisme,</hi> but also of universal <hi>Paganisme</hi>; the Summe or Substance of whatever was considerable in any Religion being comprehended in the Gospel of Christ, which was reserved to the last Periods of time as an <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. For as for <hi>Things in Heaven,</hi> whether it be the Objects of the worships of the Heathen, namely their <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, men canonized for Gods and their <hi>Heroes,</hi> or the trust they had in their <hi>Dii Medioxumi,</hi> in the mediation and intercession of their <hi>Daemons,</hi> or whatsoever obscure hopes they had of enjoying the life of the Gods themselves in Heaven after the dissolution of the Body; all these things are more compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and yet more truly, plainly and warrantably, comprehended in Christ. As also the <hi>Things in Earth,</hi> as the Jewish Sacrifices and the Pagans <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, so many and so curious Ceremonies of expiation and purification, they are all more fitly and more effectually contained in the Sacrament of Baptisme and in the celebration of the Death of our Saviour then in any of the Rites of the Nations.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And truly all things are so shrewdly levelled at the Religion of the Heathens in the transactions of Christ and matters belonging to him, that he may rather seem to be meant for them then the Jews themselves, though they had the first refusal of him; so that the counsel of God is made evident as well in the Contrivance as the Effect thereof. And this may serve for a General hint concerning the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Composure</hi> of <hi>Christianity.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. But we shall not content our selves therewith, but descend to a more Particular account, applying the Grounds which we have laid down to all the Considerable matters contained in the History of Christ; which we shall refer to these Heads: <hi>His Birth; His Life; His Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion; His Resurrection; His Ascension; <gap reason="foreign">

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>1.</hi> That <hi>Christ's being born of a Virgin</hi> is no <hi>Impossible</hi> thing. <hi>2.</hi> And not only so, but also <hi>Reasonable</hi> in reference to the <hi>Heroes</hi> of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans. <hi>3.</hi> And that this outward birth might be an emblem of his Eternal Sonship. <hi>4.</hi> Thirdly in relation to the Sanctity of his own person, and for the recommendation of Continence and Chastity to the world. <hi>5.</hi> And lastly for the completion of certain prophesies in the Scriptures that pointed at the Messias.</head>
               <p n="1">1. COncerning <hi>the Birth of Christ,</hi> or whatsoever else happened mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously to him, or was done by him, I conceive I shall give a sufficient account, if I shew not only their <hi>Possibility,</hi> but their <hi>Reasonableness.</hi> And it is not at all <hi>Impossible</hi> that <hi>a Virgin</hi> should bring forth a Son, if we understand the meaning of that term aright, which signifies a Woman that never had any thing to doe with a Man. For it implies no Contradiction for her to conceive from some other hidden cause, and therefore at least the Omnipotent Power of God can bring it to pass. For whether is it easier to create all things of nothing, to make Plants and Animals to spring out of the Earth without the help of either Male or Female, or to prepare the wombe of a woman so, as to make her conceive without the help of a man? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to deny the <hi>Possibility</hi> thereof is to deny the Existence of God in the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But it is not only <hi>Possible,</hi> but <hi>Reasonable.</hi> For besides that in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral it is fit that so extraordinary a person as our Saviour in his coming into the World should be accompanied with miraculous indications of his eminencie, there is a peculiar accommodation in this of his being conceived and born by a supernatural Power to those either true stories or strong suspicions of the Pagans, who did so easily believe that their famous <hi>Heroes,</hi> whose memory continued so long with them, and was so sacred, that they did divine honours to them, were not sprung of mortal race, but were <hi>ex stirpe Deorum,</hi> as you have already heard; which is in a most true and eminent manner accomplished in the Birth of our Saviour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, Christ considered out of the body, he being not a mere humane Soul, but being truly, livingly and really united with the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is by union the Eternal Son of God. Now that being to come to pass which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> speaks of in the beginning of his Gospel, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The word was made flesh</hi>; he that was to be born of <hi>Mary</hi> (the Spouse of <hi>Ioseph</hi>) he being, I say, the true and genuine Son of God, begotten of the Father from all eternity, when he was to be born here into the world in time; who was so fit to be entitled to his procreation
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55305:65"/>
as he that was the Author of his Eternal generation? and therefore he was to be born of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> and to be conceived by a supernatural way, that his visible Humanity as well as his inward Divinity might have a just occasion of being called <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and that the one might be the Emblem as it were of the other.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thirdly, you have seen how full of abominable obscenity and uncleanness the Superstition of the Heathen was; to say nothing of the carnality and uxoriousness of the Jews, and of that impuritie which by almost all nations (unless where Superstition has emboldened them to Beastliness) is confessed to be in the acts of Venerie; they commonly concealing those parts which Nature ordained for such uses from the eyes of men, as being ashamed to acknowledge themselves subject to so low a kind of sense. It was therefore unfit that Christ should be born accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that common way of generation, that he might give no encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to that which men are so madly set upon, notwithstanding that bridle of shame that Nature would curb them in by; especially himself coming into the world to be the highest Pattern of Purity that can be exhibited to Mankind: for which reason he also abstained from <hi>Marriage,</hi> and commended the <hi>Virgin-life</hi>; which he might doe with better reason then any, he being a more certain pledge of those holy, heavenly and eternal joyes, then ever was yet manifested to the world. Wherefore partly in opposition to the uncleanness of Paganisme, and partly for an invitation to his followers to set a due price upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence and Chastity as great helps to the purifying of the Soul, and the making of her relish those delights which are truly divine, himself did not vouchsafe to take our flesh upon him in that way which is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the height of gross carnal pleasures; nor when he had taken our flesh, to reap the Joyes thereof, no not so much as upon those allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able terms of Marriage; he coming into the World on purpose to slight and slur that which is to the greatest esteem and sweetest relish with the Natural Man.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fourthly and lastly, <hi>the being born of a Virgin</hi> being one of the notes of the <hi>Messias,</hi> as the very first prophesie of him in the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and emphatical sense thereof seems to imply, That <hi>the seed of the woman</hi> (in opposition or exclusion of the mans seed) <hi>should break the Serpents head,</hi> as also that more plain allusion and lively Type in the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> of <hi>a Virgin conceiving of a Son</hi> whose name was <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi> does exquisitely prefigure; This, I say, adds also to the congruity of this miracle of Christ's conception in the Wombe of a Virgin. All which things put together are more then enough to sufflaminate those blasphemous suspicions of witless and ungodly men, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them that it was not the colouring of some casuall miscarriage in the Mother of Christ, that he was said to be <hi>begotten of the Holy Ghost</hi>; but that it was so indeed, and so determined by the Wisdom and counsel of God. The greatest reason whereof was (as I conceive) the Sanctity of our Saviour's Soul, and his purpose of discountenancing of the pleasures and pollutions of the flesh, and the drawing of mens minds to the study of <hi>Purity,</hi> a very considerable branch of the <hi>divine</hi> life which he came to raise in the World.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>1.</hi> That as the <hi>Virginity</hi> of Christ's Mother recommended <hi>Purity,</hi> so her <hi>Meanness</hi> recommends <hi>Humility</hi> to the world; as also other circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Christ's Birth. <hi>2.</hi> Of the Salutation of the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> and of the <hi>Magi. 3.</hi> That the History of their Visit helps on also belief, and that it is not Reason but Sottishness that excepts against the ministery of Angels. <hi>4.</hi> His design of continuing a Parallel betwixt the life of <hi>Christ</hi> and of <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus. 5.</hi> The Pedigree and Birth of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius,</hi> how ranck they smell of the <hi>Animal life. 6.</hi> The Song of the Angels and the dance of the musical Swans at <hi>Apollonius</hi>'s birth compared.</head>
               <p n="1">1. NOW as his being <hi>born of a Virgin</hi> is a recommendation of <hi>Purity,</hi> so his being born of so <hi>mean</hi> a Virgin as the Spouse of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter is a recommendation of <hi>Humility.</hi> For it is observable that Christ on set purpose vilified and slighted that which is most esteemed and most dear to the <hi>Animal life,</hi> and such are all those things that make for our honour and reputation amongst men; And <hi>Nobleness of paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> is not one of the meanest of them. Other circumstances of his Birth tend also to the same scope; for no sooner came he into the world, but he practised that which he after taught others, he <hi>took the meanest place in the Inne:</hi> and though he were heir of all things, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed Soveraign of Angels and Men; yet he was shouldered out from amongst them, and was fain to take his lodgings in the Stable amongst the brute beasts. But in this low condition while he is taken no notice of by supercilious mortals, yet the <hi>Angels</hi> celebrates his Nativity with an Heavenly carol, imparting the good news of his Birth not to the <hi>wise</hi> or <hi>noble</hi> of this World, not to the <hi>learned Rabbies</hi> or <hi>Rulers</hi> of the People, but to men of a <hi>lowly</hi> and <hi>innocent</hi> profession, to <hi>Shepheards</hi> attending their flocks by night. All which circumstances of his Birth you see how reasonable, how significant and decorous they are.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor is that <hi>Salutation</hi> of the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> concerning it, and his prediction to <hi>Mary,</hi> an useless and idle complement: but it was requisite that what was to happen to her should be foretold her, that the modest Virgin might not be abash'd to see her womb swell, she not knowing the cause of it. The same may be said also of the journey of the <hi>Magi,</hi> that it is not a thing vainly inserted into the History to make a show, but that the fame of the Jews expectation of their <hi>Messias</hi> about that time being spread all over the East, these <hi>Genethliaci</hi> that lov'd to busie themselves about Nativities and strange events in the World, amidst their viewing the Constellations, discovering a New star as it seem'd to them, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving its motion, were led to the very place where the young King of the Jews lay, where they worshipped him, not as the Son of God, but as one that they expected would be a mighty secular Prince; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to engage him to favour themselves and their Country, they did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him this timely homage.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:55305:66"/>3. But though they intended no more then thus, yet it being so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous an accident could not but further the faith of those that were to be called in to the belief of the Gospel. Besides that, it was a prelusion to &amp; prefiguration of the forwardness of the Gentiles above the Jews to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ as their Soveraign and Redeemer, as also a prelibation of that glory that should at last accrew to Christ for the great debasement of himself and unparallel'd humiliation. So that nothing can make the circumstances of the History of his Birth incredible, unless it be the mention of <hi>the ministery of Angels</hi> in it, which none can cavil at but such as believe no Angels at all, neither good nor bad: nor can any be of this unbelief but such as prefer the sottish suggestions of their own dull temper before the perpetual testimonies of all Ages and all Nations of the World; who have ever and anon had new Instances of Apparitions and Communications with evil Spirits, and fresh occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of executing the Laws they had made against Witches and wicked Magicians.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I should now pass to the second head I propounded, could I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from touching a little upon the circumstances of the Birth of that famous Corrival of our Saviour, <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus</hi>; whose story writ by <hi>Philostratus,</hi> though I look upon it as a mixt business partly true and partly false, yet, be it what it will be, seeing it is intended for the highest Example of Perfection, and that the Heathen did equalize him with <hi>Christ,</hi> you shall see how ranck his whole History smells of <hi>the Animal Life,</hi> and how hard a thing it is either in actions or writings to counterfeit that which is truly <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>divine.</hi> For which end I shall make a brief Parallelisme of the Histories of them both in the chief matters of either, that the <hi>Gravitie and Divinitie of the one</hi> and the <hi>Ridiculousness and Carnality of the other</hi> may the better be discerned.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As in this very First point is plain and manifest, which is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched in a word. For in that <hi>Philostratus</hi> writes how <hi>Apollonius</hi> was of an ancient and illustrious Pedigree, of rich Parents, and descended from the founders of the City <hi>Tyana,</hi> where he was born, is not this that which is as sweet as honey to the <hi>Natural</hi> man, and such as an <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>divine</hi> Soul would set no esteem upon? Like to this is his Mother's being waited upon by her Maidens into a Meadow, being directed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by a Vision, where while her servants were straying up and down ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of posies and chaplets of flowers, (O what fine soft pompous doing is here!) and her self disporting her self in the grass, she at last falls into a slumber, the Swans in the mean time rangeing themselves in a row round about her, dancing and clapping their wings, and singing with such shrill and sweet accents that they filled the neighbouring places with their pleasant melody, they being as it were inspired and transported with joy by the gentle breathings of the fresh and cool <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrus</hi>; whereupon the Lady awaking is instantly delivered of a fair Child, who, after his Fathers name, was called <hi>Apollonius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The amenity of the story how gratefull and agreeable it is to flesh and bloud! But how ridiculous is that dance and rountlelay of the musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Swans</hi> compared with that Heavenly Melody of the holy <hi>Angels</hi> at
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55305:66"/>
the Nativity of Christ! For that, if it could be true, is but a ludicrous prodigie and presignification that <hi>Apollonius</hi> would prove a very odde fellow and of an extraordinary strein, and serves only for the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of his person. But this is a grave and weighty indication of the Goodness of God and the Love of his holy Angels to men, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of that peace and grace which should be administred unto them through Jesus Christ that was then born. <hi>Behold,</hi> said the chief Angel whose glorious presence surrounded the shepheards with light, <hi>Behold,</hi> said he, <hi>I bring you good tidings of Great joy which shall be unto all people; For unto you is born this day a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord:</hi> whereupon there was suddenly with this Angel a multitude of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Hoast praising God and saying, <hi>Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will towards men.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. WE have done with <hi>the Birth of Christ,</hi> we proceed now to his <hi>Life:</hi> wherein we shall consider only those things that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily happened to him, or were miraculously done by him, till the time of his <hi>Passion</hi>; wherein nothing will be found <hi>impossible</hi> to them that acknowledge <hi>the Existence of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the active malice of Devils,</hi> and the <hi>Ministery of Angels.</hi> But that which I intend mainly to insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate is, the comeliness and sutableness of all things to so <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> a person; which that it may the better appear, I shall after shew the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of this true example of solid Perfection, Christ, and that false pattern of feigned holiness in that Impostour <hi>Apollonius,</hi> whom the later Heathen did so highly adore.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The chief things that happened in an extraordinary way to Christ before his Passion are these Three. 1. <hi>The descending of the Holy Ghost upon him in the shape of a Dove</hi> at his being baptized, and the <hi>emission of a Voice from Heaven,</hi> saying, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55305:67"/>
pleased.</hi> 2. <hi>The Temptation of the Devil</hi> upon his fasting: and 3. <hi>His Transfiguration</hi> upon the Mount.</p>
               <p>Concerning the First, there is great reason for that Miracle. For God having a design to set on foot the <hi>Divine life</hi> in the World by his Son <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> why should he not countenance the Beginning of his Ministery by some notable sign, by which men might take notice that he was the <hi>Messias,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 1. v. 32.</note> sent of God? And <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> confesses him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self assur'd thereof by this Indication. And being there was to be some extraordinary appearance, what could be more fit then this of a <hi>Dove,</hi> a known embleme of Meekness and Innocency, inseparable branches of the <hi>Divine life</hi> and Spirit? and at what better time then when <hi>Iesus</hi> gave so great a Specimen of his Meekness and Humility, as to condescend to be wash'd, as if he had been polluted, when he was more pure then light or snow; and to be in the form of a disciple to <hi>Iohn,</hi> when he was able to teach him and all the world the Mysteries of God? Which may be noted to the eternal shame of our conceited En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasts, who phansying they have got something extraordinary within, contemn and scorn the laudable Institutions of the Church; which is an infallible argument of their <hi>Pride,</hi> as this of our Saviour's <hi>Humility.</hi> But while he humbled himself thus, God did as highly advance him, adding to this silent show an articulate <hi>voice from Heaven,</hi> the better to assure the by-standers that he was the <hi>Messias,</hi> the Son of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for <hi>his being tempted of the Devil,</hi> it has the same meaning that the hardship of his whole life. For being that the Kingdome of God on earth, which is the Church, was to overcome the kingdome of Satan by suffering; our Saviour Christ gives himself an example of all manner of trials and troubles, of the most tedious difficulties that could occurre: like a wise and couragious Commander animating his Souldiers by his own willingness to suffer as deeply as they that he commands. Which <hi>Polyaenus</hi> relates to be the stratagem of <hi>Iphicrates,</hi> who when he saw it convenient to draw out his souldiers in a cold frosty night to assault the enemy, and observed their aversness by reason of the bitterness of the season, and the thinness of their clothing, he strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way clad himself more thin then the thinnest of them, and on his bare feet trudged from tent to tent to shew himself to his Camp: which did so encourage the souldiers, that they set upon the enterprize without delay under the conduct of so wise and valiant a Commander.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And therefore Christ in like manner for the incouragement of his followers went before in all manner of difficulties, not onely in pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in reproach, and in a constant refusal of all the pleasures, riches and honours of this present World, as being to establish the faith of a better; but he was given up also to be <hi>tempted</hi> of the Devil, that we may not be dismai'd by such encounters, and know how to behave our selves when we are ingaged in them. For his being transported thus securely in the aire by the hand of Satan, like some innocent bird in the talons of a rapacious Hawk, and yet not fainting under it, what can it be but an eminent effect of his Faith in the living God, which is the very <hi>Root</hi> and inmost original of the <hi>Divine life?</hi> The same may
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55305:67"/>
be said of his <hi>miraculous Fast</hi>; For himself in answer to the <hi>Tempter</hi> did profess, man lived not onely by bread, but by Faith in that <hi>Word</hi> that sustaineth all things. That also is worth the noting that <hi>Grotius</hi> observes upon the place, That this <hi>Threefold temptation</hi> wherewith the Devil tempted Christ is the most usual and most prevalent that he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salts mankind withall, viz. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Need, Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination or the Decrees of God, and Hope of worldly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Egestas, Confidentia Praedestinationis, &amp; Spes splendoris humani,</hi> (especially those that have disentangled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the more soft and sensual desires of the Flesh:) and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Christs <hi>Temptation</hi> is, that we are punctually instructed aforehand how we are to oppose. Wherefore this History of his <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation</hi> is very decorous and agreeable to Reason. Nor does the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Devil's assalting of the Son of God make it the less credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for it is most likely that he was not sure yet he was such in that sense that we understand <hi>the Son of God</hi>; and a question whether all the Devils be yet convinced that he is what we rightly believe him to be. But for his own curiosity to try what he was, as well as out of a malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous design to pervert him, if he could, he assalted him after this manner in the Wilderness.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That of <hi>shewing him all the Kingdomes of the Earth from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding high mountain,</hi> seems to have some difficulty in it. For if it was onely a prestigious representation of the glory of the Kingdomes of the Earth, what needed a transportation of him to the top of a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or at least of a mountain so exceeding high? But if it was a real view of them, the highest mountain in the world will not enlarge our prospect so as to take in one ordinary Kingdome under our sight. But to this I answer, That this cunning Prestigiator took the advantage of so high a place to set off his Representations the more lively, and to make them the more probable to be true. For the Prospect seeming so great to the eye, and ruder phansies imagining the Earth a round flat, this old Jugler might easily hope that he might delude the Carpenters son with so large a show, and perswade him that what was so great, was all; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially perstringing his sight so, as that the whole Horizon should seem full of the pompous varieties of the Powers and Principalities of the world.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As for the long and solemn <hi>Fast of Christ</hi> and his retirement into solitude for fourty dayes, after notice was given from Heaven that he was the <hi>Messias</hi> the Son of God, this was very seemly and convenient to sharpen the desire of the people to receive him when he did return, and to gain more Authority to his doctrine which he was to teach them, and to inculcate to his successors by his Example how fit it is to starve the <hi>Animal Life,</hi> and quite vanquish all the pleasures of the Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they take upon them to be instructers in <hi>Divine</hi> matters, which are of eternal concernment to the Soul. When as now-a-daies by how much more a mans skin is full treg'd with flesh, blood and natural Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and by how much the more eager appetite he has to the things of the World, by so much impatienter he is to get into the Pulpit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise his voice and lungs, and thereby to approve himself for a prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: whenas Christ would not exercise this office <hi>of preaching the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55305:68"/>
Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> before he had at once despised all the riches, pomp and pleasures of the Earth. And as his <hi>Wisdome</hi> is discovered in undertaking this <hi>solemn Abstinence</hi> and <hi>Retirement</hi>; so is also his <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> in affecting no innovation therein, but he took up the example of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> who after conferr'd with him in the mount at his Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration: which is the Third and last eminent accident which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to our Saviour before his <hi>Passion,</hi> and which is not recited to fill up the Story, but is of very deep and weighty consequence.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Our Saviour takes unto him <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> three of the prime of his Apostles, to be spectatours and witnesses of what they should see on the Mount, whither he carried them, where he was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured before them, <hi>his face shining like the Sun, and his raiment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming as white as the light</hi>; where <hi>Moses</hi> also and <hi>Elias</hi> talked with him concerning his Death and glorious Resurrection. Which conference was First a great Cordial to animate our Saviour the better to go through his heavy sufferings; and Secondly a great Satisfaction to as many of the Jews as should be converted to Christianity, that <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> that is, their Law-giver and ther chiefest of their Prophets, were abettours to Christ in this new Dispensation he was to set up in the World; and Thirdly, there was a particular injunction (even while <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were present with him face to face) to hearken and yield obedience now to Christ as to the beloved Son of God, and to let <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> go,<note place="margin">Luk. 9.34.</note> all things being compleated in him. <hi>For a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my wel-beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: hear ye him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. And the very <hi>Vision</hi> was a representation of what was to come to pass: For after this, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> vanished, and his disciples, when he had raised them up from the ground, (for they had fallen flat on their faces out of fear) lifting up their eyes, saw no man save <hi>Iesus</hi> onely.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Fourthly and lastly, It was a very fit and powerful Instance to assure men of <hi>the Immortality of the Soul,</hi> and to beget a more unsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken belief of <hi>the Resurrection of Christ</hi> out of the grave: and therefore Christ bad his disciples tell no man of the <hi>Vision,</hi> but reserve it till its due use and time, that is, till Christ had risen from the dead, to be added as a further confirmation of that mystery of enjoying of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> in a <hi>glorified Body,</hi> against that dull infidelity of Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall men that think the Soul of man cannot act unless in the flesh.</p>
               <p n="10">10. In the First and Last of these memorable accidents we rehearsed, there is an eminent witness from Heaven of <hi>the Excellency of Christs person,</hi> to which that nothing remarkable may be omitted, we shall adde also that recorded in John 12. where Christ praying, <hi>Father, glorify thy name,</hi> there came a voice from Heaven saying, <hi>I have both glorified it, and will glorifie it again.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>1.</hi> What miraculous accidents in <hi>Apollonius</hi> his life may seem parallel to these of Christs. His superstitious fasting from flesh and abstinence from wine out of a thirst after the glory of foretelling things to come. <hi>2.

The ridiculous Folly of all these Testimonies.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WE have now gone through the chiefest things that happened to Christ in an extraordinary manner before his <hi>Passion.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we proceed any further, being mindful of our promise, we shall give a glance at what may seem parallel in the life of <hi>Apollonius.</hi> And to the miraculous <hi>Fast</hi> of Christ undergone for so sober purposes, which he was carried to by the power of the Spirit, I finde nothing to be compared in that famous Philosopher, if he deserved so solid a Title, but his continual voluntary abstinence from flesh and wine. Which need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Superstition is coloured with as contemptible an End, that is, a vain affectation of glory by foretelling of things to come; a faculty that mightily pleases and tickles the natural man: and the affectation thereof shews the <hi>Levity</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi> of <hi>Apollonius</hi> his Spirit, as also of his grand Instructers in that Science the <hi>Brachmans</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> who having asked <hi>Damis</hi> if he had any skill in Divination, and he professing that his study and knowledge reached no further then to things usefull and necessary, laughed him to scorn.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But <hi>Philostratus</hi> writes of <hi>Apollonius</hi> as wholy giving himself up to the study of <hi>Divination</hi> and <hi>Iudiciary Astrology,</hi> and how <hi>Iar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas</hi> the chief of the <hi>Brachmans</hi> gave him seven Rings with the names of the seven Planets inscribed upon them, as also that <hi>Apollonius</hi> wrote four books of this Art. Which things are a demonstration of his gross ignorance in Nature and Philosophy, and of the petty temper of his Spirit; and that there was nothing truly divine in him, though the deceived Pagans adored him for a God. For those that descend to such Arts, it is a sign there is no solid knowledge in them, much less any supernatural principle either in them or assisting to them; but that their predictions are Diabolical, or else that they are mere Whiflers and Juglers, and have no extraordinary assistance at all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I shall adde but another parallel and so proceed; and that is the Testimonies concerning <hi>the Eminencie of their persons,</hi> in which there is as great a difference as of their persons themselves. The person of Christ being witnessed to by an audible voice from Heaven, God affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thereby to the World that he was his beloved Son, and requiring their obedience to him; but the Eminency of <hi>Apollonius</hi> being recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55305:69"/>
by none but the Ghost of <hi>Aesculapius</hi> and <hi>Trophonius,</hi> whose den he entred, and (as it became a <hi>Necromancer</hi>) confabulated there a long time with him, as he did also with <hi>Achilles</hi> at his tombe, who imploy'd him to renew his annual Rites and Honours in <hi>Thessalie.</hi> But this recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of his was not immediate from either, but by their Priests, who being informed, the one by a dream, the other by some obscure voice in the Temple (of which there was no witness but the Priest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self) gave out great matters of <hi>Apollonius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. We may adde also the Testimony of the <hi>Brachmans</hi> those famous Magicians, whom <hi>Apollonius</hi> so much applauding, they claw'd him again, and concluded among themselves that he was worthy to be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a God, both alive and after Death. Nay we will give him in all to make up the weight. A certain tame Lion in <hi>Aegypt</hi> seem'd also to acknowledge his Divinity, coming to him as he was sitting in the Temple and crouching under him; who when <hi>Apollonius</hi> told the people that he was that ancient <hi>Aegyptian</hi> King <hi>Amasis</hi> come into a Lions body, the Beast began to roar, and lament and weep bitterly, as begging his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour in so bad a condition: Which <hi>Apollonius</hi> being sensible of, got the Lion to be sent to <hi>Leontopolis</hi> a City of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and there to be kept in such sort as was more sutable to his Royal Soul. How obscure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and ridiculous are all these Testimonies of the Eminency of the person of that subtil Impostor! So base and evanid is all humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance against the Glory and Soveraignty of Christ the true Son of God.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>1.</hi> Three general Observables in Christs Miracles. <hi>2.</hi> Why he several times charged silence upon those he wrought his Miracles upon. <hi>3.</hi> Why Christ was never frustrated in attempting any Miracle. <hi>4.</hi> The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Atheists that impute his Miracles to the power of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. <hi>5.</hi> Of the delusive and evanid viands of Witches and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.</head>
               <p n="1">1. VVE come now to what Jesus <hi>miraculously</hi> did in his life-time. We may referre the most of his <hi>Miracles</hi> to these four heads; <hi>His feeding the hungry multitudes: His healing the sick: His raising of the dead,</hi> and <hi>his dispossessing of Devils.</hi> In all which you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve</p>
               <p>First, That his wonder-working power was exercised upon known and familiar objects, such as often occurre amongst men. For such are <hi>Hunger, Sickness, Death,</hi> and <hi>Possession of Devils</hi> or <hi>Witchery</hi>; not that I think them both one, but that sundry persons are possessed that way, and it may be most frequently.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Christ puts forth his power no where out of any
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55305:69"/>
                  <hi>levity</hi> or <hi>vain ostentation,</hi> but as the <hi>necessities</hi> of men required it: all his <hi>Miracles</hi> being a perpetual exercise of love and compassion to mankind. To which we might adde also in the Third place, what is likewise general to them all, his purpose of <hi>glorifying God</hi> by them, and laying foundations of <hi>Faith</hi> for the people to believe in him, as the true <hi>Messias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Which belief yet he would not accelerate too fast, that it might not prevent his Suffering; nor yet accelerate his Suffering too fast, before he had done the due preparatory works which he had to do. Which made him sometime to seem unwilling to do over-publick Miracles, as that at the wedding of turning water into wine; and after he had fed the multitude, he hid himself that they might not make him King; and several times when he miraculously healed men with more privacy, he strictly charged them that were thus healed to tell no man; as well that he might not over-hastily precipitate belief in men, as I have already intimated, as also to keep himself from the rage of the Pharisees till the due time of his Suffering was at hand. In the mean while his <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> was to distill into the mindes of men by degrees, to prepare them for a fuller belief upon his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It would be too voluminous a business to rehearse the story of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular <hi>Miracle,</hi> and to descant upon it. What we have thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised in general, is most considerable and most profitable to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Nor need we adde any thing to facilitate the belief of them to those that are not such Infidels as not to believe the Existence of either God or Spirit. For others will very easily conceive that Christ being joyn'd with that Eternal Word that healeth all things, might heal those that are absent either by his word, or by the Ministery of Angels who were alwaies to attend him. And it is no wonder that Christ should never be mistaken in any attempt or presage, he being so livingly united with the Eternal Wisdome of God, and being of one Will and Spirit with him, not disturb'd or distracted with any excursions or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuosities of his own Will.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The whifling Atheists impute all to <hi>the natural power of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> and please themselves mightily in the abuse of those passages in the Gospel that seem to assert that Christ was hindred from working of Miracles because of <hi>the Unbelief</hi> of the people, as it is said in the Gospel of S. <hi>Mark,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark 6.5, 6,</note> that <hi>he could do no mighty works, because of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</hi> But it was not a <hi>natural</hi> but <hi>moral</hi> impossibility; he could not induce his minde thereto, he being provoked to so just indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his own Country that despised him. But say in good sadness, poor blind and baffled souls, How can <hi>the natural strength of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> heal the <hi>absent?</hi> to say nothing of the <hi>present</hi> sick of ordinary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, such as the Leprosy, Palsy and Dropsie; who ever cur'd those by mere Imagination? How then shall Imagination recover Sight even to them that were born blind? how shall it raise the dead in whom there is no Imagination at all? as in <hi>Iairus</hi> his daughter, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> who had lien four days in the grave. Can <hi>Phansy</hi> feed five thousand men with
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55305:70"/>
five loaves and two fishes? or four thousand besides women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with seven loaves and a few little fishes, being almost hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starv'd by three dayes recess into the wilderness?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Which things though not so substantially performed, are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in some measure imitated by Witches and Magicians, I mean in their junketings; whose viands are observed to afford so little satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to nature, that they leave oftentimes the partakers of them as weak and faint almost as if they had eaten nothing (as <hi>Bodinus</hi> relates of the Magical entertainments of that Nobleman of <hi>Aspremont,</hi> whose guests by that time they had rid a little space from his house were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to faint and fall down both horse and man for hunger;) and also to be of such a fugitive consistence, that they ordinarily vanished at the taking away of the cloth: whenas in both these Miracles many Baskets full of the fragments were reserved.</p>

AS for our Saviours <hi>dispossessing</hi> or <hi>ejecting of Devils out of men</hi>; as his <hi>raising of the dead</hi> was a pledge and prefiguration of that power he professed was given him of crowning them that believed on him with <hi>life and immortality</hi> at the last day, so was this a very proper Prelude to that utter overthrow he was to give the Kingdome of Satan, he being to dispossess him of all places at last. There's nothing can seem harsh to them that believe there are Spirits (and none but sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, profane and foolish men will misbelieve such things) there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I say, can seem harsh in this kind of <hi>Miracle,</hi> unless it be the multitude of persons then possessed, or the multitude of Devils in one possessed person whose name was <hi>Legion.</hi>

                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:55305:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. But as for the First, there may be many Answers, none where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of want their use and weight. Wee'l begin with what seems of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner consideration first: where we will not omit to mention that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy of <hi>Daemoniacks</hi> in Christs time above what we observe in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ages, may proceed from the differences of the skill and care that was then had of Mad-men and Lunaticks in <hi>Iudea</hi> and the adjacent Countries of the Gentiles from whence no small part of them came, and what is used now a-daies. It is, I say, questionable whether they had so good provision for distracted people at those times and in those places for keeping them within and ordering their distemper to the greatest mitigation they were capable of. For the stronger it is, the more effectual allurement is there to bring some evil Spirit or other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body of a man. For he ceasing to be his own, another does the more naturally become the master of him. As he that is not his own man through the soveraignty of drink, will find also many other masters buisy about him; all the boyes in the town stocking after him, and heightening his intoxication by their apish injuries. But I will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Secondly, It is not so strange that there should be a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of possessed in Christs time then now, because since Christianity the power of the Devil is much more curbed. For it is plain that where Paganisme rules, the persons of men are more subject to the cruelty of the Devil. As appears by what is recorded in History concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Inhabitants of several Countries; as of <hi>Madagascar,</hi> where the Devil afflicts them bodily: in <hi>Florida</hi> he astonishes them with dreadfull Apparitions, and cuts their very flesh off in his approaches: they of <hi>Guiana</hi> are beat black and blew by him, and the <hi>Brasilians</hi> so grievously tormented, that they are ready to dy for fear upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thought of him. The Apostate Jews that they fell under his power is the opinion of their own Rabbins: and the primitive Christians <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to Satan</hi> felt to their smart the rigour of his lash. All which may go for a sufficient proof, That the profession of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the worship of the true God in that way that he will be worshipped, is a personal protection from the gross assaults of the Devil.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A man might adde further, That not onely they that are <hi>duly excommunicated</hi> by the Church are made obnoxious to his Tyranny, but also those that revolt of themselves, and deny the Lord that bought them, by their misbelief of the sacred History of the Gospel, and the Personal office of Christ, even of him that died betwixt two thieves at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> As is notoriously apparent in some of the forlorn and giddy-headed Sects of these times, amongst whom, I dare say, a man may find out a greater number of true <hi>Daemoniacks</hi> then Christ and his Apostles are said to cure.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For to what more rationally then to the possession of these decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Spirits can be attributed those wild extasies they are in, their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down dead, the swelling of their bodies and foaming at the mouth, their neglectedness, sordidness, and abhorring from all order and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55305:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their antick postures &amp; gestures? one going in the open Marketplace with his head lift on high and his arms spread out, roaring and mouthing out fanatical denunciations; and another following him at the heels with a soft sneaking pace, his head hanging down as if his nose bled, and his hands pressing his navel, as if he were troubled with the Belly-ach; others creeping on all four like brute beasts, and wallowing and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling on the ground like dogs or swine. Others taken with <hi>the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted power</hi> they lay vacant for, were hurried on in a very swift pace on tip-toes, with their hats inverted on their heads, and yet not falling off, and their arms stretched directly upwards with their fore-fingers pointing to the <hi>Zenith</hi>; and this for so long a space as no ordinary man could doe the like.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Adde to this their being troubled with Apparitions, their fearfull and hideous howlings and cryings, their wild and extatical singings and frantick dancings, their running naked through Towns into Churches and private houses, their violent and irresistible shakings to the utter weakening of nature and making their very bodies sore: and all this transacted by <hi>a Power</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> which themselves confess distinct from themselves, which also speaks distinctly and audibly in them, and uses their arms and hands to the beating their head and body, which imposes upon them very absurd commands, macerating most, killing some with fasting, tyrannizing over them all in every thing, almost as much as the Devil does over the poor <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Creeping, crouching, licking the dust, eating of Butterflies, feeding of nought but crums and bones, such as we fling to dogs, Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage stalks and leaves of Coleworts scattered and cast away by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-women; these are smaller services of that <hi>imperious fiend</hi> within them. But this new guest countermanding the allowable voice of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture so as scarce to suffer a man to take four and twenty hours rest in five and twenty daies, to condemn him to the guidance of every foolish fly that comes in his sight, and so to adjudge him to hold his leg so long and so close to the fire (the fly guiding him the time) that it was scorched from the knee to the foot, in such grievous manner that it was not to be cured in less then a quarter of a year; these are more severe and rigid services of that <hi>infernal Task-master.</hi> Besides that, ever and anon this inward voice, and sometimes outward, utters very audibly to them some place or other of Scripture to a ridiculous abuse and prophanation of it; and not that only, but enforces the poor captivated vassal in scorn and contempt of the person of Christ to act some remarkable passages in his story, such as his <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Triumph at Ierusalem</hi>; the former by <hi>Iames Milner</hi> and <hi>Iohn Toldervy,</hi> the latter by <hi>Iames Naylor,</hi> who had his horse led in triumph by two women trudging in dirt at his entring <hi>Bristol,</hi> with <hi>Holy, Holy,</hi> and <hi>Hosanna's</hi> sung to him by the Fanatical company that attended him; garments also in some places being strow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the way. Such wild tricks as these are these deluded Souls made to play, to make sport for those <hi>aerial Goblins</hi> that drive them and actuate them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I might enlarge further upon this matter: but this short glance at
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55305:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
things might be enough to induce any indifferent man (that can at all believe That there is any such thing as Witches and possession of Evil Spirits) not easily to mistrust but that the distemper of this present Age has been such (and it may be still is) that if there were any such Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable person as could command them from under this <hi>Power</hi> by which many of them are so madly actuated, there would plainly prove a more plentifull harvest of <hi>Daemoniacks</hi> in these times then in our Saviour's; and a number more besides <hi>Iohn Gilpin</hi> and <hi>Iohn Toldervy</hi> would acknowledge themselves to have been possessed by the Devil. But at least we will gain this reasonable Observation from our Digression we have made, which will be succedaneous to what we mainly aim'd at, viz. <hi>That if one Age be so exceeding Fanatical above another, why may not one Age be as much more Daemoniacal then another?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Thirdly, Such distracted and Epileptical persons, as also Daemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acal, would not be talked of unless they were miraculously cur'd; which not happening in other Ages, they are not so much taken notice of. Fourthly, Our Saviour going from place to place, and his fame flying further then the motion of his person, he was likely to meet with and to have brought to him more of such persons by far from the Pagan nations about him, then otherwise at any time could in any like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood have been taken notice of, though there were in other parts of the World and in other Ages as many.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Fifthly, Those <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> so called in the Scripture, there is no need to take them all in the strictest sense: <hi>Mad-men, Lunaticks</hi> or <hi>Epileptical</hi> men, or any men extraordinarily distempered with Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, being by the <hi>Iews</hi> deemed and called <hi>Daemoniacks,</hi> the people being as much over-prone to ascribe natural diseases to the Devil, as many Physicians are to ascribe Diabolical distempers and vexations to Nature. But Christ cured the diseases by his word, (<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 4.39.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the people to call them by what title they pleased: as he that has a Catholick Medicine, is not very curious of either the name or the nature of Maladie. But there is no question but that there was a competent number of <hi>Daemoniacks</hi> properly so called.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Sixthly and lastly, Supposing all so called were properly <hi>Daemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acks,</hi> and that there were a greater number of them in Christ's time and in those parts then there elsewhere has been at any time, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience is there in this, if Providence would so dispense, for so good a purpose? as Christ intimates in the case of the man that was born blinde, where he professeth, That it was not his Parents fault nor his own that he was born blind, but it was the will of God it should be so, that he might have the occasion of doing the more glorious miracle. And there wanted nothing then but the Divine permission to make so many <hi>Daemoniacks,</hi> no more then there was any thing more requisite but the permission of Christ for the <hi>Gadaren</hi> Devils to take possession of the Swine, and so to hurry them into the midst of the Sea. And certainly they are very captious that will not permit so free a Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Almighty to lay some hardship on some few of his Creatures for the general good of the rest, especially when those Creatures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

may have deserved infinitely worse at his hand then he inflicts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and are compensated with a peculiar advantage for their suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. Some one of these Answers or several of them put together are sufficient, if not more then sufficient, to satisfie this first Difficulty.</p>

               <head>CHAP.

               <p n="1">1. THE Second Difficultie, concerning that fierce <hi>Daemoniack</hi> that had so many Devils in him, that he thought fit to call himself by the name of <hi>Legion,</hi> as being possest by such a multitude of unclean Spirits, though it bears at the first view the face of an extravagancie, yet if it be throughly examined it will prove a very weighty History; all being found congruous to the nature of things, and decorous and beseeming so Divine a person as our Saviour, who was to conquer the Devil and ruine his Kingdome, as we see he has in some measure done at this very day. That there should be such an <hi>Army of Spirits</hi> in one place ought not to seem strange to him that will believe the sight and report of the young man whose eyes were opened at the praier of <hi>Elisha,</hi> whereupon he saw the mountain full of horses and chariots of fire round about the Prophet. Nor is it any real incongruity, that there should be a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>Daemons</hi> or Spirits within the compass of one mans Body, though it may be so many of that Legion were not entred into him, but that he was actuated principally by the Captain thereof, he being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked by Christ in the singular number, and he answering as one in the name of many. Which we may as well understand of those that were near him and followed him, and had some maligne influence its likely on the <hi>Daemoniack</hi> by way of <hi>Obsession,</hi> as of such only as were entred into him and properly did <hi>possess</hi> him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For it seems by their petition to Christ, they were a Regiment of the <hi>Dark Kingdome,</hi> that use to rove and ramble about in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> out of which they had no mind to depart; those parts being more obnoxious to the Infernal powers, they abounding so with <hi>Apostate Iews,</hi> who being fallen from the holy Covenant became more subject to the Tyranny of the Devil. Wherefore there is no
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55305:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
necessity of granting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>a whole Legion</hi> of Fiends in this <hi>Daemoniack,</hi> but a competent multitude or some Chief one of the Legion. Though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any violence to their natures, there may many lodge in the Body of a man; these Spirits being able to draw themselves out of their usual extent into a far narrower compass, and perhaps wholly to quit their own Vehicle to make use of anothers; and so many may unite with the Blood and Spirits of a man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor need it seem so harsh that so great a number should be busied about one sorry Wight. For that military word <hi>Legion</hi> suggests unto us a very fit and easie solution of this Difficultie, viz. That this did not happen primarily, but by consequence; the Chief commander of this dark Regiment having his usual haunt and recourse to him, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>obsession</hi> of this numerous rabble is only by sequel: as if some Captain should make his stay for his own pleasure in some blind solitary cottage in the field; it would be no wonder to see the house beset with the multitude of his Souldiers, they being there in attendance on him, rather then in any satisfaction or advantage to themselves, there being not a proportionable booty for so great a company; but the place not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding would not fail to be foully pestred by them. After this sort it far'd with this miserable <hi>Daemoniack,</hi> who could not but be even stifled with the throng of this hellish <hi>Legion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor is it any question but that Christ knew how <hi>strong</hi> they were and <hi>numerous</hi>: and therefore that the greater glory may accrew to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and to him that sent him, he makes them confess their <hi>numerosity</hi> by asking the possessed his Name. And it was more fit that the <hi>Power</hi> of Christ should be demonstrated and the <hi>Divinity</hi> of his person, in chasing a whole Hoast of Devils relating to one possessed, then that there should be as many possessed as there were Devils, for him to shew his power on: For the victory is never the less, (the Devils being nothing the weaker for not appearing harnessed with humane flesh) and a great deal of inconvenience to Mankind was declined; besides the great noise and turbulency in the world which would have risen thereupon, which Christ ever avoided. But it was fit that this History should be recorded as well as transacted, that the Church might have the more <hi>strong Faith</hi> in the Son of God, who even while he was in the flesh had such Noble victories over the Powers of the <hi>dark Kingdome,</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to flight many thousands of Devils at once.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The truth whereof was very handsomely assured by Christs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting what these unclean Spirits desired, which was <hi>to goe into a heard of swine,</hi> which, the Text saies, was <hi>about two thousand</hi>; which was a very fair pledge of their <hi>numerosity</hi> to them that will not cavil; these impure Spirits, as both <hi>Trismegist</hi> and <hi>Psellus</hi> have observed, pleasing themselves to dabble in the bloud of Brutes as well as of Men, and therefore to lodge themselves in their Veins and Arteries. And <hi>Malice</hi> being as sweet to them as the refreshing of their other foul appetite, every souldier of this <hi>dark Regiment</hi> would be very nimble at seizing of his prey; and so they dividing their booty amongst them, every one reaped the satisfaction of his own foul and malicious mind, by entring
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55305:73"/>
the swine and hurrying them into the midst of the Sea: which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had not been able to doe, had not Christ permitted them. But Christ was not at all overshot in this concession or permission to effect their project: For though they desired it for mischief sake, that they might incense the <hi>Gadarens</hi> against him, yet he plainly outwitted them in their project, it being more serviceable to him then to them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For hereby was the foulness and mischievous virulency of the Devils more plainly demostrated. Whence his mercy to the possessed was the more fully illustrated: and by the loss of the Swine the Temper of the <hi>Gadarens</hi> was also discovered, the <hi>Mosaical</hi> abstinence seasonably coutenanced against the Apostate Jews of that Country, the swinish nature of men aenigmatically perstringed, and the Divine power of Christ, as I said, who alone could deal with such numerous troops of Infernal Spirits, manifested to the world; and the mouth of such fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous Allegorists stopped, as would make the Devils that Christ is said to cast out of the possessed, to be no Essential Spirits, but only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd Affections, as <hi>Calvin</hi> observes upon the place. Wherefore there is nothing of Levity, Injury or any Extravagancy in the whole Story, but all Circumstances therein are sober, just and usefull.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For Christ was not bound to hinder the loss of the Swine, their perishing being for so publick a good and of so great importance, as to assure us of the vast power he has who shall one day be Judge, and do final vengeance upon all the Infernal powers at once; and that, though he be so full of compassion towards Mankind as to lay down his life for the World, that through belief in him he may save them from eternal destruction, yet no softness or effeminacy of Spirit, or unseasonable pity to the brute creatures, shall hold his hands from doing execution up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unbelieving and obdurate persons; but that as here the Devils and the Swine were plunged together into the bottom of the Sea, so a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludge of fire shall be poured out upon the Earth at the Last Judgement, wherein all terrestriall Animals together with the Devils and the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned shall burn in flames unquenchable.</p>

               <p n="1">1. BEsides those <hi>Miracles</hi> which are referrable to the Four general heads we noted, there be also other Single Examples of different natures: such are <hi>His turning water into wine; The Miraculous draught of Fish; His driving the buyers and sellers out of the Temple; His walking on the Sea,</hi> and <hi>his rebuking of the Winds.</hi> To all which it is common with the rest, That they were not done out of any <hi>Vanity</hi> or <hi>Ostentation,</hi> but out of <hi>a Principle of Love and kind affection,</hi> being alwaies invited by <hi>some present exigency</hi> to shew his wonder-working power. As in that <hi>of turning water into wine</hi> at a wedding in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> which he did at the solicitation of his Mother, though with some reluctancy, because of the Envy of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> that sought to kill him; as also out of a principle of <hi>Humanity,</hi> they being at a loss for Wine (more company its likely for <hi>Iesus</hi> his sake coming to the Marriage-feast then was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;) nay I may say out of a frame of Spirit becoming the <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of his Person. For what is more Divine or God-like, then himself being utterly exempted from the pleasures of this life and the knowledge of the Nuptial bed, yet wholly laying aside all superciliousness and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrations to others, to countenance necessary Marriage, gratifying their lawfull desires (who could not well be disentangled from these things) in the ordinary and natural enjoyments of the Body?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The miraculous draught of Fish Simon</hi> pulled up after he had cast his net at our Saviour's appointment, it was partly <hi>a compensation</hi> of their long toil all night, when they caught nothing, and partly <hi>a prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of <hi>Peter</hi>'s excellent success when he was become a fisher of men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Miracle of <hi>whipping the Money-changers out of the Temple,</hi> (for so <hi>Grotius</hi> will have it to be esteemed, Christ performing it, as he writes, <hi>nullâ vi externâ, solâ divinâ virtute venerabilis</hi>) though it seem full of unwarrantable passion or fury, yet the Provocation was very just, and the Principle from whence this fit of Zeal did flow, the best that could be, viz. <hi>a dear regard to the despised Gentiles,</hi> (whose <hi>Atrium</hi> or place of worship the Jews did thus contemptuously prophane) and <hi>a just indignation against the Iews,</hi> who out of a fond pride and conceit
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55305:74"/>
of their being <hi>the seed of Abraham,</hi> though they prov'd themselves the sons of the Devil, scorn'd and despised the poor Gentiles for whom Christ was to die; and it was an Act full of Love and Heroical affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to right them thus while he lived.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His <hi>walking on the Sea</hi> it was to come to his Disciples that were toiling and rowing against the winde and the stream, he having in all likelihood not the convenience of taking boat any where to come unto them. And lastly, <hi>His rebuking the Wind and the Sea in a mighty storm,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity plainly extorted that Miracle, the Ship being covered with waves, and his disciples, as they conceived, ready to be cast away, which made them awaken him, crying out, <hi>Lord save us, we perish.</hi> So <hi>natural, decorous</hi> and <hi>becoming</hi> are all the <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Miracles</hi> of Christ.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is only one behinde, <hi>Instantia monodica,</hi> as a man may call it, an Example not parallel'd in the whole History of the Gospel, which is <hi>The cursing of the Fig-tree</hi>: the meaning whereof has puzzled many, as the narration it self has scandalized some; as if this act was guilty not only of <hi>Levity</hi> but of a ridiculous kinde of <hi>Ferocity,</hi> with a semblance of <hi>Injustice,</hi> if <hi>Injustice</hi> can be committed against <hi>a Tree.</hi> For was there any reason that a Tree should be cursed for not bearing fruit, when the time of year was not yet for the bearing thereof? This seems very odd and preposterous. But if it be rightly understood, there is nothing more grave, more sober, nor more weightily mysterious.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For my own part, I make no question but that the genuine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it is this, and what it signifies it sets out to the very life, viz. That the most acceptable and desireable fruit of the everlasting Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness was not then found in the <hi>Iudaical dispensation</hi>: nay, I add fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That it was never intended that that Tree should bring forth any such fruit, but only the fair Fig-leaves of an External and Ceremonial Righteousness, and a more overly and Legal kind of Morality; but the more perfect fruits of the regenerating Spirit were not to be found there, though Christ came into the world to exprobrate to them the want thereof, and so to put a period to the <hi>Iudaical dispensation,</hi> so as that it should quite wither away and fall to nothing, as we find it come to pass at this very day. Which Consideration, amongst others that occur in Scripture, more evidently confirms what we finde true in effect, That according to the Eternal counsell of God, Christ was mainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Gentiles, and that breaking this shell of <hi>Iudaisme</hi> in which he was brooded, under so many Types and Shadows, he should take his flight thence, and after spread his wings from one end of the Earth to the other.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But this Mystery having something of seeming harshness in it to men of less profound minds, such was the sweetness and inoffensiveness of our Saviour's temper, that he would neither scandalize them, nor grate too hard against the <hi>Iudaical</hi> Oeconomy, which that Nation so highly reverenced, and therefore recorded this Truth only in this Enig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical miracle.</p>

in other cases as well as in this: As in the manner of his healing him that was born blinde, John 9. where the Ceremonies he useth seem very uncouth and strange before one knows the meaning of them, but right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understood they must be acknowledged admirably fit for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: I mean, not for <hi>curing of the blinde,</hi> (For what can <hi>clay</hi> and <hi>spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> and <hi>the water of a pool</hi> avail for the restoring of Sight to one that was born blind?) but for mysteriously setting out some grand Truths concerning <hi>Iesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. As that he was the Son of God, or that <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> whereby God created the World and framed man of the Earth, in token where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he tempers Clay and Spittle, he being about to rectifie and amend the workmanship of his own hands.

               <p n="1">1. WE have now done with <hi>the Actions</hi> of Christ, such as were more extraordinary and <hi>miraculuos:</hi> we will proceed to his <hi>Passion</hi> after we have made a short comparison of the most famous exploits of <hi>Apollonius</hi> with these of our Saviour, according to those Heads we have already insisted upon; <hi>His miraculous feeding of the People; His curing diseases; His casting out Devils; His raising of the dead,</hi> and <hi>His predictions of things to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the First, I do not remember any example of it in <hi>Apolloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> his life; only <hi>Philostratus</hi> writes that <hi>Apollonius</hi> himself was entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the <hi>Brachmans</hi> at such a banquet as was provided in a miraculous manner, together with the King of <hi>Media,</hi> where three-sooted tables were brought in and plac'd in the midst without the help of any mans hand; as also the floor spread with odoriferous herbs and flowers; and bread, wine, fruits and sweet-meats on plates conveighed through the air and set upon those tables without any servitours to carry them. Which story being so very like the junketings of Witches, and the behaviour of <hi>Iarchas</hi> and his brother <hi>Brachmans</hi> being so full of scorn and insolency towards the King and the very chief of his retinue, his brother I mean and his sons, may fully confirm any man that they were no better then <hi>Magicians</hi>; nor their great Favourite and disciple
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55305:75"/>
                  <hi>Apollonius</hi> any other then a Wizzard and a Necromancer, as his conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up of the Ghost of <hi>Achilles</hi> does further prove.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for his <hi>Cures,</hi> I do remember but Three, the First of which seems to have more of the power of Nature and Morality then of a <hi>Miracle</hi>; he curing a young man of a Dropsie by precepts of Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the Temple of <hi>Aesculapius.</hi> The other was <hi>of one bitten by a mad Dog,</hi> who was so distempered therewith, that he would bark, goe on all four and couch on the ground like a Dog: But it looks so like a piece of Witchery, and <hi>Apollonius</hi> was so punctual in discovering what the Inhabitants of the place (which was <hi>Tarsus</hi>) could not inform him of, as of the colour, shaggedness and other qualities of the Dog, as also where he was, that it is a suspicion that he that cured the disease did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict it himself, or rather his Familiars for him; and so it is likely that the dog as well as the man was bewitched. For he came along from the river-side (where he was shivering as if he had an ague) so soon as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> had whispered in his Ear that <hi>Apollonius</hi> would speak with him: who told the people also while he was cherishing him and stroaking him, that the Soul of <hi>Telephus</hi> the <hi>Mysian</hi> was entred into him; which is a further confirmation of our conjecture. But indeed all the <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> of the Story are either <hi>ludicrous</hi> and <hi>ridiculous,</hi> or else <hi>impious</hi>; As his making the Dog cure the man by licking of him, and then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self curing the Dog by praying to the River <hi>Cydnus</hi> and slinging the Dog into the stream.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But the most famous cure of all is that, <hi>when he freed the City of</hi> Ephesus <hi>from the plague.</hi> But it being discovered already what a kind of man this <hi>Apollonius</hi> was, viz. <hi>a mere Magician,</hi> I cannot but suspect that the case is the same with that former, and that the whole City suffered so direfull a disease as the devouring pestilence by the hand of the Devil, to get the greater renown to <hi>Apollonius</hi> that stout <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aspistes</hi> of Paganisme, who for the advancing of his own credit was to free them from this raging evil. Of which opinion of ours there are two grand Arguments: The one his assembling the people in the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, and there incouraging them to stone an old ragged Begger, which he perswaded them was the plague, but it seems it was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a destroying Daemon</hi>; as it appeared by his eyes as he was a stoning, and by that delusion of a shagged Dog as big as a Lion found under the heap of stones, when the people had thought to have seen him there in his former shape of a patch'd Begger. The other Argument is the <hi>Ephesians</hi> erecting the Image of <hi>Hercules Apotropaeus</hi> in the place where this old <hi>Mendicant</hi> was stoned, which is a sign that Pagan Idolatry was the upshot of the plot. Wherefore I look upon these two last <hi>Cures</hi> as done out of suspicable Principles and upon extravagant Objects.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As for his <hi>casting out Devils,</hi> I do not remember any example thereof saving one, and that was of a young man of <hi>Corcyra</hi> who was a laughing <hi>Daemoniack,</hi> out of whom at <hi>Athens,</hi> by a many repeated me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces and imperious railings, he at last ejected the Evil Spirit, who for a sign of his departure made a great Image tumble down from the royal Porch in the City with a great noise and clatter. To this Head we
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55305:76"/>
may refer also, though by an improper reduction, his conjuring of a Phantasme that appeared to him and his fellow-travellers as they were journying on Mount <hi>Caucasus</hi> in a bright Moon-shine night: Which Phantasme went before them sometime in one shape and sometime in another; but by many vehement chidings, by many railings, reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and execrations, was made to disappear at last, and to depart, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and whining at the discourteous usage.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We may add to these the story of <hi>Menippus</hi> and the <hi>Lamia</hi>: Who in the form of a beautifull young woman made love to <hi>Menippus,</hi> and at last perswaded him to marry her. But <hi>Apollonius</hi> being at the Nuptials, discovered the illusion, and by reproaching the Bride, made, I think, the whole Edifice, (which was supposed to be plac'd near <hi>Corinth</hi>) I am sure the furniture and riches thereof, all the moveables, the Tapestry, the gold and silver vessels, nay the pages, servants and officers of this fair Lady to vanish at once, and her self only left was compelled to confess her self a foul carnivorous <hi>Fiend.</hi> So either <hi>frivolous</hi> or <hi>exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant</hi> are all the miraculous exploits of this deified Impostor. But all the <hi>Objects</hi> of our Saviour's Miracles were, as I at first noted, <hi>more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious</hi> and <hi>familiar:</hi> which is the greater assurance as well of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Sincerity of his Person, as of the Truth of his History.</p>

But our Saviour's raising of <hi>Lazarus</hi> after he had been four daies buried, gives sufficient credit to his other two <hi>Miracles</hi> of that kind, that they were <hi>reall</hi> and <hi>true.</hi> This Re-enlivening therefore of the new-married bride at <hi>Rome</hi> is rather to be referred to the <hi>Predictions</hi> or <hi>Divinations</hi> of <hi>Apollonius</hi> then to his <hi>Miracles,</hi> which were very few in comparison of the other: Of which yet we will give you some Examples, for it would not be worth
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55305:76"/>
the while to reckon up all, nor to reherse these at large, but only brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to name them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such therefore was the Discovery of the unclean lust of <hi>Timasion</hi> his mother-in-law in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the Prediction of a foul act in an Eunuch upon one of the King of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Concubines; as also of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Pharion</hi> at <hi>Alexandria</hi> from being executed amongst other Robbers that were led along to die, by keeping the Executioner in discourse till a messenger on horseback galloping with all speed seconded <hi>Apollonius</hi> his Divination with a clear demonstration of <hi>Pharion</hi>'s innocency. You may add to these his <hi>Divinations by Dreams,</hi> as that of the suppliant Fishes that besought the Dolphin's favour, which he interpreted to the advantage of the <hi>Eretrians,</hi> for whom he interceded with the the King of <hi>Babylon</hi>: and another by which he was diverted from going to <hi>Rome</hi> till he had seen <hi>Candy</hi>; a woman with a rich crown upon her head, who told him she was the Nurse of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> embracing him in his sleep, and desiring him that he would first come to converse a while with her before he went to <hi>Rome:</hi> Which woman he interpreted to be <hi>Crete,</hi> where <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> was born and brought up.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There were also several of his <hi>Divinations</hi> which he seemed to gather from some external accident in Nature. Such was that from the chirping of the Sparrows in the midst of his Speech to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> whereupon he broke off, to tell them that not far off a young man had spilt a sack of Corn in the street. And that from the Lioness the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had slain in <hi>Babylonia,</hi> as <hi>Apollonius</hi> was in his journey to <hi>India,</hi> which having eight young lions in her belly, he presaged from thence that it would be a year and eight months till their return. A third from a terrible thunder at an Eclipse at <hi>Rome</hi>; whereupon he lifting up his eyes toward Heaven, said that it were a great marvail indeed if this should end in nought. But his meaning was known by the after-clap, for <hi>Nero</hi>'s Cup was struck out of his hand, as he was drinking, by a flash of lightning, while he sate at table. A fourth from a monstrous birth in <hi>Syracuse,</hi> a woman of quality being brought to bed of a child with three heads, which he interpreted of the three Roman Emperors, <hi>Galba, Otho</hi> and <hi>Vitellius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The fifth and last we shall mention is an <hi>Halo</hi> which was observed about the Sun in <hi>Greece</hi>; which Meteor being round like a Crown, but much obscuring the light of the Sun, <hi>Apollonius</hi> his prediction was, that one <hi>Stephanus</hi> (which signifies <hi>a Crown</hi>) should kill the Emperour <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian.</hi> But for my own part, I conceive that the Observation of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies</hi> can as little help a man in such punctual Predictions, as of the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurations</hi> of the Starres: but that these things are pretenses and covers of a baser Art, or rather of some wicked Superstition and unlawfull fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with the Apostate Spirits. Which a notorious circumstance of the event of this last Prediction will demonstrate to the indifferent. For while <hi>Domitian</hi> was a murdering at <hi>Rome, Apollonius</hi> being at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> sees the transaction of the business so plainly as if he had been there, and at the very hour it was done encouraged <hi>Stephen</hi> to the act; and starting backwards and forwards, and staring terribly with his eyes, bad him
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55305:77"/>
stab the Tyrant, as if he had been present by to assist. Which phran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and gastly Ecstacy is an argument that he was then possessed of the Devil that raised this Theatre of things in his mind, and therefore in all likelihood foretold him them also before they came to pass.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Wherefore briefly to conclude concerning the <hi>Extraordinary acts</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Apollonius</hi>; in the one there is nothing but what is sound and necessary, of weighty and usefull importance and from a divine and irreprehensible principle; in the other nothing but what is either vainly affected, slight and frivolous, or else infernal and diabolical; that of <hi>Pharion</hi> not expected, which looks the most plausible of them all. For that Divination is no more then is performed by ordinary Witches; and that act of justice which was the reskuing of the innocent from death, though good in it self, was prostituted by him to base purposes, to the gaining of credit to a grand Restorer of <hi>Paganisme,</hi> and industrious up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of the Kingdome of the Devil.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2. Which I confess is as <hi>Brave</hi> in <hi>Apollonius</hi> as the <hi>Animal life</hi> will reach unto. But that <hi>Animal life</hi> at the best falls short of the saving knowledg of God, and is but that which in a manner is common to Beasts, Devils and Men. This therefore we will acknowledge to be in <hi>Apollonius</hi> a generous sense of <hi>Political Iustice,</hi> a severe profession of <hi>Temperance,</hi> and a great affectation of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> especially of things to come. But as for <hi>Political Iustice</hi> and Civil Agreement and Concord, which he seems often to be very sensible of, and earnestly to exhort the Cities to, where he went, no less then this can be entertained in the very
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55305:77"/>
Kingdome of Satan; which, if it were divided against it self, could not stand. And for his vehement affectation of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> it is evident that it is a mere branch of the <hi>Natural life,</hi> and such as is as competible to the Apostate Spirits, nay more by far then to an ordinary good man: and <hi>Apollonius</hi> his <hi>Temperance</hi> aiming but at this which is so low and vile, how far short does it fall of what is truely Heavenly and Divine?

But the strongest chain of darkness that he was caught in, is that of <hi>Pride,</hi> which though it be made of more subtil and small links, yet holds us longer captive then any. This is that which blemishes the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of his Life more then any Immorality else whatsoever. For to what but this can be reduced that scornfull and ridiculous Prayer he made to <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> that he would turn the countrey-people into <hi>Cypress</hi>-trees, that the winde taking their branches, they might at least by that means make some sound, they being as yet quite mute and not able to discourse with so sage a Philosopher? To what but this can we impute that magnificent answer he gave the keeper of the bridge as he passed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> when he was demanded what merchandizes he brought? To whom he reply'd, That he brought along with him <hi>Iustice, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Fortitude, Continence, Tolerance, Magnanimity</hi> and <hi>Constancy.</hi> He addes <hi>Modesty</hi> to the rest; but it was ill plac'd in so flaunting a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of his own praises. To what but this can you referre his cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the sober questions ask'd him by the Captain of the guards on the confines of <hi>Babylon,</hi> where he takes upon him as if himself was King of every country he came into?</p>
               <p n="4">4. But what need we recite particulars? his whole Life being nothing else but a lofty strutting on the stage of the Earth, or an industrious trotting from one Nation of the World to another, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Applause</hi> to himself, by correcting the Customes of the Heathen, or renewing their fallen Rites, and playing the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollable Reformer whereever he pleas'd: <hi>Which is a very pleasant thing to flesh and bloud.</hi> Besides the bold visits he gave to Princes and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, with the greatest confidence and ostentation of his own Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that could be imagined, making himself the measure of others worth, insomuch that he would not do the ordinary homage to <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danes</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> til he was certified whether his Vertues deserved it or no. With whom, as also with other Princes, he treated of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical affairs, not detrecting to intermeddle with the present administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Justice. But this unexpected audacity of his proved ever suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful, he alwaies, by I know not what luck or power, swaggering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into Respect, by despising the both pomp and persons of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test. So that he was ever <hi>haile fellow well met</hi> with the highest Kings and Emperours, they being ever taken with great admiration of his Wisdome. And therefore <hi>Bardanes</hi> is brought in in the Story cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him at last, and earnestly intreating the beggerly Philosopher to take his lodging in his Palace, shewing him all the glory and pomp of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55305:78"/>
his Kingdome, offering him great summes of gold and precious stones. The former whereof though he refused, yet he could not well ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from fingering the latter, under pretence forsooth that there was some strange Philosophick virtue in them, as also that they should be an offering to the Gods at their return into their own country.</p>
               <p n="5">5. So also <hi>Phraotes</hi> King of <hi>India</hi> is said to receive him with very great Respect, he carrying him to bathe himself in his Royal bath, and after receiving him at a Feast, and placing him next himself, above his Nobles. Beside the great Honour he had from <hi>Iarchas</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Brachmans,</hi> to whom the King of <hi>India</hi> wrote in his behalf. Where in conference with those Sages he was plac'd in <hi>Phraotes</hi> his chair of State, forbad also to rise up at the coming in of the King of <hi>Media</hi>; with whom (at that banquet which I have already mentioned) he having some contestation, the King became at last so much his friend, that he was almost uncivilly importunate to see him at his own Court in <hi>Media</hi> at his return.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Adde unto these his busy intermedling in the affairs of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire; his large Political conferences with <hi>Vespasian</hi>; his abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting conspiracies against <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi>; his learned discourses with the <hi>Babylonian Magi,</hi> concerning whom he told <hi>Damis,</hi> that they were not so perfect but that they wanted the benefit of some of his instructions, as he confessed that something he learned from them; his campling and cavilling with the <hi>Gymnosophists,</hi> who though they seemed not so great Wizzards, yet were not less vertuous then either the <hi>Brachmans</hi> or himself; and lastly, his <hi>plausible language</hi> and great <hi>Eloquence,</hi> he making in several places very winning Orations and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to Morality and the observance of the most behooffull Laws and Institutes, such as would tend most to Civility and the Peace and Security of the People.</p>
               <p n="7">7. From all which it is most evident, That a naturall sense of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Gallantry</hi> was the wing and Spirit that made <hi>Apollonius</hi> such a great stickler in his time; and that, he being of a lofty and generous nature apt to reach out at high things, the <hi>Kingdome of darkness</hi> hook'd him in, to make an Instrument of him for their own turn, and so to dress up Paganism in the best attire they could, to make it, if it were possible, to vie with Christianity: and that there should be nothing wanting to this <hi>Corrival</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Indian Brachmans</hi> pronounced him of that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, that he deserved to be reputed and honoured as a Deity, both living and dead, as I have already related to you.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But if the Excellency of his Person be better examined, he will be found so far from being in the rank of <hi>a God,</hi> that there can be no more acknowledged of him then that he was of the <hi>better sort of Beasts,</hi> that is, that he was a <hi>mere natural man,</hi> onely dressed up and disguised by his <hi>Pythagorick</hi> diet and habit, and a <hi>Magical</hi> power of doing of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; as is demonstrable from the whole tenour of his Story, there being nothing in it that relishes or savours what is above the <hi>Animal life.</hi> From whence we may safely conclude there is nothing in him <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>1.</hi> The Contrariety of the Spirit of <hi>Christ</hi> to that of <hi>Apollonius. 2.</hi> That the History of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> be it true or false, argues the exquisite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Life of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Transcendency of that <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> in him that no Pagan could reach by either Imagination or Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>3.</hi> The Spirit of Christ how contemptible to the mere Natural man, and how deare and precious in the eyes of God. <hi>4.</hi> How the several Humiliations of Christ were compensated by God with both sutable and miraculous Priviledges and Exaltations. <hi>5.</hi> His deepest Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely, his Suffering the death of the Cross, compensated with the highest Exaltation.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WHerefore we shall find <hi>the Life of our Saviour</hi> quite contrary to his, there being nothing recorded in him that is plausible to flesh and bloud, no splendour of Parentage, no streams of Eloquence, no favour of Potentates, no affectation of any Peculiarity to himself in any thing; but being every where reproached and despised, he ceased not to do good without any mans applause. And whereas the very Spirit and life of all <hi>Apollonius</hi> his Actions is <hi>a gallant sense of Glory,</hi> which the Devil befool'd him by; so that which perpetually breath'd in the Actions of our Saviour was a passive, loving, profound Spirit of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> which is the most certain character of the <hi>Divine life,</hi> of any thing that is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. So that let the History of <hi>Apollonius</hi> be wholy true, or partly false, or wholy false, it is all one to me. For if it be <hi>True,</hi> this grand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Divine vertue, as he is pretended, falls infinitely short of the truth of the <hi>Divine life</hi> manifested in Christ, there being indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing found in <hi>Apollonius</hi> that is truely Divine. But if it be a <hi>Figment,</hi> in whole or in part, how transcendent then is that Divine worth in <hi>Christ,</hi> and how lovely and illustrious is the Beauty of his Image, that the pens and pencils of the most learned and accomplish'd Pagans cannot draw one line thereof, nor give one touch or stroke near his resemblance?</p>
               <p n="3">3. And indeed how should it ever come into the minde of a <hi>mere natural</hi> man to think of an <hi>humble, passive, Soul-melting, self-afflicting</hi> and <hi>self-resigning Divinity lodging in any</hi> Person; or if it did, that there was any such great price upon that Spirit more then on that which seems to the world more gallant and generous? But certainly this is more precious in the eyes of God then all things in the world beside; and whatsoever injury is done to this, it is like the touching of the Apple of his own eye. And so tender was he over our Saviour, in whom this was so transcendently found, that he ever compensated his <hi>Sufferings</hi> with a proportionable <hi>Triumph,</hi> and his willing Submissions and Debasements of himself with an answerable <hi>Exaltation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:55305:79"/>4. And therefore his <hi>humble Birth</hi> he honoured with the <hi>Musick</hi> of a <hi>Quire of Angels</hi> from Heaven, and the <hi>Homage of the Wise men</hi> from the East who brought presents to him, as to a new-born King. So his long <hi>Fasting</hi> in the Desart was compensated by the power not onely of curing diseases, but of turning water into wine, and of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously feeding of multitudes in the wilderness. As also his refusing of all the pomp and glory of the World, (which was shewn him from the top of a mountain) by the <hi>Transfiguration</hi> of his person on the top of mount <hi>Tabor</hi> into so great a glory as all the speciosities of the world could not equalize, his face shining as the Sun, and his garments being bright as the Light. And lastly, his being carried from place to place by the hand of Satan, as an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Lamb in the Talons of an Eagle, this Temptation also was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply recompensed by having a palpable power over the Kingdome of Satan, and dispossessing Daemoniacks, and putting to flight many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of Devils at once, as you heard concerning him whose name was <hi>Legion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. But the emergency of the <hi>greatest Honour</hi> that accrew'd to him was from the deepest <hi>Sufferings,</hi> even from his <hi>bitter Passion</hi> on the Cross: Which was fully remunerated by so glorious a <hi>Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Ascension,</hi> by his <hi>Session at the right hand of God,</hi> and his <hi>Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion above all principalities and powers,</hi> whether in Heaven or Earth; he being made Head and Soveraign over Men and Angels, and indued with a power of crowning all believers with a glorious Immortality at the last day. Of all which we shall speak in order, shewing the <hi>Fitness</hi> and <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of every thing in its place.</p>

               <p n="1">1. FIrst therefore as concerning his <hi>Passion,</hi> I say, it is an enravishing consideration to take notice how this humble Candidate for so great an Empire as I have described, applies himself to his design, giving an infallible proof not onely of his <hi>Power,</hi> that he is able to protect, but of his dear affection and entire <hi>Love</hi> to his people, in that he can undergo so horrid agonies in their behalf; and being to win the Kingdomes of the Earth out of the possession of the Devil, how he uses no other Engine then the displaying of his own Nature, and the endearing Loveliness and Benignity of his own Spirit, to shame and confound the ugliness and detestableness of his usurping Competitor. Wherefore he did not onely tread counter to the wayes of Satan in <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> and continual <hi>Beneficency</hi> in his life-time: but further to shew the vast Disparity or Discrepancy betwixt that old Tyrant and this gracious Prince that is so succeed; whenas the Devil, as you have already heard, inflicted unsupportable penances upon his abused Vassals, ingaging them to cut and slash their own flesh, and frantickly to dismember themselves, to whip themselves with knotted cords or sting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nettles, to wound themselves with sharp flints, &amp; to fast &amp; macerate themselves so as to pine away in desarts, or break their necks down some steep rock or precipice, as <hi>Acosta</hi> reports of them; Christ, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ttary to this, is so far from such like Tyranny and cruel and handling of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that to satisfie us concerning the justly-suspected wrath of his Father, he undergoes all this load himself, to win us off <hi>to a more perfect and chearful Obedience to his holy Precepts,</hi> by so great and sensible an Engagement. The weight and power of his Scepter being mainly to be felt in the sense of <hi>Love,</hi> which is the strongest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie imaginable even to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55305:80"/>
natural Ingenuity. But the power of the old Serpent was exercised in fear and terrour and despightfull scorn upon poor distressed mankind. There being this great advantage therefore of winning of the Hearts of men from the Kingdome of Darkness to the power of God by Christ's afflictions and sufferings; it is no wonder that he submitted himself to them, though they were so unspeakably grievous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And indeed what can be imagined more grievous then that lively <hi>Representation</hi> of his bitter <hi>Passion</hi> (unless the <hi>Passion</hi> it self,) When in the Mount of Olives, at his devotions, he was in such an <hi>Agony,</hi> that he sweat as it were great drops of bloud that fel from his face to the ground? Besides the <hi>despightfull mockings</hi> and <hi>spittings in his face,</hi> with <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>bloody scourgings:</hi> The consideration whereof would drive a man to any hardship to approve himself faithfull and thankfull to so loving a Saviour. What then will the contemplation of his direfull and Tragical <hi>Crucifixion</hi>? where so Divine a person, nay, where the Son of God in the flesh, being disgracefully placed betwixt two thieves, his holy and spotless Humanity was so deeply pierced with the present sense and real Agony of Death, that the weight and burthen thereof enforced him to cry out, <hi>Eloi, Eloi, My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> And here he may appeal from the Cross to all the World in the words of <hi>Ieremiah, Behold and see, if there be any sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row like unto my sorrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Which <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> had it not been as <hi>real</hi> and as <hi>great</hi> as it is recounted, how slight and ludicrous a matter would the Mystery of Christianity be? How prophane therefore and execrable are those wretches, that would turn that to the disgrace of Christ, which is the Glory of the Gospel? as if our Saviour was less <hi>Perfect</hi> by being thus <hi>Passive</hi> and so sensible of pain. But it is plain that these bold and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> which boast so much of <hi>Perfection</hi> as to equalize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves or their blind guides with Christ, nay, prefer them before him, I say, it is plain they are so ignorant, that they doe not know in what the <hi>true Perfection</hi> consists.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For I have already declared, That in the person of Christ, that only which was <hi>truly Divine</hi> was to have the triumph and victory, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assisted with any thing that is precious and praise-worthy in the eyes of the world. And the <hi>true Perfection</hi> approveable before God is found only in that which is <hi>Divine,</hi> not <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Animal,</hi> such as would be applauded by a mere Carnal man. And such is <hi>Stoicism</hi> and <hi>Spartanism,</hi> a power as well relished by wicked men and Apostate Angels, nay, I may say, better, then by the holy and regenerate. And it is an Exercise of far greater <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience to the Divine will,</hi> to undergoe <hi>pain</hi> and <hi>affliction,</hi> when it searches us so deep, and stings us so vehemently; then when by any <hi>forced Generosity</hi> and <hi>Stoutness of Spirit,</hi> or any <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> or <hi>Artificial helps</hi> whatsoever, we bear against the sense thereof, and quit our selves in this heat and stomachfulness, as if we were invincible and invulnerable Champions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If it had fared thus with Christ at his Death, the <hi>Solemnity of his Passion</hi> had been lost. Indeed it had been no Passion, nor would have
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55305:80"/>
caused any in them that read the Story. But his <hi>Sufferings</hi> being <hi>so Great</hi> and <hi>so Real</hi> as they were, it is the greatest Attractive of the Eyes and Hearts of men towards him that could possibly be offered to the World: Which himself was very well aware of, and did foretell it in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time; <hi>When I am lifted up, I shall draw all men unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Which <hi>Effects</hi> of his <hi>Passion,</hi> those <hi>Miraculous Accidents</hi> that attended it seem also to presage. For what was that <hi>rending of the vail of the Temple</hi> from the top to the bottome at <hi>Ierusalem?</hi> what were those <hi>Earthquakes</hi> in more remote places out of <hi>Iudea,</hi> and the <hi>torn</hi> or <hi>cloven Rocks,</hi> but a Presage how the <hi>Earthly</hi> Minds and <hi>Stony</hi> Hearts of all men in time, as well <hi>Iews</hi> as <hi>Gentiles,</hi> would be shaken and broke in pieces with <hi>sorrow</hi> and <hi>grief</hi> at his <hi>Sufferings</hi> who is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World? Nay, what did the <hi>Sun,</hi> the very life and Soul of the natural world, what did that <hi>deliquium</hi> or swounding fitt of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token, but that this sad spectacle of the <hi>Crucifixion</hi> of Christ would so empassion the minds of all ingenuous men, and so melt their Hearts with love &amp; affection to this universal Saviour, that they would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly die with him, that they might also live with him and rejoice with him for ever in Heaven?</p>
               <p n="7">7. I speak not this to exclude <hi>other Significations</hi> of these Prodigies. For they may also have their <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>use</hi> as well as these, especially some of them: as That of <hi>the Eclipse of the Sun,</hi> which may also signifie that the true light of the world (he that was termed by the Prophet <hi>The Sun of Righteousness</hi>) was then a suffering; and That of <hi>rending the vail of the Temple,</hi> which no question denoted the rescinding of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Rites and Ceremonies, and the abrogation of the High-Priests office, Christ now having taken away the partition-wall, and given every Believer free access to the presence of his Father by his own Death whereby he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled us to God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Which offers us a third Reason why this <hi>Passion</hi> of Christ should be so <hi>Tragical</hi> as it was, and the weight thereof so unsupportable. For he bore then the wrath of God for the sins of the World, being smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as the Prophet speaks, for our transgressions, and the iniquities of us all were laid upon him; that is, he was an Universal Sacrifice for all Mankind. Which the proud and self-conceited <hi>Enthusiast,</hi> that phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies himself so well within, that he contemns all external Religion (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be of his own invention) being not at leisure to consider, boldly and blasphemously traduces him for weak and delicate, that willingly underwent the greatest pain that ever was inflicted upon any mortal, that bore a weight more heavy then mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> and too big for the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of any <hi>Atlas</hi> to bear.</p>
               <p n="9">9. As little to the purpose are the leguleious Cavils of some <hi>Pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Pettifoggers,</hi> as I may so call them, in matters of Divinity, who though they be favourable enough to the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ, and seem to condole his ill Hap that he fell thus into the hands of Thieves and Murtherers; yet set no price at all upon his <hi>Death,</hi> no more then upon theirs that died with him, accounting his Bloud as common and unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as that of the malefactors that were crucified with him; the Wrath
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55305:81"/>
of God being not all atoned, as they say, by his suffering, because it is unjust that an Innocent man should be punished for those that are guilty. But what Unjustice is done to him that takes upon him the debt or fault of another man willingly, if he pay the debt or bear the punishment; provided that he that may exact or remit either, will be thus satisfied?</p>
               <p n="10">10. But such trivial and captious intermedlers in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that take a great deal of pains to obscure that which is plain and easie, deserve more to be flighted and neglected then vouchsafed any answer. For all their frivolous Subtilties and fruitless intricacies arise from this one false ground, That the <hi>Soveraign Goodness</hi> of God and his kind condescensions and applications to the affections of man are to be measured by <hi>Iuridical</hi> niceties, and narrow and petty Laws, such as concern ordinary transactions between man and man. But let these brangling Wits enjoy the fruits of their own elaborate ignorance, while we considering the easie air and sense of <hi>Sacrifices</hi> in all Religions, shall by this means be the better assured of the natural meaning of it in our own.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Wherefore this being the sense of the Sacrifices we speak of in all the Religions in the World, it is more fit to interpret the Death of Christ, who gave himself an Expiation for the sins of the World, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that sense which is usual in the mysteries of Religion, then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the entangling niceties and intricacies of secular laws.</p>

And nothing can entertain the Soul of man with <hi>so sweet</hi> a <hi>Sorrow</hi> and Joy, as this Consideration, That the Son of God should bear so dear a regard to the World as to lay down his life for them, and to bear so reproachfull and painfull a Death to expiate their sins and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile them to his Father.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But this is not all the Advantage he had to win the Government of the World unto himself. For not only his <hi>exceeding Love to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi> was hereby demonstrated, but the cruel and execrable nature of that old Tyrant the more clearly detected. For whereas the Devil, who by unjust usurpation had got the Government of the World into his own hands, tyrannizing with the greatest cruelty and scorn that can be imagined over Mankind, thirsted after humane bloud, and in most parts of the World, as I have already shewn, required the sacrificing of men; which could not arise from any thing else but a salvage <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight</hi> against us: This new gracious Prince of God's own appointing, <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> was so far from requiring any such villainous Homage, that himself became a Sacrifice for us, making himself at once one Grand and All-sufficient <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="1">1. WE have seen how <hi>Reasonable</hi> the History of Christ's <hi>Passion</hi> is; neither do I know any thing that may lessen the <hi>Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of it, unless it be the <hi>miraculous Eclipse of the Sun.</hi> Not that the <hi>Eclipse</hi> it self is so incredible, but that it may seem incredible that so wonderfull &amp; so generally-conspicuous an Accident of Nature should be recorded by none but by the Evangelists themselves, Learning and Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in those times so universally flourishing, and there being no want of Historians to recount such things. This Objection makes a great shew at first; but you will see at length it will come to nothing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. First therefore let us set down the like Accidents to this that have fallen out, and been as conspicuous to all the World: As that <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible obscurity</hi> and languor of the <hi>Sun</hi> in <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s time, as also in <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s time, and lastly that <hi>Bloudy dulness</hi> in the face of that Luminary for four daies together in the times of <hi>Carolus Quintus</hi>; things as remarkable in themselves as this <hi>Eclipse</hi> at the <hi>Passion</hi> of Christ, and all it's likely proceeding from like Causes. But the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of these Causes so, as that the Effect should take place just at the time of our Saviour's suffering, this was <hi>miraculous</hi> and by special Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Now I demand for that First observation of the Sun, that indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a whole year together, &amp; was a concomitant of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s death; when there were so many Historians in the after-Age till <hi>Suetonius</hi> his time, viz. <hi>Livy, Strabo, Valerius, Maximus, Velleius Paterculus, Philo, Mela, Plinius, Iosephus, Plutarchus, Tacitus,</hi> how many of these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded so great a Prodigie. I doe not find any Historian alledged but <hi>Pliny,</hi> who likely had it from <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> who after the manner of Poets pleasing themselves to record strange things and to magnifie great men, recite this Accident in Nature in honour to <hi>Iulius Caesar.</hi>

Which condition of the Sun, <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, lasted for a whole year. The like <hi>Cedrenus</hi> reports to have happened in <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s time. But there were nigh twenty considerable Writers from <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s time till <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius Cedrenus.</hi> I would therefore remit the Caviller to peruse these Historians, and observe in how few of them this Prodigie in <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s daies is recorded. The same may be said of what happened under <hi>Carolus Quintus.</hi> And then if he deprehend that so remarkable Accidents be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken no notice of by many Writers that had a capacity of recording them, I would have him also to consider that such like Reasons that might cause them to omit the writing of those Prodigies, might also fit those that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the setting that down that happened at our Saviour's Passion; and to rest contented that he finds it recorded by them that are most concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in it, that is, Three of his faithfull followers, <hi>Matthew, Mark</hi> &amp; <hi>Luke,</hi> who bearing a truer respect to Christ's person then those flatterers of Princes, <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Ovid,</hi> to the deceased <hi>Iulius,</hi> recorded this Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous <hi>Eclipse</hi> to his Honour, as they did that long obscuration of the Sun to the honour of their adored <hi>Caesar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither is this all; for I may further add, That there are greater Reasons why all, saving Christ's own Followers, should omit the recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that Eclipse at his Passion, then that those Writers we speak of should the continual obscurity of the Sun, that was to be observed for a whole year together about the <hi>Exitus</hi> of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s Reign. For the noveltie of that in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s time might make the greater impression upon mens Spirits; whenas that obscuritie of the Sun at our Saviour's suffering (though I doubt not but that it was so great as that the Stars appeared through the defect of the Sun's light, so as they may doe in a Summers night) might well be neglected by the Nations of the World, they having noted already that the Light of the Sun is obnoxious to such obfuscations and dulnesses, and that for so long a time together. So that although this lurid deadness of the Sun at the <hi>Passion</hi> was far greater then that at <hi>Caesar</hi>'s death; yet it being shorter by far, as lasting not above three hours, it might seem to them less considerable; especially they not knowing what was the meaning of it. And when they did, they had the less encouragement to record it, it making for a new Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion contrary to their own. So that even that Consideration may seem a
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55305:83"/>
sufficient Reason why this notable Accident may be pretermitted by both Jewish and Heathenish Historians.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But <hi>Grotius</hi> out of <hi>Phlegon</hi> a Pagan writer ventures to answer more point-blank, namely, That the said Author does affirm that in the fourth year of the two hundred and second <hi>Olympiad,</hi> (which is the year where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Christ suffered according to the usual opinion) there was the greatest Eclipse that ever was known; night surprizing men at the sixth hour of the day (which is at noon,) and being so dark that the Stars were seen at that time of the day. He mentions also therewith a mighty Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> and how the greatest part of <hi>Nicaea</hi> was ruined thereby. To this purpose is there also recited out of another Pagan writer by <hi>Eusebius</hi>; whom <hi>Grotius</hi> discovers to be one <hi>Thallus.</hi> Which Testimonies will stand good till the Opposer of the Truth of the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Evangelists shall either prove infallibly by Chronology, That Christ did not suffer that year, or else by Astronomical calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That there was a natural Eclipse of the Sun in that year he suffered, so horrid and dismal as <hi>Phlegon</hi> describes. But <hi>Phlegon</hi> confining it to no place, intimates it was <hi>Universal,</hi> and therefore <hi>not Natural. Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> also speaking to the Pagans concerning this matter, appeals to their own Records concerning the Truth thereof. And for my own part, I make no question but that it is true in the very sense we speak of, viz. that it was an <hi>Universal Eclipse,</hi> whatever becomes of the testimonies of <hi>Thallus</hi> and <hi>Phlegon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. But being the Text does not necessarily implie thus much, we may with <hi>Calvin</hi> restrain it to <hi>Iudaea,</hi> God miraculously intercepting the light of the Sun from those parts only, by the interposition of some conspis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sated body, or by raising a black caliginous mist, such as he caused in the land of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> For the Scripture will sute well enough with any of these senses; so little of any just occasion is there left to the Caviller and Infidel. So that the <hi>Credibilitie</hi> and <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of the <hi>chief Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> of our Saviour's <hi>Passion</hi> is sufficiently cleared.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To which we have nothing to parallel in <hi>Apollonius</hi> his life, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be his Arraignment before <hi>Domitian:</hi> Where <hi>Domitian</hi> quitting him from the charge that was laid against him, yet he for ostentation sake, to shew what an expert <hi>Magician</hi> he was, vanishes in the midst of the Court, to the great amazement of the Emperour and the rest of his Judges. But in the mean time he having such a trick of <hi>Legerdemain</hi> as this, to keep himself from peril; it makes all his <hi>magnanimous Precepts</hi> concerning the Contempt of Death that he so gravely imparts to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> and <hi>Demetrius</hi> (encouraging them to suffer any thing for the cause of Philosophy) <hi>hypocritical</hi> and <hi>ridiculous.</hi> So whifling and ludicrous is every thing of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> if compared with that solid Truth and real Excellency that is discoverable in Christ.</p>

                  <note place="margin">John 2.19.</note> and then <hi>raising of it up within three daies,</hi> meaning the <hi>Temple of his body</hi>; as also in the application of that strange Accident that befell <hi>Ionas:</hi>

                  <hi>For as</hi> Jonas <hi>was three daies and three nights in the Whales belly, so the son of man should be three daies and three nights in the belly of he Earth.</hi> He deferred also the divulging of his <hi>Transfiguration</hi> in the mount till his Resurrection, as not being of any such efficacy to beget Faith in the people, till this also had happened unto him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now the grand importance of this so wonderfull an Accident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists chiefly in these Three things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>First, <hi>In that it is a very eminent Triumph of the Divine life in the Person of Christ.</hi>

               </list>
               <p n="3">3. That our Saviour Christ was the most illustrious Example of <hi>the Divine life</hi> that ever appeared in the world, cannot be denied by any but such as are blinde, and have no eyes to behold that kind of splendour. But that the judgement of the world might be the more notoriously baffled, God assisted this Divine worth with many strange Miracles, that they might more fixedly and considerately contemplate this so holy and lovely a person. But the more it seems they looked upon him, the more they disliked him, the whole World being so deeply lapsed into the <hi>Animal life,</hi> (the Jews themselves not exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

behold, His life is not like unto other mens, his waies are of another fashion: He was made to reprove our thoughts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Wherefore they having so settled an <hi>hatred</hi> against him, all the <hi>Miracles</hi> that he did, or whatsoever happened miraculously unto him, did but set a more venemous edge of their spleen against him. From whence it was easie for them to misinterpret and elude every thing, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting his <hi>casting out Devils</hi> to a contract with <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the Prince of the Devils; The <hi>Testimony from Heaven,</hi> That <hi>he was the Son of God,</hi> to the delusion of evil Spirits that would lapse them into Idolatry; His <hi>feeding the multitudes in the Wilderness,</hi> to Witchcraft and Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery; and his <hi>raising of men from the dead,</hi> to the nature of some Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical or obstupifying disease, that may seem to make a man devoid of life for four daies together. The <hi>Eclipse of the Sun</hi> indeed was a very strange thing, if the darkness was in the Sun it self: but they might remember, at least from the relations of others, that it was strangely obscured for a whole year together about the death of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> and so interpret this at the <hi>Passion</hi> as a mere casual coincidence of things; or that some delusive Spirits intercepted the light of the Sun in favour of the great Magician whom they thought just to crucifie betwixt those other two Malefactors.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But he whom they numbred amongst the transgressours, and took to be the vilest of men, because he was not recommended by any thing that the <hi>Animal life</hi> likes and applauds, (as <hi>Nobleness of Birth, the power of popular Eloquence, Honour, Wealth, Authority, high Education, Beauty, Courtship, Pleasantness of Conversation,</hi> and the like;) he is, I say, notwithstanding this general contempt from men, very highly pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by him who is the infallible Judge, whose waies are not as our waies, nor his thoughts as our thoughts; But that he might conform our apprehensions to his own, raised <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> from the dead, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that passive, contemptible Divinity that lodged in him into a deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved victory and triumph; exprobrating to the blind world the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of that Life that is most dear and precious to himself; making him alive whom they maliciously killed, and preparing a way to an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Homage for him, who was universally scorned and became <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>the off-scouring of all,</hi> though his Spirit, Life and Nature was of more worth then all the things of the World beside.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Nor is this <hi>Resurrection</hi> of Christ only a particular honour and high Testimony given to the person of Christ, who was so splendid an Habitation of the <hi>Divine life</hi>; but it is also an assurance of a blessed Immortality to all those that will adventure to follow his Example, that <hi>their labour shall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.58.</note> And therefore he is not said here to <hi>rise alone</hi>; but in token of what a general concernment his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi> was, the Monuments of some lately-deceased Souls flew open, and themselves appeared to several in the Holy City.

               <p n="1">1. THE last End of Christ's <hi>Resurrection</hi> is the <hi>Confirmation of his whole Ministry.</hi> For assuredly the Jews dealt with him as with some <hi>Magician</hi> and <hi>Impostour,</hi> who though he did very strange things whilst he lived, yet if he were once judicially tried, condemned and put to death, they did not make any question but that it would be with him as with other Malefactours, the trouble of him would end with his life; as is usually observed in matters of this kind: otherwise it would be a great flaw in Providence, and the generations of men would not be able to subsist for the insolencies of Witches and Sorcerers. But God thus extraordinarily and miraculously interposing his power, in raising <hi>Iesus</hi> from the dead, gave the most certain and most confounding Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony against the malicious cruelty of the Jewes (if we may call that <hi>Malice</hi> which the love and Candour of Christ in the midst of his bitter sufferings named only <hi>Ignorance</hi>) that possibly could be given. For their judicial proceedings are hereby not only in an extraordinary way made suspicable and taxed of injustice, but by such a miraculous means, that it is manifest that none other but God himself is their <hi>Accuser,</hi> as well as the <hi>Acquitter</hi> of the <hi>innocent</hi> whom they put to death, and did so throughly martyr, that none but the hand of God could recover him to life. The same therefore of so notable an Accident the chief of the Jews very well knowing, and that it would, if believed, demonstrate that all he did or said before in his life-time was right, and from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable principle; that the people might not receive him for their <hi>Messias</hi> now, whom three daies agoe they had crucified; hired the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that watched his Monument, to tell abroad that his Disciples stole him away by night while they were asleep.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But here haply some may demand, how it came to pass that these chief Priests and Rulers, being so punctually informed by the Souldiers (which watched the sepulchre of Christ) that he <hi>was risen from the dead,</hi> were not converted to the Faith themselves, and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that <hi>Iesus</hi> was indeed the expected <hi>Messias.</hi> But we may very well conceive, that what might prove very effectual to move others to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55305:85"/>
in Christ, might yet take no hold upon them; Partly because they were further engaged in this bloudy and direfull Tragedy then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were; and having a deeper sense of honour and repute with the people, then of the favour of God and love to the Truth, they might in a desperate and obdurate condition venture, as the saying is, over shoes over boots; being more willing to expose themselves to any thing, then to that shame and reproach that would attend the acknowledgment of so hainous an errour. And then partly because though this Accident may seem very strange, yet they might conceit that it was not above the power of Evil Spirits to perform, who might change themselves into the lustre of Angels of light, and therefore that it was but a greater temptation upon them to try their faithfulness and obedience to the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> For what would not they think rather then find themselves guilty of so grand ignorance, as not to know the promised <hi>Messias</hi> when he came into the World, and of so gross a crime as to be murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of him that from Heaven was declared the Son of God?</p>
               <p n="3">3. But out of this Solution you'l say arises as great a Difficultie as the former, viz. How we can be ascertained that Christ is really raised from the dead: Because some delusive Spirits might open his Sepulchre, and carry him away, and afterward appear in his shape, making use of his Body to shew to <hi>Thomas,</hi> or changing their own vehicles into the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of flesh and bones, so that no man's sense may discover any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. But to this many things may be answered: and</p>
               <p n="4">4. First, <hi>That that which may be an Exception or Evasion in any case, is of consequence in no case.</hi> For what does there at any time really hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, but Evil Spirits have a power to imitate so near, that our Senses may well be deceived?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Though they have this power in themselves, yet I deny that they can exert it <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>so far as they please</hi>; and therefore God would not permit them to add so irresistible credit to the whole Ministry of Christ by this last Miracle, if Christ had not really been the <hi>Messias:</hi> but he being the <hi>Messias,</hi> it was no delusion of theirs, but a real transaction by that hand that is Omnipotent.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thirdly, Every thing was exactly as if he had risen from the dead: the Watch saw the Earth-quake, and the stone rolled from the door of the Sepulchre by an Angel from Heaven: <hi>Peter</hi> look'd in and beheld the linen cloaths lying by themselves, the Body of Christ was missing there. He appeared to his Disciples elsewhere, he discoursed with them, eat &amp; drunk with them, they felt his flesh, and put their very fingers into his wounds. What greater demonstration then this could there be that he was <hi>really risen from the dead?</hi> And therefore by men indifferent it must needs be acknowledged to be so, though there be a possibility of being otherwise.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Fourthly, Those Miraculous things, either happening to him or done by him while he was alive, they being so <hi>real</hi> as they were, must needs beget <hi>Faith</hi> in the unprejudic'd, that this Accident was <hi>real</hi> also. For is it so strange a thing that that Divine power should raise Christ from the dead, that enabled him to raise <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of the Grave when
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55305:85"/>
he had been four daies buried? to say nothing of his other Miracles, and those evident Testimonies from Heaven that he was the Son of God. For though there was some room left for the shuffles and subterfuges of the blinded Jews; yet to those that are free and piously disposed, the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of Christ compared with what either supernaturally was done by him, or happened to him in his Life and at his Passion, they do so binde and strengthen one another, that there is no place left for misbelief.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Fifthly, Besides the Testimony of the Angels that told <hi>Mary Magdalen, Ioanna</hi> and others, that Christ was risen, and that they did fondly to seek the living amongst the dead, our Saviour's owne <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi> concerning his <hi>rising the third day</hi> could not but make the thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly sure to his Disciples, and all such as were concerned in it, and had believed on him before, whereby they became zealous assertors and witnessers of it to the World.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Sixthly and lastly, All these things happening thus extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and supernaturally to a person that professed himself the <hi>Messias,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 7. chap. 4.</note> at that very time that the Jewish Prophesies foretold the <hi>Messias</hi> would come; it is an unanswerable Demonstration that this was he, and that therefore all things that he did, spoke, or happened unto him, were no vain Illusion, but Reality and Truth.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Neither does his appearing and disappearing at pleasure, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in to his Disciples when the doors were shut, at all weaken the truth of his <hi>Resurrection</hi> and vital actuating that very Body that lay in the grave. For he gave a <hi>Specimen</hi> of a <hi>wonderfull power</hi> residing in him in his <hi>Transfiguration</hi> on the Mount; and that he carried that about him then that was able to swallow up mortality into life, though it was usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally restreined as a light in a dark lanthorn. His Divinity therefore with his inward exalted Humanity, I mean his Soul, took hold again of His Body, and did vitally irradiate it, so that he was as naturally united with it as any Angel is with his own Vehicle, or any Soul of man or any other Animal with their Bodies. Nor was it any greater wonder that Christ should <hi>rarifie</hi> his Body into a disappearing Tenuity, then that Angels and Spirits condensate their Vehicles into the visibility and palpability of a Terrestrial Body, the same Numerical Matter still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in both.</p>

               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:55305:86"/>1. THere is no reasonable allegation therefore against the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of Christ: And as <hi>Usefull</hi> and <hi>Intelligible</hi> a Mystery is his <hi>Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> For we are not less assured by his <hi>ascending into Heaven</hi> of the life and activity of the Soul out of an organical terrestrial Body, then by his <hi>Resurrection</hi> of her Immortality. For the body of Christ in his <hi>Ascension,</hi> though it left the earth in all likelihood organiz'd and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrially modified, yet passing through the subtil Air and purer <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> it cannot be conceived but that it assimilated it self to the Regions through which it passed, and became at last perfectly <hi>Celestial</hi> and <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereal,</hi> whatsoever was <hi>Earthly</hi> or Feculent being absorp't or swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up into pure Light and Glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor can it seem harsh to any that has well considered these things, that the Soul freed from this Terrestrial dungeon should have so great power and activity over a thinner Vehicle; the subtiltie thereof in all likelihood contributing much to this activity and vigour: Of which though she have but a small spark at first, yet the power of the Minde being kindled therewith may, as she pleases, convert her whole Vehicle into an Aethereal flame. For we are no more to measure what she can doe being rid of the fatall Entanglements of this Earthly prison, by what she does in it, then we can of the prowess and activity of some Captive Champion when he is set free, by what he does in fetters and hard bondage; or of her own agility, reason and perspicacitie when she is awake, by her stupidity and inconsistency of thoughts while she is asleep.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the whole life of man upon Earth day and night is but a Slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and a <hi>Dream</hi> in comparison of that awaking of the Soul that happens in the recovery of her Aethereal or Celestial body: Which though it be (unless it please her occasionally to mould it into any organiz'd shape) one Simple and Uniform Light, which we may call an <hi>Aethereal star,</hi> as <hi>Ficinus</hi> calls those of less purity <hi>stellas aereas</hi>; yet all the more noble functions of life are better performed in this Heavenly Body then in the Earthly, such as <hi>Intellection, Volition, Imagination, Seeing, Hearing,</hi> and the like. The same may be said of the <hi>Passions of the Mind,</hi> they being more pure, more pleasing and more delicate then can possibly happen, or at least for any time continue with us, in this life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What I have affirmed of this <hi>Aethereal Body,</hi> this Uniform and Homogeneal Orbe of Light, cannot seem rashly spoken to them that understand the immediate Organ of Sense in those Bodies we are now united with: Which I have already intimated to be either the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> or the <hi>Conarion,</hi> as unlikely a seat of Sense as the <hi>Air</hi> or <hi>Aether,</hi> and either of these as unlikely to be disobedient to the power of the Soul as the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> now are in the state of conjunction. <note n="*" place="margin">See my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course <hi>Of the Immortality of the Soul,</hi> Book 2. chap. 8.</note> And therefore it being undeniable but that the Soul does move them some way in the Body, I see no difficulty but in her releasement from the Body, she may be able to act upon her Vehicle of <hi>like Tenuity</hi> with them, so as to mould and transfigure it even as she pleases: that natural charm that lull'd her Active powers asleep while she was in the Body,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55305:86"/>
loosing its force now she is out of it. Which notwithstanding will prove no advantage to the wicked, they being thereby awakened into a more eagre and sharp torment and more restless Hell.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. TO the <hi>Ascension</hi> of Christ we are to add his <hi>Session at the Right hand of God,</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and his <hi>Intercession</hi> with God for his Church. And for the First there is no difficultie therein, whether we understand the phrase <hi>Figuratively,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> seems to doe, (For then by his <hi>Sitting at the Right hand of God</hi> nothing else is signified, but that he is next to God in the administration of his Kingdome, that he is as his Right hand to sway his Scepter over men and Angels, to bruise the wicked as with a rod of Iron, and to receive the righteous into favour;) or whether we understand it <hi>Properly,</hi> as some others would have it to be understood. For there is no inconvenience to acknowledge the <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified body</hi> of Christ to be in humane shape, and that this <hi>organized light</hi> will sit as steadily on an Aethereal throne, as a Body of flesh and bones on a throne of Wood or Ivory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor does that expression of the <hi>Right hand</hi> of God implie any absurdity in it, as if God himself were an Essence also in Humane shape, and that he had a <hi>Left hand</hi> as well as a <hi>Right,</hi> and the rest of the parts of the Body of a man. For from the words of the Text, <note n="*" place="margin">Mark 16.19.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a man may as well prove that he has many <hi>Right hands</hi> as any at all: which shews plainly that the <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> have no ground for their fond conceit from such passages of Scripture as these.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But yet though God be <hi>Infinite,</hi> and consequently every where at once, nothing hinders but that there may be some special presence of him in one place more then another, whither if a man had access, he may be truly said to converse with God <hi>face to face.</hi> We will grant therefore a Divine <hi>Shechina</hi> and a peculiar visible Glory of God which no creature can imitate residing in the Heavens, which Presence he may manifest in many places at once if he please: But whereever it discovers it self, it is a most certain and infallible sign that God himself is in a <hi>special</hi> manner there. Which ineffable and unimitable Glory is of this great consequence, that the holy Saints and Angels receive commands from thence as from the very mouth of God, are recreated more by that wonderfull lustre then we Mortals are by the light of the Sun, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55305:87"/>
that it is an Oracle with whom they may consult, and receive answers of clear and indubitable certitude, and doe divine worship and honour to the external Substance and visible Presence of the Deity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. At the <hi>Right side</hi> of this <hi>Glory</hi> might Christ in his humane shape be placed, as at the <hi>Right hand</hi> of his Father that sent him into the world, to whom also he praied with his eyes lift up to Heaven, and to whom he said that he was to return when he left the Earth, with whom also <hi>Steven</hi> saw him standing, and comforting him at his Martyrdome: whether his Visive facultie was in a wonderfull and stupendious measure fortified to discern so distant an Object, or whether that Object was not so distant as the false conceits of some vain Philosophers would deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; For for my own part, I think that if the true Philosophy were known and rightly understood, there would nothing more facilitate the belief of Christianity then it.</p>

                  </gap> will be found as Reasonable, if rightly understood. By his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> I mean <hi>his Residence in Heaven, and his receiving of Divine Honour and adoration from the Church.</hi> In which there can be nothing suspicable, unless there be any danger of <hi>Idolatry</hi> there where he that is truly God is worshipped. The <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 3. Chap. 3.</note> Apology of the Gentiles you have heard already, and how far guilty they were of that miscarriage in the worshipping of Creatures under the pretense of their being only more eminent manifestations of that One Eternal Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which they did adore. But the immediate Object of our worship is not simply a Creature, but God properly so called; forasmuch as he is as <hi>Really</hi> and <hi>Physically</hi> united with God as our Soul is with our Body. Now as a man is truly said to be a <hi>Body</hi> or a Corporeal substance because of the real or physical union of his Soul with the Body; so Christ is truly and properly said to be <hi>God,</hi> because his whole Humanity is joined with God. This is a very easie and intelligible way of conceiving this Mystery; neither does it implie any contradiction or inconsistency in it,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55305:87"/>
no more then is found in the natural Union of Soul and Body; God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as able to find fitting means of really and vitally uniting the Soul of the <hi>Messias</hi> to himself, as of uniting an Humane Soul to a Terrestrial Body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now this which was in the power of God to doe, we may be the better ascertained that he did doe it, or is to doe it some time, (For I will not anticipate and fall upon the Third part of my Discourse, before I come at it,) if we consider the <hi>Congruities</hi> thereof. I have recited to you Examples of the Pagan <hi>Apotheoses,</hi> how they did Divine honour to men that liv'd amongst them, and were considerable to their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for several benefactions and gratifications of the <hi>Animal life,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were the improvers of their pleasures or their profit, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers, successfull Commanders in War, or happie Inventours of some usefull things to supplie humane necessities. Hence it came to pass that <hi>Venus, Mercurius, Zamolxis, Mars, Bacchus, Ceres</hi> and others were deified by them. Now there being so transcendent an advantage to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew to Mankind by the coming of the <hi>Messias</hi> into the World, and he being to suffer for the Sins of the people, and so by his Death to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish the power of Death, <hi>and to set open the gates of Heaven to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi>; that that strong, natural, and at least pardonable propension in Mankind of exhibiting the highest honours they can to their most <hi>Heroical benefactors</hi> might not be frustrated and seem ever to be in vain; as also that the great humiliation and reproachfull Passion that the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi> was to undergoe might be largely compensated; and that that which is most lovely of all things, and yet in the eyes of men most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicable, I mean the <hi>Divine life,</hi> might be exalted, even in an outward Homage and Worship, as high as ever the <hi>Animal life</hi> was, in the World, and that warrantably and without any guilt of <hi>Idolatry</hi>: God, when he sends the <hi>Messias</hi> into the World, is so to communicate his own Nature to him, or so <hi>really</hi> and <hi>physically</hi> to unite himself with him, that he may be a lawfull Object of <hi>Divine worship.</hi> Which he is, if not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a Moral adhesion, or Political institution, but by a Natural and Real union with the Divine <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he truly become <hi>the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We see then upon what warrantable and rational grounds the <hi>Messias</hi> is exalted to so high a pitch of honour, God having made him supreme head over Men and Angels: I speak of the very <hi>Person</hi> of Christ as well as his <hi>Nature.</hi> For the shuffling and superficial <hi>Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist</hi> will acknowledg that the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> or <hi>upright Being,</hi> as some of them call it, is above all. But that they are so shie of taking any notice of the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ, is either out of ignorance in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, or out of a <hi>total misbelief of the History of Christ,</hi> wherein is asserted the <hi>Existence of Angels</hi> and the <hi>Immortality of the Souls of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Now if there be <hi>Angels,</hi> and if the <hi>Souls</hi> of men <hi>subsist</hi> and <hi>act</hi> out of their Bodies, they must also (as I have already demonstrated in my preparative Assertions) needs fall into <hi>Political</hi> order and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore must have some <hi>Head</hi> over them: Which here the Scripture does plainly assert to be Christ, who is the <hi>Captain of our Salvation</hi> for to assist, direct and encourage all the Powers of the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55305:88"/>
                  <hi>Kingdome of light</hi> to defend themselves and rescue others out of the captivity of the <hi>Kingdome of darkness</hi> and Tyranny of Devil.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Wherefore if any man start up and pretend an Equality with Christ, he is <hi>ipso facto</hi> convinced of ignorance in the Mystery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and deprehended to be an <hi>Impostour</hi> and a <hi>Lyar</hi>; or he is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Beast</hi> and an <hi>Epicure,</hi> denying the <hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> and thereupon building all his slights and contempts of the Personal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Saviour; he deeming him as all men else wholly Mortal, and therefore utterly to have perished above sixteen hundred years agoe.</p>

               <p n="2">2. But to this I answer, That though the <hi>Superiour Orders of Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Beings</hi> may have far more <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>natural Understanding</hi> in them then <hi>Man</hi>; yet the <hi>Humanity of Christ</hi> may not be inferiour to them in <hi>Humility</hi> and an <hi>holy adhesion to God,</hi> in <hi>Self-resignation,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> in him who is the Root of all things, in <hi>Love</hi> also and dear <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion</hi> over the whole Creation, and, in a word, in whatever apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to the <hi>Divine life.</hi> But as for the <hi>lapsed Angels,</hi> let them be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise as cunning and <hi>knowing</hi> in all Arts and Subtilties of Nature, let them be as <hi>powerfull</hi> &amp; as <hi>Gigantick</hi> as they will, even to the overturning mountains and striking down steeples at a blow; yet Christ has infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the preeminence of them in those Divine accomplishments I have recited; nay, he has a <hi>Principle</hi> beyond them, removed above their Sphere, as man has a <hi>Principle</hi> beyond Beasts.

But you'l say, Though it seem just that the usurped Empire of the <hi>Devil</hi> be taken from him, and given to <hi>Christ,</hi> yet there is no reason that the <hi>unfallen Angels</hi> should be brought under his sceptre, they being naturally of an higher order then himself, and having forfeited nothing by rebellion or disobedience to God: And therefore it had been more Reasonable for God to have united himself <hi>Hypostatically</hi> (as they call it) with some <hi>Angel</hi> then with <hi>Humane nature.</hi> But what art thou, O man, that pretendest to be so wise as to give laws to God? may not he dispose of his own and of himself as he pleases? Besides, there being so great a Revolt in the <hi>Angelical</hi> Orders, who tempted also Mankind into their lapse, the pretermission of them all in the conferring of so great an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as was conferred upon Christ, was but a <hi>just</hi> check and slight cast upon all their Orders at once; the <hi>Angelical</hi> bloud, as I may so say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tainted with Treason. Again, the revolt and rebellion of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state Angels being nothing else but a wilde and boundless giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up to the pleasures and suggestions of the <hi>Animal life,</hi> and Christianity (as I have already defined it) nothing else but <hi>a Triumph of the Divine life over the Animal</hi>; this Triumph, Scorn and Insul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation over the <hi>Animal life</hi> is more exactly pursued, by how much in every place those things that seem of most value to it are left out, as slighted and disregarded; and the whole Mystery of the <hi>Recovery</hi> of the <hi>lapsed Creation</hi> to God performed by him who undertook it without the false pomp of those needless circumtances of highness of Order, Nobleness of Birth, worldly Authority, Strength and Beauty of body, Subtilty of Wit, Knowledge of Nature, Plausibility of Eloquence, or whatsoever else seems precious to the mere <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Animal</hi> Spirit. So that upon this very account the <hi>Angels</hi> were to be excluded from this function.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But fourthly and lastly, If any <hi>Angel</hi> would have been competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour with our Saviour in this Honour, that question put to <hi>Zebedee</hi>'s Children might well have dash'd him out of countenance in his compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition: <hi>You know not what you ask:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 20.22</note> 
                  <hi>can you drink of the cup that I am to drink of, and be baptized with the Baptisme that I am to be baptized with?</hi> that is, Can you undergoe that shamefull and scornfull death of the Cross? Certainly an <hi>Angel</hi> cannot. For if he could be born into the World in Humane flesh, and suffer those agonies the Soul of the <hi>Messias</hi> did, this Angel were no Angel, but an Humane Soul. But perhaps you'l replie, that though an Angel cannot suffer death in an Humane body, yet he is so capable of torment and punishment, that he may be made an Expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Sinnes of the World. But I demand how we that are so much concerned in it shall know of that suffering. For the Transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men are a spectacle to the Angels, but the Transactions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are not discerned by men by reason of the <hi>Tenuity</hi> of their Vehicles. But this <hi>suffering Angel</hi> would have appeared on purpose: Yet how unsatisfactory and phantastical would this have been conceived in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55305:89"/>
of the real and assured Passion of our Saviour Christ.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Besides, If an Angel had undertaken this office, he could not have been so fit an Example of life to us as Christ, who was a man sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the same infirmities with our selves, and who really felt what belong'd to the imbecillity of our natures. <hi>For the Passions of his Minde were no more abated nor destroyed by his union with the Deity, then the Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Matter is by being united with a Soul.</hi> Wherefore Christ wading thus faithfully without sin or blame throughout all the incumbrances of the Flesh, which are <hi>greater</hi> then those that the <hi>Angelical Orders</hi> are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto, is a very concerning spectacle of both Men and Angels: But what an Angel could do, would but very little concern us men.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Wherefore he who was of so universal a capacity, as to be an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Good and a Reprover of Evil to all the Orders of <hi>Intellectual Beings</hi> that are pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which is the last thing I propounded, His <hi>Intercession</hi>; upon which I need make no stay, there being no difficulty at all in it, but a very great congruity, and such as is incompetible to any Angel, as I have already intimated. The Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> takes notice of it, Chap. 4. <hi>For we have not an high Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities;</hi>

               <p n="8">8. Thus we have seen how in the <hi>Birth, Passion, Ascension</hi> and <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> of Christ is comprehended a full and warrantable completion of those four notable parts of the Pagan Religion which relates to their <hi>Heroes,</hi> to their <hi>Catharmata,</hi> their <hi>Apotheoses,</hi> and <hi>Intercessions</hi> of their <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="1">1. WE have spoken of the <hi>Birth, Life, Death, Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Ascension of Christ</hi>; we will come to the Three last things we propounded, when we have briefly considered what in <hi>Apollonius</hi> is parallel to Christ's <hi>Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Ascension:</hi> For there is alwaies some glance or other in his Life at the most notable passages in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's. But I can finde nothing that must go for <hi>Apollonius</hi> his <hi>Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> from the dead, but his escaping out of the hands of <hi>Domitian:</hi> which danger was so great, that all men took him for a <hi>dead</hi> man. <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 4. Chap. 15. Sect. 6.</note> But what a whifling business it was and a mere piece of Magical osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, I have already noted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His <hi>real passage</hi> therefore <hi>out of this World</hi> must go for his <hi>Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> as his <hi>escape out of that desperate danger</hi> for his <hi>Resurrection.</hi> But the reports concerning <hi>his departure</hi> are various; some affirming that at a full Age, being fourscore or an hundred year old, he <hi>died</hi> at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi> But it seems not likely, <hi>Philostratus</hi> professing that he had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed the greatest part of the habitable world to enquire of his Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, and that he could hear no news of it any where. But so grave and divine a person as <hi>Apollonius</hi> was reputed, could not fail to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a very pompous Funeral and sumptuous Monument whereever he happened to dy, he being so famously known over all the World: wherefore it is likely that he did not dy, as they say, in his bed, but in some solitude, either by a sudden surprizal of death, or on set purpose, as <hi>Empedocles,</hi> who cast himself into the flames of <hi>Aetna,</hi> that he might be thought what <hi>Apollonius</hi> professed himself before <hi>Domitian,</hi> an Immortal God.</p>

               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:55305:90"/>3. Others report that having entred into the Temple of <hi>Minerva</hi> at <hi>Lindus</hi> in <hi>Rhodes,</hi> he suddenly disappeared before the people, and went no man knows whither. Others affirm that he left this mortal life in <hi>Crete,</hi> where approaching the Temple of <hi>Diana Dictynna,</hi> the doors flew open of themselves, to the admiration of the Keepers of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: who suspected him for a sacrilegious Enchanter, in that the fierce Mastives that kept the Treasury fawned on him with more kindness and familiarity then on them that fed them. Wherefore the Sextons bound <hi>Apollonius</hi> with fetters to secure the Treasury; but about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night he set himself free, and calling the guards by their names, that they might not think he would steal away privately, he went to the door of the Temple, which, as I said, opened of it self, and when he had entred in, shut of it self again: Whereupon were heard voices from Heaven as it were of young girles singing melodiously and chanting forth a <hi>Stanza</hi> to this sense, <hi>Come from the Earth, come, leap hither up to Heaven, mount from the earth on high.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. But concerning this History of his leaving of the World two things are observable. First, that <hi>Philostratus</hi> does invalidate his Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by varying the story so much as he does: For he professing that he made it his business to enquire of this matter, travailing most part of the habitable world for his better satisfaction, and not determining which of these three reports is the truest; it is a sign that he was not ascertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the truth of any of them, but that his end may be such as I at first intimated.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But suppose the last and most glorious of these Three stories was the truest; yet <hi>Apollonius</hi> his credit is much obscured by parting thus in the night, though we allow him a moon-shine night for his voiage: For then the highest Mystery (if it be not a mere forgery) that may be in it, is but thus much; That these young girles, the Nymphs of <hi>Diana,</hi> called and carried away the old Wizzard to the enjoyment of those disportments and pleasures that such ludicrous Spirits, together with old Hags and others of the fraternity, use to make with one another in farre remote solitudes under some broad-spred Oake, or on the top of some steep Mountain environ'd with woods and shady Trees, (which Solemnity is called <hi>Ludus Dianae</hi> by the Ancients, as I have noted already out of <hi>Mirandula:</hi>) where out of a special favour to him for the great service he did the <hi>Powers of darkness,</hi> they might break his neck in a frolick from some precipice, cracking the shell to enjoy the Kernell, or some more handsome way or other uncase him of his wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and loathed vestments of mortality; that so being stript more naked then when he appeared before the Tribunal of <hi>Domitian,</hi> he might be entertain'd with the more loving embraces of the Officers of the <hi>dark Kingdome,</hi> and receive the wages thought due to so faithfull and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious a servant; which were but such, though it may be in an higher degree, as other Magicians and Enchanters do receive. So vain, so frivolous and vulgar are all things in the life of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with what is recorded in the life of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. But be his departure out of this world what way it will, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55305:90"/>
that the <hi>secrecie</hi> thereof conciliated much credit to his person; and by adding to his Pagan zeal the spurious pretences of Abstinence, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity, Contempt of the World and other plausible showes of Morality, besides those Miracles (as a man may call them) which he did by the assistance of the powers of the <hi>dark Kingdome,</hi> he did not fail to be thought by some to have been carried Body and Soul into Heaven, as <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were, and to have obtain'd an happy <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> among the Gods. In confidence whereof they erected <hi>Statues</hi> to him here on earth, as <hi>Philostratus</hi> relates, and particularly in <hi>Tyana</hi> the town where he was born.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Grotius</hi> relates out of an Ecclesiastical Writer, that there was a Statue of his that spoke, being actuated by some assistent <hi>Daemon</hi>; but that his mouth was soon stopped by the power of Christ and the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospel. He dictated also certain Verses to a young Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of Philosophy in <hi>Tyana,</hi> concerning the Immortality of the Soul, who had for some ten months together earnestly prayed to him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve him of that point: which Verses he recited to his fellow-students in a frantick posture, starting out of his sleep, and averring <hi>Apollonius</hi> was there present, though none see him but himself: Which would make a man think it was nothing else but the continuation of a confused dream, which he compleated betwixt sleep and waking; it being no rare thing for men asleep to answer to more questions then his fellow-students put to this young Philosopher.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But his real appearance to <hi>Aurelian</hi> the Emperour seems more probable. For his forces, as <hi>Vopiscus</hi> writes, marching against <hi>Tyana,</hi> and the Citizens shutting the gates of the Town against him, incensed the Emperour so, that he made a rash vow that he would not leave one Dog alive in the City. But <hi>Apollonius</hi> his Ghost appearing to him in his tent, and dehorting him from so great a cruelty, and threatning him into a better minde, prevented the mischief; so that the town being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he merrily interpreted his resolution to the destruction of the doggs onely, but strictly charged his Souldiers to spare the Citizens. This story if it was not true, it was handsomly contrived, both for the keeping up of the honour of the deified <hi>Apollonius,</hi> by making him so seasonably deliver his native Town in so great an exigency, and also for the saving of the Emperour's Credit with the Souldiers, that he might seem by the Divine powers to be absolved from that rigid vow of giving the whole Town up to the slaughter and plunder of the Souldiery.</p>
               <p n="9">9. These are the main things I have met with concerning <hi>Apollonius</hi> his manner of leaving of the World, and the Effects of his supposed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity after he had left it. But (besides the uncertainty and suspicability of the Story) it is evident that they are very sorry and obscure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications thereof, if they be compared to the evidences that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for the real <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> of Christ. For <hi>Stephen</hi> while he was a stoning, to the great corroboration of his Spirit in his cruel Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, saw the Heavens opened,<note place="margin">Act. 7.56.</note> and Christ standing at the right hand of God in glory and great majesty. And <hi>Paul,</hi> as he was going to <hi>Damascus</hi> to persecute the Disciples of Christ, was struck off from his
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:55305:91"/>
furious purpose by the glorious appearance of Christ from Heaven: For there shone a very great light about him, and a voice was heard from Heaven,<note place="margin">Act. 9.4.</note> saying, <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</hi> &amp;c. His fellow-travailers saw also the coruscation of the light and were astonished, and heard the sound from Heaven, though they understood not the meaning of it; they hearing it not so articulately as he that was most concern'd in it. Which are Two notable demonstrations of the truth and legitimateness of Christ's <hi>Apotheosis,</hi> to which there is nothing comparable in the story of <hi>Apollonius.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. WE have now stretch'd the Parallel as far as it will go, the line failing on <hi>Apollonius</hi> his side: but so long as the matter would afford, we thought it worth our pains to continue the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that the Excellency of our Saviour's Person might more clearly appear, so illustrious a Counterfeit becoming his competitour; and that all the world may be satisfied, that it was not chance or luck, but the incomparable Dignity of the Person of Christ, and the weighty circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Providence, that gave such ample testimony to him, which made the world turn <hi>Christians</hi> rather then <hi>Apollonians,</hi> that is, made them rather embrace the Gospel then continue in Paganisme, though reformed after the neatest and most refined manner by the noblest and gallantest personage that ever was purely Pagan, the famous <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But that he may have the field clear to himself, it will not be
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55305:91"/>
amiss to digress a little further, and take notice of some few others that put in for an <hi>Equality</hi> with him or a <hi>Superiority</hi> above him: and the chief of them are these Three, <hi>Mahomet, David George,</hi> and the <hi>begod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man of Amsterdam</hi>; whom I dare not venture to bring into the list without a Preface for pardon and excuse for that which looks so like a piece of dishonour and disrespect to our blessed Saviour. But <hi>Duessa</hi> till unstripped will compare with <hi>Una</hi>; you know the story in <hi>Spencer:</hi> and the bold ignorance of some does ordinarily make others take a great deal of pains to explain and evince that which to any indifferent man is usually true at first sight. Which kind of undertakings though they be no great arguments of a mans wit, yet they are of his faithfulness and sincere love to the Truth, which is far better.</p>
               <p n="3">3. First therefore to speak a little of the two latter, <hi>David George</hi> and him of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> those two meal-mouth'd Prophets that court the world to follow them by so many mystical good-morrows, making the whole Gospel but as one long-winded Fable, and themselves the onely inspired and infallible Lights of the World, because they phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie they have found the right <note n="*" place="margin">the moral meaning of a Fable.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of it. So that their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency seems to consist mainly in these Two things; in a <hi>resolved infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> or <hi>stout misbelief of the History of Christ</hi> so far as it is <hi>Miraculous,</hi> and <hi>a dexterity in a moral Mythology thereof:</hi> whereby the <hi>Gospel</hi> is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly abrogated, and more fundamentally destroy'd then the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> is by the <hi>Gospel.</hi> For there was never any Christian so immodest as to deny the <hi>Miracles</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> and so consequently the Truth of the History of the Old Testament, which these do in the New; by which you may judge what they do concerning the Old also. For it is most likely they believe there were never any such things as <hi>Miracles</hi> done any where.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But if they believe there were <hi>Miracles,</hi> let them shew their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons why they distrust that what is recorded of our Saviour is but a Fable, and let them produce Miracles themselves to demonstrate to us that we believe a falsehood, and that God has sent them upon such a special errand as they pretend. If they can do no <hi>Miracles,</hi> God is no witness unto them, but they witness only of themselves, and therefore are mere <hi>Fanaticks</hi> and distemper'd <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> having nothing to drive them forwards to so bold and prodigious an enterprise as the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annuating of Christianity and the abrogating of the office of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ, but the pride and fury of their own inflam'd Spirits, and a phantastical conceit of themselves, as if God had inlightened them more then all the world besides.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If, according to the impulse of that Spirit of infidelity in them, they conceive there never was nor ever will be any <hi>Miracles</hi> done in the world, but that all things are carried according to the course of Nature; they betray themselves in this, that they are so far from being extraordinarily illuminated, that they are more blinde and blockish then every ordinary man that has the fear of God before his eyes; and that they are, what some suspect them to be, a skulking kinde of <hi>Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Atheists.</hi> But this I dare boldly say, that strip their style of all
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55305:92"/>
Scripture-phrases, and all allusions to the History of Christ and of the old Testament, you shall finde nothing affirmed in these Authors that will rise higher then the faith of <hi>Epicurus, Democritus</hi> or <hi>Lucretius</hi>; they positively affirming nothing but what any ordinary moral Pagan would affirm, nay not so much as the Better sort that held the Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Soul.</p>

But this is the wicked plot of the Devil in this Sect, that he clothes their Style with Scripture-language, that they may as it were wear the colours of the <hi>Kingdome of Light,</hi> and so covertly destroy or win the Christian Souldiers from their allegiance to Christ, and lapse them into the bondage of the <hi>dark Kingdome.</hi> So that that mighty prop of Faith in those precious promises of the Gospel being taken away, their heart may fail them in the hour of temptation, and they may be wrought by degrees into a full compliance with every transitory pleasure which the natural man relishes, whether in riches, honour or satisfaction of the flesh; and that upon whatever terms the world shall propound it to them. So far therefore are those two forward fellows of <hi>Delph</hi> and of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> from approving themselves so great lights of the World as they pretend, that they are more dark in their Understanding then many of the Heathen, who had some kind of glimpse of a world to come, believed the Existence of Spirits and the power of Miracles.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Which Consideration would make a man think that they were not so much as honest through-crackt <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> but rather knowing Cheats and Impostours, who being down-right <hi>Epicureans,</hi> but of something a finer contexture, could abuse their rapturous and <hi>Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astick</hi> complexion to deceive the whole Christian world, calling them off from Christ to an admiration of themselves: which might be a considerable profit, as well as no small pleasure to them; and under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense of teaching them the Great Mystery of the Gospel, might endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to undermine the Gospel by taking away the Substantial History of it, wrapping up ordinary Precepts of life, such as any moral Pagan can give concerning Vertue, in the mysterious dress of the <hi>Birth, Death, Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Ascension of Christ</hi>; making the whole Mystery of Christianity nothing but a finely-contrived Fable to set out some trivial moral Truths, such as are acknowledged by almost every <hi>Atheist</hi> and <hi>Epicurean,</hi> and the practice whereof reaches no further then the more advantageous managements of the pleasures and enjoiments of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent life.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I do not deny but that the frequent use of Scriptural allusions and phrases in their writings may raise in well-meaning men a sense beyond the feeling of them that wrote them. But where Faith in Christ is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct and of those promises that he made so clearly known to the world by his <hi>Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Ascension,</hi> I conceive that this is an infallible argument that the <hi>Divine life</hi> is extinct also; and that it is from some impurity of Body, Soul or Spirits, that a man sinks below that belief; and that his Vertues then are but <hi>Complexional</hi> or <hi>merely Moral,</hi> such as are found in a cicurated Beast or some better-natur'd Brute. This in all likelihood was the utmost of that Light which was in those two grand

Boasters; which compar'd with that in Christ, bears not so much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as the flame of a stinking Lamp to the glorious lustre of the Sun: Insomuch that if they had not been both by themselves and others either <hi>equalized</hi> to, or <hi>preferred</hi> before our Saviour, I should not so much as have vouchsafed to have made any Comparison betwixt them, or ever to have mentioned them in my Writings.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THE Third pretended Prophet and Head of the Nations is <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet:</hi> who though he haply be not so <hi>moralized</hi> a man, or at least not so <hi>cautious,</hi> as these Two we last spoke of, but more <hi>openly</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in the pleasures of the Flesh, if he be not belied, then these two <hi>Sadducees,</hi> were, and more able to enjoy himself in those pleasures; yet (be it luck or choice or mere policy,) he seems more orthodox in the grand points of Religion then they; he holding not only the Existence of a God and of Angels and Spirits, but also the Immortality of the Soul, and a solemn Judgment to come, wherein every man shall receive according to what he has done in the flesh, whether it be good or evil.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Success of this pretender has been so wonderfully great in the world, that I think it not amiss to make somewhat a longer stay upon him then upon the two former. We shall therefore take notice what pitch he sets himself at, and after endeavour to level him and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to his due place.</p>
               <p>If we will then believe his own testimony, we shall find him so much favoured by God and the Heavenly Powers, as to be <hi>carried up into the highest Heavens,</hi> at least by <hi>Vision.</hi> But he tells the story of himself
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55305:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as if it was <hi>a real transaction,</hi> viz. That once about midnight the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> knocked at his door, and told him that he should travail up to Heaven, for God Almighty would speak with him. That the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel brought along with him a milkùwhite Beast called <hi>Alborach,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing bigger then an Ass, but less then a Mule, which the Angel bad <hi>Mahomet</hi> get upon: but the Beast kicking and refusing his Rider, the Angel asked him why he did so, for he never did nor ever could receive upon his back a better man then <hi>Mahomet.</hi> But <hi>Alborach</hi> answered, he would not admit him, unless he would promise to procure him an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into Paradise: which <hi>Mahomet</hi> promising, he got up, and the Angel led the Beast by the rains of the bridle, till they were come to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Now as they were in their way upon their journey, <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> heard the voice of a certain woman crying to him aloud, <hi>Mahomet, Mahomet</hi>; but the Angel forbad him to answer: and when they had gone further, another woman called him after the same manner; but the Angel commanded him to hold his peace. And that afterward he asked the Angel what these women were: to which the Angel replied, that the First was the Promulgatress of the <hi>Iewish,</hi> the Second of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> law; and that if he had answered to the first woman, all the <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi> had become <hi>Iews,</hi> if to the second, <hi>Christians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. When they had come to the gate of the Temple at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that <hi>Mahomet</hi> lighted off from his beast <hi>Alborach,</hi> and that he and the Angel went into the Temple, where all the Prophets and Messengers of God that ever came into the world met him and saluted him, saying, <hi>Ioy to the Messenger and honourable Prophet of God.</hi> Afterwards waiting on him in great pomp to the Chappell <hi>Mihrab,</hi> with much reverence they desired him that he would pray for them all: which when he had done, they besought him also that he would be mindfull of them when he came into the presence of God. This done, they all went away, and <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> and the Angel were left alone in the Temple.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By which crafty figment <hi>Mahomet</hi> assuredly meant nothing else but a justification of himself for beginning a <hi>Third</hi> Sect, distinct from the Religions of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> and the recommendation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the World as the greatest Prophet that ever yet appeared on earth. But we are not come to the height of the Vision yet.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Angel and <hi>Mahomet</hi> afterwards coming out of the Temple, found a <hi>Ladder</hi> made of Divine light which reached from Earth to Heaven, whereby they both, <hi>Mahomet</hi> bearing himself upon the Angels hand, ascended up thither, passing through seven Heavens; The first of pure Silver where <hi>Adam</hi> was, the second of Gold where <hi>Noah,</hi> the third of a certain precious Gemme wherein was <hi>Abraham,</hi> the fourth of <hi>Sma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragdus</hi> wherein <hi>Ioseph,</hi> the fifth of <hi>Adamant</hi> wherein <hi>Moses,</hi> the sixth of <hi>Carbuncle</hi> wherein <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> was found, and the seventh of Celestial light wherein was <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> All these venerable perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages welcomed <hi>Mahomet</hi> with loving salutations and kind embraces, and commended themselves to him; but in the seventh Heaven <hi>Mahomet</hi> seems to commend himself to Christ. The infinite numbers, monstrous figures and immense bignesse of Angels that he sets off his <hi>Vision</hi> by, for
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55305:93"/>
the greater astonishment of his Followers, I thought good to omit, as being too vile and tedious, and he is not got to his journies end yet.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> takes leave of him in this seventh heaven, telling him he may goe no further with him, but that God alone now must be his guide. <hi>Mahomet</hi> therefore holding on his journie, was carried on the tops of incredible heights and sublimities, wading through much water and deep snow, insomuch that he had been quite spent, had not a voice refreshed him, saying, <hi>Mahomet, come hither and salute thy Creatour.</hi> He following therefore the sound of this voice, saw so great a Light, that he was almost blinded therewith: For the Face of God was cover'd with veiles of Celestial light seventy miles thick; to which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached within the space of two flight shot, but could not see the face of God by reason of the hot gleames and glorious raies that streamed from those veils of light. But God laid his hand upon him to refresh him, which felt exceeding cold.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In this congress he received the <hi>Law</hi> from God and many wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full secrets: but he glories most of all that in this night he had conferr'd upon him <hi>Five things</hi> which no man before or after ever had.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>First, <hi>That God then made him the first and most chief Creature in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in Earth.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, <hi>That he should be the most excellent and most honourable amongst the Sons of Adam at the day of Iudgment.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Thirdly, <hi>That he should be the general Redeemer of the World.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Fourthly, <hi>That he should have the knowledge of all tongues.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Fifthly and lastly, <hi>That he should be victorious, and carry away the spoils of war.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="8">8. We see how high <hi>Mahomet</hi> has mounted himself, &amp; how much Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical craft is intermix'd with this fanatical figment. For <hi>Enthusiastick</hi> madness, as it is never disjoined from the highest kinde of <hi>pride,</hi> even there where it seems to be most humble, (For the attributing nothing to it self, but that all its <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>power</hi> is immediately from God, is nothing else but an ostentation of an <hi>higher</hi> kind of <hi>Power</hi> and more <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi> way of <hi>knowledge</hi> then other Mortals have, of which this <hi>Vision</hi> of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s is a lively Representation) so it has very often strange and unexpected fetches of fraud and guile in it, such as would not easily come into the mind of an ordinary sober man. Whereby an <hi>Enthusiast</hi> amongst rude people, if he be not quite crackt, but be of an active spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and have opportunity offered him, may doe wonderfull things in the world, such as no sober man could ever atchieve or dare to attempt. Such is the case of this <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who in the midst of his fanatical mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, wilde mirth, insatiable lust and ambition, Poetical raptures and Martial fury, lai'd the foundation of that mighty Empire that all the world stands amazed at at this day. The first step to which was that <hi>Enthusiastick</hi> phrensie that emboldened him either to think or at least to profess himself <hi>The Last and Greatest Prophet that ever God would send into the World.</hi> For the bold inculcation of this, seconded with many occasional fetches of wit to save himself when his impostures were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, carried the business successfully with that rude nation he had to deal with.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:55305:94"/>9. As for that <hi>Pride</hi> that accompanies <hi>Fanatical</hi> madness, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess there were others had their minds set as high on that rack as he, I mean <hi>David George,</hi> he of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Doctour, and others who affected the same <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> with him, and it may be being more throughly mad (at least some of them) did more firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve themselves to be <hi>That great Prophet</hi> God would send into the world then <hi>Mahomet</hi> did. But <hi>Mahomet</hi> having a more <hi>governable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm</hi> in him, and a more <hi>Martial</hi> and <hi>Political</hi> Spirit, and, what is chiefest of all, <hi>better opportunity</hi> of playing his game, as having to deal with <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>illiterate</hi> people; his success did not only exceed theirs, but prov'd so admirable, as it might have become a True Prophet indeed.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. <hi>1.</hi> That <hi>Mahomet</hi> was no true Prophet, discovered from his cruel and bloudy Precepts. <hi>2.</hi> From his insatiable Lust. <hi>3.</hi> From his wildeness of Phansy, and Ignorance in things.

               <p n="1">1. BUT. that he was <hi>not a true Prophet,</hi> but a mere <hi>Political Enthusiast</hi> of a vafrous and versatil wit, with a little smack of cracktness and Lunacy, is very deprehensible as well from his <hi>Immorality</hi> as his <hi>Ignorance</hi> of things, and the <hi>Wildness of his Phansy.</hi> I shall give some few Instances of each. And to the First I refer his <hi>Cruelty,</hi> in giving Laws to butcher all men that would not presently turn to his Religion. Which Precept is set down in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> as also in <hi>Zuna, Occidite ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, quousque omnes Mauri fiant.</hi> And that they may act this Tragedy more zealously, and not be affraid of being kill'd themselves, he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them so great a joy in that death (besides their speedy entrance into Paradise, and feasting it there with their Creatour) that they would even willingly leave Paradise, and come again into the flesh to be capable again of so great joy as that kinde of Death affords them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Besides that he was thus <hi>Cruel,</hi> he was also <hi>insatiably Venereous,</hi> as may be gathered by several acts of his; as his taking away his servant <hi>Zeydin</hi>'s wife from him, whenas himself had no less then nine at home already of his own, and <hi>Zeydin</hi> but this one. In the book <hi>Azear</hi> and <hi>Assameil</hi> he is said to have fifteen wives, and extolled for his virility in that he had to doe with them all in one hour. He committed Adultery
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55305:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
also with one <hi>Marina,</hi> a Jewish girle, which was given him of fifteen years of age; and being caught in the act by <hi>Axa</hi> and <hi>Hafeza</hi> the two chiefest of his wives, and chid for it, he swore to them he would never meddle with her again: but his <hi>Lust</hi> being stronger then the obligation of an oath, his two wives found him at that unlawfull game once more: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Mahomet</hi> enlarged the Laws of Matrimony, to save his own credit, and made it lawfull for all his followers to have to do with their maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servants. He is said also when he had already seven wives, to have married that <hi>Axa</hi> at six years of Age, and to have lyen with her when she was but eight years old. Finally at last he set no bounds to his lust, but taught the people he might lie with whom he would, though he kept them within a certain stint: whereby he was not so kind as <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Enthusias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Triumpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> sect. 34. art. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid George,</hi> that permitted this freedom to all his followers as well as to himself.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His <hi>Wildness of Phansy</hi> and <hi>Ignorance in things</hi> is evident in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral passages; as his making <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of <hi>Iesus,</hi> the Sister of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>; in asserting the Stars to be hung in golden chains, and that the biggest of them are no bigger then a great mountain; in affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that God has established the Earth on a <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Iohan. Andr. Confus. Secta Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanae, cap.</hi> 5.</note> Bulls horn, and that the shaking of his head is the cause of Earthquakes. This <hi>Mahomet</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers in the Book <hi>Zuna:</hi> where also he teaches how when a man is bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, two black Angels come unto him, and force him to raise himself on his knees, and to put on his Soul upon the out-side of his Body as a shirt or surplice; which done, they examine him whether he believe in the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> with a deal of other stuff to that purpose. That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is a wonderfull fine fiction of his, That when he was four year old, the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> took him by the hand, and led him behinde a Hill, and there with a sharp rasor cut up his breast, and took out his <hi>Heart,</hi> which having cleansed of <hi>a black speck,</hi> he after put it in again. But it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the effect, that the Angel did not use his incision-knife for the best advantage for preventing of those so many and so enormous acts of Adultery which <hi>Mahomet</hi> was famous for: or it may be the meaning is, that that <hi>black speck</hi> being taken out, he was then <hi>impeccable,</hi> I mean, in that <hi>Fanatick</hi> sense, <hi>that doe what he would, he could not sin,</hi> no not though he lay with his own Mother or murthered his Father; a wilde conceit of some <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> of these daies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It would be an endless labour to record all the <hi>Follies</hi> of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, the most judicious whereof is his <hi>Pretense to Miracles.</hi> For he that has neither <hi>Miracles</hi> nor can feign any, what face has he to profess himself a <hi>Prophet?</hi> The <hi>first Miracle</hi> he pretends to we have mentioned already, which was <hi>the cleansing of his Heart of the black spot,</hi> which makes men obnoxious to be assaulted by the Devil, as the <hi>Mahometans</hi> conceive.</p>
               <p>The second happened when he was seventeen years old, when a Cloud like a Canopy kept over his head in an hot day, as he travailed with his masters Camels. To these you may adde his being saluted by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel in the cave, and spoken to by Stones and Trees and brute Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with this compellation, <hi>Haile</hi> MAHOMET, <hi>the Messenger of God,</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:55305:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as also the weeping of a dry trunk of a Palm-tree at his departure and exile from <hi>Mecha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. But the Three most notable <hi>Miracles</hi> are still behind. The First whereof is the cleaving of the stock of a Tree by <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s stumbling at it, as he was walking with his eyes devoutly looking up unto Heaven. For the Tree clove of it self, to give the holy Prophet passage; but when he was gone by, presently grew together again.</p>
               <p>The Second is the cluttering of Trees together to keep the Sun off from him, and the retiring of them every one to his own place at his command. in <hi>Zuna, Mahomet</hi> more particularly affirms, that on a day he doing the necessities of Nature in an open place, he commanded two Trees to come to him to keep off the heat of the Sun from him; which they did immediately, their roots being torn out of the Earth: and that he commanding them to return, the Trees obeyed, and were fastened into the Earth in their own place as before.</p>
               <p>But the last and most notable <hi>Miracle,</hi> which equally argues his <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of Nature</hi> as well as the <hi>Wildness of his Phansie,</hi> is his dividing of the Moon into two parts, and making one part goe into one of his sleeves and the other into the other, and both of them to come out at his neck, and then soadering of both parts together, and so restoring her to the same place in Heaven from whence by his prayer he made her to descend. Of which <hi>Miracles</hi> this is briefly to be noted, That as some of them are <hi>not possible,</hi> so none of them that are, are pretended to be done <hi>before witnesses</hi>; and that most of them are very <hi>foolish</hi> and <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. These things are recorded by a very grave and pious person and a true and sincere Christian, so far as I can discern, <hi>Iohannes Andreas,</hi> the son and successour of <hi>Abdalla</hi> a <hi>Mahometan</hi> Priest, a man throughly-well skill'd in the Religion and Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who after his conversion to Christianity wrote a Book, and in my apprehension with a great deal of honesty and judgment, concerning the Imposture of <hi>Mahometism</hi>; out of which I have recited what you have heard, and might adde much more both out of him and other Writers. But this will suffice to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate <hi>Mahomet</hi> to be such as I have characterized him, and make us by such comparison as these the better understand, and the more sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly relish, <hi>the Sobriety, Decency, and unexceptionable Solidity of our own Religion.</hi>

AFter our something-long but needfull Digression to view the false and unsound waies that <hi>Mahomet, David George</hi> and <hi>his Fanatical fellow of Amsterdam</hi> would lead men in, we return now to that faithfull way and true guide <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> whose <hi>Resurrection, Ascension</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theosis</hi> we having passed through, we shall now proceed to the Three last things we propounded, all which are very natural and suitable <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences</hi> of his <hi>Apotheosis,</hi> his sitting and ruling of the world at the right hand of the Father: And they are these; <hi>His sending of the Holy Ghost at the day of Pentecost, and enabling his Apostles and Disciples to doe Miracles: The great Success of their Endeavours in the World, they being thus assisted by so Miraculous a power</hi>; And <hi>Christ's visible return into the World, to judge the quick and the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The First of these, which is <hi>The Mission of the Holy Ghost, and the enabling of his Apostles to work Miracles,</hi> it was not only <hi>fitting</hi> to be performed, as being first promised by Christ, while he was with them here on Earth; but also <hi>needfull</hi> to have been done, though it had not been promised, that when they went out to preach the Gospel to the Nations, they might not seem wholly ridiculous and contemptible in propounding such vain and incredible things, (as they would seem to the World,) and such as had some kind of blemish or reproach with them, recommending to them one for the Son of God whom the Jews had crucified for a Malefactor betwixt two thieves. Certainly if an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary power had not assisted them, and they could not have done something beyond Nature, they would have been laughed at and hissed out of every place they came to. But having this supernatural assistance, both their own Faith was the more firmly rooted thereby, they finding that <hi>Iesus</hi> approved himself to the utmost to be all that with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which he professed himself to be; and they were so exceedingly encouraged and emboldened through this sensible presence of the Deity going along with them, that no dangers nor affronts, no not the fear of death or torment, could hinder them from being open witnesses to the World of all those things which they had seen and most certainly knew concerning the <hi>crucified Iesus,</hi> the Son of God and Saviour of Mankind.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We have seen in general how requisite this <hi>Supernatural assistance</hi> was to the Apostles; We shall now take notice in particular how <hi>congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> at least &amp; <hi>decorous</hi> the <hi>First appearance thereof</hi> was at the day of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost.</hi> The Apostles together with other Disciples being met in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per room at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and being all of one mind and of one faith and expectation of the promise of the Spirit, at the above-named day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 2.2, 3, 4.</note> of a suddain there came upon them <hi>a sound from Heaven, as of a mighty rushing winde, which filled the house where they were sitting;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:55305:96"/>
and there appeared unto them cloven Tongues, like as of Fire, which sate upon each of them: and they all filled with the Holy Ghost began to speak with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Supposing a God, a Providence and the Ministry of Angels and Spirits, there is not a jot of this impossible or incredible. But we shall also take notice of the <hi>Congruity of circumstances,</hi> which are either for an handsome <hi>Symbolical</hi> sense, or else for a more indispensable conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; as I conceive the <hi>Day</hi> to be, and <hi>their assembling thus together</hi> on this day of <hi>Pentecost in one place.</hi> For their seeing what happened thus miraculously to every one of them is a stronger confirmation of all their faiths, and they are the more sufficient witnesses to all the World of what thus miraculously befell them. And the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Pentecost</hi> was the most convenient time for this to happen, because of the greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curse of people on that day.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But it does not exclude that more <hi>Mystical</hi> and <hi>Symbolical</hi> sense of S. <hi>Austine</hi>'s; That as the <hi>written Law</hi> was given to the <hi>Iews</hi> on the <hi>fiftieth</hi> day after the Passeover, so the <hi>Law of the Spirit</hi> which was to be written in mens hearts was thus wonderfully begun here on the <hi>same day,</hi> by the preaching of the Apostles, on whom the Spirit descended in such an extraordinary manner. Nor does that other sense concerning the <hi>Unity of place</hi> exclude that <hi>Moral</hi> intimation of <hi>Grotius, Deus dona sua pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misit unitati.</hi> That also of their being seated in an <hi>upper room</hi> must sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>Morally,</hi> or nothing considerable; for else the more removed from the Earth, the never nearer to God, especially within the smell of the <hi>Atmosphere.</hi> Which Philosophick contemplation <hi>Apollonius</hi> pursues with a great deal of pomp and gravity, indoctrinating <hi>Damis,</hi> while they were travailing on mount <hi>Caucasus,</hi> (which the neighbour Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants look'd upon as the holy Mansion of the Gods, as other hills also are call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> from that opinion,) that a man is never the nearer the knowledge of Religion and Vertue, if he were mounted upon the highest <hi>Athos, Olympus</hi> or all the <hi>Caucasus</hi>'s in the World, unless he contemplate religious and Divine matters, not so much in a pure and subtile Air, as from an undeprav'd and sincere Spirit.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But that which is of the greatest significancy is the <hi>mighty rushing Wind</hi> and <hi>the fiery cloven Tongues.</hi> The former whereof is an Emblem of the <hi>External violence</hi> which God would doe to the World in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing of the acknowledgment of his Son into it. For without doubt those wonderfull Miracles that were done by the Apostles, beat so strongly upon the outward Senses of men, that they were after a manner forcibly driven to acknowledge that the hand of God was with them, and that the doctrine which they taught was true. The knowledge whereof at last, with the fame of their Miracles, filled the whole World, as that Sound from Heaven and mighty rushing Wind filled the whole house where they sate. I am sure the chief Priests complained betimes that the Apostles had filled all <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with their doctrines.<note place="margin">Acts 5.28.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The latter, viz. <hi>the Fiery cloven Tongues</hi>; the <hi>fieriness</hi> of them intimates the searching, penetrating, melting and purifying power of the Spirit; as their being <hi>cloven</hi> or <hi>divided</hi> the effect of the <hi>living word</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:55305:96"/>
which accompanied their preaching, which we may better call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, then the <hi>Stoicks</hi> their meager Reason. For this is that which is <hi>sharper then any two-edged sword,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 4.12.</note> 
                  <hi>dividing the very joints and marrow, and piercing to the inmost penetrals of the heart,</hi> as may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served at the preaching of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon. Or, not to be altogether so Mystical or Spiritual, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> these <hi>divided</hi> or <hi>cloven tongues</hi> may be only an external symbol of that inward power given them to speak and understand <hi>several Tongues,</hi> though they were never taught them. Which was a gift of very sober and necessary use (as all the <hi>Miracles</hi> are that were done either by Christ or his Apostles) they being to preach to men of <hi>several Nations</hi> then sojourning at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and afterwards to travail into several Countries to convert men to the Faith.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This is a solid account of all the Circumstances of that great Miracle done partly upon, and partly by the Apostles, after Christ's Ascension into Heaven: Which Divine power ever after assisted them in all their travails and labours in the Gospel, as you may see in the <hi>Acts.</hi> Where you shall find them not only endued with this miraculous power themselves, but by <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 8.15.</note> 
                  <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>imposition of hands</hi> conferring it upon others for the benefit of the Church: where you shall see them <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 5.15.</note> healing the sick, making the <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 3.6, 7.</note> lame to walk, <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 9.40.</note> raising the dead, <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 5.16.</note> casting out devils, and doing over again all the most considerable <hi>Miracles</hi> of our Saviour; and some which he never did, as the speaking with tongues, and healing <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 5.15.</note> by the mere shadow of their bodies, which seems more wonderfull then by the touching of the hem of Christ's garment. To which you may adde what strangely happened to them; as upon their praiers and devotions how the house <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 4.31.</note> shaked under them, as in an Earthquake, through the sensible presence of the Divine power at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending them: Their being <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 8.39.</note> transported through the Air by the hand of an Angel from one place to another: Their being visited by <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 5.19. and ch. 12. v. 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in prison, who opened the prison doors, and made the fetters fall off from their bodies of their own accord: The <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 6.15.</note> transfiguration of their countenances into an Angelical glory; and the <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 7.55, 56. and ch. 9. ver. 3, 4.</note> appearance of Christ from Heaven to them in a splendour more bright and radiant then the Sun at mid-day, as it happened to <hi>Paul</hi> as he was travailing to <hi>Damascus.</hi> The <hi>Credibility</hi> of which things, as also of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Miracles</hi> of Christ, the Success it self does plainly argue.</p>
               <p n="9">9. For it seems utterly impossible that Christ, a man cut short of all accomplishments that are plausible to flesh and bloud, being neither arm'd by the power of Eloquence, the knowledge of Philosophy, the authority and honour of the World, nor the advantages of Birth or Fortune; but on the contrary being disadvantaged by leading a life and offering himself an example of manners that are either scorn'd or hated by every natural man, who was still made more odious and contemptible by his suffering a shamefull death betwixt two gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s Malefactors; I say, if an high hand from Heaven had not carried on the affairs of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that is, if Christ had not done some such <hi>Miracles</hi> himself as are recorded, if he had not risen from the dead, ascended into Heaven, and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:55305:97"/>
thence powred forth his Spirit upon the Apostles, and enabled them to doe such wonderfull works as they did, <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 7. chap. 13.</note> it had been utterly impossible that Christianity could have had any such success in the world as we see it has at this day. So that the whole History of Christ is very congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and coherent, and such as according to the nature of the thing ought to be whenever the <hi>Messias</hi> was to come into the World.</p>

               <p n="1">1. IT would be too tedious a business particularly to prosecute that ample Success that the <hi>Passion, Resurrection, Ascension</hi> of Christ and his <hi>Sending the Holy Ghost</hi> had in the World: but the most univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal and farthest-spreading Effects thereof we cannot pass by in silence; especially those Three which himself foretells of, John 16. <hi>That when the Paraclete should come, he would convince the world concerning Sin, Righteousness and Iudgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning Sin, because they believe not on me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning Righteousness, because I goe to the Father, and you see me no more.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning Iudgment, because the Prince of this World is judged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. All which, as <hi>Grotius</hi> interprets the place in a Forensal sense, is of a very large extension, and acknowledged as well by <hi>Turk</hi> as <hi>Christian.</hi> For that learned Expositour makes Christ to send the Spirit as an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate</hi> to plead his cause against the World, (and indeed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> properly signifies so, and nothing else) and thereby to convince the World, First, of that great Crime of <hi>Infidelity,</hi> and of <hi>killing of their true Prophet,</hi> nay their expected <hi>Messias.</hi> This properly respects the Jews who crucified him: and they felt the Divine vengeance for so hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous a fact, their City being sacked, their Temple demolished, and themselves scattered and made underlings in all places of the World.</p>
               <p>Secondly, of the <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> dealing of the just God with Christ, who, because he had suffered so wrongfully, made him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, by making him a partaker of his Heavenly glory for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and injury he bore upon the Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:55305:97"/>Thirdly &amp; lastly, of <hi>Iustice</hi> betwixt party and party; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Devil excited the Jews to put Christ to death, so by way of <hi>Retaliation</hi> Christ should put the Devil out of his present dominion and rule in the world, by the destruction of <hi>Idolatry</hi> and the worship of those Apostate Spirits: though the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> seems something lame here, the members being so heterogeneall one to another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the Exposition will appear sufficiently ingenious for all that, if we do but consider what he sets down for the ground of his interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; That <hi>Sin, Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Iudgment,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Which assuredly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends such Laws as concern the right of <hi>Possession</hi> as well as that of <hi>Retaliation,</hi> which <hi>Grotius</hi> so specially aims at in his citing Levit. 24.20. The Devil therefore being a mere usurper and having no right to the rule and dominion of the World, the Action will lie against his <hi>Usurpation,</hi> and thus the Interpretation will be unexceptionable. And that the action is of this kind is plain, in that Christ, the Son of God, is <hi>heir of all things,</hi> as himself somewhere intimates, and the Apostle also in plain terms <note n="*" place="margin">Hebr. 1.2.</note> declares.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The sense therefore of the forecited Text in short is this, That the Spirit, which is called the <hi>Paraclete</hi> or <hi>Advocate,</hi> when he comes should convince the World of the <hi>Veracity of Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Infidelity and Cruelty of the Iews</hi> that crucified him who was a <hi>true Prophet,</hi> neither <hi>Deceiver</hi> nor <hi>deceived</hi>; and of the <hi>Equity</hi> of God that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensated his sufferings amongst the Jews, by taking him to himself, and crowning him with immortal glory; and of the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of God against the Devil, <note n="*" place="margin">John 16.11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap>, that God has given sentence against him already that he shall be ejected out of his usurped dominions, and that all the Pagan forms of worship shall be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated and destroy'd.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This the <hi>Paraclete</hi> or Spirit of God coming upon the Apostles and assisting them and the Church so miraculously for many Ages, has with such undeniable conviction made good, that not only all Christendome is assured thereof, but that vast Empire of the <hi>Turks</hi> and all the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi> whereever dispersed in the World. So that after a manner the whole Earth is filled with the belief thereof: which I thought worth the taking notice of, that this Success may not seem less ample then it is.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For though the <hi>Mahometans</hi> are not <hi>Christians</hi> but Pagans in too true a sense, yet it is plain that much of the letter of their law is <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Christ.</hi> And to the confusion of gross <hi>Idolatry</hi> and Polytheism they profess <hi>One only God,</hi> Creatour of Heaven and Earth; and their great stress of their Religion lies upon this main Article, with which they are so transported, that they spend a great deal of their time in their Mosco's in chanting out this one Truth, <note n="*" place="margin">See Chap. 16. Sect. 5. in the fifth-Trumpet Vision, where the Hypocrisie of their zeal in this point is discovered.</note> 
                  <hi>La illa ilella, la illa ilella,</hi> that is, <hi>There is but one God,</hi> as Historians relate. But this is no more then the Jews believe, nor upon so good grounds: but they proceed further, as if they
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55305:98"/>
were ambitious to make out that broken title that one gives them, who calls them <hi>Semichristianos,</hi> Half-christians.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For partly in their <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and partly in <hi>Zuna,</hi> it is recorded how <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> was conceived by the Holy Ghost, and so born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary.</hi> That the Gospel is the way, the light and salvation of men, and that they that obey it not shall be damned. That Christ knew the very thoughts of mens hearts, that he raised the dead, that he healed men of incurable diseases,<note place="margin">See <hi>Iohan. Andr. Confus. Sectae Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanae, cap.</hi> 11.</note> that he gave sight to the blind, and made the dumb to speak. That the Apostles of Christ, <hi>Matthew, Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> healed one <hi>Habib Anaiar</hi> of the Leprosie at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the King's daughter from the dead; as also gave sight to a childe that was born blinde. And lastly <hi>three Preeminences</hi> the <hi>Alcoran</hi> gives to Christ, which it gives not to any other Prophet, to <hi>Abraham, Moses,</hi> no nor <hi>Mahomet</hi> himself. The first is, That he was carried up to Heaven bodie and soul; where it is expresly added in <hi>Zuna,</hi> that he shall return from thence to judge the world with righteous judgment. The second, That he shall be called <hi>The Word of God.</hi> The third, That he should be called <hi>The Holy Spirit of God.</hi> These things you may read more at large in <hi>Iohannes Andreas</hi> his <hi>Confusio Sectae Mahometanae,</hi> as also in others; out of whom you may also add, that the <hi>Turks</hi> have so venerable an esteem of S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Gospel, that they wear it next their bodies as an amulet when they goe to war to keep them from gun-shot.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This I thought worth the noting, partly that that Honour which is due to Christ may not be given to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> of whom the best that can be said is only this, That he did not so utterly pervert and deprave the mystery of the Gospel by either his ignorance, political tricks or fanatical humours and whimsies, but that there was so much of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and virtue thereof left, as being seconded with the dint of the Sword, was able enough to hew down the more <note n="*" place="margin">See Chap. 16. sect. 5. in the vision of the fifth Trumpet.</note> gross <hi>Heathenish Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> chastise the <hi>disobedient</hi> &amp; <hi>Hypocritical Christians,</hi> and ruine the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal dominion of the Devil</hi> in the World: and partly that we may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern what great hopes there are that in due time, when the chief scandals of Christendome are taken away, (they being so far prepared already in their reverend opinion concerning our blessed Saviour) the whole <hi>Turkish Empire</hi> may of a sudden become true Christians; that which is vain and false among them having no better prop then the foolish and idle Visions, false pretended Miracles and groundless fables of a mere wily, phansifull and unclean Impostour; whenas the pure Christian Religion comprehended in the Gospel is so solid, sincere &amp; rational, that no man that is master of his wits but may be throughly satisfied concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the truth thereof.</p>

For <hi>Faith in God</hi> through our Lord Jesus Christ, and a firm Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a Life to come, and the Effect of this Faith which is the very nature and Spirit of Christ dwelling in us, consisting of <hi>Purity, Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> this sound constitution was very much in the Church in the Primitive times, even then when they had no succour nor support from the hands of men; nay when they were cruelly handled by them: they chusing rather to be banish'd, imprisoned, tortured and put to any manner of death, then to deny him who had redeemed them with his most precious Bloud, and had prepared a place of Eternal happiness for them with himself in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here <hi>Faith</hi> and the <hi>Divine Life</hi> was very conspicuously victorious and triumphant, in that in the eyes of all the world it set at nought all the cruel malice of the Devil and the terrour of death it self in the most ghastly vizard he could put on; as you may see innumerable Examples in the <hi>Ten bloudy Persecutions</hi> under the Heathen Emperours. Which History must needs make a man abominate such light-headed and false-hearted <hi>Allegorists</hi> that would intercept <hi>the Hopes of a future life</hi> by <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituallizing</hi> those passages in Scripture that bear that sense into a present, Moral and Mystical interpretation; as if the Gospel and the precious Promises therein conteined reached no further then <hi>this life</hi> we now live upon Earth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Which is the highest reproach and blasphemie that can be inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> as if he were rather a <hi>Betraier</hi> then a <hi>Saviour</hi> of Mankind; and that he was more thirsty after humane bloud then those <hi>Indian</hi> Gods we have spoken of, who were so lavish thereof in their sacrifices; and as if it were not Love and dear Compassion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us that made him lay down his life, but hatred and a spightfull plot of making myriads of men to be massacred and sacrificed out of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to him that thus should betray them. Wherefore whosoever
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55305:99"/>
interprets the New Testament so as to shuffle off <hi>the assurance of Reward and Punishment after the death of the Body,</hi> is either an arrant <hi>Infidel</hi> or horrid <hi>Blasphemer.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. WE have given a light glance upon the condition of the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Church before Christianity became the Religion of the Empire: what change would be wrought then, a man might discern out of the very causes. For whenas not only the Fear of Persecution was taken away, but great Honours and outward Advantages added to the Church, the very worst and most Atheistical of the Pagans would be most forward to close with the Christian Religion; and if any of the Heathen stood out, it is not unlikely but they were such as had most conscience, though in an erroneous worship. So that the Net then drew up more mud and dirt then good fishes. The garden of God which had before nothing else but wholesome herbs and flowers, was all overrun with weeds. Or, if you will, the <hi>true Church</hi> which was before as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous as <hi>a City on an Hill,</hi> was now <hi>hid</hi> and <hi>dispersed</hi> in the wide <hi>wilderness</hi> of the Roman Empire, which though it bore the name of <hi>Christian,</hi> yet for life and manners was worse then <hi>Pagan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But yet not to make things less considerable then they were; First, The true Christian Church was, I say, but <hi>hid,</hi> not <hi>lost,</hi> as it fares at this very day. For she is still <hi>hid in the Wilderness,</hi> and like that Voice in the Wilderness complains and witnesses against the beastly, sensual and abominable lives and salvage dealings in that part of the World which is called Christendome. For there alwaies were and still are in this great rude mass of Christianity some that are truly regenerate and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55305:99"/>
rightly form'd by the hand of God into the lovely image of Christ, who give witness of the loathsome and detestable deviations of those that so impudently and imperiously boast themselves to be the only Christians, when in truth they are not Christians at all, that is, no true members of Christ, as having nothing at all of his Spirit, as their works do evidently declare.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And Secondly, Though I must confess that the <hi>Divine life</hi> it self, as communicable to the Church, is very much under the hatches since Christianity and Political Interest went hand in hand; yet after the Church became so rich and pompous, they have laid out their riches ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much in honour not only to our Saviour, in whom the <hi>Divine Life</hi> dwelt in a transcendent manner, but to his blessed Mother, to the holy Apostles and Martyrs, who were also great Examples of it. And being that these generations were such that God could expect no better of them, his Providence, I think, did wisely permit that they might be so deeply engaged in their External homage to Christ and his most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full followers: that that might be fulfilled in some measure in the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> also which was prophesied concerning Christ,<note place="margin">Isaiah 53.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Therefore I will divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoile with the strong, because he hath powred out his Soul unto death.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> sharing so deeply in the sufferings of Christ, were permitted also in a measure to partake of that glory and honour that is done to great Princes and Emperours after their decease; to have Images and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples erected to their name. This makes me not so much wonder at that passage of Providence which allowed so much virtue to the <hi>Bones</hi> of the Martyr <hi>Babylas</hi> once Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> as to stop the mouth of <hi>Apollo Daphneus,</hi> when <hi>Iulian</hi> would have enticed him to open it by many a fat Sacrifice: To say nothing of several other memorable <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> that were done by the Reliques of Saints and Martyrs in those times.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hitherto therefore the <hi>Pagan</hi> World since they became <hi>Christians</hi> have been very religiously complemental according to the ancient guize of Paganism, devoutly cringing and courting with many sacred Rites and Ceremonies not only Christ, but the blessed Virgin and all the holy Martyrs &amp; Confessours, very freely and forwardly bestowing upon them all external Reverence, consecrating Chappels &amp; Daies to their honour and memories: So that the personal worship of the <hi>Divine Life</hi> as it is seated in Christ, in the blessed Virgin, in this or in that Saint or Martyr, is as punctually performed, as the worship of those excellent dowries of the <hi>Animal Life</hi> in ancient Paganism, which they honoured in <hi>Belus, Bacchus, Ceres, Apollo, Venus</hi> and other Eminent persons amongst the Heathens, who were great gratifiers of the natural life of man.</p>

                  <hi>Spencer</hi>'s description of <hi>Una</hi>'s Entertainment by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs in the Desart, does lively set out the condition of Christianity since the time that the Church of a Garden became a <hi>Wilderness.</hi> They danc'd and frisk'd and play'd about her, abounding with external homa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and observances; but she could not inculcate any thing of that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine law of life</hi> that she was to impart to them. The Representation
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55305:100"/>
is so lively, and the Verses so musical, that it will not be tedious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite some of the chief of them; as Stanza 11. where he makes the Satyrs to lay aside their rudeness and roughness as much as they could, to revive the dismaied Virgin after her great distress.
<q>
                     <l>Their frowning foreheads with rough horns yclad,</l>
                     <l>And rustick horrour all aside they lay,</l>

                     <l>Their backward bent knees teach her humbly to obay.</l>
                  </q>
And then again in the following Stanza,
<q>
                     <lg>
                        <l>They, in compassion to her tender youth,</l>

                        <l>And yields her to extremity of time;</l>
                        <l>So from the ground she fearless doth arise,</l>
                        <l>And walketh forth without suspect of crime.</l>
                        <l>They all, as glad as Birds of joyous Prime,</l>
                        <l>Thence lead her forth, about her dancing round,</l>
                        <l>Shouting, and singing all a Shepheards rime,</l>
                        <l>And with green branches strowing all the ground,</l>
                        <l>Do worship her, as Queen with Olive girlond crown'd.</l>
                     </lg>

                        <l>That all the woods with double Echo ring,</l>
                        <l>And with their horned feet do wear the ground,</l>
                        <l>Leaping like wanton kids in pleasant Spring, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     </lg>
                  </q>
But in all this alacritie and activity in their Ceremonies and complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal observances, <hi>Una</hi> could beat nothing of the <hi>inward law of life</hi> into them, but all was spent in an outward Idolatrous flattery, as the Poet complains Stanza 19.
<q>
                     <l>Glad of such luck, the luckless lucky maid</l>
                     <l>Did her content to please their feeble eyes,</l>
                     <l>And long time with that salvage people stai'd,</l>
                     <l>To gather breath in many miseries:</l>
                     <l>During which time, her gentle wit she plies</l>
                     <l>To teach them <hi>Truth</hi> which worship her in vain,</l>
                     <l>And made her th' <hi>Image of Idolatries.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>But when their bootless zeal she did restrain</l>

                  </q>

               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:55305:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>6. But though it has been thus so long, yet it seems incredible it should be always so; and while it is as it is, yet the <hi>Divine life</hi> is in its personal Triumph. And now the enemies of Christ even while they are such, (and such are all unregenerate men, let them be called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians never so loudly) do lick the very dust of his feet, and they lout and ly prostrate to the names of those men whose lives, if they were on the Earth again (they are so contrary to theirs) they would unrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilably hate, and scorn their persons for their meanness, and tread them under feet; nay it may be with more shame and cruelty then ever, make them suffer once again those bloudy Martyrdomes.</p>
               <p n="7">7. So that it is an uncouth spectacle to consider what strange ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous work these Satyrs, Monkyes and Baboons, (I mean the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated Mass of Mankind, who are enlivened with nothing but the mere <hi>Animal life</hi>) have made these many hundred years in the <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> with the most precious Truth of the Gospel; what Sophistical knots and nooses, fruitless subtilties and niceties, what gross contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and inconsistencies the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> and <hi>Polemical Divines</hi> have filled the World with; what needless and burdensome Ceremonies, what ensnaring new coined Articles, what setting up of self-flattering Sects and Interests, what variously-carved Formes and new-fangled Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosities have been contriv'd and shap'd out by either <hi>Superstitious Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> or <hi>Carnal Politicians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. But if there were nothing worse then this, though this be ill enough, the Scene would seem only Comical in comparison: But at last the Ape cuts his own throat with the shoomakers knife, and Christendome lyes tumbling and wallowing, I know not for how many Ages together, in its own bloud. The reason of which is, that in this long bustle for and great ostentation of an External Religion, the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward life and Spirit of Christianity</hi> which consists in <hi>Humility, Charity and Purity,</hi> is left out, and <hi>Pride, Lust</hi> and <hi>Covetousness</hi> are the first movers in all our Actions: So that though we be called by the name of Christ, yet our hearts and reall services are grosly Pagan; we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrating our very Souls with all the Powers, Affections and Faculties of them to the worst-titled Deities of the Heathen; and being strictly commanded by our Saviour <hi>to love one another,</hi> as it were in despight, to shew what real Apostates we are to Paganisme, rather pour forth one anothers bloud as a drink-offering to <hi>Mars,</hi> then keep that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable and indispensable Precept of his whom we profess to be our liege Lord and Soveraign.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Thus has it pleas'd that ever-watchfull Eye of Providence to connive as it were a while at this <hi>Pagan Christianisme,</hi> as well as he did in former Ages at the ancient <hi>Paganisme.</hi> But assuredly it will be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and all the glorious Predictions of the Prophets concerning Christ, even in this World will not end in so tedious a Scene, where there is so little good, and such a floud of filth and evil.</p>
               <p>But the Spirit of the Lord will blow upon these dry bones, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate this external forme of <hi>Religion</hi> with life and power, and the scales will fall from her eyes, and that load of scurf and ascititious foulness
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55305:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will fall from her skin, and her flesh shall be as of a tender child, and she shall grow strong, healthful and irreprehensibly lovely to look upon. When these things come to pass, the <hi>Divine Life</hi> will be in her <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Triumph</hi> or exaltation upon earth; and this excellent state of the Church will continue for a very considerable time. <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 20. v. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, &amp;c.</note> But the wicked shall again assault the just, and Christ visibly returning to judgement shall decide the controversy.</p>
               <p n="10">10. This is the truest and most faithful representation in general (so far as my skill in Church-History or Prophecies will reach) that I can make of that Interval of time, betwixt Christ's powring forth of the Holy Ghost on his Apostles and his coming again to Judgement. But because it would be a voluminous business more particularly to make good what I have asserted, and that it is not so essential to the present purpose I have in hand, I hold it not at all necessary to engage in any operose endeavours of demonstrating the truth of the conclusion. I shall rather send him that doubts, to satisfie himself in the perusing of the learned writings of that incomparable Interpreter of Prophecies Mr. <hi>Ioseph Mede:</hi> whose proceedings are with that care and caution, with that clearness and strictness of reason, with that accuracy of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and unparallel'd modesty and calmness, that the study and enquiry into these matters, which had even grown odious and infamous by the wild and ridiculous miscarriages of hot fanatick spirits, has in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension gained much credit and repute by the orderly and cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent methods and unexceptionable ratiocinations of this grave and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Person. Upon whose account I am not ashamed to profess, that I think it clear both out of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> that the Scene of things Christendome will be in due time very much changed, and that for the better.</p>
               <p>And because there does nothing so much counterbalance the weight of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s reasons as the autority and lustre of that worthily-admired Name of the learned <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> who has interpreted the Revelations to quite another sense; (the ingenuities and prettinesses of whose exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had almost imposed upon my self to a belief that there might be some such sense also of the Revelation as he drives at) to make all clear I shall take the pains of exhibiting both to the view of the Reader. Who I hope will not take it ill that so pious, so learned and judicious a person as Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> and that in a matter to which he may seem to be peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly selected and set apart to by God and Nature, to which he mainly applied himself with all possible care, seriousness and devotion, should see further then <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> who has an ample harvest of praise from other performances, and who by reason of his Political emploiments could not be so entirely vacant to the searching into so abstruse a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

From whence he further inferres, That it is plain every where that <hi>Days</hi> have never any hidden meaning in them, but signifie merely <hi>Days,</hi> not <hi>Years.</hi> Which in my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is not at all well argued by so learned an Expositour. For though we should admit that <hi>true</hi> in this place signifies <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>clear</hi> without any <hi>figure</hi> or <hi>Aenigme</hi>; it does not at all follow that whereever <hi>Day</hi> is used, it must be in this usual and proper sense. Which answer were solid, though the very word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> were used here. But they are not, but the Text runs thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>unto two thousand evenings-mornings,</hi> &amp;c or <hi>two thousand</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But elsewhere, as chap. 12. v. 11, 12. there <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is put. And therefore it were a very groundless inference to conclude, because where <hi>Day</hi> is so described by its natural parts of Evening and Morning, there it signifies naturally and not figuratively, that therefore it should do so where it is not thus described. To which you may adde, that the Angels telling <hi>Daniel,</hi> That <hi>this</hi> Vision of <hi>Evenings</hi> and <hi>Mornings,</hi> that is, of <hi>Days,</hi> is clear, doth plainly imply that the Visions of the number of <hi>Days</hi> are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not clear but obscure, and may signifie <hi>Years</hi>; otherwise this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation had been in vain: As truly the very numbring thus by <hi>Days</hi> also; whenas it had been more natural to have expressed the Prophecy by so many <hi>Years,</hi> if it had not been of set purpose to make the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of <hi>Daniel</hi> more obscure, and to hide them from such eyes as the Wisdome of God thought fit, that they should not perceive their meaning. This is the utmost that <hi>Grotius</hi> has to say against the expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Days</hi> by <hi>Years.</hi>

                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:55305:102"/>2. Let us see now what may be said for it. First, It is plain that the Prophetical descriptions of <hi>Time</hi> do sometimes affect certain <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bages</hi> and obscurities to hide themselves in, which our adversaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves cannot deny: Otherwise <hi>Daniel</hi> might have said more plainly, <hi>Three years and an half,</hi> then <note n="*" place="margin">Dan. 7.25. &amp; chap. 12.7.</note> 
                  <hi>a Time and Times and half a Time.</hi> Wherefore why may not <hi>Years</hi> be signified by <hi>Days</hi> as well as <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Times</hi> signifie <hi>Years,</hi> especially there being some handsome analogy in the matter, they being both measured by a complete circuit of the Sun, the one annual, the other diurnal?</p>
               <p>Again, we see plainly That God himself has <hi>de facto</hi> in several places of the Scripture made <hi>Days</hi> the compendious Representatives of <hi>Years.</hi> As <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Forty days, each day for a year</hi>; and <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 4.6. <hi>I have appointed thee each day for a year.</hi> To which you may adde, That the Jewish Doctors of old took it up for a Principle to interpret Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies by; which reaches the case very home, in reference to the Apocalypse, whose Authour our Adversaries will acknowledge not to abhorre from <hi>Cabbalisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, I shall urge that very Text which <hi>Grotius</hi> has so strangely perverted to his own sense, <hi>Daniel</hi> 8. v. 26. where the Angel tells <hi>Daniel</hi> that the <hi>Vision of the Evening and the Morning</hi> is perspicuous and clear. Which most certainly is an intimation to <hi>Daniel,</hi> that some Prophecies imparted to him, where the <hi>Time</hi> is numbred by <hi>Days,</hi> are not clear, but are to be looked upon as Enigmatical and figurative. But here the mention also of <hi>Evening and Morning</hi> shews plainly that <hi>natural days</hi> or ordinary <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> are to be understood, and yet the Angel puts in this caution. Whereby it is still more evident that <hi>Days</hi> do ordinarily in Prophecy signifie <hi>Years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The <hi>little Horn,</hi> Daniel 7. that rules for <hi>a time and times and half a time,</hi> it is evident that it is not <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> because this <hi>little Horn</hi> is part of the Fourth Beast, namely the <hi>Romane</hi>; but <hi>Antiochus</hi> part of the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire. For it is clear from chap. 8. vers. 21. that, the great Horn being the first King, the four fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Horns are of the same Kingdome; in the latter time whereof <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> rises up, as appears v. 23. These things are so plain that nothing can be plainer. Wherefore the <hi>little Horn</hi> in the Seventh chapter is a part of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, a power there whose reign cannot be circumscribed within the compass of <hi>Three years and a half,</hi> but these Years must be resolved into 1260 days, and these 1260 days into so many Years, or no sense can be made of the Prophesie. But this is done to our hand in the Apocalypse, where the Woman in the wilderness is said to abide there for <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 12.14.</note> 
                  <hi>a time and times and half a time</hi> as well as <note n="*" place="margin">Vers. 6.</note> 1260 days. Which plainly shews the warrantableness of this solution.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> De Numeris Danielis.</note>Fifthly, Those numbers of Daniel, chap. 12. v. 11, 12. namely, <hi>one thousand two hundred and ninety days,</hi> and <hi>a thousand three hundred and five and thirty days,</hi> they being so unapplicable to any thing in the sense of <hi>Days,</hi> but so exactly pointing out the latter times in the sense of <hi>Years,</hi> is a further demonstration that <hi>Days</hi> sometimes signifie <hi>Years</hi> in the Prophetical writings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:55305:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>Sixthly, It seems exceedingly improbable, a single day being so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable a space of time to transact those things in that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied of in Scripture, that the Spirit of God should number out the time by <hi>Days,</hi> when it might more compendiously be set down by <hi>Years</hi>; especially these pettinesses being below the Divine Majesty to catch at, and there being no Examples of <hi>Events</hi> that have been observed thus punctually to answer to a day where <hi>Prophecies</hi> have been numbred by <hi>days,</hi> that would have filled up any number of <hi>years.</hi> How unlikely then is it that <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 11.9.11</note> 
                  <hi>Half a day</hi> should come into compute, as it does in the <hi>slain Witnesses,</hi> if <hi>Days</hi> be meant, and not some greater measures of time?</p>
               <p>Seventhly, It is manifest, and confessed of all hands, That the <hi>Days</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s weeks are <hi>Years.</hi> Here <hi>Grotius</hi> would fain evade if he could, by feigning a peculiar priviledge of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to signifie <hi>a week of years,</hi> unless there be the mention of <hi>days</hi> added to determine the sense the other way: which makes me wonder that a person otherwise so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous should vent so groundless and false a supposition. I dare say you can scarce believe me unless I produce his own words, which are these; <note n="*" place="margin">Grotius in Dan. 9.24.</note>

                  </gap>, the one <hi>Daniel</hi> 10. v. 2, 3. which is not done as usual, but to adde light in all likelihood to the precedent prophecy of the <hi>weeks of years,</hi> for distinction sake, and does imply that they would also naturally signifie <hi>weeks of days.</hi> The other, <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 45.21. where it is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>a week,</hi> without any thing added to it, does alwaies signifie <hi>a week of days,</hi> unless in a Prophetical Scheme the <hi>Days</hi> of the week signifie <hi>Years,</hi> as it does here in <hi>Daniel.</hi> See <hi>Genes.</hi> 29. v. 27, 28. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. v. 22. <hi>Levit.</hi> 12. v. 5. <hi>Numb.</hi> 28. v. 26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. v. 9, 10, 16. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 5.24. In all these places <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies <hi>a week of days</hi> wihtout <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> added to it. Nor is there any example where it has such an addition but these two produced by himself, of which we have given an account.</p>
               <p>Eighthly and lastly, Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s <hi>Synchronisms</hi> are apodictically true to any one that has but a competency of wit and patience to peruse them. But according to these <hi>Synchronisms</hi> the <hi>continuance</hi> of <hi>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcation of the outward Court, the mournful prophecies of the Witnesses, the Woman in the Desart, the ten-horned and two-horned Beasts, the sealed Servants of the Lamb, the Whore of Babylon, the Succession of the first six Trumpets, the continuance,</hi> I say, of all these is circumscribed within the space of <hi>Three years and an half,</hi> if the 1260 days be but <hi>Days</hi> and not <hi>Years,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> would have it. Which is a thing impossible, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if we consider that <hi>Beasts</hi> are, in the Prophetical scheme of speech, <hi>Polities</hi> or <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> not <hi>Persons,</hi> and therefore unconceivable to be so short-lived as to last but <hi>Three years and an half.</hi> To which you may adde, That the chief matters of the Apocalypse are comprehended within this <hi>Synchronisme</hi>; and that it is a wonder that there is no mention of <hi>Years</hi> in all this Book, saving of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> but onely
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55305:103"/>
of <hi>Months</hi> or <hi>Days</hi> and <hi>half a day:</hi> Which is a shrewd presumption that the computation of <hi>Years</hi> is hidden under these Terms where they signifie any definite time at all. Wherefore I think it is as clear as the light, that <hi>Days</hi> in Prophecy do sometimes signifie <hi>Years.</hi> Nor see I any reason why <hi>Time</hi> may not as well as <hi>Things</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> be figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively expressed by the Prophets.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The greatest cavils that can be made against Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s way, I conceive, are either against his dividing the Apocalypse from the Fourth Chapter to the end of the Book into Two Systems of Prophetical Visions, the one containing the <hi>Fate of the Empire,</hi> the other <hi>of the Church,</hi> and both beginning from one <hi>Epocha</hi>; or else against his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the time of the killing of the two Witnesses; or lastly against his making the Beast out of the bottomless pit (chap. 11.) the same with the Beast out of the sea (chap. 13.)</p>
               <p>The greatest thing objected against the first is, That one of his chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est marks of the beginning a new Series of Prophecies fails him. For whereas he argues from chap. 10. vers. 11. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that there is a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a running over the same space of time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and that <hi>à carceribus ad metam</hi>; and from v. 8. <hi>The voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again</hi>; which he would parallel with chap. 1. v. 10. and with chap. 4. v. 1. the former whereof is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Prophecy of the <hi>Seven Churches,</hi> the latter of the <hi>Seven Seals:</hi> It is objected against the second mark, that it is defective, in that this <hi>Voice</hi> is not joyned with the mentioning of a <hi>Trumpet</hi> as those two to which he would parallel it are. I confess if the mention of a <hi>Trumpet</hi> had been here joyned, the beginning of the Prophecy a-new had been notoriously plain and palpable. Indeed too plain for a book of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies that the Wisdome of God has used so much artifice to obscure. But this half-indication was enough to such as God had made fit (and thought the time seasonable) to unriddle the mystery.</p>
               <p>But methinks there are other indications of the beginning of a <hi>new Systeme</hi> of Prophecies that may in a good measure compensate the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectness of this. I shall but briefly intimate them. As First the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Majesty of that Angel that has this opened Book of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in his hand; his description being not unlike that of his that had the sealed Book, <hi>Revel.</hi> chap. 4 and 5. And then Secondly, this <hi>new Book</hi> of Prophecies seems naturally to imply a <hi>new Systeme</hi> of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies distinct in kind as well as in volume; the one, suppose, containing the <hi>Affairs of the Empire,</hi> the other of <hi>the Church.</hi> Which things though different in nature, yet running parallel in time, it is reasonable to conceive that the second Book of Prophecies reaches up to the same <hi>Epocha</hi> with the first. Which in the Third place is further intimated by the oath of the Angel who swears there shall be <hi>no more time,</hi> but that <hi>the Mysterie of God shall be finished</hi> at the sounding of the Seventh trump.<note place="margin">Revel. 10.6, 7.</note> Which pronouncing that there will be <hi>no more time,</hi> certainly is meant of the <hi>time and times and half a time</hi> which shall then be expired, and which was pointed at by <hi>Daniel</hi> the servant and Prophet of God. Which is the reason of the adding of those words, <hi>as he has declared to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55305:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his servants the Prophets.</hi> And lastly, that you may be still more sure that the Prophecy begins again from the first <hi>Epocha,</hi> there is not onely this more light and general mention of the <note n="*" place="margin">verse 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Seventh Trumpet,</hi> which is the last period of the <hi>sealed Book,</hi> but also a distribution of it into <note n="*" place="margin">verse 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Seven thunders,</hi> as there was of the <note n="*" place="margin">chap. 8.1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Seventh seal</hi> into <hi>Seven trumpets.</hi> And this mighty and illustrious Angel, who, though he be not one of the <hi>Seven</hi> properly so called (and here is onely said to be <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>another An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) yet he immediately succeeding the <hi>Sixth,</hi> is in some sort the <hi>Seventh,</hi> and may well sustain the person of the <hi>Seventh</hi> for this bout, he seeming also to continue his roaring all the time the Seven thunders utter their voices. The last of which it's likely may be <hi>Thunder</hi> properly so called, namely that final Conflagration of the world and the setting the earth on fire by Thunder and Lightning. And surely when the Prophecies of the <hi>Seals</hi> have reached to this last <hi>Catastrophe,</hi> he must be very scrupulous that will make any doubt but that the Prophecies of the <hi>opened Book</hi> begin again from the first <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Revelation.</p>
               <p>To all which you may adde, That Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s <hi>Synchronisms</hi> do not depend upon this Hypothesis, but on the contrary, prove by undeniable evidence that it is more then an Hypothesis, even a necessary Truth resulting from the demonstration of the said <hi>Synchronisms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. As for <hi>the Three days and an half that the Witnesses are said to lye slain,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 11.9, 11.</note> there are scarce any now so ignorant as not to be ashamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit <hi>these days</hi> to be <hi>natural days,</hi> and <hi>these Witnesses</hi> to be any <hi>two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men.</hi> But the Objection is against them that will acknowledge them to be three years and an half, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> does, how it can be likely that at the very last gasp of the power of the Beast, the truest and most Apostolick Christians should be in worse plight then ever before. But to this I answer, That the truth of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s <hi>Synchronisms</hi> does not at all depend upon this, nor is his conjecture so impossible to be true.</p>
               <p>But I must confess I think there is still a better way of answering, namely, That these <hi>Three days and an half</hi> are the same that <hi>a time and times and half a time,</hi> that is, three times and an half. For it is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable but that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> often signifies no more then <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Now that it should signifie so here, (besides the improbability of an Effect answerable to the other interpretation, or that the Witnesses should be otherwise slain then they have been often or for a long time together) that mention of <hi>half a day</hi> answering to <hi>half a time</hi> fairly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites us to believe; it being also unlikely that Providence would affect the curiosity of counting by <hi>half a year,</hi> a thing not to be sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled in all Divine Prophecies. These <hi>Three days and an half</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are first to be changed into <hi>Three times and an half,</hi> and then these <hi>Three times and a half</hi> into <hi>Three years and an half,</hi> and these <hi>Three years and an half</hi> into 1260 <hi>Prophetick days.</hi> Which <hi>ambages</hi> and circuits are not at all improbable, if we consider what studied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealments and obscurities there are in this Book of the Apocalypse, as particularly in the <hi>number of the Beast,</hi> and of <hi>the new Ierusalem,</hi> upon which we shall touch a little anon. To say nothing of a main usefulness of these <hi>Three days and an half</hi> to determine the true number of <hi>a time
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55305:104"/>
and times.</hi> For how can we be assured how many <hi>times</hi> are designed thereby, especially it being <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> which is the plural number, not the dual, and therefore bids fair to be more then <hi>two times,</hi> at least <hi>three?</hi> Whence it would be four times and an half. But these <hi>Three days and an half</hi> correct or prevent the mistake, by fixing these <hi>Time and Times and half a Time</hi> to <hi>Three Times and an half.</hi> Which I confess I do little doubt but that it is the true meaning of the Mystery.</p>
               <p>Nor does their <hi>being slain</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 11.7.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, at all prejudice our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. For it is not well rendred, <hi>when they shall have finished,</hi> nor yet need be rendred, <hi>while they are making an end of their witnessings,</hi> as if this should happen at the latter end of it; but may very warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be expounded <hi>dum peragunt,</hi> while they are performing this office of witnessing from the beginning of the 1260 days to the end thereof. Nor yet is that a real but seeming absurdity that this Interpretation brings along with it, as if the Witnesses could prophesy while their carcasses lie dead in the streets. For it is plain that in that sense they are said to be <hi>dead,</hi> they may <hi>prophesy in sackcloth,</hi> nay they will necessarily do so, I mean perform their witnessing with sadness and mourning. For their <hi>death</hi> is nothing else but a <hi>Political death,</hi> their want of power and rule in the World. For such is their <hi>Resurrection,</hi> namely <hi>Political,</hi> they being raised to honour and government, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> himself acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth. Wherefore there is no absurdity neither in the inward mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nor outward <hi>Cortex</hi> of this Prophecy.</p>
               <p>For the inward meaning is such as I have told you: And the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Cortex</hi> framed with very graceful artifice, like that in the Image of <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> where merely for the <hi>decorum</hi> of the Type, the <hi>whole</hi> Image is represented as standing and struck upon the legs, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as yet that which was signified by the <hi>head,</hi> by the <hi>breast</hi> and <hi>armes,</hi> and by the <hi>belly</hi> and <hi>thighs,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Babylonian, Persian</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, were passed away. So for the like <hi>decorum</hi> in this Type of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> if not for necessity, to avoid a seeming gross incongruity, that the <hi>Witnesses</hi> might not be said to prophesy while their bodies lay dead in the streets; the time of their death, which really pervades the whole 1260 days, is concealed under and contracted into these <hi>Three days and an half,</hi> and made not to appear, where in the things signified it is; as those parts of the Image were represented as standing, when the things that they signified ceased to be. Which Scheme is not at all more hard in the one then in the other, and in this Type of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> more useful and necessary.</p>

                  </gap> here in stead of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> might be not to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the sense to the ten-horned Beast, but to give at least a liberty of interpreting it also of the two-horned contemporary with him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But in no aspect does this Book of the Apocalypse look so hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and discouraging as in that of the <hi>First Resurrection,</hi> Chap. 20. But withall it is to be noted, there is no difficulty here but such as will at least equally urge those that begin the <hi>Millennium</hi> at <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time: So that this can be no prejudice to Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Interpretations and Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronisms. For whether we will go the <hi>Allegorical</hi> way with some, and understand this <hi>First Resurrection</hi> in a <hi>Political</hi> sense like that of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> this way is better accommodated to Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisms then to the other Hypothesis. Nor were it any great inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to admit it as true, those phrases which at last will have a <hi>Literal</hi> fulfilling, being often used in a <hi>Figurative</hi>; as we may observe in the <hi>lake of fire,</hi> some descriptions of God's coming to <hi>particular judgments,</hi> the <hi>six thunders,</hi> and the like: all which expressions will have at last a <hi>Literal</hi> and <hi>Physical</hi> completion.</p>
               <p>But though the <hi>Figurative</hi> sense of <hi>Resurrection</hi> may be passable and tolerable in this place, yet I must confess I dare not avouch it to be who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true. My Reasons shall be suggested in the exposition of the Text, which runs thus, <hi>And I saw Thrones, and they sate upon them, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given unto them: and I saw the Souls of them that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed for the witness of Iesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the Beast, neither his Image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again untill the thousand years were finished. This is the First Resurrection. Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection; on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was never any Book penned with that artifice as this of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> as if every word were weighed in a balance before it was set down; which is manifest out of other places as well as this. In which I conceive a double design is aimed at, a prediction of a <hi>proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi> of the Witnesses to the Truth by their deaths, and of a <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Resurrection</hi> to the true and Apostolical Church that does survive upon Earth. The former are the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the latter <hi>those that worshipped not the Beast,</hi> &amp;c. which if they were not distinct from the other, it had been better to have omitted <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and to have read <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, &amp;c. Wherefore this is the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation that there are two Orders of men there set down, The one that suffered death for the cause of the Gospel; The other that are still alive, but resolute Opposers of the Beast. But there is also a second hint in the following words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>They lived and reigned.</hi> The Spirit of God seems on set purpose to make choice of <gap reason="foreign">

Resurrection,</hi> and so urge the Reader too forcibly to understand both these Orders above distinguished to be Candidates of a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>literal</hi> Resurrection at this time. And therefore he uses <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> will naturally implie a <hi>literal</hi> Resurrection; and in reference to the other, no <hi>literal</hi> Resurrection, (they being not supposed <hi>naturally</hi> dead,) but merely a living upon Earth and reigning there with Christ, which is their Moral and Political Life and Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. The <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> shall reign with Christ in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and those other with Christ on <hi>Earth,</hi> he being universal Prince over both Churches: and therefore neither <hi>Heaven</hi> nor <hi>Earth</hi> is here mentioned, that the sense may be accommodated to either the reigning with Christ in <hi>Heaven</hi> or in <hi>Earth,</hi> according to the distinct capacities of the persons. And the like caution is used in the prefiguration of the <hi>time</hi>; of which there is no necessity to conceit that it signifies just a <hi>thousand years</hi> lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, but that it signifies at least a thousand years, and certainly not more then there are daies in that thousand, nor in likelihood near so many. But the signification is rather <hi>Symbolical,</hi> as the <hi>ten daies</hi> are, chap. 2. v. 10. <hi>And ye shall have the tribulation of ten daies,</hi> that is, the utmost extent of tribulation, beyond which there is nothing further, as there is no number beyond <hi>Ten:</hi> by which therefore must be meant <hi>death.</hi> And that is the reason why presently is added, <hi>Be thou faithfull unto death, and I will give thee the Crown of life.</hi> So this <hi>thousand years</hi> upon earth is a symbol of the Churches stable duration to the end of the world, that there shall no Politie flourish beyond it: it being a Cube whose root is <hi>Ten.</hi> And the application of it to the reigning of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Resurrection with Christ in heaven, discovers the unshaken stability and endless duration of that celestial Kingdome also, beyond which <hi>absolutely</hi> there is nothing at all.</p>

After which it is plainly said, that there is a general Resurrection, and that all the dead do rise (ver. 12, 13, 14.) Wherefore this <hi>general Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> being <hi>literal</hi> and <hi>real,</hi> it is too too harsh and violent to understand this <hi>First Resurrection</hi> mentioned in this fifth verse to be only <hi>Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and <hi>Mystical.</hi> But understanding it <hi>literally,</hi> that which follows has a wonderfull natural and easie sense. <hi>Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first Resurrection</hi> (which he speaks thus in the singular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, one would think, on purpose to keep men off from conceiting he means it of the successive body of the Church during the thousand years) <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55305:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
free from the reach of the second death: <hi>But they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and reign with him,</hi> not <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </gap> that is, They shall be holy, sacred and divine persons, and live with Christ in his immutable and everlasting Kingdome in Heaven for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>This I conceive to be the most easie and natural sense of this place, and that the Personal Reign of Christ upon Earth and of his holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs is a very rash and groundless and unsafe conceit, fit for nothing but heat and tumult both of phansie and action. Nor do I think it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that the Sons of this first Resurrection should at all appear to us, their celestial bodies, into which they are vivificated, being naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, and therefore a kind of miracle for us to see them, and no more necessary then the exhibiting those Souls to view which Christ carried to Heaven in triumph after his Resurrection; which yet he did not exhibit to the sight of the world. And if he doe here, I can imagine no better end then that of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s, that it may be for a sign or beckening to the Jews, to help on their Conversion: but I can affirm nothing of these things. Only I am well assured that if Christendome were once well purged of all her Idolatries, foolish and contradictious opinions and wicked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, it would be a very great Miracle if the Jews could be kept off from being converted.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Wherefore in brief to conclude, seeing the truth of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s <hi>Synchronisms,</hi> as far as respects this present subject, is so apodictical, and that there is nothing material to be alledged against them, and that the numbers of <hi>daies</hi> and <hi>moneths</hi> there mentioned are of necessity to be interpreted <hi>years,</hi> and that according to this Hypothesis there can be no other sense of <hi>the Woman in the wilderness,</hi> of <hi>Babylon the great city,</hi> of <hi>the two-horned Beast</hi> and <hi>the ten-horned Beast,</hi> &amp;c. then what Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> hath given; it is manifest that the Church of Christ would be lapsed into a degenerate condition for 1260 years: and as evident that there will be a recovery out of this Lapse, by reason that there has been yet no room for the promised <hi>Millennium,</hi> persecution dogging the Church till <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time, after which the 1260 daies were to succeed, and therefore the <hi>Millennium</hi> is yet to come. As appears further in that it is Synchronall to the <hi>Seventh trumpet,</hi> and that the <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 11.11, 12.</note> Resurrection of the Witnesses is after their lying dead either all the 1260 daies, or at least the last three daies and an half; in that the <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Marriage of the Lamb</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences from the <hi>burning of Babylon,</hi> and the <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 7.9.</note> 
                  <hi>company of Palm-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> from their victory over the persecuting Beast. These things are so plain that they are not worth insisting upon.</p>
               <p>And it is a great priviledge of this <hi>Synchronical</hi> architecture of Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> that it is not built upon any Hypothesis but the innate Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the Apocalyptical Visions themselves; whenas <hi>Grotius</hi> his way depends so on the Chronologie of the writing of the Apocalypse, that unless <hi>Iohn</hi> received these Revelations in <hi>Claudius</hi> his time, (which yet is against the common current of all both ancient and modern writers) the fabrick of his Expositions falls to the ground. To which you may add, that he has no guide nor clue at all in this prophetick Labyrinth, no
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:55305:106"/>
not so much as that obvious, but fallible one, the <hi>order of the Prophecies as they lie</hi>; but is forced sometimes to goe back, as he fancieth himself able to apply his Historical materials. So that he has indeed no guide at all from the Apocalypse it self; whenas Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> is directed and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by the demonstrative law of those innate <hi>Synchronisms</hi> he has gathered. Of whose truth this may be one general After-ratification, that the things that are found to be <hi>Synchronal,</hi> have also a natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion and complication one with another, as he that but casts his eye upon his <hi>Scheme of Synchronisms,</hi> and considers the natures of things, will easily deprehend.</p>

               <p n="1">1. BUT for further conviction of the Excellency of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s way above that of <hi>Grotius</hi>'s, I shall compare some of their main Interpretations. For to meddle with all would be too tedious and volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous; but to give a specimen in some, very commodious, if not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. First therefore, In the first six Seals, I may add also in the first six Trumpets, <hi>Grotius</hi> fixes the Scene of all these Visions in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> and ends them with the sacking of the City. Of which in general it is to be noted, That his Applications are too small and petty usually for these Prophecies; and that the Prophecies themselves, if they had no other meaning, might very well have been spared; whatever is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in them to the Church having before more plainly been predicted by the mouth of our blessed Saviour, and therefore not likely to fill so great a part of the Apocalypse by their more obscure prefigurations. But we will descend also to their particular weaknesses and inconcinni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and first of the <hi>Seals,</hi> with the <hi>Session of Majesty</hi> prefixed before them.<note place="margin">Revel. 4.</note> Where <hi>Grotius</hi> makes the Four beasts, the <hi>Lion, Calfs, Man</hi> and <hi>Eagle,</hi> to be <hi>Peter, Iames, Matthew</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> Which besides that in
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55305:106"/>
general it is a figment at pleasure without ground, the applications I think are not so congruous. For why should <hi>Peter,</hi> who out of fear denied his Master, be a <hi>Lion</hi> more then <hi>Paul,</hi> whose heat assuredly was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greater then the others? and why <hi>Paul</hi> an <hi>Eagle</hi> rather then a <hi>Calf,</hi> who certainly laboured like an Oxe in the Ministery, and compares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to one that treadeth out the corn, 1 Cor. 9.9? And though he took long journies, yet he did not flie in the Air, nor goe faster by land or water then other travellers did. And why should <hi>Matthew</hi> be a <hi>Man</hi> more then all the rest, and rather then <hi>Iames,</hi> the brother of <hi>Iesus</hi> who was peculiarly styled <hi>the Son of Man</hi>?</p>
               <p>Wherefore Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s account seems far more solid, as having an <hi>acknowledged ground, the order of the Camp of Israel,</hi> which was distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted into Four parts, each part being under a Standard or Ensigne: those that lay on the <hi>East,</hi> of a <hi>Lion</hi>; on the <hi>West,</hi> of an <hi>Oxe</hi>; on the <hi>South,</hi> of a <hi>Man</hi>; and on the <hi>North,</hi> of an <hi>Eagle.</hi> So that this <hi>glorious Session of the Divine Majesty</hi> is set out by the <hi>order of the Israelitish Camp,</hi> where in the midst was the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> as the <hi>Throne</hi> of God, and about it the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> so disposed as I have intimated. Which is infinitely a more solid account then that of <hi>Grotius,</hi> as you shall more distinctly understand in the opening the four first Seals, whose applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are admirably fit to each Beast in Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s way, but very frigid and faint in <hi>Grotius</hi>'s. For he thinks it reason enough of the <hi>Lion,</hi> that is, <hi>Peter,</hi> his <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 6.1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>calling to see the Rider of the white Horse,</hi> because <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was the <hi>first</hi> that preached the Gospel, and therefore he speaks <hi>first</hi> here. Whenas it does not appear he spake <hi>first</hi> of those that spake the unknown tongues so fast, Acts 2. who questionless preached the Gospel in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this <hi>Rider of the white Horse</hi> is Christ, they both agree in; but why the first beast should be the <hi>Praeco</hi> before this sight, Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s reasons are far more satisfactory, as you shall hear anon. The <hi>Praeco</hi> of the <note n="*" place="margin">Verse 3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Rider of the red Horse</hi> he makes <hi>Matthew,</hi> because it is written Matth. 24.7. <hi>Nation shall rise against nation and Kingdome against king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> But this is not <hi>Matthew</hi>'s prophecie but our Saviour's. The Vision he fansieth fulfilled in the war betwixt the <hi>Beroeans</hi> and <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphians,</hi> but names no distinct time, nor Prince that should be the Rider of this red Horse.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Praeco</hi> of the <note n="*" place="margin">Verse 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Rider of the black Horse</hi> he makes <hi>Paul,</hi> because <hi>Agabus</hi> foretold him this <hi>famine</hi> which he fansieth signified here. But then <hi>Agabus</hi> should have rather been the Beast then <hi>Paul.</hi> Beside that, <hi>Agabus</hi> told other Christians as well as him of it. The fulfilling of this Vision according to him was in the reign of <hi>Claudius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Praeco</hi> of the <note n="*" place="margin">Verse 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Rider of the pale Horse</hi> he makes <hi>Iames,</hi> because he threatens rich men with <hi>death,</hi> chap. 5. But himself acknowledges that by <hi>death</hi> here is meant <hi>plague</hi> and <hi>pestilence,</hi> whenas that menace in <hi>Iames</hi> is <hi>war</hi> and <hi>slaughter,</hi> the taking and burning <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by fire; as himself also interprets the third verse of that chapter. You see by what small strings the applications of these four Beasts are tied to these four Visions hitherto; to omit what is very inconcinne, the breaking
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55305:107"/>
the order they were first named in, (chap. 4. ver. 7.) the first a <hi>Lion,</hi> the second an <hi>Oxe,</hi> the third a <hi>Man,</hi> and the fourth an <hi>Eagle.</hi> Which should have answered to the first, second, third, and fourth Seals with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any misplacing; whenas the second Beast is here applied to the fourth Seal, the third to the second, and the fourth to the third.</p>
               <p>The <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 6.9.</note> Fifth Seal he interprets of <hi>the revenge of the bloud of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> does, but restrains the Vision to <hi>Steven</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> and some few else he knows not who: and by this means leaves no Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for the Ten bloudy Persecutions which were more then ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times more considerable then what he aims at.</p>
               <p>The <note n="*" place="margin">Verse 12.</note> Sixth Seal, which mentions <hi>a great Earthquake, the Eclipse of Sun and Moon, the falling of the Stars,</hi> &amp;c. he interprets <hi>literally</hi> of such Prodigies, quite against the way of Prophetick interpretation, and without the application of History to countenance it. Such is the inconcinnity and insignificancy of <hi>Grotius</hi> his interpreting of the <hi>Six seals:</hi> Which is quite otherwise in Mr. <hi>Mede.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. For first the application of the <hi>Four beasts</hi> to the <hi>Four first seals</hi> is both <hi>orderly</hi> and very <hi>proper</hi> and articulate. For the <hi>Lion</hi> on the <hi>East</hi> side of the Israelitish camp is applied to Christ the Prince from the East in more senses then I will insist upon, they being ordinary and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious. Besides that, the nature of a <hi>Lion</hi> is sutable to the thing signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Vision, to wit <hi>Victory</hi> to him on the white horse. And the like in the rest. For so the <hi>Oxe</hi> on the <hi>West</hi> side of the camp is applied to <hi>Trajan</hi> from West; the <hi>Man</hi> on the <hi>South</hi> side, to <hi>Septimius</hi> from the South; &amp; the <hi>Eagle</hi> on the <hi>North</hi> side, to <hi>Maximinus</hi> from the North. The natures also of the <hi>Visions</hi> are sutable to the things that came to pass under those Emperours. The mighty <hi>Slaughters</hi> under <hi>Trajan</hi> and his successor <hi>Adrian</hi> are indigitated by the <hi>Oxe.</hi> The exactness of administring <hi>Iustice</hi> and carefull <hi>Provision</hi> of <hi>Septimius</hi> and <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> by a <hi>Man,</hi> to whom numbring and measuring and the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Justice is so proper. The extraordinary raging of the <hi>Famine, Sword</hi> and <hi>Pestilence</hi> under <hi>Maximinus,</hi> by the <hi>Carnivorous Eagle</hi> that feeds upon dead carkasses.</p>
               <p>In brief, the meaning of the <hi>First six seals</hi> is this: That Prince of unspotted Righteousness, <hi>the Rider of the white Horse,</hi> with his arrow and his bow in his hand, aims at something of high importance, (and it is no less then what he promised his followers at their lowest ebb, <hi>Fear not,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 12.32.</note> 
                  <hi>little flock, for it is your Fathers good pleasure to give you the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>:) and he hits the mark in the <hi>Sixth seal,</hi> where the Pagan Empire of the Devil is shattered to the purpose by <hi>Constantine</hi>'s turning Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. But to adorn the course of time till then by some Prophetick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, <hi>the Riders of the red, black and pale Horses</hi> are brought in: as also most concerningly <hi>the cry of the Souls of the Martyrs under the Altar,</hi> whereby is denoted especially the reign of <hi>Diocletian</hi> and that ten years unparallel'd persecution then commencing. Which <hi>Fifth seal,</hi> the rescuing of the Empire into the hands of Christ by the Subversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Pagan powers doth immediately succeed, and is the matter of the <hi>Sixth seal</hi> figured out by proper Prophetical expressions. So
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:55305:107"/>
that all things in Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s way as they are <hi>easie, natural</hi> and <hi>distinct,</hi> so are they very <hi>weighty</hi> and <hi>worthy</hi> the Spirit of God and his holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to predict.</p>
               <p>Nor has <hi>Grotius</hi> so much as any seeming advantage of him in any thing, unless in the interpreting of <hi>the Rider of the black Horse.</hi> Which, if History would have complied, Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> could have been content to have interpreted of <hi>Famine</hi> also. But in my apprehension nothing can be more significant of that which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> applies it to then this Vision is. For what <hi>colour</hi> is more significant of the <hi>Severity of Iustice</hi> then <hi>black,</hi> whether we look upon the Temper of Spirit wherein it resides, which is a <hi>grave, sad, rigid melancholy</hi>; or the Execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in criminal matters, which is <hi>death,</hi> whose mournfull Emblem is <hi>black</hi>? The <hi>black Horse</hi> therefore, <hi>with the pair of balances,</hi> argues the Rider <hi>severely just, frugal</hi> and <hi>provident,</hi> and one that will have a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care,<note place="margin">Revel. 6.6.</note> 1. That if <hi>one</hi> Choenix of wheat be sold for a penny, that <hi>three</hi> of barley shall be sold for a penny. 2. That men shal live by their <hi>honest labours,</hi> and not by <hi>theft</hi> and <hi>rapine.</hi> For Choenix signifies <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>the food for a day,</hi> and <hi>Denarius</hi> the <hi>wages for a days labour.</hi> 3. That there shall be no stealing nor robbing (but buying by measure,) though it should be so hard a time that their day-labour will but find them food. 4. He will provide that they shall have at least a <hi>Choenix</hi> for a penny, that the price of bread-corn and necessary victuals may not exceed a daies wages. And so of <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Oile</hi> he will take heed there be no fraud in buying and selling there neither, nor any spoil or wast by the unruly souldiery.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I should now pass to the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> but I will rather deal with those Visions first that are Synchronal to the time of these <hi>Six seals.</hi> And that is <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 12.7.</note> 
                  <hi>the Fight of</hi> Michael <hi>with the seven-headed Dragon</hi>; and <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 11.1.</note> 
                  <hi>the Temple and Altar of God that are Symmetral</hi> or <hi>commensurable to the Angels measure.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> interprets this Fight of the <hi>seven-headed Dragon</hi> and <hi>Michael,</hi> the conflict of the Church of Christ with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan cruelty till <hi>Constantine</hi>'s and <hi>Theodosiu</hi>'s times; which therefore as it is Synchronal, so has it also a great cognation with the Visions of the <hi>Six seals.</hi> For the <hi>Archer on the white Horse</hi> aims at that Effect all the time of this bloudy battel, which he hits or reaches in the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sixth seal.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Grotius</hi> referres the Vision to <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> who brought him down headlong out of the Air by his praiers, at which he supposes <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 12.10.</note> that acclamation of the Angels, who were the Spectators of this <hi>Cacomagical Funambulo,</hi> and beheld him out of the windows of Heaven while he tumbled down to the ground. But what a petty and ludicrous business is this in respect of that Effect comprized in the Sixth seal, which is both the issue of this battel and the mark the Archer on the white horse aimed at by all the labours and patience of his Saints?</p>
               <p>That of <hi>the</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 11.1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Temple of God</hi> or <hi>the inward Court of the Temple Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> expounds only to this sense, That it is thus <hi>measured,</hi> to signifie that <hi>Adrian</hi> should not build upon it, though he did upon the ground about it, and called the city <hi>Aelia,</hi> after his own name. But he brings
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:55305:108"/>
no express proof that the <hi>inward court</hi> was not built upon; nor, if it were not, was it a thing worth Divine Prophecie taking notice of: nor is there any likelihood that Providence regarded the place so which God had utterly rejected, and <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 7. ch. 9. sect. 10.</note> hindred the rebuilding of it by fire brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from the foundation. Certainly so Divine a Prophecie as this of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> looks not at such petty matters as these. Besides, the Angel's bidding <hi>Iohn measure</hi> not only the <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Altar,</hi> but also <hi>the men that worshipped therein,</hi> plainly intimates that there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of meaning in the thing then <hi>Grotius</hi> sought after, but is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has found, namely, that this <hi>inward Court that is measured</hi> signifies the pure Christian Church before it was adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated by a kind of Christian-paganisme. Which condition also of the Church has a plain cognation with other things Synchronal, as their <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 12.11.</note> resolute opposing the Dragon, and being so serious in their Religion that they preferred it before their own lives.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

               <p>The Vision of the <note n="*" place="margin">Verse 8.</note> Second <hi>Trumpet,</hi> namely, the <hi>burning Mountain cast into the Sea, Grotius</hi> expounds of the tower <hi>Antonia,</hi> whose fall notwithstanding was not accompanied with <hi>burning,</hi> and therefore he rather understands it of the sallying of the wrathfull souldiers out of the tower upon the people of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Which is but a petty matter in comparison of <hi>Alaricus</hi> his <hi>taking</hi> and <hi>firing of Rome,</hi> upon which followed a continual spoil of the Empire till it was dilacerated into <hi>Ten</hi> kingdomes; which is Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s exposition of this Vision.

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:55305:108"/>
it to the extinction of the Western <hi>Caesareate,</hi> which was grown very low and obscure in those inconsiderable Emperours, <hi>Avitus, Majoranus, Severus, Anthemius, Olybrius, Glycerius, Nepos,</hi> the immediate predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of <hi>Augustulus</hi>; but fell quite and was extinct in this Prince of <hi>sorrow, bitterness</hi> and sad misfortunes, whom <hi>Odoacer</hi> king of the <hi>Heruli</hi> pulled out of his throne, Anno 476.</p>

Which ill fate is very properly prefigured by the <hi>obscuration of Sun, Moon and Stars,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has undeniably made good, and accordingly applied the History. <hi>Grotius</hi> interprets it only of the taking of certain Towns in <hi>Galilee</hi> and other places by <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and the slaughter of the <hi>Iews.</hi> Which is a very laxe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute interpretation in comparison of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s application of this Vision to <hi>Mahomet</hi> and the <hi>Saracens</hi> is in every respect admirably natural and punctual.

Which Visions though they be more then any Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals besides, yet they have all a very near cognation or manifest colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation one to another. The general Summary of the condition of the times they point out, is <hi>the Apostasie</hi> or <hi>Degeneracy of the Church</hi>; which yet is never conceived so ill, but that there were <hi>some pure and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Christians</hi> in it; and therefore to represent the two sorts of Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of Christianity there are two sorts also of Visions: Those of the <hi>Whore of Babylon, the Ten-horned Beast</hi> and <hi>the Two-horned Beast,</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Degeneracy</hi> of Christendome; the <hi>Two Witnesses mourning in sackcloth, the Virgin Company, the sealed of the Lamb,</hi> to those that kept their <hi>Purity</hi> in the Church. All these <hi>synchronize</hi> with the six first Trumpets, out of which is blown the wrath of God upon the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, as is but just, by reason of their Apostasie; as it is also equal with God to protect his own then. And therefore the <hi>Company of the Lamb</hi> are <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 7.3.</note> 
                  <hi>sealed</hi> and <hi>marked</hi> to be kept from the common calamities. This general Apostasy also could not have crept in, if the <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astick</hi> and <hi>Secular</hi> Power had not conspired, and therefore there is the <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> as well as the <hi>Ten-horned.</hi> Against which are opposed the <hi>Two mourning Witnesses,</hi> the one sustaining the person of the unpol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Priest, the other of the faithful Magistrate. And this Apostasy consisting much in gross <hi>Idolatry</hi> and vain <hi>Superstition,</hi> which according to Scripture-language is termed <hi>Whoredome</hi>; this State is set out also by the Vision of the <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi> to which is opposed the <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 14.4.</note>

               </p>
               <p>There are yet Two Visions behind which are not properly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to this sort or that, but each of them to both, namely, <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 12.6.</note> the <hi>Woman in the Wilderness,</hi> and <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 11.2.</note> 
                  <hi>the Outward Court and holy City trodden down by the Gentiles.</hi> Which Visions have the insinuation of both <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Profaneness</hi> in them at once: The truly <hi>pious</hi> part of the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing signified by the <hi>Woman</hi>; but by the <hi>Wilderness</hi> the <hi>salvageness</hi> and <hi>brutishness</hi> of the rest of Christendome, they being wholy given up to the <hi>Animal Life.</hi> By the <hi>Outward Court and holy City</hi> is noted the <hi>Sanctity</hi> of the Christian Church set apart from the rest of the world; but by <hi>the being trodden down by the Gentiles,</hi> the imitation of <hi>Pagan worship</hi> introduced by the <hi>general Apostasy</hi> of Christendome. So that you see by what a strong tie from the very nature of the Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves these <hi>Eight Synchronal Visions</hi> are held together with, in one time.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Let us now consider <hi>Grotius</hi> his chief mistakes or defects in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting of them. As in those of <hi>the Two Witnesses,</hi> and of <hi>the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court and holy City being trodden down by the Gentiles</hi> for <hi>forty two months,</hi> which is, saith he, for about <hi>three years and an half.</hi> This City he interprets of <hi>Aelia</hi> built by <hi>Adrian:</hi> which therefore in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is not to be looked upon as <hi>holy</hi>; as indeed the City of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> ceased so to be, when the Jews had ceased to be God's people. <hi>The trampling the holy City</hi> he interprets of the building of a Temple there to <hi>Iupiter Capitolinus.</hi> As if that Temple stood but <hi>three years and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:55305:111"/>
an half.</hi> But he would terminate these years from the beginning of the building of this Temple to the sedition of <hi>Barchochab</hi>; but brings no History to make good his device: and if he could make this time of <hi>Barchochab</hi> good, it were yet good for nothing, unless he could also pull down the Temple at the three years and an half's end. The <hi>Two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi> he would have the <hi>Two Churches</hi> in <hi>Aelia,</hi> the one speaking <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi> the other <hi>Greek</hi>; as if the Spirit of God divided these into Two that professed one faith and were of one mind, not distinguished in any thing save in outward language. <note n="*" place="margin">Vers. 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>The bodies of these slain Witnesses lying in the streets of the great City three days and an half,</hi> this he interprets of the oppression and persecution by <hi>Barchochab</hi>; which certainly was <hi>very short,</hi> if but <hi>three days and an half</hi> long: neither does he here bring any proof of History, nor is it probable that divine Prophecy would affect the preciseness of <hi>half a day</hi> or <hi>three days and an half</hi> in such a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral prefiguration of things as the Apocalypse is. Besides, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely is it that <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that had now lost all its <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> should be styled by the name of <hi>the great City?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The chiefest ground that they have to think so, is that expression, as if <note n="*" place="margin">Vers. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>our Lord</hi> was <hi>crucified there.</hi> But I answer, that our Lord in a <hi>literal</hi> sense was not crucified either in <hi>Sodome</hi> or <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which <gap reason="foreign">

Wherefore this City is nothing else but the degenerate Polity of the Apostate Church where Christ is persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (as he complained to <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 9.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Saul</hi>) in his true and living members. Where also Christ according to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that is, the <hi>Divine life,</hi> is rightly said <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> was, is, and will be crucified so long as this power of Apostasy holds up. For the Praeter Tense in Prophecy is very usual for the Future. But if any one disrelish this more Mystical sense, I shall substitute that of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s, which the coursest <hi>Literalist</hi> cannot evade, namely that by <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is understood the Extent of the whole <hi>Romane</hi> Empire within which Christ was literally crucified. See Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> upon the Text.</p>

(For we may put them together, they being the same according to <hi>Grotius</hi> his own confession) This Beast he makes the Sin of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Which is quite out of the way of interpreting Prophetick Schemes, where <hi>Beasts</hi> signifie <hi>Kingdomes</hi> or <hi>Dominions,</hi> as is plain out of <hi>Daniel.</hi> But the <hi>Ten horns</hi> he will allow to be <hi>Ten kings:</hi> in which he were right, if he had acknowledged a body fit to bear them.

So much of forcedness and incoherency is there in the making out this false Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis. That also is harsh in my judgement, the making presently one of these Heads, which were before <hi>Caesars,</hi> to be the <hi>Capitol</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>; though it be said to be <note n="*" place="margin">Vers. 3.</note>

                  <hi>sword,</hi> and to be <hi>healed</hi> also: which methinks are very unnaturally applicable to a <hi>Hill</hi> or a <hi>Tower.</hi> He pretends he has hit the time of <note n="*" place="margin">Vers. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>the forty two months</hi> this Beast should make warre: but he referrs to no History; and <hi>Helvicus</hi> affixes the beginning of the Second persecution to the Tenth of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s reign: Whence it will not be <hi>Three years and an half,</hi> but rather <hi>Six years,</hi> that he wars against the Saints.</p>
               <p>But the chiefest artifice of his misinterpretation is upon Chap. 17. of the Revelation. Where the Beast <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 17.8.</note> 
                  <hi>that was, and is not, and is to ascend out of the bottomless pit, and to go into perdition,</hi> he again applies to <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> making nothing of transfiguring <hi>a single Head</hi> into a <hi>whole Beast.</hi> But the description is more accurate, vers. 10, &amp;c. <hi>The seven heads are seven kings; five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come: and when he cometh, he must continue a short space. And the Beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition. And the ten horns which thou sawest, are ten kings, which have received no kingdome as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the Beast.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>five kings</hi> here that <hi>are fallen,</hi> saith <hi>Grotius,</hi> are <hi>Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius</hi>: which how fond a conceit it is, I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy demonstrated. <hi>And one is,</hi> that is, saith he, <hi>Vespasian,</hi> in whose reign it is supposed, not proved, that <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote these Visions. <hi>The other is not yet come,</hi> namely <hi>Titus. And when he comes, must continue but a short time.</hi> But <hi>Galba, Otho,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius</hi> much shorter. <hi>The Beast that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55305:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was and is not,</hi> to wit <hi>Domitian,</hi> who was <hi>Emperour</hi> while his father <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasian</hi> was absent from <hi>Rome.</hi> Which if he were really, and not styled so out of complement and flattery, the application is handsome. For then it was sometimes true of him, that <hi>he was,</hi> and <hi>is not,</hi> and <hi>shall be Emperour again. He is the eighth. Domitian</hi> is indeed the <hi>eighth</hi> and so distinct an head and so considerable, as reigning longer then any of his predecessors, that he quite spoils the interpretation. For thus the Beast will be <hi>eight-headed,</hi> not <hi>seven-headed,</hi> contrary to the Vision: Which those words, <hi>and is of the seven,</hi> do therefore correct, and shew that the <hi>eighth</hi> is not so the <hi>eighth</hi> but that there are still <hi>but seven</hi> heads: which <note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Comment.

                  <hi>Two-horned Beast</hi> to whom the number 666 can rationally be applied: which <hi>Grotius</hi> would fit to <hi>Ulpius</hi> the known name of <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour, which he reads ΟΥΛΠΙΟC, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king C stand for six.

But it seems there is some skill to be used therein, because he saith, <hi>here is wisdome,</hi> and, <hi>let him that hath understanding calculate the number of the Beast.</hi> Which if it were but the putting of the numeral letters of some Name together, would be but a very petty piece of skill. All the skill or rather luck would be to find out the <hi>Name,</hi> but there would be no skill at all in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating of the <hi>Number.</hi> But the Text saith, <hi>Let him that hath skill calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the number of the Beast</hi>; and it sets down the very number that is to be numbred. Which number yet cannot be numbred after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men (which way notwithstanding is intimated) but by Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Root: and therefore undoubtedly Mr. <hi>Potter</hi> has found out the true and solid solution of this Mysterie.</p>
               <p>Concerning which no man can fail to be satisfied, unless either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or prejudice make him uncapable, if he consider, First, in general, what rich mysteries the Spirit of God has been pleased to wrap up in <hi>Numbers.</hi> Of which there are many pregnant examples in the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world distributed into <hi>Six</hi> daies. The meaning whereof is not otherwise to be understood but by the nature and powers of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as I have clearly enough shewn in the Defence of my Philosophick <hi>Cabbala.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then in the next place (which is closer to the purpose) if he take notice of what the abovesaid Author urges most pertinently, That other Numbers in Scripture are of necessity to be numbred thus by the extraction of the <hi>Root</hi> either <hi>Square</hi> or <hi>Cubick,</hi> to know the particular dimensions of things numbred by them. As those Stones mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned 1 Kings 7.10. which are said to be some of <hi>eight,</hi> others of <hi>ten Cubits:</hi> Which must needs be the <hi>Cubick</hi> summe of each stone, as he hath undeniably demonstrated. That <hi>Square numbers</hi> are also taken notice of, is evident from Ezekiel 48.20. <hi>Five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand.</hi> But to come nearer to the business in hand, the <hi>Cubical</hi> summe of the new <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> namely, <hi>Twelve thousand fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs,</hi> is set down in the <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 21.16.</note> 
                  <hi>Apocalypse</hi>; of which there can be no sense in way of numbring but to find the <hi>Perimeter</hi> thereof. Which is not to be done but by the extraction of the <hi>Cubick</hi> root. The measure also of the Wall, <note n="*" place="margin">Verse 17.</note> 
                  <hi>an hundred fourty four cubits,</hi> is utterly unapplicable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to if we look upon it as the number of one Line. For it would be too little for the <hi>Perimeter</hi> by far, and too great for the <hi>altitude</hi> thereof: wherefore the measure of the <hi>thickness</hi> and <hi>height</hi> of the Wall is the Root of an hundred fourty four, namely <hi>Twelve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly therefore, the applicability of the number 144 to the Holy City appearing in the Root thereof, to wit 12, which is a number peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly consecrated to signifie the chief matters of the new <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; The <hi>Chiliarchies</hi> also or <hi>Regiments,</hi> as I may so call them, of the Lamb being summed up in this number in the very beginning of that

                  <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 14.1.</note> Chapter that immediatly follows the mention of the <hi>number of the Beast,</hi> and being made up of twelve times twelve <hi>Chiliades,</hi> as appears chap. 7. how unexceptionable a warrant and assurance is it, that <hi>the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of the number of the Beast</hi> must be <hi>the finding out of the Root of his number also,</hi> and that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> lies not betwixt 144 and 666 so much as betwixt 12 and 25, and that as 12 is the number of the <hi>pure and Apostolick Church,</hi> so 25 of the <hi>lapsed</hi> and <hi>Antichristian?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the clear and unbyassed reason of the thing <hi>in Abstracto,</hi> let it light where it will. But it lights so pat upon the <hi>Romish Hierarchy,</hi> that a man cannot but be amazed at so exact a Providence. For this lucky and learned Writer has out of History made it even over-clear, that <hi>Twenty Five</hi> is a character as essentially interwoven into the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy of Rome as <hi>Twelve</hi> is into the State of the new <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> And those six main things that this holy City is set out by in the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse, namely
<list>
                     <item>1. Twelve Gates,</item>

                  </gap> exactly in the <hi>Roman Hierarchy</hi> and City, viz.
<list>
                     <item>1. Five and twenty Gates, whether taken literally, or mystically for Churches to baptize in,</item>
                     <item>2. Five and twenty Angels, that is, Pastors,</item>
                     <item>3. Five and twenty Titles or Parishes,</item>

                     </item>
                     <item>6. Five and twenty Articles of the Creed which should be the food of the Tree of life to all believers.</item>
                  </list>
In these essential matters and in many other things beside has he evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently shown how exactly the root of 666 is applicable to the <hi>Roman Hierarchy</hi>; to whose Treatise I must refer thee for further satisfaction. Which thou canst not fail of, if thou be free from prejudice, and furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but with a tolerable insight in Geometry and Arithmetick.</p>
               <p>The greatest and most obvious Objection against his interpretation is, That 666 is not a perfect Square number as 144 is. For they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, if 25 be the number aimed at, why was not the express number of the Beast rather 625, the exact square of 25? or why not any other number betwixt 625 and 676 as well as 666? To which I briefly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That as it was not expressed by the <hi>Root</hi> but by the <hi>Square,</hi> for concealment sake; so for the same reason not by the <hi>perfect Square,</hi> there being so smart a clang of the Root it self at the end of it, which might have hindred the completion of the Prophecy, and awakened them into an over-great caution how they affected the number of 25, it being so considerable a part of the number of the Beast, and might have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:55305:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or discovered the mystery of numbring it also too soon to the world. And for the numbers betwixt 625 and 676, I demand, why not 666 as well as any of the rest? For having once passed by the true Square, for which there was so good reason, any modest man might judge the choice of the rest free and indifferent.</p>
               <p>But besides, that there may want no exactness in this mystery, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 666 bears along with it very important significations and very appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the matter it is applied to: As that noted by Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> That the Idolatrous poison of the <hi>Sixth head</hi> is signified thereby, pervading all the body of this Antichristian Beast. That also of <hi>Grotius</hi> is ingenious, <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius numerus res hujus mundi significat, ut Septenarius res seculi melioris.</hi> So that by this account both the outside and inside of <hi>this number</hi> of the Beast is worldly, carnal and sensual. For the Root also, viz. 25, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the same nature; the Root of that Root being <hi>Five,</hi> an Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick of <hi>Sensuality</hi> and <hi>stupid adhesion</hi> to the <hi>Objects</hi> of the <hi>outward Senses</hi>; which are the chief faculties of the Soul that are caressed and emploied in the <hi>Romane</hi> Religion. There their Religion begins, and there it ends, as it is in this number 25, which is made by 5 into it self, and ends in 5 again. This is the circuit of their superstitious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances that reach not the rectifying of the inward, but are mere fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, though bewitching, entertainments of the outward man.</p>
               <p>And lastly, the above-cited Author's own account is not only very witty, but equally solid, in my judgment, concerning the nearer approx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imation of the Root of 666 (taking in the fraction) to 26 then to 25, that both these numbers may have a pretence to be the Root. For thereby the number 666 does more exquisitely and unavoidably figure out the <hi>Papal Hierarchie.</hi> By its Root 25, the twenty five Cardinals in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction to the Pope, an Head above them. By 26, the twenty five Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals with the Pope, who pretends also when he pleases to be one of the Cardinals. But he adds also another reason of this number, which is not rashly to be rejected: That as 144, being a perfect Square, sets out the figure of the <hi>Area</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> so the most perfect figure of 666 has the same proportion of length and breadth that the figure of the <hi>Area</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> These argumentations will seem very strange and odd to such as are not so much as acquainted with the first rudiments of Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick and Geometry, or at least have not taken notice that the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entest and best Wisdome has been hid in the Symbols of Numbers; which is notorius in <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his School. But he that seriously considers what small sense can be made by a Philosopher of the <hi>Six</hi> daies Creation and God's resting on the <hi>Seventh,</hi> without this key of the natures of <hi>Numbers</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> will be enforced to confess, That there is one supreme Wisdome that has ever attended the Church and the holy Scriptures, from end to end, which in the abstrusest mysteries thereof has been pleased to make use of a method of concealment which is <hi>Numeral,</hi> or, if I may so speak, <hi>Cabbalistical.</hi>

But it is to be considered in how short a time that honour was turned into Idolatrous reproach, as also how the <hi>thousand years</hi> according to his account are expired above three hundred years agoe; from whence commences the Devil's being let loose: Which we cannot term <note n="*" place="margin">Verse 3.</note>

Upon this false Hypothesis hangs the conceit of the <hi>Turks</hi> besieging <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to be the begirting of the <hi>holy City</hi> by the numerous armies of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog.</hi> For the <hi>Greeks</hi> themselves styled <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> New <hi>Sion,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> has noted. But it is plain the Exposition is a mere hallucination, because <hi>the holy and beloved City</hi> in the Prophecie is <hi>not taken,</hi> God interposing by <hi>fire from Heaven,</hi> and sweeping all away by that finall judgement. But the <hi>Turks</hi> have <hi>taken</hi> this <hi>Sion,</hi> and have peaceably possessed it these two hundred years.</p>
               <p>I shall conclude with the <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 21.2.</note> new <hi>Ierusalem, the Lambs Bride, adorned for her husband</hi>; which <hi>Grotius</hi> interprets of the Catholick Church made now more splendid with outward ornaments by the care and cost of Princes. Which in my apprehension is no good sense; <hi>Marriage</hi> rather signifying the bringing in some people to Christ that were not united to him before, or at least the appearing of a people that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hid, then the external adorning of them that were already the known and professed people of Christ. Besides that the times that <hi>Grotius</hi> points at are the most unlike that new <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which is the Church recovered to her <hi>Apostolical Symmetry</hi> again, and to be <note n="*" place="margin">Verse 15.</note>

                  <hi>twelve thousand furlongs:</hi> the breadth of <note n="*" place="margin">Verse 17.</note> the wall also and the height thereof is measured by Twelve. So that there is nothing in this new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> but what is pure and Apostolical; which is not so in the garishly-adorned Church that <hi>Groti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> looks at.

And verily if I were not consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to my self that the very same spirit did in some measure act me in this discovery of his mistakes, that did him in committing of them, I mean the sense of Peace and Common good of the Church, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be in his Errors accompanied with Humanity and Kindness of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, then be in a Truth that must needs be attended with Salvageness, Ferocity and Fury. But as the Truth I stand for is above <hi>Grotius</hi>'s mistakes, so I hope the good of my design will not appear inferiour to his, after you have considered the <hi>Benefit</hi> of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s interpretations of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> as well as the <hi>Truth</hi> thereof.</p>

               <p n="1">1. AND truly <hi>the Benefit of the Apocalypse</hi> so interpreted as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has expounded it, is invaluable. For the Visions are so perfectly &amp; patly applicable to acknowledged History this way that he goes; that he that will not believe the Prophecies fulfilled in those things he produces, cannot believe the fulfilling of any Prophecies at all: whenas on the other side, if the Applications were no more weighty, nor clearer and fitter then they are <hi>Grotius</hi>'s way, this Book of Prophecies would be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Useless,</hi> it being in the power of no man that is not extremely credulous to be satisfied with such lame, imperfect, nay, as I said, impossible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations. Wherefore the Vindication of the Method of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> in interpreting this Book, is really the rescuing of the Book it self into that power and use it ought to have in the Church: For it is a stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Light to all Ages thereof, and the greatest to the last.</p>
               <p>Nor do those Expressions of <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 1.1. &amp; ch. 22.6.</note>

                  </gap>, at all infringe the Truth we have declared, or import that all the matters in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> appertain to either <hi>the Destruction of Ierusalem</hi> or to <hi>Rome Heathen.</hi> For as for the former, it seems very needless to spend many <hi>Visions</hi> upon it; our Saviour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving prophesied of it so <hi>clearly</hi> before, and with all usefull circumstances that could be desired. How vain therefore is it to imagine so many <hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> spent thereupon in this Book, that are not only <hi>obscurer</hi> then our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Prophecie, but so <hi>obscure</hi> that they are now not tolerably appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the known Events; and therefore must be utterly <hi>useless</hi> to the Church, because they could neither forewarn them of any thing <hi>before</hi> the Event, nor be a Record of God's foresight and Providence <hi>after</hi> it?</p>
               <p>And for the latter, I say there are <hi>Visions</hi> plain and express enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Heathen Rome,</hi> and her bloudy persecuting the Church, in the battel of <hi>Michael</hi> and the <hi>Dragon.</hi> The first <hi>six Seals</hi> also appertain to that time while <hi>Rome</hi> was Heathen; the Sixth whereof signifies the mighty change of things to the advantage of the Church, the Empire becoming Christian. Wherefore there is no want of <hi>Visions</hi> for <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Rome,</hi> nor any but what were very significant and usefull; as all the <hi>six Seals</hi> and the Vision of <hi>Michael</hi> and the <hi>Dragon</hi> are: Which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Church to be patient under those Ten bloudy persecutions, in assurance that at last they should have the victorie over their persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting enemie. And what could they desire more to be signified then this in such general Prophecies as these? Nay I say further, they might have counted the nearness of their deliverance by the posture of the Beasts that were the <hi>Praeco</hi>'s of the four first Seals, observing from what quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter such Emperours came as bore the greatest similitude with the Riders of the <hi>red, black</hi> and <hi>pale</hi> Horses: and when the Persecution was the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55305:115"/>
highest, their Hopes were the clearest, and the Event nearest; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the easie meaning of the Fifth and Sixth Seal. So that there are <hi>Visions</hi> enough concerning the <hi>Romane Empire</hi> while it was <hi>Pagan,</hi> so far forth as it concerned the Church.</p>
               <p>And why should there not be <hi>Visions</hi> that concern the <hi>Empire</hi> when it was turned <hi>Christian,</hi> and <hi>Paganized again</hi> under Christianity, and in this Apostasie cruelly oppressed and persecuted the true members of Christ? Why should not this State of things be prophesied of as well as the former? To this there are but these two Answers to be given; Either that the Church is not apostatized, or that those Phrases <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> do plainly signifie that the scope of the Apocalypse reaches not so far. The former answer I could wish were solid, but have no leisure here to dispute it. The latter I conceive is very weak and unsatisfactory, and from an inference as ridiculous as his would be, that upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that such a <hi>Comedy</hi> or <hi>Tragedy</hi> was to be acted half a quarter of an houre hence, which, I think, is very quickly, should conclude that all the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Scenes</hi> thereof would not be a quarter of an hour long. And to make use of the suffrage of our very Adversaries, <hi>Grotius</hi> himself interprets <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> not of the whole series of Visions, but of some of them only, and particularly of the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; and othersome they are fain to expound of such Events as have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but two hundred years ago, and of such as are not to come to pass be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the End of the World. Which is a demonstration of the insolidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Exception against Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s method of interpreting this Book: Whose meaning for the general we having cleared from all possible prejudices, let us now consider <hi>the important Usefulness</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the first place therefore, in my apprehension it is the clearest and plainest conviction that can be offered to the Understanding of a man, <hi>That there is a special Providence over the Church of God,</hi> and <hi>That there are Angels, the Ministers of this Providence,</hi> to consider how there has been the communication of Prophecies concerning the affairs of the Church and Family of God by the ministry of Angels appearing to his Servants the Prophets from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, the Father of the faithfull, to this very age and onwards; the truth of the Events plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lying before our eyes, either in things that still continue, or are to be read in undoubted History. Which is a sign that those Prophets who said they did commune with <hi>Angels,</hi> did not commune with their own <hi>Fancies,</hi> but had real conference with those <hi>Celestial Inhabitants.</hi> As <hi>Abraham</hi> certainly had Gen. 18. where the Angel tells him, <hi>That in him all the nations of the earth shall be blessed,</hi> namely, by Christ who was of his seed. Nor did <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he was by the River <note n="*" place="margin">Dan. 8.16.</note> 
                  <hi>Ulai,</hi> talk with his own shadow, as the truth of the Event proves, but with an Angel; As also <hi>Gabriel</hi> was, who imparted to him the Prophecie of <hi>the Seventy weeks,</hi> then which nothing can be more accurately answering to the Event. To which you may add those Angels that appeared to him on the banks of the River <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Hiddekel,</hi> the Event of whose predictions are partly come to pass and partly now fulfilling under <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 12.7.</note>
                  <hi>the Time and Times and half a Time,</hi> which also are almost expired, and are the Period of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55305:116"/>
the latter times pointed at by those <note n="*" place="margin">Verse 11, 12.</note> numbers, 1290 daies and 1335 daies mentioned by the Angel on the banks of the river <hi>Hiddekel,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has I think very solidly interpreted. Which general intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prophecies are more particularly and more fully set out in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> of S. <hi>Iohn</hi>: who also plainly professeth himself to have had conference with <hi>Angels</hi>; and his <hi>Visions</hi> suting the <hi>Events</hi> so punctually, it is a demonstration of both <hi>the continued Providence of God over his Church,</hi> and of <hi>the Existence of</hi> those <hi>Angelical Beings.</hi> Which is the First great Fruit and Use of this Book of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> that he that reads and rightly observes the exact applicableness of the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> to the <hi>Event,</hi> cannot doubt of the <hi>Existence of God and of his Holy Angels,</hi> nor of his <hi>Special Providence</hi> over the Church.</p>
               <p>I might add also, nor <hi>of the Souls Immortality</hi>; Christ appearing so plainly to <hi>Iohn,</hi> and speaking to him in these words, <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 1.18.</note> 
                  <hi>I am he that liveth, and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore, Amen: and have the Keys of hell and death,</hi> that is, of raising men at the last day, &amp;c. To which you may add the Description of the General Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, chap. 20. Which things being uttered by a Prophet whose <hi>Visions</hi> hitherto so punctually answer the known <hi>Events</hi> of things, cannot but be an unexceptionable Demonstration of the <hi>Resurrection of Christ</hi> and of <hi>our own Immortality:</hi> And indeed of the whole <hi>Truth of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and especially of those two highest points thereof, <hi>the Divinity of Christ</hi> and <hi>the Triunity of the Godhead.</hi> For it being so generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the Church of God, That the Gospel and the Epistles of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and this Book of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> have all one Author, as indeed the very matter and style of them do further argue, (the Phrases and matter coming nearest the notions of the ancient <hi>Cabbala</hi> of the Jews, as in particular, his using of the term <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in them all concerning Christ;) it cannot but be a great satisfaction that a person so highly honoured with the gift of Divine Revelation is so express an assertor of that holy Mysterie, as he is surely in the beginning of his Gospel. Which therefore even they are also to believe with reverence that are not able to fit themselves with any easie conception thereof; it being not at all unreasonable that one so highly inspired as S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> should have something communicated to him that passes the understanding of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary capacities: So that <hi>Pride</hi> here must be the mother of <hi>Unbelief.</hi> And this is the first and main general Use that may be made of this emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently-Divine Book of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> and has reached I must confess further then the order of things requireth at this time: But I cannot but prefer the <hi>Usefulness</hi> of my Discourse before the elegancy and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of my proposed Method.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But then secondly, There is also another excellent Use thereof even against those whom either the pretence to or affectation of such kind of Knowledge has made either to appear or really to be very mad and extravagant. For I think it not improbable that some men may be content to appear this way minded upon design and for advantage. Which <hi>political abuse</hi> of the holy Oracles of God is in my apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one of the worst and the most execrable kinds of <hi>Sacrilege</hi> that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55305:116"/>
is. But by being well skilled in the meaning of the <hi>Visions</hi> of this Book, we shall be the more able to defeat the evil purposes of such <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> and <hi>Impostours,</hi> who being wholy ignorant of the affairs of the Kingdom of Christ, will yet pretend to be the great Instaurators of his Empire, and the beginners of the blessed <hi>Millennium,</hi> and of the Reign of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Whose fraud and villanie is easily discoverable from the solidly-framed <hi>Synchronisms</hi> of Mr. <hi>Mede.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I speak chiefly in reference to that great Prophet of the <hi>Familists,</hi> whom I have so often named, whose imposture is easily confutable out of the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> For the Church having continued for some Ages <hi>Symmetral,</hi> that is, <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 11.1.</note> commensurable to the Reed of the Angel (which Ages were before the Apostasie of the Church;) it is evident that the <hi>Faith and Practice</hi> of the Church <hi>Catholick</hi> then is allowable and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable by the rule of God, and therefore not to be reproved by men, nor to be reformed any further then into that Primitive state, when they held the Creed in the plain literal sense thereof without any shuffling Allegories, as also the distinction of <hi>Laity</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> and met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in places set apart for publick Worship. Which is an undeniable testimonie out of this so divinely-inspired Prophet S. <hi>Iohn</hi> against all those that would lay aside the Person of Christ, and deny his <hi>Divinity,</hi> with the <hi>Triunity of the Godhead,</hi> antiquate his <hi>Mediatorship,</hi> make no distinction betwixt <hi>Laity</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> would pull down <hi>Churches,</hi> with the like wild fanatical professions and intentions. Which certainly would have been accounted abominable in those Ages that the Church was <hi>Symmetral,</hi> which lasted till about four hundred years from the Birth of Christ; as appears out of that ingenious inference of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> from the proportion of the <hi>outward Court</hi> of the Temple to the <hi>inward,</hi> which according to <hi>Villalpandus</hi> is as 7 to 2, and therefore 1260 daies of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie</hi> implies 360 daies of the <hi>Purity</hi> of the Church foregoing this <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie,</hi> which added to the years from the Birth of Christ to his Suffering make up 400 years or thereabouts. Or else, if you reckon from these very times (wherein this period of <hi>Apostasie</hi> should be near its expirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) backward, and take 1260 from 1660, there will remain 400 years again: Till which time the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church is out of the <hi>Visions</hi> of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> assured to us as approvable before God. Which I look upon as a fit Engine to beat back the fury of such Reformers as those <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> are I mentioned, and a demonstration that for all their heat and canting they are but <hi>Demoniacks,</hi> and no divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-inspired men.</p>
               <p>But as in the times that the <hi>Messias</hi> was personally to come into the world many <hi>Impostours</hi> instigated by the Devil stood up to deceive the people of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and brought them into much misery and mischief; so now the times being at hand that Christ is to appear in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>dead Witnesses</hi> are to <hi>rise up</hi> and <hi>rule,</hi> many <hi>false Dispensations</hi> will crowd in with fury, boldness and tumult, and pretend to be the <hi>true Dispensation.</hi> Which will not be prevented by slurring the main Scope of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> and pretending that all the matters there are meant either of the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> or else of <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, (this
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:55305:117"/>
is but like the sprinkling a little water upon too violent a fire, which will but make it rage the more;) but by applying our minds more through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to understand the meaning of these <hi>Divine Visions,</hi> that we may be the more able thereby to steer the zeal of men off from doing so much hurt as they may be instigated to doe; that the wheat be not burnt up with the cockle, but that what is pure and <hi>Apostolical</hi> may be preserved.</p>
               <p>And so also in <hi>Secular</hi> affairs: Whereas the very Power of the <hi>Civil</hi> Magistrate and his security is hazarded by wild and hot-spirited men, that would raise a <hi>Fifth Monarchie</hi> by Bloud and Rapine, and tumble down all Government, according as either their own <hi>Enthusiastick</hi> heat shall instigate, or opportunity invite or give leave; pretending that all Authority, all Orders and Degrees in this <hi>Fourth Monarchie</hi> are unholy and prophane, and that <hi>they</hi> are the Pioners to level all plain, and break all Government in pieces, that <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Fifth Monarch,</hi> may perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally come and begin his <hi>Millennial</hi> Empire upon Earth; it behoves the Christian Rulers, whether <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> or <hi>Civil,</hi> to be so well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the meaning of these <hi>Prophecies,</hi> that they may be able to stop the mouths of these loud <hi>Fanaticks</hi> by those holy Oracles they pervert thus and abuse, and to shew them that there is no proof at all of such things as they thus vainly imagine: as assuredly there is not, as I have already shewn in my interpretation of the fourth and fifth verses of the Twentieth chapter; and that it was both the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Apostles, and <hi>Practice</hi> of the Church, while it was <hi>Symmetral,</hi> to <hi>obey the Magistrate</hi> and <hi>live peaceably under him,</hi> though he were an <hi>Heathen:</hi> how much more then are they to <hi>obey</hi> them that are <hi>Christians?</hi> That <hi>Superiour</hi> and <hi>Inferiour</hi> are as natural in a people as <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Feet</hi> in an humane body; and that therefore no man can decry Government but out of madness or some villainous design to enthrall others at last under the yoke of their own lawless Fury. That there are Kings and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours under the renewed state of things in the <hi>Millennium,</hi> as appears Revel. 21. v. 24. and that no frame of Government can be evil, where Governours rule by a good law. And lastly, That to make any thing <hi>essentially evil or good</hi> that is <hi>in it self indifferent</hi> and left so by <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> is a <hi>fundamental</hi> Transgression against the Law of the New <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> whose Foundation and Structure is all upon <hi>Twelve.</hi> But instead of convincing them by what is <hi>true,</hi> to endeavour to stop their fury by imposing upon them by <hi>false</hi> Glosses, is the next way to imbolden them the more, and make them contemn the authority of them that should guide them and instruct them. For the prefiguration of the <hi>Apostasie</hi> of the Church, and her <hi>Recovery</hi> out of it (which may be done, at least without changing any <hi>Temporal</hi> Powers and Superiorities) is a thing so plain, that it cannot be hid.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A third Use of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> is the Answering a very crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Objection both from the <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Atheist.</hi> For seeing things have been so ill for so many Ages of the Church together, that the World has grown <hi>Pagan</hi> again after a manner, and that the <hi>Turk</hi> has also swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed so great a part of the Church; surely there is no true <hi>Religion</hi> at all, nor <hi>Providence,</hi> will the <hi>Atheist</hi> say; and the <hi>Iew,</hi> at least that
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:55305:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their <hi>Messiah</hi> is not yet come, <hi>Idolatry</hi> having in a manner filled all the Nations that profess him. But to both we may answer, That nothing has hapned in all this but what was foreseen by God, and predicted plainly in these <hi>Visions</hi> of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi>; to say nothing of what <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> had more generally adumbrated before. Which therefore is rather an Argument for <hi>Providence</hi> then against it, and a demonstration of the <hi>Messiah</hi>'s faithfull vigilancie over his Church, rather then of his not yet having gathered one in the world. For it is plain that Christ is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of those holy Visions, and that the great Plagues that have fallen upon the Church, either by the <hi>Turk</hi> or others, have been by reason of their Apostasie from the Purity of the Apostolick Faith and Practice.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A fourth Use, and that an eminent one, of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> is, to be as a clear Mirrour of both the <hi>Apostasie</hi> of the Church and of the Way of her <hi>Recovery.</hi> The <hi>Apostasie</hi> of the Church is intimated more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in the <hi>number of the Name of the Beast,</hi> whose Root being 25, as the Root of the Number of the <hi>Apostolick</hi> Church 12, intimates that their <hi>Apostasie</hi> consists, in the general, of adding to the Root and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Christian Religion supernumerary Articles of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and coining, being not contented with the <hi>Essentials</hi> or <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals</hi> of Faith, which were clearly and plainly delivered by the twelve Apostles, and are easily without any dispute and contest understood to be in the holy Scriptures. I intimated also before from the Root of 666, being 25, resolvable also into 5 again, That their <hi>Apostatical</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was framed chiefly to gratifie and entertain the external <hi>Senses,</hi> that it began there and ended there, and let the Diviner and more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly motions of the Mind lie asleep. But yet more particularly this <hi>Apostasie</hi> is indigitated by the Square 666; as if the poison of the sixth Head of the Beast, that <hi>red bloudy Dragon,</hi> that is, cruel <hi>Persecution</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> were spred through the body of the <hi>Apostatized</hi> Church: Whose chief part the <hi>Two-horned</hi> Beast must needs be,<note place="margin">Revel. 13.</note> who made the whole <hi>Romane</hi> Empire very lively resemble the Beast, whose deadly wound he healed, that is, the <hi>ancient Pagan Power.</hi> But enough of this, it being a Theam that will be over-eagerly listned to by some, and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, without any consideration and reason, rejected by others.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But this <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Glass is not only for the <hi>Romanist</hi> but all the Churches of Christendome to look their faces in, and to consider how much they are still engaged, or how far emerged out of this <hi>Lapse and Apostasie,</hi> or whether they be quite emerged out of it or no. For I must confess I do much scruple the matter, and that upon account of the 1260 daies, wherein the <hi>Woman is in the Wilderness,</hi> and the <hi>Witnesses mourn in sackcloth.</hi> Concerning the <hi>Epocha</hi> of which daies the very highest Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> pitches upon is 365, namely, from the death of <hi>Iulian,</hi> which will end the 1260 daies, Anno 1625. But many years before this were there the same different Churches that there are now. Wherefore it is a sign that <hi>the Woman was not then, nor yet is, out of the Wilderness</hi>; but that the <hi>true Church</hi> is <hi>still hid</hi> in these <hi>divisions of Churches,</hi> and that all hitherto for the outward face of things is but a wilde <hi>Desart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover those <hi>Divisions of Churches</hi> which were made about an
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:55305:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hundred years ago, and which immediately became the Churches of this or that Polity; if those Alterations then had been into a way <hi>purely Apostolical,</hi> it had been plainly the <hi>enlivening of the Witnesses,</hi> and the <hi>calling of them into Heaven,</hi> many years before the expiration of the 1260 days. Which is a strong presumption all is not yet right, and that <hi>the Witnesses are not yet alive,</hi> nor <hi>the Woman yet out of the Wilderness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Wherefore out of a due humility and modesty suspecting our selves not to have emerged quite out of this <hi>General Apostasy</hi> of the Church, into which the Spirit of God has foretold she would be lapsed for 1260 years; let us see if we can find out what <hi>Remainders</hi> of this <hi>Lapse</hi> are still upon us. Which I suppose we shall be the more ready to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by how much more they shall be found to symbolize with that Church whom we justly judge to be so manifest an Apostate. Now I demand, Is not one <hi>Fundamental miscarriage</hi> in that Church, <hi>That they make things Fundamental that are not, and mingle their own humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions with the infallible Oracles of God, and imperiously obtrude them upon the people?</hi> We are very sensible our selves of this in Ceremonies. And are not <hi>uncertain</hi> and <hi>useless Opinions</hi> as arrant a ceremony as Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies themselves, which we so kick against and fly away from, like wild horses? Nay I may adde also, That it will be hard to wash our hands clean from that other badge of the Beast, <hi>Unchristian Persecution in points of Religion,</hi> and that for differences where Christ himself has made none, but our selves onely imagine them.</p>
               <p>Again, as for <hi>Idolatry,</hi> another known Character of the Beast, cannot we find that also amongst our selves? I do not mean <hi>Covetousness</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which the Apostle cals <hi>Idolatry,</hi> but the adventuring to erect <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,</hi> if not <hi>Images,</hi> of God, some more horrid and affrightful then those that stand in the most polluted Temples of the Pagans, (the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Saturn</hi> tearing his own children a pieces with his teeth and eating of them, is but an <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> in comparison thereof;) while in the mean time <hi>the mournful Witnesses</hi> testifie both out of <hi>Moses</hi> and out of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> That the nature of God is quite another thing. <hi>God is Love, and he that abideth in Love abideth in God, and God in him. The Lord, the Lord God, gracious and merciful, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.</hi> And yet what forcible assaults are there to set up <hi>this Idol</hi> or <hi>false Image</hi> in the <hi>Temple</hi> of every mans Minde, which otherwise should be consecrated to the <hi>Love</hi> of God and the warm and comfortable residence of his Holy Spirit? That also is a blind <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> of God, worse then the Pagan <hi>Cupid,</hi> which some conceited Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings set up in favour of themselves, <hi>That God sees no sin in his Elect,</hi> let them sin never so grosly; whenas the Scripture expresly affirms, <hi>That his eyes behold, his eye-lids try the Children of men,</hi> and <hi>That he is of purer eyes then to endure iniquity any where.</hi> To say nothing that <hi>Opinions themselves</hi> that are framed by humane curiosity in points of Religion, though otherwise harmless, become <hi>Idols,</hi> and have the very same effect that <hi>Idols</hi> have, that is, <hi>They lay asleep the Minde, and besot it so, that it becomes senseless of the indispensable motions of the Divine life.</hi> And further, That the tricking up our selves with such curiosities is
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:55305:118"/>
but <hi>a self-chosen holiness,</hi> and a worshipping and serving God after our own humour, which assuredly is little better then <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. And lastly more compendiously and at once, Let us consider the nature of <hi>the Witnesses slain by the Beast of the bottomless pit.</hi> Which is a childish thing to conceit to be <hi>Two persons,</hi> forasmuch as they prophesy for 1260 years together, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has well defined; and I also adde, that they are dead in another sense even that time they are said to prophesy, as I have <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 15. Sect. 4.</note> above noted, and I think there is very little doubt to be made of the Interpretation. Let us therefore now consider what these <hi>Two Witnesses</hi> are. And truely according to the richness of Prophetick expression I do not think they are restrained to one single signification, but type out at least these two things, <hi>The Old and New Testament,</hi> which by a <hi>Prosopopoeia</hi> are here called the <hi>Two Witnesses</hi>; or else <hi>The Magistracy and Ministery,</hi> forasmuch as those things they are described by are allusions to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and to <hi>Zerobabel</hi> and <hi>Ieshua.</hi> The Concinnity of the former interpretation does not depend onely on that obvious allusion to that Latine word <hi>Testament,</hi> but is further ratified from the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> frequently signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Laws</hi> or Institutes of God, rendred also for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Not to adde, that the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament</hi> are, whether they were called so or no, Two eximious Witnesses of the Mind of God unto the World.</p>
               <p>Wherefore now, <hi>more Prophetico,</hi> making these Two Books Two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, they may be said to be <hi>alive,</hi> or <hi>slain,</hi> either in a <hi>Political,</hi> or <hi>Moral</hi> sense. They would be <hi>alive</hi> in a <hi>Political</hi> sense, if they had the only rule in the transactions of the affairs of Church and Commonwealth: that there should be no injunctions as indispensable in matters of Religion, but such as they plainly determine, much less any thing against them. And so likewise in State-affairs all Oppression and Tyranny would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited. Wherefore while the Inventions of men rule in the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of the Dictates of those holy Oracles, and while course Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Tyranny over the members of Christ is prevalent, that is, while men think they have power and wealth and wit and policy, merely to tread down the people, and not to succour them and guide them for their real good, and to ennoble their spirits as much as they are capable, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to make them besotted vassals and slaves, to put out their eyes, to make mill-horses of them, that they may the better droile and drudge for the satisfaction of their lusts; whereever things are carried on this way, <hi>the Beast of the bottomless Pit has slain the Two Witnesses</hi> in the <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> sense, the Law of God in the mean time protesting against their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, both in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament,</hi> as is plain to every one that peruses those Writings.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Witnesses</hi> also would be alive in a <hi>Moral</hi> sense, if those <hi>indispensable Precepts of life</hi> witnessed by them were <hi>really turned into life and practice</hi> in us. For the <hi>External Word</hi> is but <hi>a dead letter,</hi> but then is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>alive,</hi> when that life is begotten in us whereof it testifies. Which if it be neglected; as also their Rule, so farre forth as it respects Ecclesiastick Policy, be declined, and men act, both in Political affairs
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55305:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and in their private capacities, according to the Rules of men and their unprofitable Institutes, and thereby neglect the <hi>indispensable Commands</hi> of God; who cannot but see that the <hi>Two Witnesses</hi> we speak of are plainly <hi>slain,</hi> and that the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament</hi> are but as <hi>two liveless carkasses,</hi> lying unburied indeed, (for they will not burn them, and put their ashes into an urne, and hide them under ground, for fear of the people) but <hi>useless</hi> and <hi>unactive,</hi> having no power to curb the wicked enormities of the world, who have taken up another self-chosen Law to themselves, minted and forged by the false Antichristian Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent enough with, nay very favourable to, all those pomps and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that we are sworn against in our very Baptisme? Whence it is said that the Inhabitants of the World are so <hi>glad</hi> and triumphant and <hi>send gifts to one another</hi> upon the slaying of the Witnesses,<note place="margin">Revel. 11.10.</note> their death con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing so much to the uncurbed fruition of all worldly and carnal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but the Church in the mean time becoming no better then <note n="*" place="margin">Vers. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> a land of Tyranny and Beastliness, a City of Carnality and Oppression.</p>
               <p>Wherein (to proceed to the other sense) <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Zero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel</hi> and <hi>Ieshua,</hi> the holy and legitimate <hi>Magistracy</hi> and <hi>Ministery</hi> are <hi>slain,</hi> that is, <hi>kept out of all Political power</hi> by this Beast out of the bottomless pit, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Which as it may signifie the <hi>Sea,</hi> may be understood of the <hi>Ten-horned Beast</hi>; but as it may signifie a <hi>deep pit</hi> in the earth, such as that from whence Smoke came and the Locusts, may signifie the <hi>Two-horned Beast,</hi> who is said to <hi>come out of the</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 13.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Earth,</hi> and is the Master of that Wisdom that is <hi>earthly, sensual and devilish,</hi> and which is accompanied with bloudy zeal and strife about their vain and useless Opinions and Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>This, I believe, we will be prone enough to acknowledge against o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, namely in those dominions wherein Popery has so great a stroke: but it is more to our advantage to examine also what is amiss at home. For it does not follow, because <hi>the Number of the Beast</hi> is not upon us, that we do not <hi>Bestianize</hi>; nor is it the purple spots, but the disease, that is mortiferous. But the case is as if a man not yet knowing <hi>Sheep</hi> from <hi>Goats,</hi> should be told that those in such a pasture that had such a Mark or figure upon them, were <hi>Goats:</hi> It were a fond thing for him to think that this mark or figure were so of the essence of a <hi>Goat,</hi> but that, when in another place he met with a creature so shaped, of the like big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and with such a cry as a <hi>Goat</hi> has, he might take the boldness to pronounce that that was a <hi>Goat</hi> too, though the abovesaid Marks were wanting. Wherefore let us impartially consider whether we be yet pure <hi>Sheep</hi> or no.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Witnesses</hi> be <hi>dead</hi> in both a <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Political</hi> sense amongst us, that is, if we follow the name or authority of any man, and be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led more by that then the plain Scriptures; if we are not content with such a <hi>Faith</hi> as is plain out of them, and was the <hi>Faith of the Church when it was Symmetral</hi>; if by fulsome and course <hi>Antinomianisme,</hi> by the doctrine of the <hi>Needlesness</hi> or <hi>Impossibility</hi> of <hi>being good</hi> and of living according to the Precepts of Christ, we hinder the <hi>Scripture</hi> from <hi>being
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:55305:119"/>
alive</hi> in us, and by mingling conceits of our own and imperiously impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of them upon others hazard with some the belief of the whole, and keep others out of such place and authority as naturally falls to their share, though never so cordial and exemplary Christians according to the old <hi>Symmetral</hi> pattern; we, having thus transgressed that holy, ancient and <hi>Apostolick</hi> Number (12) by our new-fangled additions, and adding also <hi>Persecution</hi> thereto, do as certainly become or continue part of <hi>the Beast,</hi> as the <hi>Goat</hi> is <hi>a Goat</hi> without the above-said mark and figure upon him.</p>
               <p>Nor shall we ever be quit from the crime of <hi>slaying the Witnesses,</hi> till we lay aside all heat and pride in preferring our own Opinions, whereby we do but make void the weighty Precepts of Life, and make the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God of none effect by our Traditions; engaging the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the people in things that are unprofitable, and inuring them to lie cool to the indispensable Law of Christ. Which is <hi>truely to slay the Witnesses, and to let them lie stark dead in the streets.</hi> And while those that govern, govern for themselves, and love to feel their own power, and forget that the very Rule of their Government is the comfort and ennoblement of the spirits of the people, (that they may be free and knowing, faithful <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi>) and that whatever any one has, it is given him for the good of another, and not for the satisfaction of his own vain lusts: while such miscarriages as these are in either <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi> or <hi>Magistracy,</hi> Supreme or Subordinate, in what measure these are, in that measure is <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Zerobabel</hi> and <hi>Ieshua,</hi> the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and the <hi>New Testament slain and cast out dead into the streets</hi>; and all Power, (let it change into what frame it will) but the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Leviathan</hi> in the waters of the Sea, making the deep boil before him, and leaving an hoary tract of froth after him, boasting himself in his Power and Title, that he is <hi>the Prince of the children of Pride.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Wherefore that <hi>Millennial Happiness</hi> that some men talk so loud of, is not in demolishing of all Ranks and Orders of Superiority in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> which things are natural and necessary; but in the right administration of affairs in both, by those Orders of men. Who if they would reform all things according to the <hi>Apostolick</hi> Rule, and insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute such a Discipline as would countenance the <hi>indispensable life of God,</hi> not the <hi>unprofitable humors</hi> of rash and fallible men; and every one in their rank would pay their duties of support and succour to the people, that every man that is honest and vertuous might live according to his quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in a Christian comfortable way; the Tributes of Honours and Titles to such Orders of men are but their just due, and become as well usefull as ornamentall to the world. It is therefore but a <hi>Fanatick</hi> or <hi>Satanick</hi> fury in such that under pretence of ushering in <hi>the Fifth Monarchy,</hi> as they call it, would destroy <hi>all Orders</hi> and <hi>Ranks</hi> in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> as if <hi>the Wrath of man could work the Righteousness of God:</hi> when neither these Orders themselves have any unholiness in them, nor the Persons haply in possession are less Saints then they that would pull them down. For if the enriching a man's self by the destruction of others entitle a
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:55305:120"/>
man to Saintship, the greatest Robbers are in the readiest way to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Holy of Holies.</hi> But such <hi>Zelots</hi> as these, what miserable Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers they are like to prove, is too sadly prefigured by that <hi>Iewish</hi> facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> more intolerable by far to the Inhabitants then the Enemy that besieged them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the gaping after a <hi>Fifth Monarchy</hi> in this sense, can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but the thirsting after spoil and bloud, many men being sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated thereto by the secret sting of the old Serpent in Envy to the Church of Christ, hoping to root out the Gospel by destroying of setled Authority and by starving the Ministery, and so to bring in a rabble of Fanatical Superstitions or Atheistical Prophanenesses. The most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain prevention whereof, in my judgment, is the Reduction of the Church, by those that are in Authority, to such a frame as is purely Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical. For then the constitution of things will be so sacred and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable, that it will awe and keep off the Villainy and Boldness of such men that are otherwise encouraged by the conspicuous intermixture of things false, Idolatrous and impious, to flie against all at once, and to rend all into pieces. Besides that they row with the stream, and the tide of Divine vengeance will carry them along; which will ever and anon flow in upon the Church, till a true and sincere Reformation. For there is no <hi>Stability</hi> to be expected till that City be raised, whose not only Foundation is laid in <hi>Twelve,</hi> but whose Gates, Tribes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the breadth and height of the wall, and the solid Content of the whole City, are nothing else but the Replication still of <hi>Twelve</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, that is to say, <hi>till that Church appear that is purely Apostolical in Life and Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Which times being so very near at hand, as appears by compute of Prophecie, it should be a great encouragement for every one to look thither-ward, and to shake off that Dulness and Lethargicalness that has possess'd the world so long, as if it would never be better. For this <hi>Article of Infidelity</hi> among the rest keeps the <hi>Witnesses still dead</hi> in all the senses above-named. Wherefore let every man reform himself, and exhort and encourage his neighbour, and witness the good witness of the power of God to the conquering and subduing of all manner of Sin. <hi>For these times come not on by Rapine and Violence, but by the increase of Righteousness upon Earth.</hi> For the real and speedy advancement whereof there is nothing more effectual then the belief That God will now, in these last times of all, give more then ordinary assistance to them that will be faithfull in his Covenant, and that the work of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness will goe on with much more ease then heretofore and with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely better success.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is good striking while the Iron is hot, and making use of this Day of Salvation, lest such Prophecies of grace being condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, it may fare with us as it did with the <hi>Israelites</hi> whose carkasses fell in the wilderness, in a tedious delay and a long leading them about, who otherwise had in their own persons entred the promised Land. So I do not see that it is impossible or improbable but this Prophecie of the Churches change into so excellent a state may be foreslacked by the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:55305:120"/>
ill management and faithlesness of them from whom God more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly expects that they should be industrious Labourers in this white Harvest of Apostolick Purity and Sanctity; they having now for some time separated from the great <hi>Babylon</hi> to build those that are lesser and more tolerable, but yet not to be tolerated for ever; it being more then high time they should clear up into an <hi>holy City of God.</hi> Otherwise I do not see but the success is likely to answer the endeavours of them that are chiefly concerned. And the variety of numbring the period of time by <hi>Daies, Months and Semi-Times,</hi> seems to threaten some such matter. And therefore according to that laxer computation by <hi>Months</hi> and <hi>Semi-Times</hi> there may lie hid a reserve of delay for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nay an hundred or two hundred years longer then God otherwise intended to commence this glorious Dispensation. But the certainty of the <hi>Events</hi> of other Prophecies that precede in order, if this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise be not <hi>conditional</hi> to both Jew and Christian, is a Demonstration that it will not fail to take effect.</p>
               <p>This is the faithfullest Account that I can give of the affairs of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome from the pouring out of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles, till Christ's coming again in the Spirit to renew his lapsed Church into true Holiness and Righteousness <hi>in the rising of the Witnesses and the reigning of the Saints upon Earth a thousand years.</hi> The close of which will be <hi>The Day of Iudgment</hi> properly so called, which, after this long but not impertinent Digression, if it be a Digression, we shall now take into consideration.</p>

               <p n="1">1. IN the Return of Christ to Judgment these Three things are to be considered as very nearly annected and comprehended in it; The <hi>Visibility of his Person and pomp of his coming,</hi> The <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Dead,</hi> and <hi>Conflagration of the World.</hi> But because all these things are doubted by some that do not profess themselves <hi>Anti-Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists,</hi> I shall first produce such places of Scripture as do plainly assert these Points, and then in the next place shew how <hi>Reasonable</hi> the Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Visible or personal Return of Christ to Iudgment,</hi> though it may be proved from many places, yet I shall content my self with a few. And I must confess I look upon the 24 of <hi>Matth.</hi> from the 30 to the 32 verse, (where the Son of Man is said <hi>to come in the clouds of Heaven with power and great glory,</hi> and <hi>to send out his Angels with a mighty sound of a Trumpet</hi>) to be a pregnant Testimony thereof. But the 29 verse to be a description of the state of the World, especially of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, till the appearance of <hi>the sign of the Son of Man.</hi> But whether this <hi>sign of the Son of Man</hi> be the same with the Son of Man coming in the clouds, or some sign in the Heavens to be given long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his coming, for the Conversion of the Jews, I take not upon me to decide. But from the 32 to the 36 verse, I think there our Saviour may reassume his first Subject, the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; and therefore being within the view of the Temple and of the City, he uses the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noun <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>these things,</hi> in his prophecie of them. But in the 36 verse, pursuing his prediction of the end of the World, he saies, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>but concerning</hi> THAT <hi>day:</hi> and so he gives wholesome
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:55305:121"/>
precepts of watchfulness to his Church, to the end of this Chapter. Which sense is very agreeable to the following Chapter, which most easily and naturally is wholy to be understood of the last Judgment. But from the 31 verse of that Chapter to the end, even they that would wind the former part of the Chapter to another sense,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.31.</note> acknowledg it to be understood of the last Day. And there the Visible Pomp of Christ coming to judge the World is plainly set down, viz. his <hi>sitting upon a throne with his holy Angels about him.</hi> To these you may add the <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 1. v. 11.</note> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of the two men clothed in white shining raiments, that told the Disciples as they were gazing up into Heaven after Christ, as he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, that he should come down again in the same manner as they had seen him goe into Heaven: As also that of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Thess. 4.16, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>For the Lord himself shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain, shall be caught up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the Air, and so shall we be ever with the Lord.</hi> These places are so plain concerning the <hi>Visible Appearance</hi> of Christ's Person in his coming to Judgment, that no tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Allegorie can elude them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there will be a <hi>Resurrection of the dead</hi> (in a <hi>natural</hi> not a <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> sense) at the same time, is as evident from the very last words I ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For who but a mad-man will interpret <hi>the meeting of Christ in the air</hi> in a <hi>moral</hi> sense? If it had been written [<hi>in the Heavens,</hi>] they would have shuffled it off, and said, in the <hi>Heavenly being</hi> or <hi>Heavenly nature</hi> mystically understood. But will they have the impudence not to acknowledg the aieriness and phantastry of their Mysteries of Increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when they must according to the same analogy be driven to say that we shall at the Resurrection meet Christ in the <hi>Aiery Being</hi> mystically understood? But it is as false a gloss to interpret the doctrine of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection 1 Cor. 15. so as to exclude the Natural and Physical sense of it, it being plain that such a <hi>Death</hi> and such a <hi>Resurrection</hi> is spoken of concerning us, as is argued from the <hi>Death</hi> and the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of Christ, who is said to die <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>for our sins</hi>; which is impossible to be interpreted mystically. Read from the first to the eleventh verse, it is a plain History. From whence the Apostle inferres that there is a blessed Resurrection or glorious Immortality in Body and Soul which Christ will bestow on all true believers at the last day: As himself has promised over and over again in the sixth of S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Gospel, [<hi>and I will raise him up at the last day.</hi>] Many other places there are to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in Scripture which I willingly omit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The third and last is the <hi>Conflagration of the World,</hi> of which I hold that of S. <hi>Peter</hi> an undeniable Testimonie;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.10.</note> 
                  <hi>But the Day of the Lord shall come as a thief in the night; in which the Heavens shall pass away with a noise, and the Elements shall melt with fervent heat, the Earth also and the works therein shall be burnt up.</hi> The explication of which Prophecie Mr. <hi>Ios. Mede</hi> has set down with a great deal of caution and judgment. To which I should wholy subscribe, did I not believe that this execution of Fire were the very last visible judgment God would doe upon the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55305:122"/>
Rebellious generations of <hi>Adam,</hi> leaving them then to tumble with the Devils in unsupportable torment and confusion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And therefore I would expound <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> verse 13. <hi>But yet Notwithstanding,</hi> or <hi>Nevertheless,</hi> before this Conflagration of the Earth <hi>we expect a new Heaven and a new Earth,</hi> in a <hi>Political</hi> sense, <hi>in which Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness shall dwell.</hi> Nor does that phrase verse 12. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>looking for &amp; hastning the coming of the Day of God</hi> warrant any one to restrain this Prophecie to a Moral meaning, as if it were only high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions signifying something in our own power and to be done by us. For <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may be either an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and denote no more then <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>with great earnestness and diligence to expect</hi>; or if so be you take them for two several things, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> must signifie <hi>hastning,</hi> that sense is also consistent enough with our Interpretation. For being the Day of the Lord is a day of great Joy and ample Remunerations to the Godly, as well as of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to the Wicked, (and suppose it also comes not till Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness has had its reign upon Earth) we may well be exhorted by our prayers and conversations to hasten and accelerate as much as in us lies the coming of either.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But that by no such mystical Interpretation as this the Earth can be excused from being burnt by a visible and palpable Fire, is clear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all exception from the 5, 6 and 7 verses of this Chapter. Where the Apostle alledges against that usual Refuge and Security of Atheists, to wit, <hi>The sameness and immutableness of the Law of Nature and the order or course of things, that all things are as they were from the beginning, and ever will be so, and that therefore God will never step out in such an extraordinary way to Iudgment</hi>; To this the Apostle op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses that eminent Example of God's Vengance in bringing the Floud upon the old World and drowning the Earth in an immense Deluge of Water: <hi>But the Heavens and the Earth which are now,</hi> saith he, <hi>are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served unto fire against the day of Iudgment and perdition of ungodly men.</hi> Were the Waters in <hi>Noah</hi>'s time <hi>natural,</hi> when God had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie with all flesh, and shall the <hi>Fire</hi> that the world shall be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with be <hi>spiritual?</hi> But light-minded men whose hearts are made dark with Infidelity care not what Antick Distorsions they make in interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Scripture, so they bring it but to any shew of compliance with their own Phansie and Incredulity.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I know there be that would understand by this <hi>burning of Heaven and Earth,</hi> the destruction of the City of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> But the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription is too big by far for so small a Work, and not likely to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of them it was intended as a comfort to, it being so exceedingly well fitted to the <hi>Conflagration of the World,</hi> and so disproportionated to the other Event. Moreover it is manifest from the Scoffer's arguing against the Promise of Christ's coming ver. 4. (<hi>That nature keeps still the same course it did since the beginning</hi>) that this Coming of Christ was not understood by them (and consequently not by S. <hi>Peter</hi>) of the burning of a City by war, (For such things have hapned often, and so they might not think it improbable <hi>Ierusalem</hi> might be burnt in due
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:55305:122"/>
time;) but of that final glorious coming of Christ to judge the World, which Judgment the Conflagration of the Earth is to attend.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And truly if a man will but weigh things without prejudice, he shall find the main matter of these two Epistles to be nothing else but an Exhortation to grow perfect and established in all Christian Vertues from the hope of that excellent Reward that shall be bestowed at the appearing and coming of the Lord Jesus: as you may see in this second Epistle,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.11.</note> the first Chapter, <hi>For so an entrance shall be administred unto you abundantly into the everlasting Kingdome of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.4.</note> Which is parallel to that in his first, where the Promise is <hi>an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away, reserved in the Heavens</hi>; and so on to the thirteenth verse. Which verses doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less no unbiassed judgment will ever understand of a delivery from any Temporal calamity, much less the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> from which place those dispersed Jews were far enough removed, as far as <hi>Pontus, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia, Asia, Galatia, Bithynia.</hi> To say nothing that the so-carefull an Inculcation of that sad Theam of the fatal destruction of the holy City would not so much become the pen of this venerable Apostle, nor the gust of them he wrote to, being Jews by Nation as well as Christians: to neither of which capacities could that fearfull destruction of their City be so comfortable a contemplation, whenas it drew tears from our Saviour's eyes though at a greater distance of time. And his great so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude that they should have these things alwaies in <note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet. 1.12, 13, 14, 15. &amp; Chap. 3.1.</note> remembrance after his death, is a sign that what he insists upon is a matter of more consequence and longer continuance then what respects the Burning of the City.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Furthermore, the Argument whereby he would set on these things upon the Spirits and belief of them he wrote to, that he was an Eye-witness of the glorious Transfiguration of Christ,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.16, 17, 18.</note> when his person ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in that splendour which might become a glorified body, such as himself will appear in at his return to Judgment, makes it still more reasonable that that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that <hi>powerful coming of Christ</hi> there mentioned, is his Final coming in Glory, <hi>when he shall change our vile bodies into the similitude of his glorious bodie according to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his mighty power.</hi> This chief Article therefore of the Christian Faith, in which all Christians are the most highly concerned, was that which the Apostle did press so earnestly and carefully upon them before his departure, which was the chief Prop of their Faith and Patience, and which he affirmed from a special experiment of his own in that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Transfiguration on the Mount, (where <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> talked with Christ, which was a most certain argument of the Soul's Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) to be no cunningly-contrived fiction, but a certain Truth, both from what he saw there before his eyes, and what he heard discoursed at that holy meeting. Where the Passion of Christ was treated of, and the exceeding glorious consequences of it; of which the greatest of all is his last Return to Judgment, when he shall consummate the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of all Believers with everlasting glory, and so restore the Creation to a perfect recovery into what they had fallen from, and punish the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:55305:123"/>
obstinate with eternal Fire. Which things being declared without the circumstance of the series of Time, it was easie for those three Auditors on the Mount to conceive them to be very shortly to come to pass, and therefore to make that Enquiry of <hi>Elias</hi> his coming first, according as their Scribes taught them out of <hi>Malachi</hi>; if simply the Appearance of <hi>Elias</hi> and his going away again, contrary to their expectation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, did not put them upon that question.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But that the glorious Coming or powerfull Presence of Christ, which he so solicitously would ascertain them of, is not his coming to destroy <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> appears further from the nineteenth verse of this Chapter;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.19.</note> where, after he has endeavoured to establish them in the belief of that main Article, from the resplendent Transfiguration of the person of Christ (of which he was an Eye-witness on mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> as also as Ear-witness of that voice from Heaven, <hi>This is my beloved Son,</hi> and of that precious Promise that he was to be the Performer of at the last day; which Transfiguration was a visible pledge of his being invested into that supereminent office of the glorious Judge of the quick and the dead) and had recommended to them also the Prophecies of the Old Testament as a light that shines in the dark to give some direction; yet he insinuates further that they shall have a more clear and firm assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this so concerning a Truth, the day dawning and the day-star arising at length <hi>in their hearts.</hi> Which is very harsh to applie to any thing but to the more clear conviction, by the Spirit of God in their Souls, of the truth of this Promise of an Eternal Reward, of that Crown of a blessed Immortality to be given at Christ's Return to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the last day. These and such like considerations make it seem to me utterly incredible that by this <hi>Fiery Destruction</hi> should be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <hi>the burning of Ierusalem,</hi> and not the <hi>Conflagration of the Earth</hi>; and by the <hi>Appearing</hi> and <hi>Coming of Christ</hi> so often mentioned in these Epistles, his <hi>Vengeance on the Iewes,</hi> and not <hi>his final Return to judge</hi> the whole World: a supposition in my apprehension far more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the weight and gravity of this Apostles style.</p>
               <p>Thus much by the way for the rescuing of these two excellent Epistles to that more natural and more solemn and useful sense they were ever understood in, till of late; though I must confess they have not depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the meaning of the seventh verse of the last Chapter of the second Epistle, it being indeed impossible to interpret it otherwise then of the <hi>burning of the World,</hi> which alone is sufficient for our present purpose.</p>
               <p n="11">11. We might adde several other passages as well in the Prophets as in the Apocalypse and other places, that tend to the same purpose with this of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> for the proving of this final Judgment of God by Fire; as also such places of Scripture elsewhere as implie that there is some notorious Punishment reserved for the Devils, which shall be inflicted upon them at last. For when and upon what occasion can it begin so fitly as at the Conflagration of the World? That there is a certain hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible torment in store for them is plain from Matth. 8.29. <hi>Art thou come to torment us afore the time?</hi> and 2 Pet. 2.4. (as also Ep. of Jude ver. 6.) where the Devils are said to be <hi>reserved in chains of Darkness unto the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:55305:123"/>
Iudgment of the great Day,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That God has confined them to this lower Region of caliginous Air as to a dark Prison till the great Assizes, as some very judiciously expound it. With which places if you compare that last Malediction or severe sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of our Saviour against the wicked, <hi>Goe ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> it will be very easie to infer what this final Punishment is, and when, and how it will begin. But we need not insist upon these things, we having sufficiently proved the point already.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. IT remains now that we shew, That these Three main Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Christ's coming to Judgment (which we have proved to be contained in the Mystery of our Religion) are in themselves <hi>congruous and reasonable.</hi> Which we shall first make good concerning <hi>the Visible Pomp and glorious Appearance of the person of Christ in the Air,</hi> attended by his holy Angels, he descending as it were with the noise of Battel and Alarm of War, an Archangel sounding a Trumpet before him as the Heavenly Camp marches on and moves. For he will certainly appear in an Equipage most terrible and glorious, and in this solemn and dreadful Order he will face the bold, prophane and Atheistical World, <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 2. chap. 5. sect. 3. and ch. 6. sect. 1.</note> who by no other means would be convinced of either a Providence or a Deity, but with supercilious looks and scornfull speeches have contemned all the hopes of future Reward, and laught at the Religious for weak-brain'd Fools or Mad-men. But then shall the hearts of the faithfull be filled with joy, they seeing so comfortable an Appearance of him whom their Soul longed for; who will reward all their Injuries, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and Reproaches with condign Honour and Happiness. Nay I may say that Christ will then vindicate himself from all those scorns and revilements that bold and prophane Wretches out of their Sensuality and High-mindedness have cast upon him from Age to Age, pleasing themselves and gratifying other <hi>Epicurean</hi> Brutes of like impiety with themselves with their ungodly jears and scoffs against him who was the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55305:124"/>
highest Example of Divine Perfection that ever appeared in the World. Nay I adde further, That there is in a manner a <hi>Necessity</hi> of this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Return of Christ thus in glory to judge the World according to his promise, that these Blasphemers may not be encouraged to reckon him with such Impostours as <hi>David George</hi> and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who though they prefixed a shorter time to their followers, shall not again be heard of till they appear before his Tribunal of whom we speak.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as for those that do believe that the Person of Christ does still subsist, that he was so miraculously born, so gloriously transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the Mount, so wonderfully raised up from the dead, and did so conspicuously ascend into Heaven,<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 1. v. 10.</note> two Angels in bright garments affirming to them that beheld him, that he would thus return again, viz. in a <hi>personal Visibility</hi>; what stranger thing is it that he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, then that which they acknowledge to be true of him already? And how fit is it that he should still retain this Supremacy over the World, none else having bought it so dearly as himself did by his most bitter Death and Passion? and he that is so compassionate a Mediatour by reason of his Humane nature, will prove the more fit and equal Judge. And that there will be a Period and full pause of the Generations of men upon earth, I have already little less then demonstrated, though it be enough to shew there is no incongruity nor inconvenience in it.<note place="margin">See Book 2. ch. 6. sect. 2.</note> For that is sufficient to stop modest men from either inventing or embracing such evasive Allegories as do elude the Testimony of the Scripture in an Article of so weighty a concernment as this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And as for those that are greater Infidels, and look upon the above-framed description of Christ's coming to Judgement to be exceeding improbable, if not impossible, I say, nothing but the very dulness of Atheisme it self can make them conceit thus. For it being once admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That there are Angels as well as men, this glorious Appearance of Christ with the holy Angels is as easie and natural to admit, as the Martial Pomp of a mighty Army, or the Solemnity of a great Assize. But that there are Spirits or Angels, and that they can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to men in what Region of the Aire they please, History affords innumerable instances. And how much for the miraculousness of it does this pompous Approach of Christ in the clouds differ from those fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and skirmishings of whole Armies in the Aire, of which all Ages al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most and all Historians ring, as well sacred as prophane? The clattering also of Armour and the sound of the Trumpet have been very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard from the Heavens, as <hi>Plinie</hi> and other Historians do report. <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Ovid</hi> record these things with verses sutable to the solemnity of the Prodigies.

So that the Apostles prediction of Christ's coming thus visibly to judge the world, attended with the heavenly Hosts, and the Archangel soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Trumpet before him, is so far from being impossible, that it has in some manner and measure been already in the World, though those asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing Prodigies fall infinitly short of the Glory and Terrour of the Day of Judgement.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Besides, if we may compare small things with great, as certainly we may, the analogy being so conspicuous, what particular judgement and vengeance of note has God done in the World, wherein there has not been a sensible administration of Angels forerunning it? I might make a very copious induction, but I will keep my self within measure. Before sweeping <hi>Plagues</hi> and <hi>Warrs</hi> how frequent are these Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons! <hi>Cardan</hi> makes mention of several of the first kind.<note place="margin">Cardan de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum varietate lib. 14. cap. 69.</note> Before the plague at <hi>Galaratum</hi> there appeared to a young man, as he was riding thither in a rainy Night, a Cart all covered with fire, which, gallop he as fast as he would, was ever over against him: he heard the voice also of Rusticks saying, <hi>Cave, Cave, Take heed, Take heed.</hi> This Spectre attended him till he got to the Temple of St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> which was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the town gate, and there sunk into the ground both Cart, Oxen, Rusticks, and Fire and all.</p>
               <p>The same Author relates also of a stranger prodigie of a Pestilence in <hi>Peru</hi> upon the banks of the river <hi>Consote</hi> near <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Idem lib. 15. cap. 81.</note> where there appeared to certain women washing there, as their custome was, a man of a huge stature with his belly cut up and exenterated, and two children in his armes: he spoke to them, and told them that all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian women should die, and the greatest part of them also. This Spectre was also seen on horse-back on the side of the Hills, running swifter then the wind. A mighty Plague followed, that destroied almost all the Inhabitants of the place.</p>
               <p>That also out of <hi>Fincelius</hi> is very remarkable,<note place="margin">See <hi>Henningus Grosius</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gica de Spectris, lib. 1.

People endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to apprehend them, but they ran too swift for them, and yet they nevertheless mowed as laboriously in their flight as before. A great <hi>Plague</hi> ensued thereupon. I could adde to these what I have been cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly informed has hapned in England.</p>

He writes also of the <hi>Picts</hi> in England, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their destruction there were seen fiery Armies in Heaven fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with one another; and that in the confines betwixt the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> at mid-day there was so great a noise of armed horsemen that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred one another, that it almost frighted the poor countrymen out of their wits.</p>

That was also a terrible Prodigie that preceded that hideous ruine of <hi>Antioch</hi> by an Earthquake. There was seen over that great City a <hi>Spectrum</hi> in the Aire of a vast stature in the habit of a Woman, but with an horrid countenance, so that she frighted all that looked on her, but especially when she slash'd a whip which she had in her hand, the cracks thereof were so loud and dreadful.

Which is deprehended not onely by that flaming sword that hung over the City for a whole year together, and a sudden light in the night-time that shone about the Altar and the Temple, so that it made it as light as day; as also the spontaneous opening of the East gate of the Temple, which was so heavy and massy, as being made of brass, that it was as much as twenty men could do to shut it, (to which you may adde the Voice that was heard by the Priests, as they went into the Temple by night at the time of Pentecost, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="1">1. WE come now to the second particular propounded, <hi>The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the dead,</hi> which I dare say the <hi>Atheist</hi> will listen to with more then ordinary attention, and greedily suck in the Doctrine, provided it be stated with the most curious circumstances that the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidest of Theologers will describe it by, and mainly by these two; That we shall have the same <hi>Numerical</hi> Bodies in which we lived here on Earth, and That those very bodies, the molds being turned aside, shall start out of the Grave. This doctrine the <hi>Atheist</hi> very dearly hugs as a pledge, in his bold conceit, of the falseness and vanity of all the other Articles of Religion. Wherefore he phansying the upshot of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity to be so groundless and incredible, he fairly quits himself of the trouble of all, and yields himself up wholly to the pleasures of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And I question not but that this is the great Stone of offence upon which those two blind <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> of <hi>Delph</hi> and <hi>Amsterdam</hi> (of whom I have so often spoken) fell and split themselves; the Rock which made them suffer the Shipwrack of their faith, in <hi>allegorizing</hi> the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead and the last Judgment into a mere <hi>Moral</hi> sense, and in conceiting the last Trump to be only their doctrine, and that Christ was come in them to judge the quick and the dead; and that the happy Resurrection so much talked of and so long expected, was nothing else but to be raised up into the like life and belief with these <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> as I must call them: and I would ask them, what is meant by the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>unjust,</hi> if this be the Resurrection of the <hi>just</hi>? or if this be the Resurrection <hi>to life,</hi> what is meant by the Resurrection <hi>to condemnation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But in truth it is scarce fit to ask <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> any questions at all, they, under pretence of inspiration, wholy disclaiming the use of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and imperiously dictating their own wilfull Imaginations to the World for certain and undisputable Revelations: And therefore in this regard there is more hope of the Atheists then of them, who by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding their Objections put men in a capacity of finding out an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:55305:126"/>
but when men will haughtily and superciliously deny a Truth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of the Spirit, without rendring a reason, this Ignorance or rather Madness is utterly incurable.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Leaving therefore these men to the full enjoyment of their own phansies, let us hear the Objections of the Atheists against this Article so stated as has been above defined; which are chiefly Three.</p>
               <p>First, against the <hi>numerical Identity</hi> of our Bodies in the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Because, say they, the <hi>Anthropophagi</hi> or <hi>Cannibals</hi> are continually fed with mans flesh, as also they feed one upon another. To give therefore the highest instance against this Assertion; How can that man, say they, that has been fed with mans flesh in a manner perpetually, and at last himself fed upon by men, have the same Body at the Resurrection? For he will be left as bare of flesh, as the Crow was of feathers when every bird had pecked away what belonged unto themselves. Besides the hazard of losing that flesh that was his own, (if any was his own) by being himself devoured and digested into the flesh and body of others.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Their second Objection is against mens Bodies rising out of their graves, and runs thus; It implies, say they, that all men were buried: whenas Myriads have been drowned in the seas and eaten by fishes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides infinite numbers that have had the usual burial of their Nations, have had a very inconsiderable part of their bodies committed to the ground; only a few ashes in an Urn; the rest of their body, in the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, vanishing into Air. Which in some sort comes to pass in them that are wholy buried in the Earth. For the Body rots and melts away there into fume and vapours, which the heat of the Sun exhales and draws into the Air. Some it may be shoot up into the blades of Grass, which either rots upon the ground, or is food for horses, to whose shares it doth not fall to have honest burial, but lie to rot also in the open fields, or else are eaten by those Creatures that at length doe so. So that the Soul, if she were to seek for her Body, would hear more likely news of it in the Air then in the Earth. So incredible is it, that it is kept circumscribed in so particular a part of the Earth as the Grave.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And lastly, to make all sure, They endeavour to enervate the very grounds and dig down the deepest foundation of this Assertion of <hi>Identity</hi> of bodies at the Resurrection, by alledging that the very end thereof implies a contradiction. For whereas the reason is given, That the Body that was partner either in unlawfull pleasures or the laudable pains and labours of the Soul, might partake also of her Punishment or Reward: here they pretend that the Bodie is not the same <hi>numerical</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy throughout the whole life of a man, no more then a river is the same river, but that the Bodie wasts and is restored, that the present Spirits, Bloud and Flesh are passing, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a river.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> speaks, and new supplies are perpetually made by food; and that therefore we have no more the same <hi>numerical body</hi> always then the same <hi>numerical</hi> cloaths, but that in both we wear out the old and get new, but in our cloaths at once, in our Bodies by degrees. Wherefore to contend that the same <hi>numerical</hi> body shall rise that was buried, and that upon point of Justice, is to contend for the greatest piece of Injustice that may be:
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:55305:126"/>
For so shall the Body of an old man be punished for the sins of that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy he had when he was young.</p>
               <p n="7">7. These and such like are the Arguments of those that would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Religion upon this advange, as they deem it; and something they drive at that seems to tend to a perswasion of some kind of incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and incredibility in the matter, but it will not all amount to an <hi>utter Impossibility.</hi> But to me it seems so inconsiderable, that I shall not vouchsafe it an Answer upon those terms and that Hypothesis they goe upon. I shall soar a little higher, <hi>that my way being aloft,</hi> as the Wise man speaks, <hi>I may be free from the snares beneath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what I answer I would be understood to direct to the <hi>Atheist</hi> and the <hi>Infidel,</hi> permitting them that already believe the substance, to vary their phansies with what circumstances they please. But for these others I must hold them to hard meat, and cut my skirts as short as I can, that they sit not upon them.</p>

                  </gap>, what the meaning of them is in that general sense which is applicable as well to the Resurrection of the unjust as of the just.</head>
               <p n="1">1. I Answer therefore first out of the best sort of Philosophers, That <hi>Animus cujusque is est quisque,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>That the Soul of every man is his individual Person,</hi> and <hi>That she alone it is that hears, that sees, that enjoies pleasure and undergoes pain</hi>; and That the Body is not sensible of any thing, no more then a mans dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet when he is well bastinado'd. And this Answer takes away all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the First and Last Cavil. For why are men solicitous of the same <hi>numerical</hi> body, but that they may be sure to find themselves the same <hi>numerical</hi> persons? But it being most certain there is no <hi>stable Persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of a man but what is in his Soul, (for if the Body be Essential to this <hi>numerical Identity,</hi> a grown man has not the same individuation he had when he was Christned;) it is manifest, that if there be the <hi>same Soul,</hi> there is exactly the <hi>same Person</hi>; and that the change of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy causes no more real difference of Personality then the change of cloaths. And why do men plead for the consociation of the Soul's <hi>nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical body</hi> in Reward or Punishment, but that they phansie the Body ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:55305:127"/>
of pleasure and pain? But they erre, not knowing the nature of things, the Body being utterly uncapable of all sense and cogitation, as not only the best of the <hi>Platonists,</hi> but also that excellent Philosopher <hi>Des-cartes</hi> has determined, and is abundantly demonstrated in my <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 2. ch. 2. of that Treatise, as also chap. 4, 5, 6.</note> Treatise of the Immortality of the Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This therefore being cleared, I answer also to their second Cavil, concerning mens rising out of the very graves they wery buried in, That the expression is only Prophetical and Symbolical, (though I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that in some it may happen literally to be true) and that it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies no more then thus, <hi>That the same men that die and are buried, shall as truly appear in their own persons at the Day of Iudgment, as if those Bodies that were interred should be presently actuated by their Souls again, and should start out of their graves</hi>; and to give an instance, they shall be as truly the same persons as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when he rose body and soul out of the Grave, after he had lien there four daies together. But that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal expression of mens <hi>rising out of the Grave</hi> is but a Prophetical Scheme of Speech the more strongly to strike our senses, as I have already inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in my <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 1. ch. 6. sect. 3.</note> exposition of the 15 of 1 Cor. against the <hi>Psychopan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nychites.</hi> And therefore the greater accumulation of absurdities that can be made against that circumstance, it will the more confirm that use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Interpretation of mine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This succour we have against the Atheists out of Philosophy; but I answer further as concerning the Scripture it self, (which is the only certain measure of the truth of our Religion, and to which alone I dare finally stand, not thinking my self bound to make good every conceit that either the <hi>Pride, Precipitancie, Inadvertencie</hi> or <hi>Ignorance</hi> of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Teachers have obtruded upon the World,) That I dare challenge him to produce any place of Scripture out of which he can make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, That the Mysterie of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> implies <hi>the resuscitation of the same numerical body.</hi> The most pregnant of all is Job 19, which later Interpreters are now so wise as not to understand at all of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. The 1 Cor. 15. that Chapter is so far from asserting this curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity, that it plainly saies it is not the same body; but that as God gives to the blades of corn grains quite distinct from that which was sown, so at the Resurrection he will give the Soul a Body quite different from that which was buried. Now if it be not the same Body that was buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what need it run into the Earth to come out again? Wherefore it is plain that the Apostle there writes, as I said before, in a Prophetical and Symbolical style.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But the <hi>Atheist</hi> will still hang on and object further, That the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry term <hi>Resurrectio</hi> implies that <hi>the same body</hi> shall rise again, for that only that falls can be said properly to rise again. But the Answer will be easie, the Objection being grounded merely upon a mistake of the sense of the word, which is to be interpreted out of those higher <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and not out of the <hi>Latine,</hi> though the word in <hi>Latin</hi> does not alwaies implie an <hi>individual</hi> Restitution of what is gone or fallen: as in that verse in <hi>Ovid,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Victa tamen vinces subversaque Troja resurges.</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:55305:127"/>
But this is not so near to our purpose; let us rather consider the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which <hi>Resurrectio</hi> supplies in Latin, and therefore must be made to be of as large a sense as it. Now <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is so far from signifying (in some places) the Reproduction or Recuperation of the same thing that was before, that it bears no sense at all of <hi>Reiteration</hi> in it. As Matth. 22.24. <gap reason="foreign">

Wherefore so far forth as they are said to be dead, so far forth may they be said to be revived or to be raised from the dead; as the Ghosts of men are said to be by art Magick, because they are made to appear. But the Devil is not said to be raised from the dead, because he was never properly said to be alive amongst us, or to live amongst us.</p>

               <p n="1">1. I Should proceed, but that I must be contented to be interrupted by one Objection more, which is this; If the Souls of men live and act out of their Bodies before the Resurrection, what need is there of any Resurrection of the Body? For what want have they of any Bodies at all, if their Soul can live and act without them? But I answer,</p>
               <p>First, That we are not infallibly assured but that the Souls as well of the Good as the Bad after Death have an <hi>Aereal</hi> Body, in which, if Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries be true, they have sometimes appeared after their decease. And that they may act, think and understand in these Aiery vehicles, as well as other Spirits doe, is not at all incredible nor improbable; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of an humane Soul being not inferiour to the Faculties of some Orders of Spirits,<note place="margin">See my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality of the Soul, Book 3. ch. 17.</note> whose Understandings are not so clear but that they are divided in their judgments, some being of one Sect of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, some of another, as those that appeared to <hi>Cardan</hi>'s father pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed themselves <hi>Avenroists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But secondly, if it were granted that the Souls of the deceased were stript of all Corporeity, and yet could act, we may nothwithstanding very well conceive that that which once had so intimate union with the grossest of Bodies, has certainly a very strong propension, natural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency or <hi>essential aptitude</hi> alwaies to join with some Body or other. Which power if we may not infallibly affirm to be so catching, that the Soul is never disappointed of some kinde of Vehicle, yet we may safely pronounce, that when that natural capacity is satisfied, there accrues a greater accomplishment and more vigorous enjoiment to the Soul, her Operations thereby being made more sensible and vivid. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that great Reward of an Heavenly, Aethereal or Immortal body, which shall be given at the last day, is of very high concernment for the compleating of the happiness of the Souls of the faithfull, whether we suppose them in the mean time to live without Bodies, or to be alive on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Aiery vehicles; the <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid. Book 3. chap. 1.</note> latter whereof if examined to the bottome, will appear the most unexceptionable opinion, and least liable to the Cavils of Gainsaiers. But whether of them be most true I leave to the grave and wise to determine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Rub being thus removed out of the way, we now proceed to the special significations of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>the Resurrection to life, the Resurrection of the just,</hi> and simply <hi>the Resurrection,</hi> as it is 1 Cor. 15. and elsewhere. Wherefore <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> as they belong to the wicked, have no further sense of <hi>Revivification</hi> then in that general way we have explained, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> implying that they were raised and made to appear at this day of general Summons, merely to receive the sentence of Eternal Death, <hi>Goe ye accursed into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting fire,</hi> &amp;c. But now <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as it is appropriated to the <hi>Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the just,</hi> and is termed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, implies in it a further and more peculiar <hi>Revivification</hi> or <hi>Re-enlivening,</hi> viz. into that <hi>life</hi> which was lost by the first Fall, that Paradisiacal life, that Aethereal and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly life, which is unrecoverable unless we recover those Heavenly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified bodies which are promised to us by Christ at his coming.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For this muddy Earth, and vaporous polluted Air which is the very Region of Death, wherein all the Pleasures, Joyes and Triumphs of this Present Life are but like the grinning laughter of Ghosts or the dance of dead men, these foul Elements, I say, can afford no such commodious habitation for the Soul, as to arrive any thing near to the height of that Happiness which she shall be possessed of when Christ shall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to change these our vile bodies into the similitude of his glorious bodie, and so to recover us into the enjoiment of that Heavenly Life which we unhappily forfeited by our first Fall. For which purpose he came into the world, as himself professes John 6. v. 40. <hi>This is the will of him that sent me, that whosoever sees me and believes in me, should have everlasting life, and that I should raise him up at the last day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. And so certainly it will be at his coming to Judgment, that they that then see him and firmly believe on him, ardently loved him and vehemently desired his Appearing, shall find such a warming change in themselves, partly by the glorious approach of his Person and Lustre of his numerous Retinue, partly by the wonderfull secret workings of the Divine Presence in their very Bodies and Souls, that at last there will be kindled such an irresistible Faith, so rapturous a Joy and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Love, that breaking out upon the Body, be it what it will, it will turn all into a pure Aethereal flame; and so <hi>Elias</hi>-like in those Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial chariots shall they ascend up to Christ, and meet him in the Air, and join with his Armie whereever it moves, as becoming then <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, their Vehicles being transformed by the power and presence of Christ, and the working of his Divinity, into a pure Paradisiacal and Angelical nature.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And thus shall he make his word good of <hi>raising us up at the last day,</hi> in that he does re-enliven us, and restore us to that <hi>Life</hi> and Joy which we had fallen from, re-enthrone us into that Glory we had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced in our selves and was lost in these dark Bodies of ours, and raise us up to that pristine state of Happiness and that superiour Paradise, which we could not re-enter into, or be re-estated in, but by becoming wholly <hi>Aethereal</hi> or <hi>Celestial.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>1.</hi> That he has freed the Mysterie of the Resurrection from all Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of either <hi>Atheists</hi> or <hi>Enthusiasts. 2.</hi> That the Soul is not uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Happiness of an Heavenly Body. <hi>3.</hi> And that it is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most sutable Reward that can be conferr'd upon her. <hi>4.</hi> That this Reward is not above the power of Christ to confer, proved by what he did upon Earth. <hi>5.</hi> That all Iudgment is given to him by the Father. <hi>6.</hi> Further arguings to the same purpose.</head>
               <p n="1">1. AND now I think we have so disentangled the Mystery of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> from all the Prejudices and conceived Difficulties that it was involved in, that I may challenge all the World, the <hi>Atheist, Infidel</hi> and new-fangled <hi>Enthusiast,</hi> if they can frame any solid Exception against it, which they can manage by Reason, and is not a mere sullen dictate of their own dark and dull minds.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For this precious Crown of Immortality which Christ shall then crown us withall, is neither beyond his power to give, nor our capacity to receive. For the offers and fluskerings, as I may so say, of the Faculties of the Soul of man, even in this state of Death and Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are so High, so Noble and Divine, as well in Speculation as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, especially when our Spirits are more then ordinarily pure, and come nearer to an Aethereal kind of defecacy; that they that have the experience thereof cannot distrust but that, if she had the advantage of an Angelical Bodie, her operations would prove little inferiour to theirs. Which is a demonstration that she is as well capable of such Bodies as they; As also of the worth and value, and of the fitness and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modateness of so ample a Reward.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For Philosophy herself can witness, That according to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter purity of our Spirits, the Motions and Passions of our Minds are changed and become more holy and divine, &amp; our Thoughts and Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions more clear, our Love to God more ardent and sincere, our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity to men more free and general, and all the Faculties of our Soul in a ready posture to comply with the best commands or suggestions of Reason or Religion. Of what infinite importance therefore must it be to have such a Body as is not only perpetually thus compliable with the Best motions of the Soul, but by virtue of its Heavenly purity does na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally encline the Mind to such Thoughts, Motions and Affections, as are most acceptable to God and most enravishing to her self? Which consideration does evidently demonstrate that <hi>high Reason</hi> that is in our Religion, in the <hi>Promise of a glorified Body,</hi> as the greatest Reward of our earnest colluctations and obedient endeavours in this life. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Divine Inspiration or some infallible Method of Philosophy could discover to the Mind of man so concerning a Point.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But to doubt whether Christ can cloath us with such Bodies as those, or enliven our whole man, in whatsoever bodies we be found, into
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:55305:129"/>
that Immortality and Life which accrues to us by transforming our vile bodies into the similitude of his glorious Bodie, is either to forget or not to believe what mighty power he had when he was here upon earth; how merely by his word he calmed the raging of the seas, silenced the tempestuousness of the windes, multiplied a few loaves and a few fishes so, in the very eating of them, that he fed many thousands therewith in the wilderness; which was an eminent specimen of his power of transforming Matter into what modification he pleased: besides his healing of the sick, not only those that were present and believed on him, but also the absent; to which you may add the raising of the dead, which comes nearer to our purpose, as also the Resurrection of those that rose with him, to signifie his enlivening power, who himself so miraculously rose from the Grave.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By which wonderfull works he did plainly demonstrate, That what he professed of himself was true,<note place="margin">See my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul, Book 3. ch. 18. sect. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>That as the Father has life in himself, so he has also given the Son to have life in himself,</hi> that is, the power of vivification or enlivening of others, as you may see by the context, John 5. v. 26. And not only so, but he has given him also the power of punishing as well as rewarding, as it follows in the next verse, <hi>And he hath given him authority to execute judgement, because he is the Son of man,</hi> viz. That Son of man that upon his sufferings and after his being risen from the dead should have all power given to him in Heaven and in Earth. Which we may easily believe, whenas he had so vast a power in the lowest ebbe of his Humiliation, when he went up and down afflicted, despised and neglected, being attended only by a few contemptible fisher-men and others of like inferiour condition; and yet then he opened the eyes of them that were born blind, and at a distance healed the sick, and being unaccompanied with any visible pomp or power, with one word of his mouth drove away a Legion of Devils at once. What shall he not then be able to doe, when he shall return in the highest Glory and Majesty that the visible Divinity can appear in? when the Heavens shall be filled with the brightness of his Camp, and all the Nations of the World shall be astonished at the dreadfull splendour of his coming?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Shall not he then, who in his dejectment could raise to life not only a faithless but senseless corps, enliven those that at his glorious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance are so filled with Faith, Love, Joy, Desire and Admiration, that their empassioned Souls are ready to leave their Bodies, if it were possible, to come and doe their homage to their long-expected Saviour and Redeemer? Shall not that Divine and Omnipotent Power then that worketh round about him, so cooperate with those kindled Affections, as to change their very Bodies into an ability of naturally ascending up to him, and joining with him? Or is it hard for him to convert Flesh or Air into a pure Aethereal Fire, &amp; to awake such a Facultie in the Soul as shall kindly and vitally inactuate it, who turned Air into Flesh, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the dead carcase of <hi>Lazarus</hi> so fittingly for reunion with the Soul, that he raised him out of the Grave on the fourth day? Wherefore this Resurrection, Life and Immortality we speak of, being neither impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:55305:130"/>
for Christ to give, nor our nature uncapable to receive, it remains that we shall enjoy it, because Christ both himself and by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles has so plainly and expresly promised it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THe Third thing we propounded comprized in Christ's Return to Judgment is the <hi>Conflagration of the world,</hi> a Point as incredible to most of the Heathen as the <hi>Resurrection of the dead</hi>; and the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them both together made it the more ridiculously-incredible to them, as you may see by that Jear that <hi>Caecilius</hi> gives the Christians in <hi>Minucius Felix. Quid? quod toti Orbi &amp; ipsi Mundo cum sideribus suis minantur incendium, ruinam moliuntur? quasi aut Naturae divinis le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus constitutus aeternus ordo turbetur, aut, rupto omnium elementorum foedere &amp; coelesti compage divisâ, moles ista quâ continemur &amp; cingi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur subruatur.

Anceps malum &amp; gemina dementia, Coelo &amp; astris quae sic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquimus ut invenimus interitum denunciare, sibi mortuis &amp; extinctis (qui sicut nascimur &amp; interimus) aeternitatem repromittere. To which you may add how they menace burning and meditate ruine to the whole Earth and to the Heaven it self with the Stars thereof; as if the Eternal Order constituted by the divine laws of Nature could be disturbed, or that this huge Fabrick wherein we are contained and surrounded, by the breaking of that league amongst the Elements and division of the celestial Compages could tumble down. And not content with this furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinion alone, they join and stitch to it old wives fables. They af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that they shall rise again after death, and live after the being tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into embers and ashes. I know not upon what confidence they can thus believe one anothers lies. You would think they were men started out of their Graves already. A twofold mischief and double madness, to denounce destruction to the Heavens and Starres which we leave in
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:55305:130"/>
the same condition that we find them, and to promise Eternity to our selves once dead and extinct, who as we are born into the world, so we die.</hi> But the double sting of this twofold Jear is easily pulled out; and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed concerning the <hi>Resurrection</hi> already; we having plainly shewed, That that mysterie implies nothing more then this, That the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Persons shall be revivificated body and soul, and made happy with Eternal life. But <hi>the same individual Person</hi> does not involve any necessity of the <hi>same numerical body,</hi> as has been shewn at large.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The very point and sting of this Scoff against the <hi>Conflagration,</hi> is also a presumptuous mistake as well as that against the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> (though I deny the possibility of neither) and it lyes in these words, <hi>ipsi Mundo cum sideribus suis minantur incendium, ruinam moliuntur.</hi> Such a clatter as this indeed (though some of the Pagan Philosophers, as <hi>Lucretius</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> are not affraid to admit, yet) might well scare the more sagacious from giving assent to it. But <hi>the Conflagration of the World,</hi> according to the truth thereof in the Christian Mystery, is limited with more modest and credible bounds, it not concerning the <hi>Starry Heavens</hi>; unless you will call these Heavens <hi>Starry</hi> that are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of Sublunary Comets and falling Starres. So that all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction that is threatned by the better-knowing Christians is onely to the Globe of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the circumjacent <hi>Aire,</hi> with all the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishings of them, which shall be burnt up and destroyed: But the <hi>Aire</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> shall continue <hi>Aire</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> still; but with such alteration as this terrible Burning shall work upon them.</p>

And yet these <hi>Vulcanoes</hi> are not less frequent in <hi>America,</hi> as <hi>Acosta</hi> writes, and gives this description of them in general, <hi>That they be rocks or pikes of very high mountains, having upon their tops a plain, and in the midst thereof a pit or great mouth which descends to the very foot of the Hill,</hi> a thing very terrible to behold, as he saies. Out of those mouths is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited smoak, and sometimes fire, and sometimes neither, as it fares ordinarily with that of <hi>Arequipa,</hi> as also with that of <hi>Mexico</hi> near <hi>the village of Angels,</hi> which sends out smoak and ashes onely by fits, but never fire; and yet the Inhabitants are affraid it will sometime break out and burn all the Country.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The <hi>Vulcanoes</hi> of <hi>Guatimalla</hi> are more terrible. In the year 1586. almost all the City of <hi>Guatimalla</hi> fell with an earthquake. This <hi>Vulcanoe</hi> had then for six months together day and night cast from the top and vomited, as it were, great flouds of fire; a notable instance of what treasures of <hi>combustibles</hi> Nature is stored with. As is also observable in the <hi>Vulcanoe</hi> of <hi>Quitto,</hi> which cast such abundance of ashes, that in many leagues compass thereabouts it darkned the light of the day.</p>
               <p n="8">8. There are also other kind of <hi>Vulcanoes</hi> which never cast either smoak, flame or ashes, but in the bottome they are seen to burn with a quick fire never dying. This imposed upon a greedy Priest, and made him think it was nothing else but heaps of Gold melted in the fire, which he thought to have fetched up by letting down an iron Kettle with chains. But his device was not fire-proof, his kettle and chain melting so soon as they approached near the bottome.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But the greatest wonder of all is that which <hi>Acosta</hi> noteth of some <hi>Vulcanoes,</hi> that for some hundred, nay some thousands of years have cast out continually smoak, fire and ashes. These visible instances of particular burnings of the Earth are notable Presumptions that there are laid in in the hidden Mines of Providence such a provision of Combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible matter as will serve for that universal Conflagration we speak of, when the day of Vengeance shall make use of those Treasuries of Wrath.</p>

               <p n="1">1. WE have seen how well stored the Earth is toward this <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conflagration</hi>; let us now consider what the Heaven or Aire may afford. Where letting go other <hi>Fiery</hi> Meteors, we shall only consider some few instances of <hi>Comets, falling Starres</hi> and of <hi>Thunder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>Comets</hi> I understand onely such <hi>new Starres</hi> as are <hi>Sublunary</hi> and of combustible matter actually set on fire. Of which sort there was one of so huge a magnitude which appeared after the death of <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> that it was found no less then the Sun to see to, and with the brightness of its fiery shining turned Night into Day. But to speak more at large of this Meteor, <hi>Cardan</hi> and other Philosophers would have them either <hi>Signes</hi> or <hi>Causes</hi> of great <hi>Droughts</hi>; and they may well be both, these sublunary especially: such great fiery bodies not being easily fed without wasting much of the kindly moisture of the Aire, which makes the season also unwholesome and pestilential. But for <hi>Droughts,</hi> it has been observed that after the appearing of these Comets, the year has been so excessive hot, that it has parched the Corn upon the ground, set whole Woods on fire, and dried Fountains and Rivers; as it hapned in the years 1477 and 1539.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Stellae cadentes</hi> are either such as <hi>Virgil</hi> describes in his <hi>Georgicks,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Saepe etiam stellas vento impendente videbis</l>
                     <l>Praecipites coelo labi, noctisque per umbram</l>
                     <l>Flammarum longos à tergo albescere tractus.</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="234" facs="tcp:55305:132"/>Oft mayst thou see upon approaching wind</l>
                     <l>Starres slide from Heaven, and through the Night's great shade</l>
                     <l>Long tracts of flaming white to draw behind.</l>
                  </q>
(Which Meteors though they make a great show in the Night, yet doe not ordinarily much hurt, unless they should light upon the fields of <hi>Aricia,</hi> whose Earth was so combustible that it would take fire upon the falling of any coal) Or else they are such <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>Comets,</hi> as themselves become sometimes falling Starres: Which <hi>Scaliger</hi> affirms to have been found true in his time: and <hi>Fromondus</hi> out of <hi>Sennertus</hi> writes, that the Tail of a Comet in the year 1543 flew off, and falling into a River drunk up all the water of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But the Effects of no fiery Meteor are so frequent or so terrible as that of <hi>Thunder.</hi> To which sulfureous Exhalations out of the Earth contribute something, as well as moist Vapors for the generating of Rain: As is discovered by the great frequency of Thunders about the <hi>Vulca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes</hi> we spoke of.</p>
               <p>One notable Effect which <hi>Plinie</hi> takes notice of is like that of the Tail of the Comet. For he saith there is one kind of Thunder, <hi>quo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia exhauriuntur intactis operimentis.</hi> Like to this is that which the above-named Writer recites out of <hi>Wolfangus Meurerus,</hi> that a certain Minister as he was going from <hi>Lipsia</hi> to <hi>Torga</hi> was so consumed by <hi>Thunder,</hi> that not a bit of him was to be seen, his whole body being dissolved into Vapour and Exhalations, and blown away with the wind. The closest texture of bodies will not hold, when this quick searching Fire assaults them. For this Meteor is made of such subtile, glib and furiously-agitated elements, that they will irresistibly pass whereever they attempt, and disjoyn every <hi>congeries</hi> of Atoms, as <hi>Lucretius</hi> has well described them.

               <p n="4">4. But that is as remarkable as any thing concerning <hi>Thunder,</hi> that the fire thereof is sometimes unextinguishable; as it hapned in <hi>Macrinus</hi> the Emperours time, when the Theatre was Thunder-struck in the very day they celebrated their <hi>Vulcanalia.</hi> And such was that fire that fell from Heaven in <hi>Aurelius</hi> his time by the prayers of a Legion of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, which from this effect was called <hi>Legio Fulminatrix,</hi> the <hi>Thundring Legion.</hi> A competent shower of such fire as this, that is thus perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory and importunate, what part of the earth is so incombustible that it would not subdue?</p>
               <p n="5">5. I would not mention that strange and unexpected effect of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whereby it conglaciates or makes rigid, fluid or soft bodies, (which both <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Cardan</hi> takes notice of: The one gives an instance of hogsheads of wine turned into ice by Thunder;<note place="margin">Cardan. de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Varietate, lib. 8. c. 43.</note> the other of certain mowers in the Iland <hi>Lemnos,</hi> who being thunder-struck as they were
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:55305:132"/>
supping under an Oake, their bodies became so hard, rigid and stiff, as if they had been so many Statues, which imitated the same actions they were doing when they were alive, one seeming to eate, the other seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to lift a pot to his mouth, a third to drink, &amp;c.) I say I would not mention this, did it not give some light and credibility to that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Transmutation of <hi>Lot</hi>'s wife into a pillar of Salt; the thundring and lightning that then fell, some of it it seems being attempered to such an effect, and directed to strike that refractory woman, that she might be not onely a monument of God's wrath upon disobedient curiosities, but also of the manner of his executing that signal vengeance upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> with the neighbouring Cities, viz. That it was with thunder and lightning from above, as the Text witnesseth, and <hi>Solinus</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> also agree to, and not onely by subterraneous fire breaking forth, and the absorption of Earthquakes that swallowed down the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as <hi>Strabo</hi> seems to insinuate.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This destruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> with fire from Heaven, assented to by Heathens as well as Christians, is so ample a pledge of the possibility of the <hi>Conflagration</hi> of the Earth, that though I could out of <hi>Plinie</hi> and others adde other such like instances of Cities being burnt down with Thunder, yet I shall content my self with this so notable an example. And having shewn that there are such copious and rich treasures of the fiery Principle in Nature, I shall make this brief demand, Why may not this Principle sometime so break out and overflow, that there may be an universal rage of Fire upon Earth, as well as there was once of Water? For the hidden causes and principles of Nature sometimes work scantly, sometimes moderately, sometimes as if they had broke all laws and bounds: as is observable in Torrents and Earthquakes; they sometimes being kept within the compass of a very few miles, othersometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a manner universal, as those Earthquakes were that hapned in the years 367, and 1289. So flouds sometimes are so small, that they scarce cover a whole Meadow; othersometimes so great, that they drown whole Towns; and othersometimes they are either so large as to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, or at least to cover vast Kingdomes and Continents at once. Such were the Deluges of <hi>Deucalion,</hi> of <hi>Ogyges,</hi> and that of <hi>Noah.</hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we see also in History what particular executions the Element of <hi>Fire,</hi> either by fulgurations from Heaven or eruptions out of the Earth, has done on this House, on that Town, nay upon whole Countries: why may not the rage of it then at last so break out, that it may be called even a general <hi>Deluge of fire?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. This seems so farre from an Impossibility to <hi>Plinie,</hi> that conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how full fraught the World is with this Element, and how propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative it is of it self, he saith it is the greatest Miracle of all,<note place="margin">Plin.

And if there were not here already matter enough to contrive into the most mischievous kind of fiery Meteors, such as will be sure to do execution, yet that <hi>Word</hi> that created all things can easily change so much of any Matter into such a modification as will most effectually serve for this heavy Vengeance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But I make no question but that there are Second causes on this side that <hi>Omnipotent Creative</hi> power of the Godhead, that are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for such ministries of Providence as this. As truly those innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable bright Legions of Angels may seem to be, whose Skill and power of Imagination upon the Elements of Nature is certainly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendently above what we can conceive; their Faculties, at least some of them, as farr surpassing ours, as ours do those of brute beasts who have not the least conceit of our power and artifice in doing things.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What power think you then is in the Head of these Heavenly hosts <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> who in the flesh, as I have often noted, shewed such mighty specimens thereof over the Elements of the world? The mere <hi>Fiat</hi> therefore of his Imagination and Will acting upon the <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> whether nearer hand or farther of, cannot but prove sufficient, if he so please, to undoe that universal coalition of particles out of which arises the <hi>Compages</hi> and consistence of every earthly Substance, and to turn them into such a flame as some would have the whole Earth anciently to have been, or so to moderate the action, and fire it so deep, and with such a qualification of parts, as shall be most sutable to his present and after-design.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This Effect will not seem beyond that inherent power in the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Soul</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> if we consider its unspeakable corroboration by his mysterious union with the Godhead, and the obedience of the <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> to the <hi>exalted powers of the Soul,</hi> and the power of <hi>this</hi>

               <p n="1">1. I Hope by this time we have prevailed so far as to perswade the <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of the Conflagration of the World,</hi> in that sense we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained it. And truly I know nothing that should keep a man from as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to it as <hi>possible,</hi> but that dull Fallacie, whereby we conclude <hi>That nothing can be done but what we have seen done, or phansie we could doe our selves.</hi> And this is the reason that makes the <hi>Atheist</hi> misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Creation,</hi> because he himself can make nothing but out of preja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Matter; and a settled course of things causes so deep an impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in our Senses, that we can hardly phansie they will ever alter. Which makes some men never think of Death, especially if they have never been sick; a flattering impossibility, by reason of so long continuance of life, stealing into their hopes, as if they should never die. And therefore that great Monarch was fain to have one to rub up his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry every day with a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Remember that thou art mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</hi> Well may we phansie then such unalterable Laws of Nature as shall secure the Earth from such a destruction as we speak of, when we are led unawares into so favourable a conceit of our own life or fortune, after we have for a competent time been well settled in either, as not at all to think of the mutability of our condition. Wherefore I hope any one that is aware of this ordinary Fallacie, will easily recover himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to so much use of his Reason, as not to conclude the <hi>Conflagration</hi> of the Earth <hi>impossible,</hi> because <hi>he knows not how to burn it himself</hi>; or that it will <hi>alwaies continue unburnt,</hi> because <hi>it has been unburnt thus long.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But that which I drive at is, to shew that the belief of a Christian is not only of things <hi>possible,</hi> but <hi>reasonable</hi>; which I have in some sort made good already by discovering the manifold treasures of the fiery and combustible principles in Heaven and Earth: to which I add further,</p>
               <p>First, That Providence ordering all particular corporeal things by number, weight and measure, it is reasonable that the continuance of this present stage of things be <hi>numbred,</hi> that is, have its number of years set, so that there be a full pause or Period, a last <hi>Exiit</hi> and <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite,</hi> to this <hi>Tragick Comedie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:55305:135"/>3. Secondly, Whatever particular corporeal structure has a Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (unless it be a Body inacted with a glorified Spirit) will also have an End naturally of it self, and that which will have an End, is subject to decaying. And for my own part I question not but that the Earth is of such a nature, and <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 2. ch. 6. sect. 2.</note> that it waxes old by degrees, &amp; will grow more &amp; more dry &amp; steril in succession of Ages; whereby it will become more kexy, and loose of its Solidity. For a Body that is porous and can imbibe moisture, the more moist, the more solid it is, &amp; the more solid the Earth is, the better it will keep its distance from the Sun, as it is swung about him in this common <hi>Vortex</hi> of the Planets. Wherefore the distance of the Earth lessening so, as Astronomers observe, might it not come from other causes, would be a parlous Symptome and sign that the Earth grows old apace, and much exhausted: And the more it is exhausted, the nearer still it will be wrought toward the Sun, according to the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Philosophy. So that at last, what by its over-drieness and what by its approaching so near to the Fountain of heat, not only Forrests and Woods, which has happned already, but the subterraneous Mines of Sulphur and other combustible Matter will catch fire, and set the <hi>whole Earth</hi> in a manner on burning.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I say therefore, that the Earth will thus at the long run be burnt, <hi>either according to the course of Nature,</hi> (of which manner of destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction these be the main concomitants; That by reason of a long distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and languishment, she will be utterly unable or very wretchedly able to sustain either Man or Beast for abundance of Ages together before she be ruined and burnt up by this mortiferous Fever, and after this death and destruction of hers, far less able, she becoming then but as a <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> by reason of the long exhaustion of the life and heart of the soil before this lingring Conflagration) <hi>or else by a more speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or solemn appointment of Providence, the Period of her Conflagration shall be shortned.</hi> From which if any universal good doth accrue to the Creation, it is not unworthy of the Son of God and his mighty and most glorious Host to be emploied in so weighty a performance. For is not the whole Earth the Vineyard of the Lord, a particular platt of his skillfull Culture and Husbandry?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thirdly and lastly, There being so many obdurate rebellious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as well among the Apostate Angels as Men, that are so far revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from God, that they scarce retain any sense of him in their minds, that peremptorily deny a particular Providence, and stoutly phansie that if there be a Deity, he takes no notice of the affairs of any particular Creatures, that jear and flout at Religion, and look upon the life of the Son of God when he lived in the world as a poor and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Example of Pusillanimity and Dejectedness of Spirit, that contemn all his true followers for moaped Fools; but make their own Lusts their law in all things, and therefore are insensible of whatever Injustice or Cruelty they commit, or whatever Beastliness or Vileness they give themselves up to; these being past all sense within, but all of them sensible enough in their bodies or vehicles, the Devils themselves not excepted, how fitting, nay how necessary is it, that a fiery Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:55305:135"/>
and Tempest of Vengeance should rattle upon their external per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and that corporeal pain should pierce them to the very quick, and that all whatever they took delight in should be demolisht, and that they should be smothered in tormenting Heat and Darkness, of which they know no end?</p>
               <p n="6">6. These Considerations which I have alledged make the <hi>Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World</hi> not only <hi>possible,</hi> but also very <hi>reasonable,</hi> especially with that circumstance of not coming <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 2. chap. 6. sect. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:55305:136"/>
so sutable to the state of the World, that no wise and vertuous Person can doubt but that it is or will be set on foot at some time by Divine Providence; and that if the <hi>Messias</hi> be come, and the Writings of the New Testament be true, in the literal sense it is on foot-already.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WE have, I think, fully enough set forth the <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of Christian Religion in the <hi>Idea</hi> thereof, it may be more fully then was needfull, before we come to prove That it is more then an <hi>Idea.</hi> We shall by way of Recapitulation contract the more Intelligible frame thereof into a lesser model, that its due symmetrie and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be better seen at once. Which will be both a relief to our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and also a help to our Judgment, when we shall have a more easie opportunity of considering the solid strength and handsome congruity of the whole Fabrick.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And I dare challenge the most maliciously-wise and skilfull, if he can find any rational exception against the structure of this so intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Truth, whose Foundation is no less firm then what is built upon these undeniable Grounds; <hi>That there is a God,</hi> and <hi>a Perfect and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Providence, That there are Angels,</hi> and <hi>Spirits of men really distinct from their Bodies,</hi> and <hi>That the one as well as the other are lapsable.</hi> Which things I have demonstrated <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 2. ch. 1, 2, 3.</note> partly in this present Treatise, <note n="*" place="margin">In my Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote against Atheism, and my Treatise of the Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Soul.</note> partly in other Writings; and I appeal to all the World if they have any thing solid to oppose against what I have writ. Moreover, That this Lapse of Men and Angels is their forsaking of the <hi>Divine Life,</hi> and wholy cleaving to the <hi>Animal</hi> without any curb or bounds; whereby as well the fallen Angels or Devils as Man himself are become, as much as respects the inward life, mere Brutes, being devoid of that touch and sense of the <hi>Divine Goodness.</hi> And therefore their Empire is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally merely like that of the Beasts, according to <hi>Lust</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> where the stronger rules with Pride and Insolency over the weaker; and so the Devils being a degree above men, of more wit and power then they, it naturally falls to their shares to tyrannize over Mankind, who were in the same condemnation with themselves, having become Rebels to God as well as they.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And it is but a piece of Wisdome and Justice in that great Judge and <hi>Dramatist</hi> God Almighty, to permit this to be for a season: And therefore the generality of the World were to be for a time under the Religion and Worship of Devils, who were wild and enormous Recommenders of the <hi>mere Animal life</hi> to the sons of men without any bounds or limits; themselves in the mean time receiving that tribute of abused Mortals which was most agreeable to their Pride and Tyrannical natures, that is, <hi>Religious Worship</hi> and <hi>Absolute Obedience,</hi> as I have proved by many Examples in History.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And that God should stand silent all this time is no wonder, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from what I have intimated already, and partly because he is out of the reach of any real injury in all this; as also because the <hi>Object</hi> of this ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular Fury of both Men and Devils, in which they please themselves so much, is but the <hi>Effect</hi> of that <hi>one Power</hi> from whence are all things,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:55305:136"/>
or some shred or shadow of the Divine Attributes.<note place="margin">See Book 2. ch. 9.</note> For I have shewn fully enough That all the Branches of the <hi>Animal life</hi> are good and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable in themselves, and that only the Unmeasurable Love and Use of them is the thing that is damnable. The great Rebellion therefore of both Men and Angels is but <hi>a phrantick dotage upon the more obscure, evanid and inconsiderable operations or manifestations of that Power which hoots into all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. In this low condition is held the <hi>Kingdome of Darkness,</hi> who, maugre all their Lawlesness and Rebellion, do ever lick the very dust of his feet from whom they have revolted. For there is no Might nor Counsell against the Eternal God, but his Will shall stand in all. That all-comprehending Wisdome therefore was not outwitted by these Rebels, but she suffered them to introduce a Darkness, out of which herself would elicite a more marvellous and glorious Light, and let them prime the tablet with more duskish colours, on which she was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to pourtray the most illustrious beauty that the eyes of man could desire to look upon.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And that there is a <hi>Lapse of Men and Angels,</hi> is very manifest. That of Man is so plain, that not only the better sort of Philosophers, such as the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> and <hi>Platonists,</hi> but the making of Laws and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Punishments and mens general confession of their Proneness to Vice and Wickedness, doth abundantly testifie. And that there are <hi>wicked Spirits</hi> or <hi>evil Genii,</hi> as well as <hi>good,</hi> the Religion of the Pagans, and the Confession of Witches, and the Effects of them in the possessed are a sufficient argument.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now that Wisdome, as I have said, that orders all things sweetly, is not in the least measure baffled by this Misadventure of the fall of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men; but looks upon it as fit fuel for a more glorious triumph of the <hi>Divine Life:</hi> And that noted Aphorisme amongst the <hi>Pythagore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who laid no Principles for mean ends, comes in fitly here, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>That the Worser is made for the service and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Better.</hi> And the <hi>Kingdome of Darkness,</hi> no question, by Him that rules over all is very dextrously subordinated to the greater advantage of the <hi>Kingdome of Light,</hi> it yielding them a due exercise of all their Faculties in the behalf of the <hi>Divine life,</hi> which God most justly does magnifie above all things; as also a most successfull victorie and triumph. So that the Period of Ages ought to end (so exact a Providence attending things) as a very joyfull and pleasant <hi>Tragick Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.</hi> This the Reason of man will expect upon supposition that there is a God and Providence, as most certainly there is both; especially if one quality of <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> be better and more precious then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the <hi>Divine life</hi> the most lovely Perfection of all.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Which is as true as touch to all that have once tasted the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of it; and the Ignorance of the blinde is no argument against the certain Knowledge of them that see. For one <hi>Soul, Angel</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> (though they may be the same in Substance, as all Corporeal things are the same in Matter) may differs as much from another, as Gold, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amonds and Pearls do from common Dirt or Clay, or the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:55305:137"/>
Beauty from the horriblest Monster. That therefore that is base shall be rejected, and that which is precious and noble shall be gathered up, in that day that the Lord shall make up his Jewels.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And that there will be such a visible Day of Vengeance wherein the whole Earth shall burn with the wrath of God, not only the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fame throughout all Ages and Places, of <hi>the Final Conflagration of the World,</hi> and natural Reasons in Philosophy, but also a necessity of some universal, palpable and sensible Punishment on impudently-prophane and Atheistical People, is a warrantable Inducement to believe.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The great Good therefore that does arise out of this Revolt of Men and Angels, is a setting the Activity of the Creation at an higher pitch, and <hi>making the Emanations of all manner of Life felt more to the very quick,</hi> exciting and employing all the Faculties and Passions of Souls and Spirits in a greater degree of life and motion, with more vigilancy and a more favoury sense of acquired enjoiments, then if there had been no such opposition betwixt the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Dark Kingdomes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Now therefore though God may seem at first to give the <hi>Dark Kingdome</hi> and <hi>Animal life</hi> the start of the <hi>Divine,</hi> yet he is in due time, by some very effectual means, so to raise up, so to back and assist the <hi>Divine Life</hi> against the <hi>Powers of Darkness,</hi> that she may be found to have very visible Victories against the usurpation of Satan over the sons of men. Wherefore the Divine Wisdome that does not act according to absolute Power, but according to the Congruity of the nature of things, is to wind off Mankind from the slavery of the Devil, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them from the irregularities of the <hi>Animal life</hi> to the embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Divine,</hi> by such a way as is most accommodate to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Faculties and Capacities.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And what do we think could work more kindly upon the Nature of man to disenslave him from the bondage of <hi>Satan,</hi> and to make him close with the <hi>Divine life</hi> which he had forsaken, then to exhibit a very visible Example thereof in some venerable Person, who should earnestly exhort mankind to follow his steps and practices, and whose Doctrine should be confirmed with sensible Testimonies from Heaven, in approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and exaltation of his person, shewing that he is the only Beloved, the Darling and Delight of the Eternal God, with some such Expression as this from the very clouds, <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear him</hi>? In brief, That his Birth, Life and Death should be adorned with such miraculous and supernatural Circumstances, that it may be visible to all men that are not willingly blinde, that this man was a true and infallible Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sent from God? Which would be a very forcible battery laid against their <hi>outward</hi> senses.</p>
               <p n="13">13. But being that this had been the sadder message by how much more they had been ascertain'd it had been true, <hi>That they must forsake the exorbitant pleasures of the</hi> Animal Life, <hi>and keep close up to the</hi> Divine; it was also requisite that they might be assured of a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Reward for so great an Agony as they were to undergoe in morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying &amp; castigating their natural or habitual desires, and betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the streighter way. And therefore it is fit that that Truth that

is so obscure and incredible to the generality of men, should be made grosly manifest to the meanest capacities; I mean <hi>the Reward of a blessed Immortality after this Life, and the regaining of Heaven or Paradise which lapsed Mankind had lost.</hi> The Certainty whereof I cannot tell how it may be better assured to them, then by the witness of one whom we are sure is infallible, and who saies expressly that he came from <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 1. Chap. 8. sect. 5, 6.</note> thence, and after Death is to go thither again, and does not only tell the World so, but proves it to outward sight, he being raise out of his Grave after he was perfectly dead, and ascending into the Heavens where flesh and bloud cannot inhabit. Which is a visible Demonstration of the Soul's Immortality, and as feelingly accommodate to the slowest appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, as if some man, of whose honesty the people were indubitably assured, should descend from some high Hill, where none of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try had had the hap to have been as yet, and should tell them what pleasant Woods and Groves there were there, full of all manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Fruit, a true terrestrial Paradise, and that it was not so steep or inaccessible as they imagined; and therewith should return thither in the very sight of those that questioned the Matter. <hi>This consideration would reach their very inward Reason and indispensable Interest.</hi> For they that are the lowest lapsed, are not fallen from the sense of their own good, and from a desire of everlasting happiness if they find it possible.</p>
               <p n="14">14. This were enough to make mankinde weary of the Devil's Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical yoke. But in all revolts there ought to be some Head; and no person is so fit for such a purpose as he who is able to reward his followers, whose Vertues are eminently opposite to the Vices of the Tyrant, and whose Rule, when he is installed, will as little thwart the usual or natural and innocent propensions of the People as may be.</p>
               <p>Wherefore whereas the Devil's Government is notorious for unspea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Pride, Insolency and Cruelty to Mankind; (as has been at large discovered in those bloudy sacrificings and despightfully misusings of men in a way of Superstition, which no man can doubt to have any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Author then Satan himself) the Head of this warrantable Revolt must be singularly kind and tenderly and affectionately loving and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate to the Generations of men, as also very humble and lowly, and be so far from requiring such abominable and bloudy homages as the sacrificing of men to him, that he would willingly lay down his life for their sake. Which must needs prove an unspeakable endearment of the affections of his followers to him, and raise in them a more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment detestation of the Devil's Tyranny. But because Love is ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual that has no power of doing good, this Head becomes the more perfectly compleat, if he be found not only so Kind as to be willing to lay down his life for his Subjects, but also to be able to save them from all the inconveniences that opposite Power intangled them in, whose wages were no better then Eternal death; and therefore it was fitting that he should have a power from God of giving Everlasting Life and crowning them with a blessed Immortality at the last day, and of saving them from that general Destruction that will in time seize as well on the rebellious Angels as the unreclaimed Souls of men.</p>

Lastly, Those natural &amp; innocent Propensions of Mankind are gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in this Head we speak of, if there be such Properties in him as are sutable to their Opinions, Practices and Desires, in matters of Religion. And we know by History that the Heathen were very prone to suspect those that were their eminent Benefactors to have been born of more then humane Race; and that they had so high sense of Gratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, that they Deified them after their Deaths, and did them divine Honour.

               <p n="16">16. This is a short Review of the more Intelligible part of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; the <hi>Reasonableness</hi> whereof I take to be such, that I dare appeal to the judgment of any, if it be not so worthy of the Divine Wisdome and Goodness, and so fitly suited unto the nature and condition of things and the state of men upon earth, that it is indispensable but that Providence some time or other should send into the world such a <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Redeemer</hi> of his People out of the Captivity of the Devil, as we have described: who having declared the Promises of Eternal life to his faithful Followers, and so raised himself a party against the Powers of the <hi>Dark Kingdome,</hi> should exercise the Creation with this noble and high-concerning Conflict, and after a due time of trial of the Faith, Resolution, Constancy, Love, and Obedience of his Adherents, return visibly again at last, according to promise, giving Victory, Peace and a Blessed Immortality to his own, and pouring down Wrath and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance and utter Destruction upon his implacable and contemptuous Enemies. This Providential Contrivance, I say, looking upon it in the <hi>Idea,</hi> is so Congruous and Rational, that there is no wise and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man but will easily assent, that it will some time or other be set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot in the World. But I shall now endeavour to make good That it is already on foot, and that this Period of Providence is begun in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> the Son of God and of the blessed Virgin: that is, That our Christian Religion, as it relates to the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ, according as I have propounded it and displaied it in the main Branches thereof, is not a mere <hi>Idea,</hi> but a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>actual Truth.</hi> Which I think will be sufficiently demonstrated, if I prove <hi>That the expected Messias is come,</hi> and <hi>That the Writings of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament are true.</hi> For nothing then can defeat our design, unlesse

Of this you may read more fully in his first Exhortation, Chap. 15. and 16. Which Ugly and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Character he gives of all Christians besides his own Family (who yet are indeed (as you shall hear anon) no Christians at all) must needs imbitter the Spirits of his professed Followers, and envenome them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all measure against the Ministry of the Gospel according to the <hi>Letter</hi> thereof. Which yet clearly enough sets out to us the History of Christ, his Promises and Precepts; neither is there any Mystical mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that is true, that is not literally set down in the Text. So that all their boast is but of Allusions and Phrases, nor can they produce any thing that is not already plainly before our eyes in the <hi>Letter</hi> it self.

Which is the greatest Tyranny and Slavery upon the Soul of man that can be devised, and a shrewd Indication that those Elders will approve and advise things against express Scripture, Reason and Conscience. And thus is many a poor simple Lamb catched out of the Fold of Christ, and carried quite away without recovery into the

               <p>Which he does by intercepting all aid that the use of Reason and the Knowledge of the Scripture could administer, giving them such hard lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as we have above recited; the civilest aspersion he bestows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>Imagination of the Knowledge:</hi> but magnifying himself and his <hi>Service of the Love,</hi> that is, his own Doctrine, above whatever yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to the sons of men, as you shall now hear.</p>

He calls also this his <hi>Service</hi> of the Love the <hi>Last Day,</hi> and the <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Conclusion</hi> of all the works of God.

               <p n="1">1. BUT enough has been related to shew that transcendent esteem this <hi>Enthusiast</hi> had both of himself, and also would insinuate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, of his own <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Let us now consider what <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Ground</hi> he had to assume so much to himself, or others may have to attribute so much unto him. And to bring all the Inducements imaginable into view; This high conceit of his of being so superemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a Person, must arise either from the <hi>Matter</hi> he does deliver, or his <hi>Eloquence,</hi> or the <hi>Raptures</hi> he was in when he penn'd down his Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (as he would have them thought) or from the <hi>Mysteriousness</hi> of his <hi>Allegories,</hi> or from his <hi>Evangelizing the Perfection,</hi> or lastly for that he was <hi>prophesied of</hi> in the Scriptures, as he in whom all things should be fulfilled.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now for the main <hi>Matter</hi> he delivers plainly and above-bord, it is the <hi>excellency of Love.</hi> Which is so Essential a Truth to Christianity, <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 8. ch. 2. ad 13.</note> and plainly inculcated in the Gospel, and so effectually recommended, that there is no true Christian can miss of it. So that we need no new Instructer in that divine Grace, much less any <hi>inspired Prophet</hi> to teach us what is so plain to us already. And therefore if there be any thing new in this doctrine of <hi>Love,</hi> it must be such a kind of <hi>Love</hi> that is new to Christians, I mean to true Christians; but not to the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> nor the School of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who spoke as magnificently of himself as this Impostor can do possibly. And for his <hi>Scriptural Eloquence,</hi> his <hi>Raptures</hi> and <hi>Transportations</hi> in the penning down his Writings, how that such things arise frequently from Nature and Complexion, is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared in my <hi>Enthusiasmus Triumphatus:</hi>

For making this a mere Representation of something to be performed within us, namely his <hi>Crucifixion,</hi> of our <hi>mortifying</hi> of the old man, his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> of our <hi>rising</hi> to newness of life, his <hi>Ascension into Heaven</hi> and sitting at the right hand of God, of our entrance into and rule and reign in the Heavenly Being with Christ in the Spirit, and his <hi>Returning to Iudgement,</hi> the judging and governing our natural and earthly man with Righteousness and Equity (which Allegories, or rather not so good, is the deepest Wisdome and divinest Revelation that is to be found in this admired Prophet) such <hi>Allusions,</hi> I say, and <hi>Similitudes</hi> as these have no more force nor effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to urge us, or help us on to those Accomplishments they represent, then if the <hi>History</hi> of Christ were a mere Fable. But if, in stead of making them <hi>Resemblances,</hi> we should use them as <hi>Arguments from a true History,</hi> they have a power unspeakable for the making us good. <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 8. Chap. 16.</note> For thus any ingenuous Spirit would melt into remorse, when he considers how the Son of God, out of mere love and compassion to him, was crucified for him; and thereby will willingly submit to all the pain of <hi>Mortification</hi> in a kindly Gratitude to his Saviour: <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 8. Chap. 17.</note> And from the belief of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of Christ from the dead, will be the further animated in his pursuance of the Resurrection to an holy life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assured of Eternal enjoyment of his labours by a blessed Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; of which also His <hi>Ascension</hi> into Heaven is a further pledge, and his <hi>sitting at the right hand of God</hi> the greater motive to take off his mind from earthly desires, and to think of those things that are above. <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 8. Chap. 18.</note> And lastly, his certain hope of obtaining that crown of glory which Christ the righteous Judge shall give unto him at the last day (I mean that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and Heavenly Body) will be the greatest ingagement imaginable to spend the strength of his natural body in his service, to expose it to all hardships, yea to death it self, if need so require, for the honour of his Saviour; and in the mean time to possess it in all Sanctity possible, in a gratefull observance of his commands from whom we expect the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of our Bodies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wherefore the <hi>Literal</hi> meaning of the <hi>History</hi> of Christ being so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and effectual to the making of us good, it is a sign of a great deal of folly and levity to dote upon mere <hi>Allegories</hi> and Allusions, that have no force at all in them to move us to Godliness and Vertue; or to surmise that there is any thing Spiritual or Divine in the mere <hi>allegorizing</hi> of the Scripture. For there is nothing <hi>Divine,</hi> saving our full assurance of the holy Truths themselves that are delivered in the Gospel, whether they be <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>History,</hi> for this is a spiritual gift indeed. But that we conceive that one may represent the other, that is only the natural Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of our Phansy, or a Dexterity accruing to us from Use and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; such as I question not but was in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who was brought up a <hi>Pharisee,</hi> &amp; the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:55305:141"/>
such applications in the <hi>New.</hi> But this was no such special Inspiration or peculiar spiritual Attainment in him above the rest of the Apostles, but merely a Cast of his Office, a <hi>Specimen</hi> of his former Education, which accustomed him to Allusions and Allegories in the interpreting of the Law. So that I much pity those poor <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 10. chap. 13. sect. 5.</note> souls that are so transported and overcome with those Allusions and Allegorical Reflexions, as such high Attainments, that they think themselves illuminated above the capacities of all other Mortals, being more pleased with the gaudy colours of the Rainbow then with the pure light which is reflected thence: Which yet all true Christians plainly see and feel in the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of its own nature, without any such cloudy refractions; and know that the rest is not the dictate of the Spirit, but the mere service of Phansy lending its aid to the setting forth of divine Perceptions. And yet this slight sallad is the chief food this pretended Prophet feeds his followers withall, and the greatest demonstration of his being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily called and inspired.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For as for <hi>Miracles,</hi> he never did any, as you may see in that Book of his Life entituled <hi>Mirabilia Dei,</hi> where nothing miraculous is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, unless a certain Prophetical Dream, wherein he seemed to be frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, together with some devotional expressions after he awakened out of it; as also a lucky escape out of the hands of his Persecutors, who haply being not so vigilant as they might be, the phrase of the story makes them struck with blindness; and lastly his witty questions and answers to the Priest or Confessor when he was a child: wherein he does so fully utter the chief of his Doctrine, that he seems as wise at eight years old as ever he was since, though he lived to a very considerable Age. But any one that has any insight in things may easily discern that the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course was never intended for a true <hi>History,</hi> but a spiritual <hi>Romance.</hi> So that as petty businesses as these are, they have no assurance of their truth.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now for his Pretensions of being the most eminent <hi>Preacher of Perfection,</hi> it is a mere Boast. For whether he means by <hi>Perfection, Love,</hi> which is the perfection of the Law, it cannot be more clearly and advantageously preached then it is in the New Testament by Christ and his Apostles. <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 8. ch. 2. sect. 3.</note> And what Comparison is there betwixt such a Teacher of Love, who being the declared Son of God by Signes and Miracles, gave his life out of dear compassion to mankind, and a soft Fellow that onely talks fine phrases to the World? Or whether he pretend to a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Perfection</hi> in the divine Graces or holy Life, whose Root is true <hi>Faith in God</hi> and his Promises through Christ, and the branches <hi>Charity, Humility</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi>; it shall appear anon, that as for <hi>true Faith</hi> he is perfectly fallen from it, and that he is as a dead tree pulled up from the root. And for the present it is evident also out of his own writings (not to charge him with accusations out of others) that he is far from being perfect either in <hi>Charity, Humility,</hi> or <hi>Purity.</hi> For what greater sign of <hi>Uncharitableness,</hi> then to charge all men that are not of his Communialty to be of the Synagogue of <hi>Satan</hi> and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Devil? and what greater <hi>Pride,</hi> then to prefer himself before <hi>Abraham, Moses</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> and make as if he were God himself come to
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:55305:142"/>
judge the World with his thousands of Saints and Seraphims? And lastly, what greater Symptoms of <hi>Lust</hi> &amp; <hi>Impurity,</hi> then to be sunk down from all sense and presage of a life to come? To say nothing of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, in his <hi>Glasse of Righteousness,</hi> of such as came in to spy out their liberty, <note n="*" place="margin">See his <hi>Glasse of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> Book 3. Chap. 26.</note> and his lusty animations against Shamefacedness and Modesty in men and women, and their shiness to such acts as ordinary Bashfulness is loath to name. Which in my apprehension are very foul spots in that Glasse of his, as if it had been breathed upon by the mouth of a menstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Woman.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But there is also a more subtil Uncleanness, from which who is not free, if he knew his own weakness, he would be ashamed to profess him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>perfect</hi>; and that is the Impurity of the <hi>Astral Spirit,</hi> in which is the Seat and Dominion of unruly Imagination. Hence are our <hi>Sidereal</hi> or <hi>Planet-strucken</hi> Preachers and Prophets, who being first blasted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, blast all others that labour with the like impurity, by their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick</hi> Contagion. Those in whom <hi>Mortification</hi> has not had its full work, nor refined the <hi>Inmost</hi> of their natural Complexions, are subject to be smitten and overcome by such <hi>Enthusiastick storms,</hi> till a more perfect Purification commit them to the safe custody of the <hi>Intellectual Powers.</hi> Wherefore let this pretended Prophet boast as much as he will of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Resurrection</hi> from the dead, it is manifest to the more perfect, that he has not yet so much as passed through that <hi>Death</hi> that should have led him to the unshaken Kingdome of Truth, and letten him in to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable Calmness and serene stilness of the <hi>Intellectual World,</hi> where the Blasts and Blusters of the <hi>Astral Spirit</hi> cease, and the Violence of Phansy perverts not the faithful representations of <hi>Eternal Reason.</hi> For God is not in these fanatick <hi>Herricanoes,</hi> no more then he was in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous Wind,<note place="margin">1 King. 19.12.</note> Earthquake, or Fire that passed before the Prophet <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as.</hi> But the <hi>Divine Truth</hi> is to be found in that still small voice, which is the <hi>Echo</hi> of the <hi>Eternal Word</hi>; not urg'd upon us by that furious Impulse of complexionall Imagination, but descending from the Father of lights, with whom there is no shadow of change. This was an Attainment out of this Boasters reach, of which he had not the least sense or presage, and therefore was wholy given up to the hot scalding Impressions of misgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Phansy</hi> in his <hi>Astral Spirit.</hi> Which being strangely raised and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this false light, has a power by words or writings to fire others, and to intoxicate them with the same heat and noise in their enravished Imagination, whereby that still and small voice of <hi>Incomplexionate Reason</hi> cannot be heard.</p>

Nicolas,</hi> he being a mere mistaken <hi>Enthusiast,</hi> or worse.</head>
               <p n="1">1. AND therefore being blinded with the wind and dust of this Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Tempest, they are carried on to so great a piece of Folly, as to fansy this mistaken Wight so Sacred and Divine a person as to be prophesied of in the Holy Scriptures. But the places that are alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged are so weakly and ineptly applied, that it is a further confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their being strangely hood-winked and held down with an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing effascination and witchcraft. For how vain a thing is it to make this <hi>Man</hi> that <hi>Angel</hi> that <hi>preached the Everlasting Gospel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Revel. chap. 14. v. 6.</note> whenas that Angelical Preachment was at least seven or eight hundred years before he lived, according to all those Interpreters that have endeavoured to give a solid and coherent account of S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Prophecy? But this is more then I need attempt, (or it may be can be done) to confute this assertion by Chronological demonstration. It is sufficient to note that it is groundless, a mere phansy unbacked by Reason and Argument; whenas on the contrary there is evident Reason against it; This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whom they so much adore being rather a <hi>Decryer</hi> of the Everlasting Gospel then a <hi>Preacher</hi> of it, as shall appear in due time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second conceit of his being prophesied of in Scripture is fixt upon that of S. John 1. verse 21. where they would have him to be <hi>That Prophet,</hi> viz. an eminent Prophet distinct from <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Christ.</hi> But it is very discernable how weak an Alledgement this is. For first, if there were such an eminent Prophet expected distinct from <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> it does not follow it is he. And then again, this expectation of the Jewes is no Divine Testimony. And thirdly, as some Interpreters have noted, they expected him before the coming of <hi>Elias,</hi> as <hi>Elias</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of Christ.<note place="margin">See <hi>Grotius</hi> upon the place.</note> Others understood by <hi>That Prophet</hi> the Prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> who is styled <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>That Prophet of God.</hi> And lastly, amongst the rest that excellent Critick and pious Interpreter <hi>Castellio</hi> renders it simply, <hi>a prophet,</hi> the sense being, <hi>At least art thou a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet?</hi> See <hi>Castellio</hi> upon the place. So many weaknings are there of this groundless Fiction of his being prophesied of in this place of Scripture.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But I shall produce a Third place, and that of his own chusing, Acts 17. where <hi>God is said to have appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 17. v. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</hi> This shameless <hi>Enthusiast</hi> does not stick to apply to himself this place, as if he were the man prophesied of therein. Whenas it is manifest it
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:55305:143"/>
is meant of the Person of Christ, whom God had corporeally raised from the Grave, as a palpable Pledge and Assurance that the World should be judged by him according to the Scriptures, Math. 25.31. But suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the meaning to be that which this fanatick Boaster would have it, see what sense it will make with the preceding verse, which would be this, <hi>That God now commands all men every where to repent,</hi> namely, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi> 1500 <hi>years hence he will raise up</hi> H. Nicolas <hi>from the dead,</hi> in a moral sense, <hi>who shall judge the world by his doctrine.</hi> What Bedlam Madness is this to vent such Expositions of the Holy Writ upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of higher Inspiration then ever was yet in the World? The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's exhortation would be as wild sense as if one should earnestly cry unto the people walking in <hi>Paul</hi>'s to run out of the Church as fast as they can, because it is ready one thousand five hundred years hence to fall down upon their heads.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That I may not omit any places that they alledge, I will adde also 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. v. 9, 10. <hi>For we know in part, and we prophesy in part: But when that which is perfect is come then that which is imperfect shall be done away.</hi> And <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. v. 1, 2. <hi>Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of Repentance from dead works, and of Faith toward God, of the doctrine of Baptisme, laying on of hands, and of the Resurrection of the dead, and of the Eternal judgement.</hi> From these two places they are wont to gather that the Doctrine of Christ is imperfect, and a more perfect Doctrine was to come, which is, say they, the Doctrine of <hi>Hen. Nicolas.</hi> Which argument is as weak and frivolous as blasphemous. For it is plain that in the former place he compares not any Doctrine to be set on foot on earth with the present Doctrine of Christ and knowledge of the Apostles, but the condition of the knowledge of the Christian Church in this life with that which she shall have in Heaven: and therefore he saith, <hi>Now I know in part, but then I shall know even as I am known.</hi> What, does S.<hi>Paul</hi> mean that he shall know nothing clear till <hi>H. Nicolas</hi> his time? O the madness and impudence of these giddy Interpreters! And to the latter Text; What, would they have us to let go our Christian Creed under pretence of a new Doctrine which is more perfect? Yea certainly they would so, as will appear more plainly anon. But how shamefully they abuse this Scripture to that execrable end, is evident from the following verse, <hi>And this will we do, if God permit.</hi> That is, The Apostle himself will deliver that doctrine of <hi>Perfection</hi> he mentions in the first verse; and therefore it is no Prophecy of the Doctrine of <hi>H. Nicolas,</hi> but a more exquisite Declaration of the excellency of Christs Priesthood; which is too long and too accurate to fill a short Creed. But what pittiful shifts are these deluded Fanaticks put to, when they have no better Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements then these for their rebellious Errours against Christ?</p>
               <p n="5">5. I shall conclude my examination of their grounds of believing this <hi>Fanatick</hi> so great and eminent a Prophet, with something a more trim conceit of his followers, whereby they would countenance their high opinion they have of him, which is hinted also from himself; namely, That the <hi>Series</hi> of Times and Providence seem to give witness to the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:55305:143"/>
mighty Professions he makes of his own Ministry. For as there was for a time a Service of the <hi>Law</hi> under <hi>God the Father,</hi> and then a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the <hi>Belief</hi> under <hi>Christ the Son</hi>; so likewise the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> must have his turn and have his Service: and what Service can that be, but <hi>the Service of the Love?</hi> To which I answer, That if they speak this in good earnest in reference to the three <hi>Hypostases</hi> of the ever-Blessed <hi>Trinity,</hi> it is plain that that Mystery was not communicated to the World under the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> but concealed in the hidden <hi>Cabbala</hi> among the Wise men and Prophets, not to be published till Christ; for the better clearing and fitter recommending the Theory of his Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Eternal Word. With the appearance therefore of Christ, with whom all the fulness of Divine Wisdome was to be imparted to men, a distincter knowledge of the Deity and clearer assurance of the Immortality of the Soul (the main Branches of the ancient <hi>Cabbala</hi>) was also communicated. But it is no where said, nor can be conceived, That <hi>God the Father</hi> distinctly from the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> gave the <hi>Law</hi> to <hi>Moses</hi>; but it was an act, as all acts <hi>ad extra</hi> are, of the entire God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. Nor is the <hi>Father</hi> nor the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> excluded in the oeconomie of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> but their Glory is acknowledged coequal and their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty coeternal. Nor again can the Church ever cease to be under the <hi>Belief</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> so as that any other <hi>God-service</hi> should justle that out by its succession. For the <hi>Belief</hi> of the Promises of Christs coming again visibly to Judgement and Crowning his true members with Eternal Life and Glory, must of necessity continue till the Promises themselves be <hi>fulfilled:</hi> Which are but phantastically conceived to be fulfilled in <hi>the Service of the Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Moreover how can that <hi>Dispensation</hi> pretend to be the <hi>Ministry of the Spirit,</hi> where men are kept off from believing the inward manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations of their own Mind (where alone they can be properly said to <hi>be taught of God</hi>) and urged to give up all their Light and Consciences to be rul'd at the pleasure of the Elders of his Family? This is not to be inspired by God, but to be taught merely by men, and to be carved and shaped out like a piece of dead Marble by the hand of the Statuary. So wholy unlike <hi>the Dispensation of the Spirit</hi> is this Oeconomie of <hi>the Service of the Love.</hi> Beside that it is a piece of Rapine and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to appropriate that to their Family which is the Peculiar of every true Believer in Christ, who assuredly have the assistance of the Holy Spirit, <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 8. ch. 8. and 9.</note> as I have proved at large in the following parts of my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But if any one will adventure to affirme, That after this <hi>dead Forme</hi> of Religion and <hi>external flattery</hi> of the Person of Christ, which has continued too-many Ages, there will succeed <hi>a more general Reign of the Spirit of Life and experimental knowledge of his Sceptre and Power in us,</hi> subduing all his enemies there under his feet, and renewing the World in true Righteousness and Holiness; it is that which I in no wise oppose; nay I must confess I have a fatal and unalterable propension to think it to be true, and that this may be that <hi>Regnum Spiritús</hi> which the <hi>Cabbalists</hi> of old did presage, and does begin with <hi>the Reviving of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:55305:144"/>
the Witnesses</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> of S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> Of which things I have <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 5. Chap. 17. sect. 8.</note> already spoke. But in the mean time this is not the special work of any one man, but like the Vision of <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> where Breath comes from the four Winds of Heaven upon the bones already covered with sinews, flesh and skin; and behold they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceeding great Army: an orderly Company, such as the Church of Christ ought to be. For this Internal power of the Spirit will not annul or destroy the External Frame of Christian Religion, as it referrs to the Offices of the Person of Christ, the Head of his Church, (as these <hi>Satanical</hi> Impostors would pretend) but rectifie and corroborate it, and make it more irreprehensibly and enravishingly beautifull; as there was more lustre in those raised Bodies after the Spirit of life had entred into them, then when they were mere dead carkasses.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Besides, if we did conceive that this Dispensation of Christ in the Spirit was to be in a more special manner promoted by the Ministry of some one Person, it does not at all follow that <hi>H. Nicolas</hi> is the man; and not onely so, but I am confident I shall make it manifest that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that it should be he. Which I shall have sufficiently performed, when I have demonstrated that he is nothing at all of that which he pretends to be, but only a mere <hi>mistaken Enthusiast,</hi> if not worse; which was the last part of my Purpose. And this I conceive is fully evinced by proving him to have laid aside all the Offices of the Person of Christ, as he is <hi>Man,</hi> and intercepted all the hopes of his Visible Return to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the clouds of Heaven, and of rewarding all true Believers with that glorious Crown of Life in an Heavenly Body at the last day. Which things are so clear in Scripture, that the Scripture it self must loose its authority if these things once loose their belief, as is manifest by what we have said <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 1.</note> already in this present Treatise. And therefore he that denies these things, it is plain he is not inspired of God, but is a Minister and Factor for the Devil.</p>

                  <hi>that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest, in things appertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people: For in that he himself hath suffered, being tempted, he is able to succour them that tempted.</hi> And it is further clear that it is <hi>this very man</hi> we speak of, in that he is said to <hi>be born</hi> not of <hi>the Tribe of Levi,</hi> but of <hi>the Tribe of Iuda,</hi> chap. 7.14. and yet he is there declared <hi>a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</hi> Read the whole Chapter; nothing can be more clearly asserted then the Everlasting high-Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>this man,</hi> who sanctifying the People <hi>with his bloud,</hi> suffered <hi>without the gate.</hi> Which are such particularities as must needs affix the Eternal high-Priesthood to the Humane person of Christ.</p>

                  <hi>which are the figures of the true; but into Heaven it self, now to appear in the presence of God for us. Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entreth into the holy place every year with bloud of others. For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the World. But now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgement: So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sin unto salvation.</hi> To which you may adde that of <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.18.</note> 
                  <hi>For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God.</hi> And 1 John 2.1. <hi>If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Iesus Christ the Righteous, and he is a propitiation for our sins.</hi> And if he was so in S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s time, why not alwaies?</p>
               <p>Furthermore, <hi>Romans</hi> 5.6. <hi>For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</hi> He saies not, <hi>by the ungodly,</hi> but, <hi>for the ungodly</hi>: which therefore cannot be allegorized but into Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense. Like that, verse 10. <hi>For if when we were enemies, we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God by the Death of his Son.</hi> Is any one reconciled by killing the Holy Life, the Mystical Christ in him? Wherefore it is plain that in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time the Humane Person of Christ was the high Priest who was an Atonement with God by the sacrifice of himself. And God has not declared any where that he has or ever will put him out of his Office, till his coming again to Iudgement, when he <hi>shall appear the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, without sin unto Salvation,</hi> as you heard out of the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>; that is, When he shall not bring his sin-offering with him, viz. an earthly, mortal body, capable of Crucifixion, but shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as a glorious Judge to complete <hi>Salvation</hi> to all them that truely believe in him, and expect his joyful coming; at what time he shall finish the Redemption of our Bodies, and translate us to his everlasting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And that this Office of a <hi>Iudge</hi> is assured to his Humane person, is
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:55305:145"/>
plain from what we recited out of the Acts: namely, <hi>That God has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven assurance to all men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 17. v. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>that he will judge the world by the man Jesus, in that he has raised him</hi> so miraculously <hi>from the dead.</hi> Which is that very Son of man that shall appear on his throne accompanied with his Angels, Matth. 25. And assuredly none will deny but that he who sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth at the right hand of God, will come thence to judge the quick and the dead: But it is this <hi>crucified Iesus,</hi> that for the joy that was set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God, Hebr. 12.2. To which truth S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> also witnesseth in the Acts.<note place="margin">Acts 3.13, 21.</note> Where <hi>that very Iesus</hi> whom the Jews delivered up and denied in the presence of <hi>Pilate,</hi> is said to be received into Heaven, until the time of Restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of his holy Prophets since the World began. This implies that at the utmost fulfilling of the Periods of time he will again appear and finish the Mysterie of Righteousness, and perfect Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his people at the last, according as he has promised, John 6. <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father, which has sent me, draw him; and I will raise him up at the last day.</hi> Which certainly is to be understood of his Humane person, forasmuch as for that very cause he has made him Judge of Life and Death, as appears Chap. 5. ver. 26. <hi>For as the Father hath life in himself, so likewise he hath given to the Son to have life in himself; and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</hi> Now when he saith, <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father draw him,</hi> it is manifest, that by <hi>the Father</hi> is meant the <hi>Eternal hidden Deity,</hi> whose workings and preparations within every mans Soul fit him to join with <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>humane person,</hi> the visible Head of the Church of God: otherwise if by <hi>Christ</hi> were here understood the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word,</hi> it would not be good sense. For that is that which draws, not the thing drawn to, in this place. Again, whereas he saies, <hi>He will raise him up at the last day,</hi> it is evident that it is not <hi>morally</hi> or <hi>mystically</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, but <hi>literally</hi>; otherwise it could not be defer'd till the last day, but should be done in this Life. Nor can it be understood of <hi>the day of the service of the Love:</hi> For then the sense would be, That they that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on Christ some sixteen hundred years agoe, should become <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi> now, or rather some others for them; which Promises are insipid and ridiculous. Wherefore it is <hi>this Son of man,</hi> to whom God hath also given power to execute judgment. And the very same certainly is he that is represented on the great white Throne, from whose face the Earth and Heaven fled away. Rev. 20. <hi>And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God: and the Bookes were opened, and another Book was opened which is the Book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in those Books, according to their works. And the Sea gave up the dead which were in it; and Death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. And Death and Hell were cast into the lake of fire. Hell,</hi> i. e. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is here <hi>the Region of the dead:</hi> and the whole frame and phrase of the matter here contain'd doth so plainly import that the Judgment is concerning those that are dead, whether drowned in the Sea, or buried
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:55305:145"/>
in their Graves, or in whatever other circumstances quitted this mortal life; that this truth of Christ's visible coming to Judgment cannot be concealed or eluded by any Allegorical fetches whatsoever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor have our inconsiderate Adversaries any thing to alledge for their rebellious despising of the Humane person of Christ, unless two or three grosly-mistaken places of Scripture. Such as Hebr. 11. v. 26. where <hi>Moses</hi> is said to <hi>esteem the reproach of Christ greater riches then the treasures in Aegypt</hi>; and Chap. 13. v. 8. <hi>Iesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.</hi> Out of which passages they phansie to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves such a Christ only as was as well in <hi>Moses</hi>'s time as now, and was ever the same from the beginning of the World and ever will be. But they plainly in these Texts raise Mountains of Molehills. For the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and genuine sense of the former is nothing but this, That <hi>Moses</hi> bare such reproaches as Christ and the firm professors of Christ bear, which he uses as an argument of Patience to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> from the example of <hi>Moses:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See Book 1. chap. 8. sect. 4, 5, 6.</note> unless you will interpret the place upon the supposition of Christ being the Prefect of <hi>Israel</hi> before his Incarnation. But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sense is more plain and passable. And for the other place, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an exhortation to Perseverance from the constancy of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Rulers and Governours who persisted in their Faith to the end: and the Apostle tells them hereupon that the Faith is the same still, and Christ's assistance the same now that it was then to them, and will be ever the same to all true Believers. Which surely is all that is meant by Jesus Christ <hi>the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.</hi> For to make <hi>yesterday</hi> to signifie <hi>from everlasting,</hi> is very rash and cross to the phrase of Scripture, Psal. 90. <hi>For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday</hi>; and Job 8. <hi>For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing.</hi> Which is very true of these new upstart Interpreters.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But their last and most plausible allegation is that out of the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, <hi>Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.16.</note> 
                  <hi>yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet know we him so no more.</hi> Here they think they have full commission to lay aside the Humane person of Christ from the Example of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> But their mistake is in not knowing the Hebrew Idiom of this place of Scripture. For as that excellent Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> has noted, the words are to be rendred, <hi>yea though we might have known Christ after the flesh,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Though I with others might have known Christ after the flesh, and conversed with him here upon earth, nay have been something a-kin to him,</hi> as certain boasted themselves it seems at <hi>Corinth, yet henceforth,</hi> saith he, <hi>we should know him after this manner no more,</hi> but as an Heavenly Prince: in whom he has the most interest, that is the most nearly renewed into the image of his life. Or without this <hi>Hebraisme,</hi> It may be an oblique Monition to the aforesaid persons, and have rather the nature of an Exhortation to them, then of a Declaration concerning himself; which they would be more certainly enforced to take to themselves, by how much more plain it was that <hi>Paul</hi> never knew Christ according to the Flesh. That it has some such meaning as this, and not that of our Adversaries, is plain from the precedent verse, where he expresly retains the Humane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:55305:146"/>
of Christ in his Priestly office: For that he saith, that <hi>he is that one man that died for all,</hi> (not <hi>killed by all,</hi> as I noted above) <hi>that they who live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him that died for them and rose again.</hi> Which is not sense, if it be not understood of the Humane person of Christ. And verse 20 he does plainly profess him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Ambassadour of the crucified <hi>Iesus,</hi> or <hi>Legate</hi> of the great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Covenant; <hi>Now then we are Ambassadours for Christ, as if God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him.</hi> Of which there can be no possible meaning that excludes the Humane person of Christ from his Priestly office. We have therefore abundantly demonstrated That the Person of our Saviour is not to be laide aside, but that he is a Priest for ever according to the Scriptures.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. <hi>1.</hi> That <hi>Hen.

               <p n="1">1. WE shall now make it as evident that this pretended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet we speak of does lay him aside, whereby we shall clearly convince the World of his falshood and imposture. And this shall be chiefly out of his own Writings. Out of which we shall first produce such passages as in a more general manner infer what we aim at. As certainly such places doe, as expresly declare <hi>That whatsoever is taught of Christ out of his Communialty of the Love, is all false.</hi> Whence it does plainly appear, That the Articles of the Apostles Creed under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood according to the <hi>Letter,</hi> are held false by this inspired <hi>Communial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>: For these Articles are taught by them that are not of <hi>Hen. Nicolas</hi> his Family. In his <hi>First Exhortation</hi> Chap. 5. he plainly declares, That the true Belief in Jesus Christ is not to be found in any people upon Earth that walk without the <hi>Communialty of the Love.</hi> And Chap. 16. Sect. 15, 16. he tels us, <hi>That it is a presumption against God and his Saints, that any one out of the Learnedness of the Letter, or out of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination of the Knowledge, taketh upon him to be a Teacher or Preacher, or to institute or intermeddle in any God-service or Worship, unless he be an illuminated Elder of the house of the Love.</hi> And Sect. 17. He does affirm
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:55305:146"/>
                  <hi>That it is all assuredly false and lies, seducing and deceitfull, whatever is taught by others out of the Learnedness of the Scripture.</hi> Again, in his <hi>Evangely,</hi> Chap. 32. there also he asserts, <hi>That to those that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Family of Love, all the matters of Christianity to them are in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, Figures and Shadows, in Similitudes, Parables and closed Books.</hi> Where his meaning is easily understood out of Chap. 30. sect. 17. For these Figures he makes <hi>Shadows of the true and spiritual things which were heretofore, through Iesus Christ, come to pass, seen, heard and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and have stood for a memorial of the true spiritual things which should, in the time to come, come to pass,</hi> namely by this <hi>inspired Minister.</hi> Whereby the <hi>History</hi> of Christ is made a mere <hi>Allegory</hi> and prophetick Prefiguration of what is fulfilled in his Dispensation of <hi>the Communialty of the Love:</hi> wherein all becomes fulfilled in Christ, whatsoever was written of him, as he plainly asserts Chap. 1. sect. 10. And he more abundantly declares himself in his Prophecie of the Spirit of Love, Chap. 13. <hi>That a man out of his natural and Scripture-learned under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing has not any light or knowledge at all of the Christian Mystery; yea he is so utterly void of the same, that he cannot understand the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest tittle thereof: he may indeed speak out of the written Word, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth nothing thereof according to the truth; but it is all covered and sealed before him in Similitudes, Images, Figures and Parables.</hi> Where again it is easie to infer, That this great Prophet holds nothing of the Articles of the Christian Faith to be true in that sense the <hi>Scripture-learned</hi> teach them: which is plainly to deny the <hi>History</hi> of Christ, and to profess our selves mere <hi>Infidels.</hi> Out of which <hi>Spirit of Infidelity</hi> he has so distortedly allegorized all the clauses of the Creed, that to such as are not bewitched and besotted by his <hi>fanatick blasts</hi> to a better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him then he deserves, he must needs appear an <hi>Infidel.</hi> Lastly, in his <hi>Introduction,</hi> Chap. 9. sect. 35. there again he does boldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, <hi>That it is certainly mere lies</hi> what the Letter-learned institute or set forth, how clear soever in understanding, if they be yet unreformed by the <hi>Love</hi> and her Service. And in the following Section he plainly declares, That the Scriptures are not to be taught nor held forth Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, but as Prefigurations of the Promises that are fulfilled in his <hi>Service of the Love.</hi> Whence it is evident he had no belief in the Letter of the Scripture, nor of the miraculous History of Christ, and of the Predictions concerning him, whereby our Faith should be affixed to his Humane Person. Against which he useth all diligence imaginable, as if not simple <hi>Care</hi> but an <hi>inspired</hi> Envy or <hi>Satanical</hi> Spite against the honour of his Person did actuate him in all his Writings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To which purpose,<note place="margin">Chap. 12. sect. 14.</note> I conceive, is that Caution in his <hi>Introduction, That no man bind his heart to any outward thing, which he is served with to the Righteousness of life.</hi> For of all <hi>outward things</hi> nothing can be more serviceable then the Humane Person of Christ, who suffered for us and redeemed us from the wrath to come, if we stand faithfull in the Covenant.<note place="margin">Introduct. ch. 13.27.</note> Those places also where he saith, <hi>That the Godly life is the very Saviour himself; and that no man knows Christ nor can confess him, unless his shape be in him,</hi> that is, his Life and Image be in him, seem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:55305:147"/>
as justling against the External Person of Christ; as also what he saith Chap. 22. namely, <hi>That no other Foundation may be laid then that Iesus Christ who from everlasting was, and is, and abideth for ever:</hi> whereby I doubt not but he intends the exclusion of his Humane Person, whose compute began but about 16 hundred years agoe. But the most wonderfull sleight he puts him off by, is his Mystical meaning of Christ's celebration of the Passeover with his Disciples. Which we shall easily understand, if we take notice what he means by <hi>Flesh</hi> in his Writings, namely, by <hi>Flesh</hi> is meant the <hi>Letter</hi> or <hi>History.</hi> In his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of the Spirit of Love,</hi> Chap. 13. ver. 4. <hi>Verily therefore they do all erre very much that judge according to their understanding (out of the earthly Being, or out of the Flesh or Letter) God's truth, which is Heavenly and Spiritual.</hi> See also <hi>Introduct.</hi> ch. 14. sect. 20. Now if you will but read his <hi>Evangely,</hi> chap. 21. sect. 3, 7, 8, 10. also chap. 22. sect. 5, 6. and chap. 25. sect. 1, 2. you shall find in brief (for it were too tedious to write these allegorical Ambages) that the right Celebration of the <hi>Pascha</hi> or <hi>Passeover</hi> with Christ is, That he (namely, <hi>Christ after the Flesh,</hi> they are his own words) should be slain, that is, that <hi>Christ ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Letter or History should be abolished, that he may be entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned only according to the Spirit.</hi> Which is the great <hi>Arcanum</hi> of this Sect of the <hi>Family. Behold,</hi> saith he, <hi>this is the right</hi> Passeover <hi>with Christ, and the right Supper which the upright Believers and Disciples of Christ keep with Christ,</hi> to wit, <hi>that they depart even so with Christ out of the Flesh,</hi> (that is, that Christ according to the <hi>History</hi> or <hi>Letter</hi> be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or slain in them, that is, nullified and rejected as a mere Legend or Fable) <hi>and pass into the Spirit,</hi> (that is, the spiritual Mystery of Christ, the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Moral</hi> of the Fable) <hi>and out of the Death or Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,</hi> (that is, out of the dead Letter) <hi>into the Eternal Life of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Immortality.</hi> In which sonorous language that you may not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to your self any such lasting purchase, there is nothing meant but the <hi>state of Perfection</hi> which these <hi>Familists</hi> phansie to themselves here upon Earth, and is <hi>everlasting</hi> in no other sense then in succession, they promising themselves that their Sect will continue for ever; and therefore he adds, <hi>wherethrough sin and all destruction becomes van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished,</hi> namely by this <hi>state of Perfection,</hi> wherein sin and every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and destroyable state is swallowed up. For they having come to the highest, there is no change of things, though their persons be mortal, according to their own doctrine. This Allegorie of the Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is so odd a conceit, that did I not suppose the Author deeply Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, I should suspect it accompanied with a sly jearing and scorn against the History of Christ, and to be the product of a scoffing Atheistical Spirit. For no Atheist could exercise his wit here with more villainous sliness against the truth of the Scriptures then thus. Which makes me sometimes think that he was not <hi>simply Fanatical,</hi> but either <hi>Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical,</hi> or <hi>possessed by the Devil,</hi> himself in the mean time not knowing whose <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> he was.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And thus we have had a taste in general, how sedulously this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor endeavours to out the Person of Christ. We shall now pursue the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:55305:147"/>
matter in two main heads, the Office of his Priesthood, and his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming visibly to judgment in his Humane person. To which is annexed the promise of a glorious Resurrection, and Eternal Life, in a plain and true sense, without any shuffling or equivocating. That he makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the atonement of Christ's personal sufferings, he does in my judgment too plainly discover, chap. 13. sect. 8. of his <hi>Documental Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,</hi> where rather then he will acknowledg the usefulness of that <hi>Advocate with the Father, Iesus Christ the righteous, who is a propitiation for our sins,</hi> he does pronounce him that sins by violence or Temptation to be guiltless, as the ravished virgin Deuteronomie 22; that so there may be no need of Christ's Sacrifice, whose personal death and Priestly office he never takes notice of to this purpose: As you may observe further, <hi>Exhortat.</hi> chap. 20. from sect. 19 to the end of the chapter. Where although he supposes a mans stumblings and fallings daily very great and terrible before him, and that for that cause he is very wofull of heart, feels the pricking of sin, the darts of death, and condemnation of Hell, and so is in much anguish and affliction of mind; yet is there no application at all of the Sacrifice of Christ upon the <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 8. ch. 15, &amp; 16.</note> Cross, nor any help nor comfort at all held out by his sufferings, though it was the most proper place that could be to mention them. And chap. 24. in the praiers he puts up there, in stead of making use of the mediation of that Christ that felt the pains of death on the Cross for us, he makes use only of Gods supposed Promise or Covenant he has made with <hi>the House of the Love,</hi> sect. 3. and 7. See him also upon the Beatitudes sect. 6. And it is no wonder we hear nothing of that Reconciliation made by the Cross of Christ, for he does plainly aver, sect. 34. <hi>That the true being in the Love is that peace with God and man</hi> (mentioned Ephes. 2.14.) <hi>and the true Testament that standeth fast for ever.</hi> And <hi>Exhortation</hi> chap. 12.44. <hi>Remission of sins</hi> is gained only by submitting to the <hi>House of the Love</hi>: The same that <hi>David George</hi> boasted of his doctrine. <hi>Therefore my beloved children change ye not nor turn away your selves from the</hi> House of Love. <hi>For there is in the same the stool of grace, to an everlasting remission of sins over all such as cleave thereon, and to a peace and rest of the life to all such as humble them there-under.</hi> By such slips and omissions as these, those that are not very dull of perception may easily spel out his meaning. Which yet is more clear by other places of his <hi>Evangely,</hi> chap. 13. Where he setleth the Everlasting Priesthood not upon Christ's person, but makes this Kingly Priest no <hi>person</hi> at all, but a <hi>thing,</hi> a state or condition of him and his followers here upon earth. And therefore he calls there this mystical Christ, <hi>The Lords Sabbath, The seventh day in the Paradise of God, The perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> &amp;c. And chap. 22. he makes the entrance of Christ into heaven and his visible ascending up thither, and sitting at the right hand of God, and sending down the holy Ghost at the day of Pentecost, (which was a real effect of his eternal Priesthood and Intercession with God for his Church) nothing but the appearing of him according to the Spirit, out of the Heavenly Being in their Minds or Souls, upon which he sent down his Spiritual or Heavenly Powers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:55305:148"/>Wherefore this Mystical Christ is the only high Priest that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, and will allow him no otherwise then in this mystical and spiritual sense to be an everlasting and true Christ of God. See the place;<note place="margin">Evang. Regni, cap. 22.</note> of which you will assure your self I have given the right sense, if you compare it with chap. 26. sect. 10, 11, 12. where he more plainly affirms, <hi>That it is the upright being of the Love,</hi> Christ after the Spirit, (which he calls the true light) <hi>which is that high Priest that abideth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at the right hand of God in the Heavenly Being.</hi> Which phrase <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Being</hi> alwaies signifies <hi>morally</hi> or <hi>mystically</hi> with him, and means some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within us. And yet he has the impudence to alledge Acts 1. v. 11. where Christ is said to ascend into Heaven <hi>literally</hi> and naturally so called, his disciples gazing upon him as he went up. Thus you see how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously, nay how madly and rashly, he shuffles out the Humane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ from his Priestly Office every where. And as he will have the <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>most Holy</hi> within us, so will he have his Sacrifice and Passion within us too. <hi>Introduct.</hi> chap. 8.38. <hi>Where doe any now,</hi> saith he, <hi>keep the Supper of Christ, where they break, distribute and eat the bread</hi> (which is the true Body of Christ) <hi>to a remembrance of Christ, that he hath suffered in us for the sins cause the death of the Cross, and so his death is published till he come in his glory</hi>? Where it is plain that the Crucifixion of Christ is a mystery in us, and it is insinuated a duty too. For the Body and the Flesh of Christ is Christ according to the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Which Christ according to the Flesh is to be slain in us, if we ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the Passeover aright: and thus we must publish his death till he come <hi>in glory,</hi> that is, <hi>in the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And truely no other is <hi>his glorious coming to judgment,</hi> with this Sect, then this <hi>Mystical</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> coming; which was the second part I intended to pursue; which I question not but I shall make as clear as noon-day. Of this there are so many Testimonies and so pregnant, that the only fear is of being too copious in the proof of this matter. <hi>Revel. Dei cap.</hi> 7. There his illuminate Elders together with his Family of Love are the Heavens in which Christ the Son of God comes glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and triumphantly to judgment, to reign with God and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness everlasting upon earth. Which plainly excludes the ending of the World and that coming of Christ that all Christians expect. And chap. 15. sect. 6. he affirms that in this Eighth day, which is the day of the Spirit of Love, <hi>all the dead that are deceased in the Lord Iesus Christ do rise from the death, and all Generations of Heaven and Earth do become judged in the judgement of God with equity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again in his <hi>Introduct. Chap.</hi> 1. he saith, <hi>That now the true glorious God, who is the Resurrection and the Life, revealeth his Saints out of his bosome, where (since the time they fel asleep) they have rested untill this day of the Love; because they should now in these last times, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the righteous, be manifested with Christ in glory, to a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judgement of God on the earth.</hi> And chap. 12. he there also affirms, <hi>That in this day of the Love there appear and come to us livingly and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously all God's Saints which in times past died and fell asleep in God.</hi> And chap. 22. there he also tells us, <hi>how that in sure and firm hope of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:55305:148"/>
everlasting life the upright believers have rested in the Lord Iesus Christ, till the appearing of his coming, which is now in this day of the Love revealed out of the heavenly Being; with which Iesus Christ the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Believers of Christ, who were fallen asleep, rested or died in him, are now also manifested in glory, being raised from the dead to the intent that they should reign alive with him over all his enemies.</hi> To which you may add what he has wrote chap. 16. in his <hi>Prophecy of the Spirit of Love: Make you to flight, make you to flight, yea, get you now all out of the way, ye enemies of the Lord, and of his service of the Love, and give the Lord with his holy ones the roome; yet shall ye not escape the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God.</hi> For, he saith, <hi>the Lord cometh to judge betwixt the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Love and the rest of the world: where-through the Earth is now moved, the Heavens troubled, the Elements melt with heat, and the token of the coming of the Son of man appears in Heaven: with which rumour or rushing noise of the power of God and his holy ones, the last trumpet doth also presently give forth her sound; through whose blast of her vehement sound, and through the appearing of the coming of Christ, the dead shall stand up and arise unto the judgement of God</hi>; who having revenged the bloud of his holy ones, that the sinners have spilt and shed upon the earth, he puts this pure Family in peaceable Possession thereof; that they may reign there-over, or judge the same with righteousness, from henceforth world without end. So that the completion of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ends in the Triumph of <hi>Familism</hi>; the same which <hi>David George</hi> boasted of himself. See also chap. 15. sect. 5.</p>
               <p>Lastly in his <hi>Evangely,</hi> chap. 35.8. <hi>Behold in this same day,</hi> namely of the Love, <hi>is the Resurrection of the Lords dead come to pass, through the appearing of the coming of Christ in his Majesty according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</hi> And a little after, sect. 9. <hi>In which resurrection of the dead, God sheweth unto us that the time is now fulfilled, that his dead (or the dead that are fallen asleep in the Lord) rise up in this day of his judgement, and appear unto us in Godly glory, which shall also henceforth live in us everlastingly with Christ, and reign upon the Earth.</hi> Of which the plain sense is, That the Souls deceased so many hundred years agoe, are alive again in these of <hi>the Family of Love,</hi> and shall reign everlastingly in them with the Mystical Christ on the Earth. Which plainly excludes that other <hi>Iudgement</hi> or <hi>Resurrection</hi> in the <hi>Literal</hi> sense, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Again chap. 4. sect. 15. <hi>For this cause our hope standeth now in this day very little on many of the Inhabitants of the world; but we hope with joy much more on the appearing of the dead that die in the Lord or are dead in him, to wit, that they in their resurrection from the death shall livingly come unto and meet with us. For all the dead of the Lord and members of Christ shall now live and rise with their</hi> Bodies, <hi>and we shall assemble us with them, and they with us to one body in Iesus Christ, into one lovely Being of the Love, and be altogether concordable in the Love and peace of Iesus Christ.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. FInally as for that Article of the Creed concerning <hi>Life everlasting,</hi> his exposition is this: <hi>We confess that the same everlasting life is the true Light of men, and that God hath made and chosen him the man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that he should live in the same light everlastingly.</hi> Where, by <hi>him the man,</hi> he means the succession of mankind, as any one may know that is but a little acquainted with his manner of writing: and by <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life and the true light of men,</hi> he means the <hi>Light of the Love</hi> and the <hi>Service thereof</hi>; which he presages shall abide for ever. Which therefore he cals <hi>the house of God's dwelling,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Evang. Regni, cap. 34. &amp; 37.</note> 
                  <hi>the eternal rest of his holy ones, the everlasting fast-standing Ierusalem, the true and indisturbable kingdome, full of all Godly Power, Ioy, and of all heavenly Beautifulness, wherein the land of the Lord, with fulness of Eternal life, and lively sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is sung from everlasting to everlasting.</hi> With such sweet Charms and pleasing enchantments does this grand Deceiver lull asleep his <hi>little ones</hi> into an utter oblivion and perfect misbelief of those precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of Everlasting Happiness made to us by Christ, who <hi>hath brought Life and Immortality to light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. For that there is with no other Life but this, nor any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul or blessed Resurrection which consists in the Soul's being invested with an Heavenly and Spiritual body according to the plain and literal sense of Scripture; his gross abuse of those two main proofs thereof [1 Cor. 15.] [1 Thes. 4.] do plainly demonstrate; which he does wildly distort, as he doth the rest of the Scripture, to a mere prediction of his <hi>Service of the Love,</hi> in which he will have every thing of the last Day and of the Resurrection fulfilled, that we may be sure that there is nothing else to be expected but this. For in this <hi>the last trump sounds; Christ appears</hi> in the Heavens, being come <hi>to judgement</hi>; those very Saints that in time past <hi>died</hi> and <hi>fell asleep</hi> in the Lord, are now raised up in glory, and that <hi>with their bodies,</hi> and livingly come unto and meet with us, according to that in 1 Thes. 4. and lastly, these raised
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:55305:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Saints, that is, <hi>the Family of Love,</hi> shall thus reign with their <hi>mystical Christ</hi> upon earth for <hi>ever world without end.</hi> What interpretation of Scripture can more accurately and radically take away all expectation of Christs personal coming to Judgement, and the hope of a Blessed Immortality included therein by the resurrection of the dead, then this of this bold Author? Which we may be the better assured he intends, in that his applications are so miserably forced, and yet he has no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proofs then these for the ratifying of his <hi>Service of the Love.</hi> For if he thought they did signifie that which all Christians think they do, he could fancy no force at all in them for the establishing of his Doctrine: but the orthodox meaning seeming to him utterly incredible, makes him confident that he has found out the right sense; if he deal <hi>bonâ fide,</hi> and takes not the Scripture for a <hi>mere Fable,</hi> which he may abuse as he pleases.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For we may observe him using the same industry in eluding the force of such places as are plain for an Immortal state after this life, even there where he may seem unconcerned, if he held the Soul of man Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal. As that 2 Cor. 5. where the Promise of the Heavenly or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual body is evidently set down, as appears further out of the last verses of the precedent chapter: and yet these <hi>Familists</hi> are not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to expound it of <hi>the most holy of the true Tabernacle,</hi> in their canting language; whereby they mean the <hi>perfection of the Love,</hi> a state in this life, as you may see in their <hi>Mirabilia Dei.</hi> And in the <hi>Spiritual Land of peace,</hi> That which is writ Luk. 20.35. concerning the children of the Resurrection, <hi>that they are neither married nor given in marriage, but are as the Angels of God,</hi> he applies to the state of <hi>the Service of the Love,</hi> and makes it fulfilled in his life. Which is an Allegory so cross and crooked, that nothing but an unbelief of the literal sense could ever have put a man upon the framing of it: besides that scurvy intimation it bears along with it of <hi>community of wives,</hi> the very same doctrine that <note n="*" place="margin">See Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasm. Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat. sect. 34. Artic. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>David George</hi> is said to have vented.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Who also held, That Angels and Devils are onely Good men and Bad men, or their Vertues and Vices: in whose footsteps this scholar of his <hi>Hen. Nicolas</hi> treads very carefully, as appears from his <hi>Revel. Dei</hi> cap. 14. where he makes the <hi>Righteousness,</hi> the true <hi>Spirits</hi> or holy <hi>Angels.</hi> As also <note n="*" place="margin">See H. N upon the seven deadly sinnes.</note> elsewhere he saith, <hi>that he that has the seven deadly sins in him, is possest of the seven horriblest and destructionablest Devils:</hi> intimating that the rest of the Vices are Devils also, but not so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structionable. And he insinuates further in the same place, that the Seven Devils cast out of <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> were those seven deadly Sins. And I am certain that the most knowing of the Family have freely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed that there are no Devils nor Witches nor Angels but those in us. Which things being supposed, it is necessary either to cast away the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, or else to allegorize them away into a mere moral or mystical sense, as these <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> have done.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They believing therefore the Existence of neither Angel nor Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, of necessity they must believe no Immortality of the Soul. And that they believe no such thing there is still a further evidence, in that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:55305:150"/>
he never exhorts any man to <hi>Holiness</hi> upon that account (which yet is he most powerful argument to make men good that can be propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) nor ever makes use of such places of Scripture as imply a blessed Immortality to come after this life, in the literal meaning of them. His encouraging his followers to comply with any Superstition, be it never so uglily idolatrous, rather then to expose themselves to danger, agrees also well with this Supposition. And some have noted that they have alledged this reason for it, <hi>That the temple of God may not be destroied.</hi> Whereby they mean their humane persons, which they suppose lost ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably in the death of the body. And that there may be no doubt at all that this is their opinion, I will conclude with a reference to <note n="*" place="margin">Epist 6. Chap. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> one of his Epistles, where he speaks to this very question: which he does with so many hacks and hesitations, with so much shuffling and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and insinuations to the contrary, that no rational man can be unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied but that he held it mortal. For if he had held it immortal, it had been impossible he should have concealed his opinion, or intimated any thing to the contrary; it being so useful a doctrine for others, and so commendable for himself to profess. Which obdurate conceit of his made him allegorize away all the Articles of the Creed, and so deny the Resurrection of Christ as well as of all others that believe on him; and being secure, as he thought, that he does not now subsist, he could not dream of any Christ that could be Head of the Church but that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical one he insists so much upon, <hi>the Upright Being of the Love,</hi> the Perfection of all. And verily if there be nothing to come after this life, I dare allow him to be as great a Prophet as either himself or his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers desire he should be esteemed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. He is therefore upon his own Hypothesis very consonant to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in removing the Humane person of Christ as a thing that has peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed one thousand six hundred years ago, and in riveting the Godhead into his own person so <hi>thwackingly and substantially,</hi> as that he may give the World to understand that he was as much God as that Christ that died at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and that all those that attained to the <hi>perfection of the Love</hi> were so too: that he might <hi>abundantly compensate</hi> thereby the <hi>loss</hi> of <hi>that one</hi> that died upon the Cross, having fallen into the hands of merciless sinners. This, I say, is a consistent dream of his: and that it is no more but a dream, I partly have already, and shall still more clearly demonstrate in this present Discourse.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In the mean time it is very plain, that though he sets out himself in such <hi>Seraphical</hi> language, and adorns his own person with such gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Titles as if nothing ever yet appeared in the World so holy and divine; yet he is indeed much inferiour to the better sort of Pagans, as being nothing more then an <hi>Enthusiastick Sadducee,</hi> or a <hi>Fanatick Deist,</hi> if so much. For I wonder what a kind of God he imagins to himself, to whom he makes the Senate of Heaven so unmannerly as to use such formes of speech to him as he does <hi>Revel. Dei</hi> cap. 21. <hi>Go to then, let it even be so, O God, it is vouchsafed thee that thou shouldest first bring forth a Declaration of thy right.</hi> But I have no mind to dive any further into this depth of <hi>Satan,</hi> from which I pray God deliver every good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>

               <p n="1">1. OUT of the Description we have given hitherto, we may easily compute the great mischief that accrues to the World from this false Pretender to Revelations, whereever his Witchcraft has power to seize the spirit of a man. For first, That admirable Wisdome of God in the outward frame of Christian Religion, as it respects the Person of Christ, his endearing Passion, his glorious Resurrection and Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, his comfortable Intercession, and his joyful Return to judgement, when our Immortality shall be completed in heavenly Glory; all this is swept away, and therewith our assurance of Eternal Life. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, that there may be nothing wanting to the perfecting of that monstrous Evil that is hatched in this Family, it may prove a <hi>Pandora</hi>'s box to Mankind even in this life, if a more benigne Providence do not prevent it. For they having, as I have told you, a full licence from their infallible Prophet to dissemble and aequivocate, to comply with any Religion whatever; they may multiply hiddenly in great numbers to the hazard of a State or Commonwealth. For being taught by their illuminate Elders, That there is nothing to be expected after this life, it must needs make them hang their lips very longingly after the greatest enjoyments they can of this present World. The Possession and Rule whereof their Prophet has promised them with such magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent words and Enthusiastick Grandiloquence, that they cannot but be inflamed into violent attempts upon the first occasion that they shall phansy safe to make use of. And what full right do you think will they imagine themselves to have to fly upon all, whenas they phansy the Head of their faction to be no less then <hi>Christ himself</hi> come to judge the World in righteousness?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wherefore if some <hi>sullen fellow</hi> amongst them of a <hi>peremptory</hi> and <hi>imperious Spirit, overcharged with Pride and Melancholy,</hi> and <hi>deeply bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi> into the doctrine of this Sect, shall by his fanatick heat, parts and language emerge to that height of honour as to be approved the Eldest of that Family: the same is presently become in his own conceit, and in theirs also, <hi>God himself</hi> returned to Judgement, and all his host, <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Seraphims,</hi> if ever opportunity arme them to execute their design. And then will they think that that is to be fulfilled which is figured out in that Vision of a man clothed with an Habergion,<note place="margin">See Revelat. Dei, Cap. 27. sect. 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> and Harness, and girded with an iron chain, whose hands and leggs to the very girdle
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:55305:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were wet with bloud, with a sword in his left hand also red and bloudy, and another in his right which was altogether a glowing fire, glisning &amp; crackling very terribly with many fire-flames. Which direful Spectre gives out his voice in the following Sections. <hi>Vengeance, Vengeance, Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; Now swiftly, now swiftly, yea now very swiftly, Wo, Wo, Wo, unto all the enemies of the Lord and his holy ones, and to all the enemies of the Family of Love.</hi> So great Darlings do they give out themselves to be of God and his Providence, and so miserable an end, do they prefigure to themselves, shall befall those that are not of their blessed Family. God of his mercy open the eyes of all men, that they may see the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful purposes of this Diabolical Impostor, and quit themselves of these subtil delusions of <hi>Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. For if I have any sense or foresight at all in me, it is a plot to overrun and subjugate, if it be possible, all Christendome, and perfectly to extirpate the worship of Christ, and to extinguish the belief of all his Promises, under pretence of a greater Holiness and Perfection then there is in Christian Religion; though this <hi>Familisme</hi> be such as I have abundantly set out to you. See his <hi>Prophesie of the Spirit of Love,</hi> Chap. 11. also Chap. 14. Sect. 8, 9. and Chap. 16. Sect. 3, 4, 7, 8. and Chap. 19. Sect. 4.5.7, &amp;c. In which places he promises to his followers that they shall have the day at last, that is, <hi>That Familisme shall thrust Christianity out of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Which because they have so great minde should be fulfilled, let us suppose a while that they have got the mastery over Christendome, and compute with our selves the consequences thereof. Without all question, although every page of this Divine Authour (as they would have him) be so thick painted with the sweet repetitions of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Lovely,</hi> the issue of such a victory would be the most beastly Tyranny that ever appeared yet upon the stage of the earth, worse by farre then <hi>Mahometisme</hi> it self. For first, all hope of a Future life being taken away, every man according to his power will be more free and eager to satisfie his lust in the superfluous pleasures of this. From whence those that are weak will be oppressed without pitty, to satiate the desires of the proud and injurious Oppressour. And then again, for peace in matters of Religion, upon which score especially this flattering Deceiver would recommend himself to the World, the interpretations of Scripture, whereby he would establish his authority with men, are so wilde and fanatick, and so dissonant to all sense and reason, that he has sown therein the seeds of perpetual Contention; unless it be prevented by a Remedy worse then the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, that is, <hi>a perfect slavery of the Conscience, and an implicit faith That their Prophet is infallible, without any examination and doubt.</hi> Which is the most base and villainous Degeneracy that the Spirit of man can be forced into, and is ever there attempted most where the Religion of a Nation is the most rotten and false. But that this latter would be the way seems too-too probable, both from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the case, and from such intimations out of his Writings as I have already produced. To which you may adde that in his
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:55305:151"/>
                  <hi>Revelatio Dei,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Revel.

But that Religion certainly is false at the bottome that will not suffer it self to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into by <hi>Reason</hi>; as <note n="*" place="margin">Grotius de Religione Christiana, lib. 6.</note> he saith very excellently of <hi>Mahometisme, Meritò suspecta merx est quae hâc lege obtruditur, ne inspici possit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. You see what a wild and exorbitant thing <hi>this blind Enthusiasm</hi> is, the very Vehicle of Hell that carries to <hi>Antheisme</hi> and <hi>Prophaneness,</hi> and the Triumphal Chariot of the Devil; in which questionless this begodded Mock-Prophet was hurried away, though haply he might not know it, but gloried in his shame, and prided himself in his own Captivity. The condition of whose Spirit, what it is, and whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it tends, if I know mine own heart, I have thus carefully discovered, out of no other Principle at all but that Love and Loialty I owe to my crucified Saviour and Sovereign, and out of that dear Compassion I bear to my fellow-members of his Body the Church. For verily I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but melt into sorrow and pitty, to consider how deceivable many well-meaning Souls are, and how captivable by the witchery of a <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Eloquence into a strange belief, that there is a more then ordinary share of Divinity residing upon this Person, whom I am so well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red is but <hi>Epicurus</hi> turned <hi>Enthusiast,</hi> and one sunk as low beneath the light of the Gospel as any wretched <hi>Pagan</hi> that never heard thereof. And therefore I hope all his Admirers that are not so far baptised into his way as to have celebrated his <hi>Pascha</hi> and slain Christ according to the <hi>flesh,</hi> that is, according to the <hi>Letter</hi> and <hi>History,</hi> and so become perfect <hi>Infidels,</hi> will take it well at my hands that I have so faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully discovered the deceit, that they may no longer give countenance to so horrid an Imposture. And for as many as have thus slain the Lord of Life, which yet I hope are not very many, how they should take ill this my freeness of speech, I can in no wise imagine. For I dare say for them, in that they have thus slain him, (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> said in another case) they have done it out of ignorance, through the prestigious enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this grand Deceiver; and therefore they can no sooner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their errour, but find their pardon, through him who was truely slain and sacrificed for the sins of the World, and rose again for an assurance to us of a blessed Immortality after the death of the Body. Which must needs be a message of great joy to all people that are of an upright and sincere heart.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIX. <hi>1.</hi> That <hi>Familism</hi> is a Monster bred out of the corruptions of Christianity, and ill management of affairs by the Guides of the Church. <hi>2.</hi> The first Particular of ill Management intimated. <hi>3.</hi> The second Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. <hi>4.</hi> The third Particular. <hi>5.</hi> The fourth. <hi>6.</hi> The fifth Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. <hi>7.</hi> That this false Prophet <hi>H.

               <p n="1">1. AND now after my freedome with your competitours for the rule of Christendome, the <hi>Illuminated Elders</hi> of the <hi>lovely Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nialty of the Love</hi>; have the patience to hear me in a word or two, O ye conspicuous Lights and Guides of the Communialty of Christ. What think you of this hideous Monster that I have so lively set before your eyes? From whence came it? Whose brat is this foul errour of <hi>Familism?</hi> Methinks I hear you straight reply, <hi>H. Nicolas</hi> his. But I demand further, how came <hi>H. Nicolas</hi> to be such a Monster? You will immediately return answer out of <hi>Micronius,</hi> That he received his Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphosis from <hi>David George.</hi> But I take leave to ask again, Who transformed <hi>David George</hi> into such an Angel of light? To which you'l quickly reply, The Devil. His back I confess is broad enough to bear all, indeed too broad to satisfie the curiosity of my Querie, who would gladly know the more particular causes of so monstrous a production in the bowels of Christendome. Which if you be ignorant of, give me leave a little to informe you: and be not displeased if you find much of the fault laid at your own dores. For my own part, I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that you your selves have congested that putrid matter together, which neither Sun nor Moon, nor any natural Influence of Heaven, but the fiery Wrath of God and his enraged eye of Jealousie has given heat and life to. This dangerous Monster therefore have you your selves, by Provocation of the Divine Vengeance, raised up to your selves, and given increase to, and strength to subsist. Which may appear to you from the due consideration of these Particulars following.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For first, You have so corrupted the <hi>Simplicity</hi> of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by your humane inventions and Opinions, (which are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, so unintelligible, so against all Sense and Reason, and obtruded on the people with so much force and violence, and with an authority and necessity equally indispensable to the very Oracles of God) that you are constrained thereby to pronounce of that Religion then which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more <hi>reasonable,</hi> That there is no reasonable account to be given of it, but that we are to believe it without examination or inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition into it, and thereby debase it and set it as low as <hi>Turcism</hi> or the most pittifull piece of <hi>Paganism</hi> that can be produced. You inuring therefore the people to believe things upon no account, and obtruding
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:55305:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>
such things upon them as no account can be given of, prepare them for the entertaining of every bold <hi>Impostor</hi> that pretends to an infallible Spirit, and commends his adulterous ware upon the same title that you doe yours, namely, that they are so high and transcendent that they are above the reach of carnal Reason, condemning every sober inquisition into the Truth as carnal. Wherefore if there be but impudency enough, assisted with a fiery Enthusiastick style, flowered over with Scriptural Phrases and Allusions, with deep and vehement protestations of the irresistible power of the Spirit that transports them and carries them on to that Prophetical Ministry, they may securely say what they please, and never be tried nor distrusted, let them speak never so irrationally and inconsistently. For the People are already sufficiently inured to things irrational, contradictions and unintelligible, whereby the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest <hi>Non-sense</hi> must appear to them the most pure Dialect of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And therefore there will be no stop but they <hi>must needs be carried</hi> on with such Torrents of Ecstatick eloquence, and be washed away from the body of the Church into this or that Fanatick Sect, according as the sutableness of their natural humour and opportunity exposes them to their assaults.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, When I consider the ineptness of your Allegations out of Scripture for such Opinions as you are so zealous for, and the solemn adorning of the margins of your Theological Treatises with such insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant citations out of the undeniable Oracles of God, as that when one examines them he shall find his understanding as much abused as a mans eye-sight is by that mockery of drawing ones hands one from the other, and twisting with his thumbs and forefingers as if there were some subtil string betwixt; (For assuredly the connexion betwixt your Quotations and your Conclusions is utterly as invisible as that imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary line to the eyes of the sleepy) I cannot but look on the Writings of this <hi>Enthusiast</hi> as an imitation of yours; wherein Providence does reproach to you your unfaithfulness to the credulous people, in that you would bear them in hand that all is true you obtrude upon them by your multitude of impertinent references to the holy Writ. Which artifice this <hi>Mock-Prophet</hi> has taken up and out-done you in, who stuffes his margins so thick with citations, as if every Sentence in the Bible strove to put in their suffrage for him; according as he boasts of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, That all the Scriptures from the beginning to the end do point at him and his Ministry if rightly understood: Whenas, if truly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, though his Margins perpetually point towards the Scriptures, they do not at all point at him again in any place, nor give him the least nod of approbation, nor take any notice at all of him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thirdly, Whereas the Mystery of Christianity, even as it refers to the External person of Christ, is the chiefest obligation of mutuall Love that the Wisdome of God could set forth to the world; you that are not only Christians, but the Guides of Christendom, have so entangled this Mystery with your rash and perverse superadditions, with your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries, subtilties and vain comments, that it is become nothing else but a shop of Controversies, a School of Contention, out of which is heard
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:55305:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nothing but brawlings and scoldings about useless Opinions, nothing has sprung from thence but Hatred, Pride, Faction, yea barbarous Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Bloudshed, your selves <hi>blowing the trumpet</hi> out of those holy places which were erected for the <hi>preaching of the Gospel of Peace,</hi> and in an Antichristian phrensy sounding an alarm of warre against such as are in Reconciliation with God through the bloud of Jesus Christ, which should be the common cement of Christendome, and hold all their hearts together in firm Unity and Concord. Wherefore you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus left empty the Tabernacle of <hi>David,</hi> is it any wonder that a Stranger hath thus stept in, and taken possession? And you having flung away that precious Legacy of your dying Lord, namely, <hi>the Love of one another,</hi> what Injustice is it that an Alien take it up, and flourish it in your sight to your utter Shame and Reproach? And truly he writes as one that knows his advantage passing well in this regard, as you may see if you read his <hi>Introduction,</hi> chap. 4. sect. 35. to the end of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as also sect. 51 of the eleventh chapter to the end thereof.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fourthly, Whereas you place all your Piety in an hypocritical Flattery of Christ's <hi>Person,</hi> and have overwhelmed and smothered the <hi>Life</hi> of Religion with an unsupportable load and luggage of needless and thankless Ceremonies, or else have wounded it to death with the acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and spinosity of harsh and dry Opinions, not heeding at all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation of your own minds, nor of theirs that are committed to your charge into the lively Image of Christ, which assuredly does mainly consist in <hi>Christian Love</hi>; how just is it with God to permit such an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiast</hi> to arise, who shall make it the great <hi>Arcanum</hi> of his Religion to <hi>slay Christ according to the flesh,</hi> that is, <hi>according to the History,</hi> you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving slain him so cruelly and remorslessly according to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> (that is, extinguished his Life that ought to be in us) by substituting your own foolish Opinions and loathsome Ceremonies in the place thereof? Nay indeed you have handled the matter so, that you have made <hi>Christ according to the flesh</hi> be the Executioner of <hi>himself according to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> making every Article concerning Christ an Engine for either <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality</hi> or <hi>Strife.</hi> In brief, the <hi>exteriour oeconomie</hi> of Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being intended for the <hi>inward perfecting of our Minds in true Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Holiness,</hi> (which is Christ in us according to the Spirit,) you by your Devices defeating this end, doe naturally take away the means thereto; and thus <hi>yourselves</hi> are the <hi>principal Murderers</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> even according to the <hi>flesh</hi> too, and <hi>H. Nicolas</hi> is only your <hi>appointed Executioner.</hi> And therefore it is, as I said, but just with God, you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so long and so constantly abused all the Articles of the Creed to a contrary purpose then was intended by his gracious counsel, that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit such a <hi>Mock-prophet</hi> to arise that should hazard the peoples misbelief of all, and Allegorize away all that solid and useful Truth of the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Christ, into a mere <hi>moral</hi> or <hi>mystical</hi> sense, as if the <hi>Letter</hi> were but a <hi>Parable</hi> or <hi>Fable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Fifthly, In that this Sect we speak of do rattle so about your ears with the loud noise of <hi>Perfection,</hi> though for my own part I am well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured the best of them are far enough from it; yet in the mean time I
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:55305:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cannot but interpret it an exprobration and reproach to the great ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency you have to so searching a doctrine, that will touch and wound your <hi>Hypocritical</hi> hearts with the sense and conscience of <hi>wilful sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> which you would cloak under that colour of <hi>Impossibility of being as you should be</hi>; as also to your false dealing with those under your charge, whom you do <hi>bedwarfe</hi> and <hi>becripple</hi> by your poisonous medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, would make them alwaies sorry boies with bibs and aprons, or else conceal their age and keep them alwaies in minority for advantage sake, like those infortunate Orphans that are betraied into the hands of treacherous Guardians. What wonder is it therefore that those that truly hunger and thirst after Righteousness, being starved at home with those dilute and corrupt doctrines of the <hi>Needlesness of Sanctity,</hi> of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Infirmity, slight Attrition, frivolous Penances, venal Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> crawl out abroad to seek better food, and so get into the lap and suck the nipples of this sweet Enchantress, <hi>the lovely Family of the Love</hi>; whose breasts do promise such strong nourishment, that they that drink thereof do not only pass from <hi>children</hi> to <hi>men,</hi> but from being <hi>men</hi> doe become <hi>Gods</hi>?</p>
               <p n="7">7. And Sixthly and lastly, While I contemplate the universal face of Christendome, what a Den of Thieves and Murderers it is become, what a Region of Robbers and Oppressors, what a Sty of Epicures, what a Wilderness of Atheism and Prophaneness, in a manner wholly inhabited by Satyrs and salvage Beasts; when I consider within my self how generally men live as if there were nothing to come after this life, and how many already have drunk down that doctrine, That there is indeed nothing to come hereafter; of which notwithstanding the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of Christ, his Death, Resurrection and Ascension, and his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing out of Heaven to <hi>Paul</hi> as he was a going to <hi>Damascus,</hi> are as palpable pledges as Divine Providence could produce, as also of his visible Return to Judgement according to the Scriptures: I say, when I consider how little effect all this has had for the raising of mens minds to an heavenly Conversation, but that they live as if they were utterly sunk from this belief, I cannot imagine any thing more reasonable then to conclude, That out of very Wrath and Indignation God has raised this false Prophet to them, that it might be with them according to the Proverb, <hi>Like lips, like lettice; Like Prophet, like People.</hi> As if God should thus expostulate with Christendome; Behold, I have given to you my only-begotten Son out of my own bosome, whose authority I ratified unto you by audible Voices from Heaven, by mighty Signs and Miracles done by him while he was alive: I gave him a sacrifice for sin to reconcile you to my self, and to endear your affections unto him and me, that ye might cordially follow his Example and keep his Precepts: I raised him from the dead and exhibited him visibly to his disciples, as an undoubted pledge of a blessed Immortality to them that believe on him; which I further confirmed by his Ascension into Heaven, and his appearing to that chosen Vessel of mine, who has so fully prefigured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you his glorious Return to Judgment, and the Resuscitation of all his Saints into that Eternal Happiness which they had fallen from. And
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:55305:154"/>
now I demand of you, what could I have done more for the gaining you back to my self, and for the resettling you again in my Heavenly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise? But because you are so besotted with Earthliness and Sensuality as to make no use of the inestimable advantages of the Gospel, but have set your Happiness upon things here below; behold, I have raised up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you a Prophet according to your own hearts desire, who will help on the completion of your Infidelity, and in the midst of a many fine words and sweet friendly phrases, <hi>close up your eyes in Unbelief</hi>; and so having sealed unto you by his witchery and enchantments this assurance, <hi>That the Mystery of Christ reaches no further then the things of this life,</hi> you may use the present market, and enjoy your worldly lusts to the full.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This surely, if I understand any thing, is the sense and meaning of God's permission that such a Prodigie as <hi>Familisme</hi> should appear with so much success in the Christian World: and though I have faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and industriously discovered the matter unto you, yet I must profess that I conceive it not in my power, nor any ones else, to prevent the sad effects thereof. That can only be by a true and sincere Reformation of Heart and Minde into the ancient and <hi>Apostolick Life and Doctrine.</hi> For there is nothing so recommendable to Mankinde as the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> in the <hi>native Plainness</hi> and <hi>Simplicity</hi> thereof; nor any thing so horrible and detestable as that vizard that the Depravedness of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome has put upon it. Which Face of things if it continue, <hi>Atheism</hi> having seized on so great a Proportion, it is prone to conjecture, that what remains may be easily swallowed up of <hi>Familism,</hi> or of some such parallel Plague of the Church; and so the right Faith in Christ may quite be laid asleep, never to awaken till there is no use thereof, I mean, till men be affrighted into a belief by an universal Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from Heaven, and the glorious Appearance of the Son of man in the Clouds, to recompence the good, and to adjudge the wicked to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Fire. For the Counsels of God, as his Prophecies, are two-handed, and both of them in some cases have a meaning conditional. But, as I desire, so I hope the best: and it is a great ease to my minde, that I have so freely declared what I conceive tends so much thereto.</p>

               <p n="1">1. WE are come now to the Third Part of our Discourse, wherein the doubtfull Dawnings of this great Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we are clearing up will break out into a fuller Light, and the Progress of <hi>Truth</hi> will be like that of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> that shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth more and more till perfect Day.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Possible,</hi> as also <hi>Reasonable Idea</hi> of Christianity, which I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto represented, is but as the <hi>Seminal Forme</hi> of a Plant hid in the seed under ground; but we shall now exhibit it as it were to sense, shot up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to open view, and demonstrate That this <hi>Possible Idea</hi> has already arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to a <hi>Real and actual Existence</hi> in the World.</p>
               <p>Which being a matter of so great consequence, we will not huddle it up at once, nor yet make any steps more for pomp then for use and the fuller conviction of the Truth we are to prove.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And truly the very first step I shall make, or rather have partly made already, I hope, to any indifferent man will seem not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable. We have very amply and intelligibly declared how highly-<hi>Reasonable</hi> the Frame of our Religion is, how <hi>becoming</hi> and <hi>consistent</hi> all those things are that Christ is recorded to have done or suffered. Add therefore to the <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of the thing it self, the <hi>constant and perpetual Tradition thereof for true,</hi> and that it has been so seriously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in all Ages, that as well the Learned as Unlearned, as well the Noble as Ignoble, have been ready, nay have actually laid down their Lives for a witness thereof. And methinks no man that is not over-Sceptical, but this Consideration should fetch off his assent. For the Fame of those things that are seriously reported and constantly believed
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:55305:155"/>
by knowing and judicious men, cannot rationally be called into questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unless the things themselves affirmed seem unreasonable, or else over-artificial and in too trim and cunning a dress of Reason. That the things recorded are very <hi>Reasonable,</hi> I have already demonstrated: And how little of the cunning Artifice of either <hi>Logick</hi> or <hi>Rhetorick</hi> they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of, I dare appeal to any that peruse them. Wherefore if any man persist in his Unbelief, the impediment is not in the Mystery offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him, but in himself, that has no desire it should be true, either out of Pride, as not being willing to find himself to have been ignorant hitherto of the true Religion, or out of the love of either the Pleasures or Profits of this present World, which the Belief of Christianity does naturally curb.</p>
               <p>But we proceed to what is still more close and cogent. That the <hi>Iews</hi> have for this many hundred years expected and do still expect him whom they call their <hi>Messias,</hi> every one knows, as also that this name <hi>Messias</hi> is the same with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> from whence our Religion is denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Wherefore if I can prove That this <hi>Messias</hi> is already come, and that <hi>Iesus</hi> whom we worship is that <hi>Christ,</hi> I have then performed the Promise of the Third Part of my Discourse; which is to prove That Christianity (the <hi>Idea</hi> whereof I have hitherto described,) is not a mere <hi>Idea,</hi> but a <hi>real</hi> Truth.</p>
               <p>Which first I shall attempt from <hi>Prophecies,</hi> after from <hi>History:</hi> the comparing of both which together will be so strong an Argument, that to the unprejudiced it cannot appear less then a perfect Demonstration.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I know some are of so impatient and superficial a Spirit that they vilifie the very name or mention of <hi>Prophecies,</hi> as arguments of no vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, because they cannot find themselves at leisure to weigh the force of them. But if they will rationally speak against them, they must alledge some of these four Objections, viz. That either they are often <hi>forged,</hi> or at least <hi>corrupted</hi> by some wily Politicians to serve some State-design: Or are so <hi>obscure</hi> that there is no certain sense or meaning of them: Or if there be, that it does not infallibly import that things thus predicted will surely come to pass, there being so great <hi>dependance</hi> of the affairs of the World upon <hi>the actings of men:</hi> Or lastly, to strike home, that there never was nor ever will be any Prophecies from any extraordinary Inspiration, but that some men have very <hi>hot Phansies,</hi> and their minds running on future things vent what they think; and their Predictions, like Dreams, sometimes prove true, sometimes false; and that the report of those that have hapned true has begot that false perswasion of there being Prophets in the World.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Such slight Considerations as these doe marvellously gratifie the Light-minded and Atheistical, but more severely looked into will prove of no force.</p>
               <p>For as for the first Objection, it is plain it can have no place here, if we consider with what holiness and veneration the <hi>Iews</hi> look upon the very outward Letter of those Divine Oracles committed to their custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Besides that it is ridiculous to suspect them either to have <hi>foisted</hi> in or any way <hi>altered</hi> such Prophecies as we are here to make use of, they being
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:55305:155"/>
such as will manifestly make against themselves: Which is a mighty Priviledge that Christianity has, that in maintaining of her Cause she can so boldly appeal to those Records that have been ever kept in the hands of her Enemies. Nor can the Christian, if he would, corrupt these Prophecies, but he would be forthwith discovered by the <hi>Iews.</hi> Whence neither Atheist nor Pagan can rationally suspect any foul play of this kind.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As for the pretended <hi>Obscurity</hi> or <hi>Ambiguity of Prophecies,</hi> I deny that they may all justly be termed <hi>Obscure.</hi> Besides that, the words of them that are so in some measure, ever fit one sense better then another; and where there is any such ambiguity, that sense is to be accounted true that has been judged so by men unprejudiced, and, all things considered, appears most proper and easie. The Satisfaction of which Answer will be better understood when we descend to Examples, then by general Precept.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The third Objection cannot be urged by any but such as are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doting Idolizers of the Faculty of <hi>Free will,</hi> and forget that some <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies</hi> are not <hi>conditional</hi> but <hi>absolute,</hi> as certainly all those are that are of so vast and Moliminous Concernment to the World as the appearing of the <hi>Messias</hi> is. Whose coming, if it had been <hi>conditional,</hi> nothing could be thought to hinder but Sin. Which in this case is as absurdly inferred, as if one should argue that the sickness of the Patient keeps away the Physitian, when it rather occasions his coming. And one end of Christ's coming, as I have abundantly shewn already, is to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for sin, and to renew the World in Righteousness.</p>

The last Objection is the most perverse and lubricous, but yet such as is easily mastered, if we consider how punctually and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly many things have been prefigured in Prophecie, and, that usually those that have prophesied, have also done Miracles, or something mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous and extraordinary has hapned unto them; that they have seen <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 5. ch. 17. sect. 2.</note> Visions of Angels and have been assisted by supernatural Powers.

So <hi>Isaiah</hi> prophesied of <hi>Cyrus</hi> by name, and what God intended to doe by him in reference to his people, some hundreds of years before <hi>Cyrus</hi> was born.

               <p n="2">2. It is plain from this brief and warrantable exposition of the words, that the natural and genuine sense of <hi>Iacob</hi>'s prophecie is this, <hi>That, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever become of the Tribes of Israel,</hi> Juda, <hi>and what ever part of the Tribes have any coalition with it, and goe under one name and title, shall not fail to have a Political Power and Government of their own, till the</hi> Messias <hi>come.</hi> This, I say, is the most easie and natural sense of this Prophecie, and such as has been ever given by their own Expositors, till that sad mistake of killing their <hi>Messias</hi> perverted their Judgments. Wherefore, before themselves became guilty, and while they were fit to be judges, we appeal to them, if <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Prophecie does not plainly foretel, That the Political Power and Government of the Jews shall not cease till the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi> come. But it is evident it has ceased: therefore of a certain the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi> is come.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Which this Prophecie would sufficiently assure us of, though there were other tolerable interpretations to be made besides this; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reasonable to conclude, that where there may be various senses made of words, that is the truest that flowes the most naturally, and seems to doe so to such as are unprejudiced. But to be still more certain of the truth of the sense of this Prophecie which has been already given; though both Jews and others have set their wits on tenter-hooks to find other meanings thereof, they have light upon none but what are intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably vain and foolish.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It will not be amiss to give you a tast of the chiefest of them. First therefore, Those that would not have the <hi>Messias</hi> understood by <hi>Shiloh,</hi> they understand either <hi>Moses, Saul, David, Ieroboam</hi> or <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadonosor.</hi> First, <hi>Moses,</hi> because when he was sent to deliver the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt, Iuda</hi> surrendred the Sceptre to him, though he was of the Tribe of <hi>Levi.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Saul,</hi> because he was crowned in <hi>Shiloh.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>David,</hi> viz. implying that the Sceptre was in <hi>Iuda,</hi> and should there continue til <hi>David</hi>'s time, in whose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eign there was an accession of some people brought under his Rule. Fourthly, <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> as being he who was crowned in <hi>Shiloh,</hi> and took the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre from <hi>Iuda.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>Nebuchadonosor,</hi> because he took the Sceptre from <hi>Iuda,</hi> and carried the people captive, and rased <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the Temple to the ground. But to these may be answered briefly:</p>
               <p n="5">5. To that concerning <hi>Moses,</hi> That he could not take the Sceptre from <hi>Iuda, Iuda</hi> having none. For all the Tribes together were not a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity then, much less any one of them, but were miserable underlings and bondslaves to that cruel Tyrant <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> To that of <hi>Saul,</hi> That he was not created King in <hi>Shiloh,</hi> but in <hi>Mizpeh</hi>; nor that <hi>Saul</hi> the <hi>Benjamite</hi> could take the Sceptre from <hi>Iuda,</hi> he having none yet, as was said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:55305:157"/>
besides that ridiculous Syntax of <hi>Shiloh</hi>'s <hi>coming,</hi> which is a <hi>place,</hi> not a <hi>person,</hi> according to this interpretation: as also it is very frigid to applie the last clause of the Prophecie to <hi>Saul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. To that of <hi>David</hi> may be answered much-what the same with that to the former, That <hi>Iuda</hi> before <hi>David</hi>'s time, though it had a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and Seniority, yet wielded no Sceptre over the other Tribes, nor had any distinct Jurisdiction more then the other had: And that it is very inept, if we read the whole Prophecie, which immediately before speaks so magnificently of <hi>Iuda</hi>'s Courage and Prowess, to think it presently falls so flat, as only to predict that <hi>Iuda</hi> shall not lose his Seniority or Precedencie til <hi>David</hi> come. And still, which makes it more harsh, the words naturally seem to import, that <hi>Iuda</hi> shall lose his Sceptre when <hi>Shiloh</hi> or <hi>David</hi> is come, though it be the first time then that he takes it up. I say the words do naturally implie so, though not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily: but admit they do not, but the royal Sceptre continue with <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> for many hundreds of years afterwards, as it did, and that even then when almost all the Tribes were lost; how frivolous do they make this Prophecie of <hi>Iacob,</hi> in setting off so petty things in such magnificent terms, and leaving out the most notable matters that belong to that Tribe? And lastly, that that addition to the Jurisdiction of <hi>David</hi> does not so well fit nor fill up the sense of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as that of the <hi>Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> the Jews expect.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To that of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> That <hi>Ieroboam</hi> was not anointed King in <hi>Shiloh,</hi> but in <hi>Sichem</hi> a city of <hi>Ephraim:</hi> And that this conspiracy did not take away the Sceptre from <hi>Iuda,</hi> but rather gave occasion to <hi>Iuda</hi> of being a kingdome of it self, and such as was not dissolved for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after, whereas before it was but a part of the kingdome of <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And lastly to that of <hi>Nebuchadonosor,</hi> That this Interpretation puts a very foolish and frivolous sense upon the Prophecie, as if it ran thus; That the Sceptre shall not be taken from <hi>Iuda,</hi> till some one come and take it by force. As if <hi>Iacob</hi> would venture to foretel that <hi>Iuda</hi> would not be such a fool as to give away his Sceptre, though he might be so either cowardly or unfortunate to have it wrested out of his hands. Wherefore he that is prophesied of here must be to the Jews more then a mere Robber or Despoiler, and must have some special relation to them of either being their King or Prophet in some more then ordinary manner; or else the sense will be very flat and inept, as if he should say, <hi>The Sceptre will not be taken away before it be taken away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Besides, the Sceptre was not so much taken away by the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish captivity, as sequestred for a time, during which space they were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained from God by the mouths of his Prophets, that they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again within the space of seventy years. So that it was rather an <hi>Interregnum</hi> then an abolition of the <hi>Iudaical</hi> Politie. Which some would have to continue in some small degree amongst themselves even in that interval of their Captivity, as having their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, who had a power over all the people of <hi>Iuda.</hi> But that is more then is worth the contending for. God's obligation by the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:55305:158"/>
mouth of his Prophets to bring them back within seventy years, and the smallness of the continuance of their Captivity in respect of the enjoiment of their Liberty afterwards, are sufficient of themselves to make that Captivity onely a suspension, not a taking away, of the Sceptre from <hi>Iuda.</hi> To all this you may add the <hi>unsutable Connexion</hi> of this Prophecie with the foregoing verses, where <hi>Iuda</hi> is so magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently spoke of for his stoutness and courage; to which presently it is subjoined (according to this interpretation) that the Sceptre shall never be taken away, till some vanquish him and take it away, as it seems <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadonosor</hi> did: Which is as incoherent and insipid sense as can be imagined, as I partly intimated before.</p>
               <p>But to interpret it, as the ancient Jews have interpreted it, of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi> the coherence is very perfect, viz.

                  </gap>. So that though they might shuffle off the right sense of the Prophecie in the beginning thereof, yet the following part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends both it self and the other from that violence and injury. For there must be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, Political Power, in <hi>Iuda,</hi> till <hi>Shiloh</hi> come, let <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> signifie what it will.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But to touch upon them also in several; where we must take notice that the <hi>Tribe of Iuda,</hi> not his <hi>Person,</hi> is the subject of this Prophesie. The sense therefore of the first Interpretation will be this,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:55305:158"/>
                  <hi>That</hi> Judah <hi>will not be taken from</hi> Judah, <hi>till</hi> Shiloh <hi>come.</hi> Which is very ridiculous. But so far as it is possible <hi>Iudah</hi> is taken from <hi>Iudah,</hi> and therefore <hi>Shiloh</hi> is come. For <hi>Iudah</hi> is taken all apieces and scattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the nations in all the quarters of the World. Or if they will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst reason phansy the person of <hi>Iudah</hi> the subject of this Prophecie, (of which the sense will then be, <hi>Iudah</hi> his tribe shall not be taken from him, till <hi>Shiloh</hi> come,) the Patriarch would have expressed himself more determinately and said <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, otherwise <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally signifies, no Tribe at all should be taken from him, whereas Ten have been carried away at a clap and never yet returned. Besides if <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may signifie <hi>his own Tribe,</hi> that is properly taken from him too, and lost, they not being under his Rule, that is, under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Iuda</hi>; but he is like a Commander whose Armie is quite routed, and all carried away from him Captive, and under the command of strangers: and though they bear his name still, what is that if they be not under his power? Surely the Patriarch's mind was taken up with mean matters on his death-bed, if there be no more in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie then so.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The Second Interpretation, understanding still <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for a <hi>Tribe,</hi> is lyable to the like Exceptions with the first, and the foolery of it still more palpably deprehendible. For here it is exceeding evident that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, will necessarily signifie, <hi>Not a tribe shall be taken from Iuda,</hi> &amp;c. For it is as if one should say, that a Sheep shall not be taken out of the fold, till <hi>Dametas</hi> come. But if <hi>Dametas</hi> coming, there should be found onely one left, the other Shepheard would think himself deluded; if he that promised him should pretend he has kept his word in keeping but one Sheep in the Fold. For it were a foolish fallacy to plead, that he promised that a Sheep should not be taken away, and that there is a Sheep that is not. So that it is plain that by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, one particular Tribe, <hi>Benjamin,</hi> cannot be understood, and therefore none at all. For all the rest were carried away by <hi>Salmanassar</hi> into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Captivity.</p>
               <p n="14">14. To the Third Interpretation we answer, That <hi>Iacob</hi> is distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting <hi>peculiar Benedictions</hi> to every one of his Sons; but this is common to them all, and therefore not to be affixed to <hi>Iuda:</hi> And then, that it is a petty business amongst such illustrious predictions and encomiums of <hi>Iuda,</hi> that he shall not be put to such utter streights but that he shall be able to live, though an underling, and dependent on other People; so that this is a very wretched and dilute sense of the Prophecie.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And the Fourth is as ill, if not worse. For First, as before, what is common to all the Tribes, and yet belongs more to the other Tribes then to <hi>Iuda</hi> (the Ten I mean that were carried away by <hi>Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nassar</hi>) is here appropriated to <hi>Iuda,</hi> and that in the midst of <hi>encomiums</hi> and blessings. Read the whole Prophecie concerning <hi>Iuda,</hi> and at the first sight you will discover the unreasonableness of this patch, if this be the meaning of this part of the Prophecie. Besides, the Prophecie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this sense could not be true. For <hi>Iuda</hi> was a flourishing king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:55305:159"/>
or commonwealth for many hundreds of years together, as appears out of their own History.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And lastly, in answer to both these last Interpretations at once; The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> simply set down as it is here without any other circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to determine the sense of it, never signifies either the <hi>Staffe of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance</hi> or the <hi>Rod of chastisement.</hi> So that they might as well expound it a <hi>Crutch,</hi> as either. For <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> will certainly signifie a <hi>Crutch:</hi> and therefore taking that liberty that they take, the sense of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie may run thus, <hi>A Crutch shall not depart from Iuda, nor a Scribe from betwixt his feet, till Shiloh come:</hi> that is, That <hi>Iuda</hi> never will want a Scribe with a Crutch, that is, an halting Scribe, a Scribe that will make lame and crooked Expositions of the Law in defence of that capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal errour of theirs, till the second Coming of the <hi>Messias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. I have given you a brief tast of the fond Evasions the Jews make use of, to hide the plain sense of this Prophecie of <hi>Iacob:</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which it is worth the taking notice, That as their Expositions are very vain and seem so to us, so it is manifest that they are unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory even to themselves, in that they have produced so many. For what could put them upon excogitating a new one but a dissatisfaction in the old? and though they have pumped out as many as they can, they do not know which to adhere to.</p>

III. <hi>1.</hi> The Prophecy of <hi>Haggai. 2.</hi> The natural sense of the Prophecy. <hi>3.</hi> That the Second Temple could not be more glorious then the First but by receiving the <hi>Messias</hi> into it. <hi>4.</hi> That <hi>Herod</hi>'s Temple could not be understood hereby. <hi>5.</hi> An Answer to their subterfuge concerning <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Temple. <hi>6.</hi> That the Prophecy of <hi>Malachi</hi> addes further force to that of <hi>Haggai. 7.</hi> That the Prophet could understand no other Temple then that which was then standing.</head>
               <p n="1">1. BUT if they could have found out any tolerable Evasion in this Prophecy, yet their work is not done, there being other plain Predictions to the same purpose:<note place="margin">Haggai 2. v. 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> As in <hi>Haggai, For thus saith the Lord of hosts, Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the Heavens and the Earth and the Sea and the dry land: And I will shake all Nations, and the Desire of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts. The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts. The glory of this latter house shall be greater then that of the former, saith the Lord of hosts, and in this place will I give peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The natural sense of which Prophecy is plainly this: The Prophet encourages the people to work and build the Temple, because that though it should not be so costly as the former in ornaments of Gold
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:55305:159"/>
and Silver, which yet it were an easie thing for God to bestow if he would, (<hi>The silver is mine and the Gold is mine</hi>;) yet the glory of this latter house shall be greater then the former, in that it shall be honoured with the presence of the <hi>Messiah</hi> in it, who is called here <hi>The Desire of all Nations:</hi> and as he is elsewhere styled <hi>The Prince of peace,</hi> so is his coming set out here by the Gift of Peace; <hi>And in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Now we demand of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> in what respect this <hi>Second house</hi> was <hi>more glorious</hi> then the former, if the <hi>Messiah</hi> came not into it while it was standing. That it was a pitiful Structure in comparison of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, the weeping of the old men at the rearing of the edifice was a plain Demonstration. Besides that the <hi>Rabbins</hi> themselves say it was destitute of <hi>five Prerogatives</hi> the other had: viz. <hi>The Urim and Thummim, the Shechina, Fire from Heaven, the Ark of the Covenant, and the Spirit of Prophecy.</hi> The evasions of the Jews here are very poor and inconsiderable: viz.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That though the Temple at first was not so glorious, yet when <hi>Herod</hi> had reformed it, it was more splendid and stately then <hi>Solomon</hi>'s. Which is not only false, but if it were admitted to be true, would not salve the meaning of the Prophecy. For all those external Ornaments could not compensate the losse of the <hi>five Preeminences</hi> above-named. Besides that it is ridiculous to make so petty a design of building a fine Temple to be expressed with such exceeding high language as if the greatest Miracle in the World were to be exhibited, (which yet was done by <hi>Herod,</hi> the vilest of men) <hi>I will shake the Heavens and the Earth and the Sea and the dry land,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And the second Alledgement, That this latter Temple stood ten years longer then the former, is still more frivolous. And therefore at last they are forced to quit this Temple, and affix the Prophecie on a third, viz. <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Temple. Which is yet unbuilt, though it be above two thousand years since that Prophecie; whenas the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet said, <hi>Yet a little while, and I will shake the Heavens and the Earth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But the Jews will be still obstinate, and still urge that it is plain how magnificent a Temple <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s is, and that it is clearly prophesied of, and must be at last, and that therefore they will not expect their <hi>Messias</hi> till then. But to this I briefly answer, First, That it may be, that Vision of the Temple was nothing else but an exhibition of the Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> such as it was when <hi>Nebuchodonosar</hi> destroyed it. To which opinion <hi>Grotius</hi> is very inclinable. Secondly, if it be a more magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent structure, That the Prophecie is not <hi>absolute,</hi> as that of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> but <hi>conditional</hi>; as seems to be expresly intimated in the very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 43.<note place="margin">Vers. 10, 11.</note> Upon which, I conceive, it may be a representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such a magnificent Structure as the <hi>Iews</hi> would have raised even in their <hi>Messiah</hi>'s time, if they had not refused him, that they would have pulled down <hi>Herod</hi>'s Temple as built by the hands of so execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Wretch, and raised this structure of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> This had been the natural issue of their embracing the <hi>Messiah</hi>; but the counsel of God
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:55305:160"/>
must stand. Or lastly, That the whole Vision is of a mere Mystical or Spiritual meaning, which the Vision of the <hi>holy waters</hi> and the strange virtue of them, as also the Trees there mentioned (<note n="*" place="margin">See Ezekiel 47. v. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</note> Chap. 47.) seem shrewdly to insinuate. So that no argument drawn from the Temple of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> can enervate the force of this Prophecie of <hi>Haggai,</hi> it being so very clear in it self, and the other so many waies interpretable to a compliance therewith.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The truth whereof will be still more evident if we adde that of <hi>Malachi;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Malach. ch. 3. v. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold, I will send my Messenger, and he shall prepare the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me: and the Lord whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his Temple; even the Messenger of the Covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Prophecie is parallel to the foregoing Prophecie, and does more fully describe the person of the <hi>Messias,</hi> whereby we may be the better assured that they are both meant of him: and the time here again seems plainly enough to be predefined, viz. That he would come into that Temple that the <hi>Iews</hi> had then standing, though it had not been long rebuilt, and grace it with his presence before it should be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ruined and laid wast.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This certainly is the natural sense of this Prophecie, and it is a very harsh thing to think that <hi>Malachi</hi> had any other Temple in his mind but this. But this Temple has been laid level to the ground a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove one thousand six hundred years agoe, and therefore the <hi>Messias</hi> either came into his Temple then, or the Prophecie is false. For there never was any since for him to come into, nor is now, nor will be again for ever, at least before his coming. For how shall the Jews build them a Temple before they have found the <hi>Messias?</hi> So that the <hi>Messias</hi> will be first, and the Temple after, if at all. But certainly this Prophecie of <hi>Malachi</hi> supposes the Temple first and ready built, and that the <hi>Messias</hi> in due time will be born into the World, and come into it. Which therefore was the Second Temple.</p>

                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:55305:160"/>
that seventy years should be accomplished in the desolations of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and praying earnestly to God in behalf of the people, the Angel <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi> by express command was sent to him to impart this Prophecie to him.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy City, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of Sinnes, and to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the Vision and Prophecie, and to anoint the most Holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement to restore and to build Ierusalem, unto the Messiah the Prince, shall be Seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks, the street shall be built again and the wall, even in troublesome times.</hi>

               <p n="3">III. <hi>And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself; and the people of the Prince that shall come shall destroy the City and the Sanctuary, and the end thereof shall be with a floud, and to the end of the warre desolations are determined.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This is so eminent a Prophecie, and so mainly to the purpose, that we are concerned to annex some short notes upon every verse, that the sense may appear more plain; and if there be any diversity of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, that we may the better shew that none does prejudice the main scope we drive at.</p>

From the Decree or Command of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> in the seventh year of his reign mentioned Ezra 7. whereby <hi>Ezra</hi> was ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to constitute Magistrates and Judges over the people, to have power of life and death amongst themselves and to live after their own Political Laws. In which concession cannot possibly but be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a licence or decree to build up the houses of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, as <hi>Funccius</hi> also pleads, their Liberty of living under their own Magistrates is the truest and most substantial sense of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their City: and vers. 18. there is express leave given to make what use they please of the Remainder of those liberal Contributions which were given for Sacrifices and religious Services. Whence it is plain the power of building the City was included in this Commission; onely <hi>Ezra</hi> cared not to begge that expresly that would be involved in a greater Grant and such as might incline the King's Spirit more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, viz. matters of Religion, as you may see vers. 23. Wherefore this is the proper Decree for rebuilding the City, or else none. For the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of the other Decrees are either for building the Temple, or else re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to the rearing of the Walls of the City, the houses having been built before, as you may see by reading the History of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Shall be seven weeks, and sixty two weeks</hi>: that is, sixty nine weeks, there being no mystery in the parting of these Numbers, saving an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Idiom to be understood from <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 45.12. and <hi>Genes.</hi> 5. often in that chapter, as also 8. vers. 3. as <hi>Grotius</hi> comments upon the place. <hi>Funccius</hi> offers at something more considerable, That the State of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Commonwealth should be more unsettled for the first seven weeks or thereabouts, as is to be understood out of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah.</hi>

                  </gap>, which signifies <hi>to cut off,</hi> not only from life, but, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> observes, from reigning as a King. And in respect of the <hi>Iews</hi> he was cut off in both these senses. For he was the <hi>Messiah</hi> their Prince whom his own people cut off from life, and thereby from themselves, that they should be no more his people nor he their King: And therefore it follows <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is not, <hi>and not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>; but the sense is, The <hi>Messiah</hi> shall be cut off by the hands of the people of the Jews, and that people <hi>shall be none of his.</hi> This exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Manasseh Ben Israel</hi> likes so well, that he applies it where it is not so natural and easie, or else is tautological. For he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets it of <hi>Agrippa</hi> the last king of the Jews, whom, he saies, <hi>Vespasian</hi> slew some three years before the destruction of the Temple, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and so the Kingdome was no longer <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s nor any of his Race. But in this sense concerning the <hi>Messiah,</hi> it being presupposed that he is cut off by the Jewish People, it is very easie to conceive that they are the Nominative Case to the Verb understood in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and that the people that cut him off should be no longer his people, by reason of this hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Act of theirs. So that upon this act the <hi>Iews</hi> ceased to be the <hi>people of God</hi>; and thus being given over, at last comes that vengeance prophesied of in the following words, that their City and Sanctuary should be destroyed by those that were <hi>designed</hi> to be the people of the Prince the <hi>Messiah.</hi> For so Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> interprets the place excellently well in my judgement, rendring <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Populus Principis futurus</hi>;

understanding thereby the <hi>Romans,</hi> in which Empire Christ was to have chiefly his Church and Kingdome. And it is most natural that as <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi> before was the same with <hi>Messiah</hi> the Prince, so the Prince here should be the same with the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the sense fitting so exceeding well.

                  </gap>, but only some Prince and people at large [<hi>the People of the Prince which shall come,</hi>] the sense thereof will be more lax and dilute, which would be more knit together and made of a more even Contexture upon Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Hypothesis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the end thereof shall be with a floud.</hi> That is, After the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the City, the <hi>Roman</hi> armie will overflow <hi>Iudaea.</hi>

                  </gap> may either signifie <hi>in one half-part of the week,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> interprets it, or else simply, <hi>in the midst of the week.</hi> In which interpretation <hi>the midst</hi> need not signifie mathematically the middle part of the Week equidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the extremes, but any part within the extremes: so that the second or sixth year of the week may be said in this sense, and that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>in the midst of the week.</hi> So that the Angel may mean no more by this expression then that what he foretells shall be done after the last week begins and before it ends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He shall make the Sacrifice and Oblation to cease.</hi> viz. The <hi>Messiah</hi> then suffering shall antiquate and put an end to the Jewish Sacrifices and Oblations. For he that was prefigured by them being come, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been sacrificed and made an oblation, it is plain that those other ceased as to right and efficacy, that is, were abrogated or abolished by the excellencie of his Person, who offered up himself once a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Atonement for the sinnes of the whole World. If Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie will but admit of it, the wit of man cannot find out a more beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:55305:162"/>
interpretation then this concerning his making the daily Sacrifice to cease. Which is as it were the Scope of the whole Prophecie. For to intimate within what week the <hi>Messiah</hi> should suffer, upon whose death the <hi>Antiquation</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law and the <hi>Introduction of the everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Righteousness</hi> depended, is a thing more decorous, &amp; more befitting so <hi>precise an Accuracy,</hi> then <hi>the Destruction of the Temple,</hi> which other Interpreters say is meant by <hi>making the Sacrifice to cease.</hi> Besides, it had been more proper and compendious to have named the <hi>Temple</hi> then the <hi>Oblations</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> if there had not been something of an higher nature meant by this Expression. The main drift therefore of the Prophecie is, more curiously to define the time, as of his Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so likewise of the Death of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which I question not but may very well be hinted at here in this Expression; and what was spoke more at large and indeterminately in the foregoing verse touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>being cut off,</hi> may here, for time, be more punctually defined: And as at the mention of his Death before, there was annexed that Vengeance upon them that murdered him; so here, where it is repeated again, the same Vengeance is repeated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for the overspreading of abomination he shall make it desolate.</hi> The Hebrew is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Which with Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> I would render thus, <hi>And commanding over a wing of abominations he will be a destroyer,</hi> i. e. over an armie of Idolatrous Gentiles, namely the <hi>Roman</hi> Armie. See also <hi>Grotius</hi> upon Matth. 24. v. 15. Whose Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, though it differ something from Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s, yet in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion does confirm it very much: He proving by several citations out of Authors, that the <hi>Romans</hi> bore upon their Standards the Images of their Gods, which in Hebrew is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. We shall only instance in that one of many out of <hi>Tacitus; Fulgentibus aquilis, signisque &amp; simu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacris Deûm in modum Templi.</hi> So fitly is this <hi>Wing of Abominations</hi> interpreted of an Armie of Idolaters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Even until the consummation and that determined.</hi> Read, <hi>and even until the consummation,</hi> i. e. the finishing of this destruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shall be poured upon the desolate.</hi> Read, <hi>it shall continue upon the distressed,</hi> viz. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The <hi>Roman</hi> armie shall continue upon <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> til they have brought it to utter devastation: or, it shall be spread like water poured out upon the desolate, in that sense that <hi>Inundation</hi> was interpreted in the foregoing verse. For, as I intimated before, this is but a repeated Prediction of the same Vengeance upon the same oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, namely, the consideration of their murdering their <hi>Messiah,</hi> which is implied in that expression, <hi>He shall make the Sacrifice and Oblation to cease,</hi> himself then becoming a Sacrifice according to the eternal coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The sense which we have given of this Prophecie is so coherent and of one piece, though taken out of several Interpreters, that no sense can be applied to any Writings more naturally. So that, as I said, if Chronologie will but favour the Interpretation, it is most certain that what we have given is the meaning thereof. And <hi>Funccius,</hi> who has made the Seventy weeks expire exactly with the breath of our
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:55305:163"/>
Saviour upon the Cross, if he could have found the ending but a year sooner, had given a tolerable and commendable account of this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie according to the latitude of the sense of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And it is not a thing hopeless, but that he and other Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers may be mistaken a year in their Computations. But whoever out of his industry and skill in History and Chronologie shall demonstrate to the World, That the Passion of our Saviour fell out some two or three years before the ending or else after the beginning of the last Week, his Invention will be more to Christian Religion then either the <hi>Venae Lacteae</hi> or the <hi>Circulation of bloud</hi> to Physick and Philosophy. For the fulfilling of this Prophecie will appear so clear and complete, that if <hi>Porphyrius</hi> were alive again, he would again be driven to say it was writ <hi>post eventum,</hi> that is to say, That the Jews have contrived a Prophecie to confute themselves withall.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The good news therefore that the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> imparts to <hi>Daniel</hi> in this Prophecie is this, That they should return out of Captivity; and that from the going out of certain Decree to rebuild <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and give it the form of a City, that is, a power of being governed by their own Laws and Magistrates, that from that time forward God had determined <hi>Seventy weeks</hi> for them, that he would give them his special Protection so long, and they should be his People, and their City should be holy, their Oblations and Sacrifices should not be antiquated, nor their Law and Religion abrogated: But within that time a new Law or Religion should begin, which should never have an end, which therefore is called the <hi>Everlasting Righteousness</hi>; and that the <hi>Iudaical</hi> Sin-offerings should then cease, that is, should be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger warrantable or effectual. For the <hi>Messiah</hi> should by that time be come, whom they will slay, and he shall by his Death put an end to all other Sacrifices, his bloud being sufficient to reconcile the whole World to God. But though the design of Divine Providence herein was holy and good, yet the Jews crucifying him out of malice and envie, (enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous wickedness having blinded their eyes) the people of the Jews shall be cast out of God's favour, nor shall they be the People of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> but a People that shall be the <hi>Messiah</hi>'s, viz. the <hi>Romans,</hi> shall come and destroy their City and Sanctuary with an utter Destruction.</p>

This is a short and easie account of the whole Prophecie, in which it plainly appears, That the foretelling of the destruction of the City is but an Appendix to the main Prophecie, and comes but in by the by, as an effect of that foul act of the Jews in slaying their Prince: But that the circumscription of the Prophetical Weeks is made by those main Designs they were allotted to the Jews for, that is, they should not expire till the <hi>Everlasting Righteousness</hi> was brought in, till the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies were fulfilled, and <hi>the most Holy</hi> was anointed, that is, till the <hi>Messiah</hi> was come, till he suffered, rose again, ascended into Heaven, sent down the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles, and set the Christian Religion on foot in the World. All which was done in the last week. After which the City was to be destroyed by the <hi>Romans</hi>; but there was no need of precisely setting down the time when.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:55305:163"/>But the noise and clatter of the devastation of it has so disturbed the Judgments and Phancies of many learned Writers, that they have very crookedly and unnaturally haled on the extent of the Weeks to reach the destruction of the City, and so have caused a needless obscurity in so pregnant a Testimonie of the Truth of our Religion. For indeed there can be no genuine or satisfactory Interpretation of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they all of them, the <hi>seven,</hi> the <hi>sixty two,</hi> with the <hi>single week,</hi> follow one another continuedly in one line, and such an <hi>Epocha</hi> be pitched upon, as that at the expiring of the sixty nine Weeks the <hi>Messiah</hi> may be manifested to the World, and in the seventieth Week be cut off, and be made a Sacrifice for sinne, and so abrogate the Jewish Law, and bring in the <hi>Everlasting Righteousness,</hi> &amp;c. To which the <hi>Epocha</hi> from the seventh year of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus</hi> does fairly lead, nor is there any other tolerable besides it; which is a further confirmation of the truth thereof. To say nothing, how there is none of the three Decrees, but that which went out in the seventh year of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> that can so fitly be called a Decree for rebuilding the City, as I have intimated already.</p>

               <p n="1">1. I Have compleated the sense of the Prophecie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and that with more accuracy then this present occasion required, I speak in regard of pitching upon that <hi>Epocha</hi> with <hi>Funccius,</hi> which is set down <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. For without being so particular there is strength enough in the Prophecie to evince, That the <hi>Messiah</hi> is already come.</p>
               <p>For from the First verse thereof it is very clear, That within Seventy Weeks the <hi>Most Holy</hi> was to be anointed, and an <hi>Everlasting Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> to be brought in. Now I demand of the <hi>Iews</hi> or any else, take their <hi>Epocha</hi> where they will, if they can finde any <hi>Everlasting Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, Law</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> that was brought in before the Expiration of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks, if it be not this of Christianity: but by the Prophecie there must be some Law or everlasting Righteousness brought in by that time. And what or who was that <hi>most Holy</hi> that was <hi>anointed</hi> within these Weeks, if it was not the very <hi>Christ</hi> whom we Christians worship? The <hi>Iews</hi> themselves acknowledge the Second Temple was not anointed: therefore it must belong to some Person; which must be the <hi>Messiah</hi> mentioned in the following verse. I may add also, how is Vision and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:55305:164"/>
Prophecie fulfilled, (the most eminent whereof was concerning their <hi>Messiah</hi>) I say, how are they compleated within the space of these seventy Weeks, if the <hi>Messiah</hi> be not yet come?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Iews</hi> have no way in the World to evade here but by forcing the most absurd interpretation upon this Verse of the Prophecie that can be imagined; as if the sense were, That those things there foretold should come to pass after the seventy Weeks. Whenas it is plain That the casting the Weeks so into parts, and expresly foretelling that in this part this shall come to pass, and in that, that; it is plain, I say, from hence, That the main scope of the Prophecie is to tell what things will come to pass before their expiration. Which we shall be the better as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of if we examine the fondness of the other Supposition, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to the words of the Text, which are these,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy City,</hi> or, <hi>cut out for thy people and for thy holy City, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to finish trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,</hi> &amp;c. If these things that follow in this verse be to be understood as foretold to come to pass after the seventy Weeks, what is the sense of the preposition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>? Questionless there can be but these two senses of it; either so as the Septuagint have translated it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, viz. <hi>that transgression may be finished,</hi> as also our English Translatours have rendered it, which doubtless is the true sense; or else it must sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the same that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and there is no sense imaginable besides these two that can be pretended.</p>
               <p>If the first, the gross Absurdity is this, That whereas there has been about three hundred Weeks for the compleating those things mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there in that verse, and they not yet done, according to the Jews opinion; yet the Prophecie mentions only Seventy, and those wherein they themselves confess nothing at all was to be done of them; then which nothing can be imagined more wilde and ridiculous.</p>
               <p>If the second, I answer that the <hi>Seventy</hi> and other unprejudiced In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters alway turn it according to the former sense. Nay, that <hi>Abar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banel</hi> and <hi>Manasseh,</hi> who otherwise pervert the sense of this Prophecie, yet they translate it so too, and yield that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> never signifies <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>until.</hi> And lastly, if it did so, yet the sense of the Prophecie would be pittiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lame and imperfect, if we compare it with the Event. For the sense would be, <hi>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people,</hi> until <hi>or</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that <hi>the everlasting righteousness be brought in, the most Holy anointed, Vision and Prophecie perfected,</hi> &amp;c. Which certainly supposes that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a little time after, at least after less then Seventy Weeks, these things should be fulfilled; and yet there has thrice seventy Weeks gone over since the expiration of the first Seventy, and no tidings of any such things. Wherefore it is more clear then the Meridian Sun, that the things there understood were to come to pass <hi>within the Seventy weeks</hi> expressly spoke of by the Prophet <hi>Daniel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, from the Second verse of this Prophecie we demonstrate, That the <hi>Messiah</hi> is come: Because from the going out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment or Decree to rebuild the City to the <hi>Messiah</hi> is but sixty nine weeks. Wherefore imagine what Decree you will, the time is run out,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:55305:164"/>
and many hundred years besides. And that this Prophecie is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of that great <hi>Messiah</hi> their Prince and Redeemer, appears plainly enough because he is called here by <hi>Daniel</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> absolutely, as being his <hi>Proper Name,</hi> whenas in all other places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it is an <hi>Appellative.</hi> Whence it is more then conjectural that the <hi>Iews</hi> had the name of their <hi>Messiah</hi> out of this place, and understood it of that <hi>Messiah</hi> we speak of. But after that unhappy mistake of theirs in refusing their <hi>Messiah</hi> when he came, they have forced other Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, though utterly unapplicable to the Text; some understanding by <hi>Messiah</hi> King <hi>Cyrus,</hi> others <hi>Nehemias,</hi> others <hi>Iehoshua</hi> the Priest, others <hi>Zerobabel:</hi> none of which conceits are so much as possible. For the <hi>Epocha</hi> from which they must reckon, must be from some Command or Decree to rebuild the City. For so the words run, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is as much as a <hi>Decree,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. And the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth put the business out of all controversie that this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is, as the <hi>Seventy</hi> often translate it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>Command,</hi> not a <hi>Foretelling</hi> or <hi>Talking of things</hi>; because <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> does not signifie <hi>concerning</hi> the restoring, but <hi>to</hi> restore. So that none that have any either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense or but moderate skill in the Hebrew, but will confess that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies, <hi>From the Decree to cause to return,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>From whence it is very manifest that none of those Persons which the Jews here offer can be accepted for the <hi>Messiah</hi> mentioned in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie. Not <hi>Cyrus</hi>; because if you will apply him to the first Decree, which was his own, the account is absurd at first sight. For thus you must reckon from the Edict of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to the same <hi>Cyrus.</hi> The other Decrees are after <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and therefore the sense will be more absurd, if any thing can be more. The reason is much-what the same concerning <hi>Iehoshua</hi> and <hi>Zerobabel,</hi> for they were the very persons that immediately execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Decree. And for <hi>Nehemias,</hi> he is a great many years too late from <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Decree, and as much too near to that Decree that went out the seventh year of <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> This I speak in reference to that Evasion they seek in the parting of the number of this Prophecie into seven Weeks, and sixty two Weeks, as if it should be but seven Weeks from the Decree to the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that is, fourty nine years. But besides that it is plain, Chronologie will not fit their turn for this subterfuge, it is further evident that if it would, it will yet appear ut a Subterfuge. For unless you will joine the Seven Weeks and the fifty two Weeks together, it will not make good sense, as any one that examines it will easily understand; and that the <hi>Messiah</hi> is not to come within the first Seven Weeks, appears in that he is to be cut off after the sixty two Weeks.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Which shall be a third argument (from the Third verse of the Prophecie) That the <hi>Messiah</hi> is come. <hi>After</hi> sixty two weeks the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi> shall be cut off, that is, not until the last Week begin and before it
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:55305:165"/>
expire. For there is no question but the Seventy Weeks being thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into parts for the setting out the time of the coming and appearing of the <hi>Messiah</hi> even to his death, that what he did visibly or suffered in the World is circumscribed within those Weeks; and therefore we may safely conclude that before the Seventy Weeks expired the <hi>Messiah</hi> was cut off, that is, that he was cut off above sixteen hundred years agoe, to wit, before the destruction of the City, as plainly appears in the Text, that makes the sacking of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> a consequent of his death: and the number of the Weeks, pitch upon what Decree you please, must needs expire many years before the taking of the City, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Messiah</hi> was cut off, and consequently came into the World so many years agoe.</p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Iews,</hi> to evade so manifest a Demonstration, tell us a story of one <hi>Agrippa</hi> their last King, and of <hi>Mumbas</hi> his sonne, whom they say <hi>Vespasian</hi> slew at <hi>Rome</hi> three years and an half before the destruction of the Temple. This was he that was cut off from the Kingdome of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and it was no longer his nor his Posterities. This is the most specious Answer they have made yet, but yet upon examination will be found excessively weak. For first it is plain from Records of History and Antiquity, That <hi>Agrippa</hi> the last King of the <hi>Iews</hi> lived nigh upon thirty years after the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> And then in the second place, if we should suppose their fiction to be true, the last week of the Seventy will either expire many years before, or run out beyond the cutting off this <hi>Agrippa,</hi> if you make, as you ought, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree for building of the City the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the account, and affix it to the seventh year of either <hi>Funccius</hi> his <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> or <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s. To all which you may adde that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> being put here so absolutely, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be understood of the great <hi>Messiah</hi> the Jews did and do still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, their own <hi>Rabbins</hi> expounding it so while they were unprejudiced; and that it is most natural to understand the same person spoken of in the whole Prophecie; who is first prefigured in the expression of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (which their own Doctors also interpret of their <hi>Messiah</hi>) by which if the Temple had been meant, it had been rather <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And therefore again an <hi>anointed</hi> Person being understood in the first verse, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> mentioned in the second and third must be the same Person; and there being in the first joyned with the mention of him not only so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred a Title as the <hi>Most Holy,</hi> but also the bringing in of <hi>everlasting Righteousness, the expiating of sin,</hi> and <hi>fulfilling of Prophecies,</hi> it is plain that so mean a person as <hi>Agrippa</hi> (or any else they have or can name) is unapplicable to this Prophecie of <hi>Daniel</hi>; such things being there fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told as are utterly incompetible to him: but such as will anon appear from other Prophecies to be singularly competible to the great <hi>Messiah</hi> the Jews expected, and are the Characteristicals of his Person, as we shall fully make good in its due place.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. IN the mean time it is so plain and apparent from these Prophecies of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Haggai, That the Messiah is already come</hi>; that any one, though secluded from all Commerce with these parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and knowing nothing of the face of things here, if he had but onely certain information that the <hi>Iewish</hi> Politie and Temple were destroyed, and could but read the above-named Prophecies, he would be sure that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was come into the World: as also out of this Prophecie of <hi>Daniel</hi> he might without any intelligence at all (provided only he took notice of the <hi>Epocha</hi> of Decrees, and how that the Weeks from any one of them would be expired many hundred years ago) infallibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr That the <hi>Messiah</hi> was certainly come. These things are so perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clear, that it is needless to add any thing else to confirm the belief of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Which yet some do by appealing to the judgement of their own <hi>Rabbins,</hi> if they themselves did not conclude that their <hi>Messiah</hi> was to come about that time we say he did. <hi>Nehemias,</hi> a Jewish <hi>Rabbin,</hi> that lived some fifty years before Christ, did openly declare out of the Prophecie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that the coming of their expected <hi>Messiah</hi> could not be prolonged above fifty years; as appears out of <hi>Grotius,</hi> if he was not misinformed by <hi>Stoctoxus.</hi> But by what he answers to <hi>Sarravius,</hi> one would think that he saw the place with his own eyes;<note place="margin">See Sarrav. Epist. pag. 52.</note> 
                  <hi>Ostendit istum mihi locum olim Hagae Stoctoxus.</hi> And that this was not one <hi>Rabbin</hi>'s opinion, but the apprehension of many of their wise men, is manifest from what <hi>Iosephus</hi> has written, <hi>De bello judaico</hi> lib. 7. cap. 31. To <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>That which excited them most of all to the warre, was a doubtful Prophecie found in the holy Writings, as if about that time some one from their Country should be Emperour of the World. This the Iews took as properly belonging to them, and many of the wise men were deceived in their judgements about the matter.</hi> Out of which words it plainly appears that the learned of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and in a manner the whole Nation, was perswaded that their <hi>Messiah,</hi> whom they thought would be the Prince of the known World, was hard at hand. In which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion they were so serious that they ventured their Lives, Liberty,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:55305:166"/>
Temple and City thereupon, that being the greatest thing that anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to that infortunate Warre. Of their firmness in which opinion a further argument is, that they were so ready to phansy this or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their <hi>Messiah</hi> about those times. For there were many looked upon for a while as such, as <hi>Herod, Iudas Gaulonites, Ionathas, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chochab</hi> and others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither does <hi>Iosephus</hi> his note upon the Prophecie that gave the <hi>Iews</hi> this confidence, he calling it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>an ambiguous Prediction,</hi> derogate any thing from the clearness thereof concerning the Time. But the character of his Person, it seems, was not so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly set out, but that they missed the knowing of him when he was come: and therefore it was necessary for <hi>Iosephus</hi> to say that the Oracle was <hi>ambiguous.</hi> But it were <hi>ambiguous</hi> indeed, if it were, as he would make it, more applicable to <hi>Vespasian</hi> then to the true <hi>Messiah.</hi> For that <hi>Messiah</hi> there prophecied of was to be <hi>cut off,</hi> which <hi>Vespasian</hi> was not; and that <hi>before the last week,</hi> whenas <hi>Vespasian</hi> besieged <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> about fourty years after. Besides that it is ridiculous to resolve the solemnity of the holy Oracles of the Prophets into so petty a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as in stead of their foretelling that one of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Lineage should become a great Prince, and sway the sceptre over the Nations (which prediction was alwaies looked upon as some peculiar Honour and Priviledge to the <hi>Iews</hi>) that only a forraigner coming to <hi>Iudaea,</hi> and for no better end then to sack their City, destroy their Temple, and make vassals of them and slaves, that this man after should be chosen Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> as others had been before him. Whether awe and fear might baffle the understanding of <hi>Iosephus</hi> so as to think this a true Glosse, though it be but servile flattery, I will not dispute: but whether he thought it false or no, that it is so, I think I have put out of Controversie.</p>

                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:55305:167"/>1. WE have, I think, sufficiently demonstrated That the time of the coming of the <hi>Messiah</hi> is expired, and therefore (the Predictions of him and Promises being not <hi>conditional,</hi> as I have above in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated, but <hi>absolute,</hi>) it undeniably follows that he is come. Upon which we might immediately infer, especially considering the Time of his coming, That <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is he. For whom else can they possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly pitch upon? But we shall proceed more punctually, and suspend that Inference, until we have laid before you those Prophecies that characterize his Person, <hi>What a one he should be, What he should doe,</hi> and <hi>What should betide him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Of which there is none so full as that of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> Chap. 53. But before I enter upon it or any other, it will be very convenient, for the preventing of all Cavils and Tergiversations, to set down a Supposition which is both rational in it self, and allowed of, nay highly magnified, in things where their Interest does not lie at stake, by the most learned of the <hi>Iews.</hi> And it is this, That that eminent Person whom they call their <hi>Messiah,</hi> being at last to give them a visit in this World, and as the very sense of his Name imports, which signifies <hi>Anointed,</hi> being to be the Top and Flower of those three Functions in which this <hi>Anointing</hi> was used, viz. <hi>Prophet, Priest</hi> and <hi>King</hi>; it is very rational to conceive, how in their Actuations by the Spirit of God, when he fell upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that while they prophesied or spake of some more considerable Priest, Prophet or King (that Wisdome guiding them which is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient and more moving then any motion, which reacheth from one end to another mightily, and sweetly orders all things) they were so actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and transported, that in that fatidical Rapture they were caught up into, the sense of their Mind and Words was carried further then the particular Person they began to describe. So that according to this Supposition we will of our own accord acknowledge that several, and those of the most eminent Prophecies that characterize the Person of Christ, did first touch upon some other Person, which was but a fainter Resemblance of him. But that after this glance they are carried to their main scope they drive at, where they pierce and are fixt, as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row stuck in the mark.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now this Reference is of two sorts, either <hi>a Perfect Allegorie,</hi> or <hi>Mixt.</hi> That I call a <hi>Perfect Allegorie,</hi> when all the expressions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Person first spoke of do very well and naturally fit him, but may be interpreted (and that more exquisitely it may be) of some more illustrious Person that comes after. Such <hi>Allusions</hi> as these are used by the Apostles and Evangelists to the great confirmation of our Faith, however the <hi>Iews</hi> are scandalized at it. For there can be no other sense of it then this, viz. That either these Interpretations which they put upon the Prophets were the known Interpretations of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and therefore very accommodate to perswade the <hi>Iews</hi> by; and it was a sign they were right Interpretations, they being made before prejudice had blinded them. Or else, that these Expositions were their own, that is, that they arose in their own minds first; which was impossible
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:55305:167"/>
they should, they being but <hi>Allusions,</hi> unless the certain knowledge of what hapned to our Saviour Christ had put them upon it. So that those allusive Proofs are to us strong Confirmations that the History of the Gospel in those things that seem most incredible is certainly true. I will content my self with that one instance (though I might alledge many others) of Christ's being born of a Virgin. Certainly unless they had known that <hi>de facto</hi> he was so, or that their wise men had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted that of <hi>Isaiah</hi> Chap. 7. to that sense, it is incredible that they should ever alledge that place for it; and they making no use of any other but this, which is only <hi>allusory,</hi> it is plain the certainty of the Event was that which cast them upon the Interpretation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I call <hi>a Mixt Allegorie</hi> that which is partly <hi>allusoric,</hi> as being applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble first to some more inferiour Person, whether King, Prophet or Priest, and then to the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and partly <hi>simple</hi> and <hi>express,</hi> not applicable to any but the <hi>Messiah</hi> himself; the Prophet being so actuated by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, that in the sublimity of that divine Heat he is in, his sense and expressions reach out further then the Person that is the <hi>Type,</hi> and strike into such Circumstances that are not at all true but in the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type.</hi> And these Predictions of this nature concerning the <hi>Messiah</hi> are as Demonstrative to those that are not intolerable Cavillers, as if the Prophecie had been wholly carried to the <hi>Messiah,</hi> without glancing or touching upon any other Person.</p>
               <p n="5">5. These things being premised, let us return to <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and peruse his whole Prophecie, that we may the more accurately judge thereof. Chap. 53.</p>

               <p n="6">6. The <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>wisest</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi> ever interpreted this Chapter of their <hi>Messiah.</hi> And the <hi>later Rabbins</hi> being convinced of the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Prophecie, and respecting the Authority of those wise In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters before them, have been some of them forced to acknowledge two <hi>Messiahs,</hi> the one the Son of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> the other of <hi>David.</hi> The former a <hi>suffering Messiah,</hi> the other <hi>victorious</hi> and <hi>triumphant,</hi> rather then to deny the evidence of this Prophecie. Out of which there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a special Tradition set down in an ancient Book amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> which is called <hi>Pesikta,</hi> which further confirms our assertion of their interpreting of it concerning the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of the <hi>Messiah</hi>; How that the Soul of the <hi>Messiah</hi> was ordained (and did gladly accept the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to suffer, from the beginning of the World. The Tradition runs thus, <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Hulsius De Messia</hi> pag. 309. and <hi>Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi> l. 6. c. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>That when God created the World, he put forth his hand under his Throne of Glory, and brought forth the Soul of the</hi> Messiah <hi>and all his Attendants, and said unto him, Wilt thou heal and redeem my sons after six thousand years? He answered he would. God said again unto him, Wilt thou undergoe the chastisements to purge away their iniquities, (according as it written</hi> (it is the Rabbins own application) <hi>Certè morbos nostros tulit?) The Soul of the</hi> Messiah <hi>answered, I will undergoe them and that right gladly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. This is enough to confirm that it was the Opinion of the ancient and unprejudiced <hi>Iews,</hi> That this Prophecie was meant of their <hi>Messiah:</hi> and, as I said, there is not any one Prophecie so full of <hi>Characteristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals</hi> of his Person as this, though not all of the like Clearness. But I dare say no less then these nine are in some sort or other included in it. 1. His being rejected by the Jews; 2. And being made a Sacrifice for sin. 3. His Resurrection. 4. His Ascension. 5. His <hi>Apotheosis.</hi> 6. The excellency of his Doctrine. 7. His Reception by the Gentiles. 8. The Destruction of their Superstition and of that divine Honour done to unwarrantable Persons. 9. And the Eternity of His Kingdome.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I shall briefly intimate in what verses of the Prophecie every of these are hinted. His <hi>Rejection</hi> by his own is plainly intimated vers. 1, 2, 3. His <hi>Suffering</hi> and being a <hi>sacrifice</hi> for sinne, ver. 4, 5, 6, 7, 10. His <hi>Ascension</hi> and <hi>Resurrection,</hi> vers. 8, 10. His <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ver. 9. <hi>He made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death,</hi> that is, with the wicked rich men, that is, great Potentates of the Earth who were rich, powerfull and injurious, those many <hi>Nimrods</hi> in the World,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:55305:168"/>
whose Sepulchres and Monuments were after magnificent Temples, and themselves deified as Gods. <hi>Because he had done no violence.</hi> The reason is incomparably solid: For if the Princes and Emperours of the World had divine honours done to them after their death who were but <hi>Magnifici Latrones,</hi> as one calleth them, much rather should the <hi>Messiah,</hi> who <hi>did no violence,</hi> but was so faithfull and good in all things, be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto this Honour, have Temples built to him, and be worshipped as a God. The 12 verse does further confirm this sense, <hi>Wherefore I will divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death.</hi> Which <hi>spoil</hi> cannot be so aptly understood of any thing as this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it being mentioned so upon these terms, after his pouring out his Soul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death. One verse illustrates another so, that I think there can be no doubt of the sense. The excellency of his <hi>Doctrine</hi> is understood vers. 11. which sets out the success of the Gospel. His <hi>Reception</hi> by the Gentiles vers. 10, 11. For if the Gentiles had not come in, there had been small satisfaction; the Jews being excluded, or rather they exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him. The <hi>Destruction of their Superstition</hi> and unwarrantable Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship they did to unworthy Persons, this is included in their Reception of Christ. The long <hi>Duration of his Kingdome,</hi> v. 8. <hi>And who shall declare his generation?</hi> that is, the permanency of his own royal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the succession of his Church that will adhere to him for ever.</p>
               <p n="9">9. This is a punctual and very reasonable account of this Prophecie: but be it how it will, yet this is out of question, That the <hi>Suffering</hi> and <hi>Glorification</hi> of the <hi>Messiah</hi> is here prefigured, and that if that in the general be not understood, there is no good sense to be made of this Prophecie. For to distort it to the affliction of the Jewish people, is very harsh, nay impossible, as appears from vers. 8. <hi>For the transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my people was he stricken.</hi> Wherefore it was not the People of God that are here stricken, but some person struck by reason of them. The most tolerable application of the Prophecie is to the afflictions of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> of whom <hi>Grotius</hi> has expounded it, (though not excluding Christ) and has made sense of it in so many places, that I do not deny but that it may be understood of <hi>Ieremie</hi> in the first and less-considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meaning; but that withall the application to Christ is not merely <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusory,</hi> but that such things are spoke in this Prophecie as cannot but with an exceeding deal of lameness and ineptness be applied to <hi>Ieremie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. And truly the very beginning of the Prophecie is too magnificent by far for the affairs of <hi>Ieremie; Who has believed our report,</hi> &amp;c. for there is nothing so incredible in all those transactions concerning him. Again vers. 5. <hi>With his stripes we are healed.</hi> It is ridiculous to attempt an application of these words to <hi>Ieremie.</hi> For he was no Sin-Offering to appease the wrath of God, but what he suffered was rather for their mischief. And that is as foolishly applied to him, vers. 8. <hi>And who shall declare his Generation?</hi> as if it were understood of <hi>Ieremie</hi>'s Longevity, then whom far less considerable men have lived much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. So frigid and frivolous is this Interpretation. Neither without violence can that Phrase, <hi>For he was cut off out of the land of the living,</hi>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:55305:169"/>
(especially considering the mention of the <hi>grave</hi> in the next verse) be understood otherwise then of the inflicting of Death: Which was not <hi>Ieremie</hi>'s case. So verse 20. <hi>when thou shalt make his Soul an offering for sinne</hi>: To interpret that of <hi>Ieremie</hi> is plainly to dote. For <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies a <hi>Sin-Offering</hi> or <hi>Sin it self</hi>; but God made <hi>Ieremy</hi> neither <hi>Sin</hi> nor <hi>Sin-Offering</hi> for his People. And lastly, to say nothing of the unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that expression, <hi>I will divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong,</hi> to be applied to that petty business of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> chap. 40. v. 5. where the Captain of the Guard is said to give him Victuals and a Reward, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated him for his Journey (the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But because all the Characters of him here included are not so full and clear as in other places, and those that are the clearest are of so much importance, that it will not be any loss of labour to adde other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations to them, I shall evidence every one of them more fully from other Prophecies.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>1.</hi> Further Proofs out of the Prophets, That the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be a Sacrifice for sinne. <hi>2.</hi> That he was to rise from the dead. <hi>3.</hi> That he was to ascend into Heaven. <hi>4.</hi> That he was to be worshipped as God. <hi>5.</hi> That he was to be an eminent Light to the Nations; <hi>6.</hi> And welcomely received by them.

               <p n="1">1. THE first mark of the <hi>Messiah</hi> was his <hi>Rejection,</hi> that he should be rejected of the Jews; but those places that foretel his <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> more strongly implying his <hi>Rejection,</hi> we need add nothing parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:55305:169"/>
thereof. <hi>That the Messiah was to be slain, and be a Sacrifice for sinne,</hi> besides that full and copious prediction of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> is clear out of <hi>Daniel,</hi> who saith that <hi>after sixty nine weeks the Messiah was to be cut off</hi>; and then adding afterwards that <hi>in the half of the seventieth week he should make the sacrifice to cease,</hi> it is plain that his Death and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Jewish sacrifices and oblations were in one Week, and that thereupon his Death was a Sacrifice, whereby those <hi>Iudaical</hi> Oblations were antiquated. For it is well known that the Temple and their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations continued about forty years after the Passion of Christ: so that it cannot be understood of the outward destruction of the Temple, and Prohibition of Sacrifices; and therefore it must be understood of the nulling of the Validity and Authority of them, their Law of sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing being abrogated by that transcendent Sacrifice of the body of our blessed Saviour upon the Cross. For there is nothing else that can be imagined to cease or take away the <hi>Iudaical</hi> Sacrifices <hi>in the midst of the last Week</hi> but that. To these we might adde <hi>Psalm</hi> 22. and <hi>Zachar.</hi> 12.10. but what has been alledged already is more then enough.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us now rather see what has been foretold of his <hi>Resurrection from the dead.</hi> And in my mind that is a very clear Prediction thereof <hi>Psalm</hi> 16. v. 8. where <hi>David</hi> being transported in his Spirit by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power writes higher matters then are competible to any but the true <hi>David,</hi> the <hi>Messiah</hi> himself. <hi>I have set the Lord alwaies before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoyceth; my flesh also shall rest in hope: For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption. Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is fulness of Ioy, and at thy right hand there are Pleasures for evermore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is so natural a description of one raised out of the Grave before he corrupt there, and ascending into the presence of God in the Heavens to enjoy Eternal Life, that nothing can be more express. But <hi>David</hi> was never raised out of the grave himself, but his flesh saw corruption. Wherefore it appears that it was a Prophecie of some other, viz. the <hi>Messiah,</hi> of whom <hi>David</hi> was a <hi>Type.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Ascension</hi> of the <hi>Messiah</hi> is lively prefigured <hi>Psalm</hi> 68. <hi>The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of Angels: the Lord is amongst them as in Sinai, in the holy place. Thou hast ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on high, thou hast led</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 1. ch. 9. sect. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Captivity captive: thou hast received gifts or men, for the rebellious</hi> also, <hi>that the Lord God may dwell among them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this be applied unto Christ, the sense is easie, especially if you take notice how the Lord was amongst them in <hi>Sinai,</hi> that is, there was one chief Angel, whom some would have to be Christ, which sustained the person of God, who might have the name of <hi>Adonai,</hi> as Christ also has, and is styled the <hi>Angel of the Covenant,</hi> Malachi 3.1. In lieu of him is here the <hi>Messiah</hi> himself attended with many Squadrons of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and receiving gifts of his Father to communicate to the World, that God might dwell amongst them, that they might be brought in to be of his Church.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:55305:170"/>4. This Prophecie also plainly points at his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> but there are also other places that make it still more clear, as <hi>Psalm</hi> 110. <hi>The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool:</hi> and then vers. 4. <hi>The Lord has sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a Priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedeck.</hi> The Jews themselves of old acknowledged this Psalm to be a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the <hi>Messiah</hi>; and the first and fourth verses are such that they can bear no other sense, but that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be greater then <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and to be a King, Priest and Intercessour at the right hand of God for ever.</p>
               <p>Also <hi>Psalm</hi> 45.6. <hi>Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; the Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptre of thy Kingdome is a right Sceptre: Thou lovest righteousness and hatest iniquity; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of Gladness above thy fellows.</hi> Him that the Psalmist speaks of here he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and it cannot signifie an ordinary King or Magistrate, because he saies, his throne is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>for ever, absolutely,</hi> as <hi>R. Moses Aegyptius</hi> expounds that Phrase. Wherefore most justly does the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrast</hi> make this Psalm a Prophecie of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> whose <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or Divinity is plainly expressed in these verses I have recited.</p>
               <p>I will add one place more out of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> chap. 9. v. 6. <hi>For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, Counseller, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of peace: of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David and upon his kingdome, to order and to establish it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth and for ever: the zeal of the Lord of hosts will doe this.</hi> I do not doubt but that this Prophecie is in some sort referrable also to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and hits upon him first, but the main scope of it is the <hi>Messiah</hi>; and that therein his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity and the Eternity of his Kingdome is set out, both the Testimony of the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrast,</hi> the Translation of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and the expressions in the Prophecie according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text is evidence enough. For they translate <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>and his name shall be called Wonderfull Counseller, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of peace,</hi> after this manner, <gap reason="foreign">

Iews,</hi> who may well be thought to understand the <hi>Genius</hi> of their own Prophets the best, have long since, before this inveterate contest betwixt the <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Christian,</hi> interpreted them so.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The sixth Character of his Person is <hi>the Excellencie of his Doctrine.</hi> This is intimated, as I said, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 53. <hi>By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justifie many</hi>; but is more fully express'd <hi>Malachi</hi> 3. <hi>The Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come into his Temple,</hi> (which might have been produced as another Prophecie of the Divinity of the <hi>Messiah</hi>) <hi>even the messenger of the Covenant, whom you delight in; behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts. But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? For he is like a refiners fire, and like fullers sope: and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of Silver; and he shall purifie the Sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in Righteousness.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is plainly denoted the <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>sanctity</hi> of that <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to communicate to his serious followers, that he would throughly purifie them and purge them from their Hypocrisie and Sinfulness.</p>
               <p>And again, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 42. <hi>Behold my servant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my Soul delighteth: I have put my Spirit upon him, he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoaking flax shall he not quench; he shall bring forth judgment unto truth. He shall not fail, nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the Isles shall wait for his law. Thus saith God the Lord, he that created the Heavens and stretched them out, he that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it, he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein; I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thy hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people, for a light of the Gentiles: To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Isaiah</hi> 49. <hi>Listen, O Isles, unto me, and hearken ye people from far. The Lord hath called me from the womb, from the bowells of my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath he made mention of my name. And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword, in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft, in his quiver hath he hid me.</hi> And verse 5. <hi>And now saith the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Iacob again unto him: Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the eyes of the Lord, and my God shall be my strength. And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Iacob, and to restore the desolations of Israel; I will also give thee for a Light to the Gentiles, that thou maiest be my Salvation to the end of the earth. My Salvation,</hi>

                  <hi>Iesus,</hi> that the <hi>Messiah</hi> may seem to be prefigured in the very name of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> as well as in his Person: As it must be confessed that both these two Prophecies do in some measure belong to <hi>Isaiah</hi> himself first. But considering how the more <hi>excellent Kings and Prophets</hi> were to be <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and that the language is so very high, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted but that in these Divine raptures and exaltations of Spirit, the Minde and Tongue of <hi>Isaiah</hi> was carried above what was competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his own Person, and therefore must naturally be transferred to the <hi>Messiah</hi>; it being plain from other places, that there was at last to come some one transcendent <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Prophet</hi> anointed in an higher manner and measure then any other. Which the <hi>Iews</hi> expected, and called their <hi>Messiah.</hi> And therefore it is therewithal manifest, that their <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be an eximious Teacher, Prophet or Law-giver.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The seventh Character is that <hi>he should be very welcomely received of the Nations</hi>; that which these last Prophecies also intimate. But I shall add others also. To this sense the Jews themselves interpreted that ancient Prophecie of <hi>Iacob <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, <hi>and he is the hope</hi> or <hi>expectation of the Nations.</hi> And there is yet one, more ancient then that, which implies it; viz. the Promise to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> that <hi>he should be a Father of many Nations,</hi> and that <hi>in his seed all</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Genes. chap. 12. v. 3. and chap. 18. v. 18. also chap. 22.18.</note> 
                  <hi>Nations of the Earth should be blessed.</hi> Of which other Prophecies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so witness. Isay 2.2. <hi>And it shall come to pass in the last daies, that the mountain of the Lords house shall be established in the top of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all Nations shall flow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</hi> The Jewish Doctours themselves acknowledge this to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the times of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And chap. 11. <hi>And in that day there shall be a root of</hi> Jesse <hi>which shall stand for an ensign of the people: to it shall the Gentiles seek, and his rest shall be glorious</hi>; or, <hi>Him shall the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles seek,</hi> viz. in a devotional way, shall pray unto him, and sing prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses unto him.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> are all one, as appears Psalm 88. v. 11. Lastly, Psalm 23. v. 2. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Aquae requietum,</hi> implies such a rest as <hi>Sleep,</hi> the <hi>brother</hi> of <hi>death.</hi> For there is nothing more prone then to lye and sleep on the shadie banks of a River. Wherefore <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may very well signifie <hi>Dormitorium ejus,</hi> or <hi>Sepulcrum ejus, erit gloriosum</hi>; that is, That it shall at last be exalted to the nature of a Temple, he shall have Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour done unto him, and the Gentiles shall pray unto him and adore him: as is intimated in the words immediately going before. But this was more then we needed to charge this Prophecie with, though it be probable enough it is contained in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:55305:171"/>There are sundry other places that serve for the proof of this seventh Character: but because it is sufficiently enough demonstrated already, and little or no controversie made of it, I pass to the eighth.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Which is <hi>the Messiah his abolishing the Superstition of the Gentiles,</hi> that is, such worship as they had no divine warrant for, they being so grosly mistaken in the Object. This is so plainly included in the two last Characters, that I need add no other proof. But if there were need, that in the 2, and 110 Psalms might further confirme it. Where he is constituted a new King and Priest; and therefore implies new Religion and Laws, and such as the heathen were ignorant of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but such as they must obey upon pain of high displeasure.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The last Character is <hi>the long Duration of the Messiah's Kingdome.</hi> Psalm 89. v. 35. <hi>Once have I sworn by my holiness, that I will not lye unto David. His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the Sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me. It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven.</hi> Also Psalm 45. v. 6. <hi>Thy throne, ô God, is for ever and ever, the sceptre of thy Kingdome is a right sceptre,</hi> &amp;c. Which Prophecie makes good the former, and shews how it is to be fulfilled in the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> See also Psalm 72. which the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Rabbins do acknowledge to be understood of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Also Daniel 2.44. and 7.27. This Character is so clear, that I need not insist any longer upon it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. These are the main Marks and Characters of the Person of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> by which we may infallibly find out who he is. And who indeed can he be according to these Characters, but <hi>Iesus</hi> whom we Christians worship? For what competitor for the <hi>Messiahship</hi> but he, was, being a <hi>Iew,</hi> rejected by the <hi>Iews</hi> and crucified? Who is it that arose from the dead and ascended into Heaven but he? Who ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered so pure Doctrine to purge the World from wickedness and to enlighten the Nations as he? It is he therefore whom the Nations waited for, and have received: It is he for whose sake they parted with their old vain and impure Superstitions, by whose Doctrine they are brought to the knowledge of the Eternal God: And lastly it is he whom for his bitter sufferings God has exalted above Angels and Archangels and all the host of Heaven, and has set him at his own right hand to be a Priest and King over his Church for ever.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. WE have now made a very considerable Progress in the proof of <hi>the Reality of Christian Religion,</hi> That it is more then a mere <hi>Idea.</hi> Let us here make a stand and breath a while, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate with our selves the peculiar Use and advantage of this present Argument, for the stopping the mouths as well of the bold <hi>Atheist</hi> as the suspicious <hi>Melancholist.</hi> For indeed it is too true, and every good man could wish it were not so, that the latter Ages of the Church have not dealt faithfully with the World, but beyond the bounds of all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and conscience obtruded upon the people fond Legends and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miracles, as if they were given up into their hands onely to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon and abused. Which consideration does cast some men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an unchangeable misbelief of the whole business of Christianity, and makes them look upon it all as a mere Fiction and Fable. For they measure the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Primitive Church by what they see practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed before their eyes now-adayes, and look upon the whole Tribe of the Priests as Impostors. Which censure though it be most unjust, yet it will be very hard to convince these Censurers but that it is very true, unless by some such Argument as now lies before us, viz. That the ancient Prophecies in the Old Testament could not be forged by the Christian Priests, and that the Jews would not forge them against themselves.<note place="margin">See chap. 1. sect. 4.</note> Nay they that know any thing of the Jews, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them so religiously addicted to the Letter of these holy Writings, that knowingly and wittingly they durst not alter a tittle. Wherefore all those Prophecies we have alledged are real, and we have made good they clearly foretel That the <hi>Messiah</hi> should come many hundred years ago; therefore it is plain he is come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I therefore demand of either the <hi>Prophane</hi> or <hi>Melancholick,</hi> who is this <hi>Messiah,</hi> if <hi>Iesus</hi> be not he. Nay I appeal to them if the very Characters of his Person be not certainly to be known by their own Senses agreeably to the Prediction of those infallible Oracles. The Prophecies have said, He should be rejected of his own. Ask the <hi>Iews,</hi> they will acknowledge they have rejected him. The Prophecies foretold he should be cut off, be killed by them. Ask the <hi>Iews,</hi> they will not deny but that they did condemn him to death, but deservedly, as they contend for their own excuse. The Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies foretold his Doctrine should enlighten the Gentiles. Ask thine own eyes if the Gentiles be not turned from their vain &amp; unwarrantable Superstitions to the knowledge of that one God that made heaven and earth, and of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> whom he hath sent. The Prophecies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured his rising from the dead and his ascending up into Heaven: and ask thine own Conscience if thou dost not believe that this was alwaies the belief of the Christians; and consult with thine own Reason, if it had been possible that the <hi>Death</hi> of Christ could have drawn all the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:55305:172"/>
World after him, if it had not been seconded with his <hi>Resurrection.</hi> Certainly those that believed on him before, had deserted him after his death, if he had not risen from the dead: but of that more fully hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Lastly, the Prophecies foretold that the <hi>Messiah</hi> should be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped as a divine Person, and receive divine Honour, and that God would make him a King and Priest for ever. Ask thine own senses, if thou dost not find it so. How many thousand Temples are there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated to his name? in how many Nations and Kingdomes of the earth is he honoured as the Son of God; Prayers offered unto him, and in his Name, and Praises sung unto him with all solemnity and devotion imaginable?</p>
               <p n="3">3. And for the Duration of this his royal Priesthood, it has continued already a faire time, about one thousand six hundred years, as may be infallibly gathered out of History. And as appears from these ancient Prophecies of the Jews, he is a Person so holy and sacred, and upon whom the eyes of Providence have been in such a wonderfull manner fixed, infinitely above any Person that ever was yet in the World, that it is impossible that the Testimonies given of him should ever be oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by succession of Time; nothing but an universal Conflagration being able to make an end of all the copies of the Jewish Oracles or of the Christian Gospel. And therefore it is a thing beyond all Likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, nay I may say all Possibility, that this Honour and Kingdome of Christ upon Earth should ever cease till the Earth cease to have Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. I do not deny but the insupportable Wickedness of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, their Faithlesness, Ferocity and Uncleanness, their accursed Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie and open Prophaneness, may make this Kingdome of Christ very itinerant and to pass from one Nation to another People; but it will ever be the Religion of some People and Nation or other: Or if not, there will at least be sincere Professors of his Name in several Nations and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, as in the persecuted estate of the Primitive Church; which will certainly leaven the World again with the Christian Religion, with more glory and purity then ever, unless a fiery Vengeance from heaven step betwixt, and Christ come again visibly so Judgement in the clouds.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The thing therefore that I say is this, That though a man should be so cautious forsooth and so crafty, as that because these latter Ages have been guilty of so much Falseness and Forgery, he will believe no Records of the Church at all, no not so much as the Holy Gospels and the Epistles of the Apostles; yet he may have sufficient assurance from the Prophecies of the Old Testament (which, unless he will be egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously foolish and unreasonable, he cannot have any pretense to suspect as supposititious) That Christianity is no Fiction, but a real Truth; if he will but compare the Prophecies with the Events of things as they lye before his eyes, and with the free Confession of those that are open Enemies to the Christian Religion, I mean the Nation of the <hi>Iews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. For the firmer belief whereof, he may also help himself some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from those strinklings that are found in prophane Writers. For if thou wilt be so prodigiously melancholick and suspicious as to doubt
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:55305:173"/>
whether there ever were such a man as Christ, the very History of the Heathens may assure thee thereof; they mentioning these things so time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as that there could be no errour about the existence of the Person they speak of whether he ever were in the World or no. For <hi>Plinie, Tacitus, Lucian</hi> and <hi>Suetonius,</hi> all of them flourished so near the time of the taking of the City of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> (viz. <hi>Plinie</hi> about twenty, <hi>Tacitus</hi> thirty, <hi>Lucian</hi> and <hi>Suetonius</hi> about forty or fifty years) that they could not but have certain information whether he was a fictiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Person or real, from the captive <hi>Iews,</hi> who would not have failed to stifle a Religion they hated so, if it had been but a Figment at the bottome. <hi>Plinie</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Trajan</hi> finds the Christian profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours in good earnest, even to death: Whose dangerous and mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous errour he might easily have confuted, if the History of Christ had been but a <hi>Romance</hi>; but he found them immovable, nor could he help it. Which constancy of theirs he calls <hi>pervicaciam &amp; inflexibilem obstinationem, a Pervicacity and inflexible Obstinacy.</hi> Which is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to think can befall men in a mere Fiction within the time that search may easily discover to be false, and that they should stand out to the exposing of themselves to death and torture. He writes in the same Epistle that he put two maid-servants on the rack, <hi>Sed nihil aliud inveni quàm superstitionem pravam &amp; immodicam, But I found nothing else</hi> (saith he) <hi>but a perverse and immoderate Superstition.</hi> And of those that fear made desist from the profession of their Religion, <hi>Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mabant hanc fuisse summam vel culpae suae vel erroris, quod essent soliti stato die ante lucem convenire, carmenque Christo quasi Deo dicere,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They affirmed that this was the sum of their either fault or errour, that they were wont on a set day to meet together early in the morning before day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break, and sing an hymne to Christ as to a God.</hi> Which is a sign that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Christians followed Christ, not as a mere eminent Moralist, that gave excellent precepts of life, better then ever any did, but that they held his Person truely Divine, and adorable for some wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful considerations or other.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But this Inquisition and bloudy Persecution of the Christians began higher then <hi>Trajan</hi>'s time, to wit in <hi>Nero</hi>'s, who, to smother that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable act of his in firing the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> did most salvagely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the Christians, as if they had been the Authors of it. <hi>Tacit.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. lib. 15. <hi>Ergo abolendo rumori</hi> Nero <hi>subdidit reos, &amp; quaesitissimis poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis affecit, quos per flagitia invisos vulgus</hi> Christianos <hi>appellabat.

Et pereuntibus addita ludibria, ut ferarum tergis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecti laniatu canum interirent, aut crucibus affixi, aut flammandi; atque, ubi defecisset dies, in usum nocturni luminis urerentur. Wherefore</hi> Nero <hi>to suppress the rumour of his own vile act, by suborning false witnesses
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:55305:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>
got those to be accused who being hatefull for their wickedness were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called</hi> Christians, <hi>and punished them with exquisite tortures. The Author of that Sect was one</hi> Christus, <hi>who in the reign of</hi> Tiberius <hi>was put to death by</hi> Pontius Pilate <hi>the Deputy. Which damnable superstition, suppressed for a time, broke out afresh, not only in</hi> Judaea <hi>the first source of that Mischief, but also in the City of Rome, whither all villainous and shamefull things flow from all parts, and are held in great esteem. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were first laid hold of that</hi> confessed <hi>themselves</hi> Christians; <hi>after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by their discovery a huge multitude were condemned, not so much for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of firing the City, as that they were hated of all mankind. They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded also reproaches to their death, clothing some of them with the skins of beasts, to be worried by dogs; others were crucified, and others were burnt after day-light, to serve in stead of lynks or torches.</hi> This Persecution was not thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years after the Passion of Christ. I appeal now to any one, if he can think it possible that these that lived so near to that time when Christ was said to be crucified, that they might make <hi>exact</hi> inquiry into the matter; I appeal to him, if he can think it possible they could expose their lives and fortunes to the hatred and cruelty of the Heathen, if they were not most certain that there was such a man that was crucified at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem:</hi> and demand further, he dying so ignominious a death, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be again possible that there should not be some extraordinary thing in the Person of Christ, to make them adhere to him so after his death, with the common hatred of all men and hazard of their lives.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And therefore <hi>Lucian,</hi> in his <hi>Peregrinus,</hi> does rightly term Christ <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:55305:174"/>
therefore there was some extraordinary worth and excellency in his Person. Which Conclusion I shall make use of in its due place.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In the mean time I shall onely add that mention made of him in <hi>Suetonius, in Vita Claudii,</hi> cap. 25. where he is called <hi>Chrestus,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>Lucian</hi>'s <hi>Philopatris</hi> he was called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Iudaeos, impulsore Chresto, assiduè tumultuantes Româ expulit, He expelled the Iews out of Rome, they making perpetual tumults by the instigation of Chrestus.</hi> Which is the highest Record of our Religion that is to be found in prophane Writers; and no marvel, it reaching so near the Passion of Christ from whence our Religion commenced. For the reign of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> began about seven years after Christ's Passion, and ended within thirteen years. And that Christ suffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate, Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> himself gives witness in what we have above recited. But a more accurate Chronologie of these things cannot be expected but from them who are more nearly concerned, viz. the Christians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Iosephus</hi> his Testimonie had reached higher in time, if we could be assured that what he seemed to write of Christ was not foisted in, by some thankless fraud of unconscionable <hi>Superstitionists,</hi> or short-sighted <hi>Politicians,</hi> that could not see that the solidity of Christian Religion wanted not their lies and forgeries to sustain it. But, for my own part, I think it very unlikely that <hi>Iosephus,</hi> being no Christian, should write at that rate concerning Christ as he does, besides other reasons which might be alledged. And therefore for the greater compendium, I shall be content to acknowledge that what is found in his <hi>Antiquities</hi> concerning the <hi>crucified Iesus</hi> is supposititious,<note place="margin">Antiquitat. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daic. l. 10. c. 4.</note> and none of his own. Which Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion I impute partly to his Prudence and partly to his Integrity. For certainly he knowing the affairs of <hi>Iesus</hi> so well as he did, could not in his own judgment and conscience say any thing ill of him, more then that he was crucified; which was no fault in him, but in his unjust and cruel Murderers: and simply to have nominated him in his History, without saying any thing of him, had been a frigid, lame business; and to have spoke well of him, had been ungratefull both to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men the <hi>Iews</hi> and also to the Pagans. Wherefore it being against his Conscience to vilifie him and revile him and his followers, so as the Heathen Historians have done; and against his Prudence, being not convinced that he was the very <hi>Messiah,</hi> to declare how excellent a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he was; it remains that in all likelihood he would play the Politician so far as not to speak of him at all.</p>
               <p n="10">10. We shall produce but one Testimony more out of Pagan Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and that is out of <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> concerning <hi>Iulian</hi>'s purpose to re-edifie the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that the <hi>Iews</hi> might sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice there according to their ancient manner. Which was looked upon to be done more out of envy to the Christians, then in love to the Jews; and in an affront to that universal and inestimable Sacrifice of the body of Christ once offered upon the Cross, which was to cease the Jewish Sacrifices, and to put an end to the exercise of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> ceremonies. <hi>Ruffinus</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> declare the matter more at large; but we shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:55305:174"/>
our selves within the recitall of what <hi>Ammianus</hi> has written, (lib. 23. near the beginning) who being an Heathen, puts as fair a gloss upon the Emperour's Action as he could; but the Event is plainly enough set down, and such as does much confirm the Truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion. Julianus <hi>imperii sui memoriam magnitudine operum gestiens propagare, ambitiosum quondam apud</hi> Jerosolymam <hi>templum</hi> (<hi>quod post multae &amp; internecina certamina obsidente</hi> Vespasiano, <hi>postea &amp;</hi> Tito, <hi>agrè est expugnatum,</hi>) <hi>instaurare sumptibus cogitabat immodicis; negotiumque maturandum</hi> Alipio <hi>dederat</hi> Antiochiensi, <hi>qui olim</hi> Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias <hi>curaverat pro Praefectis.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when this same</hi> Alipius <hi>did stoutly urge on the work, and the Governor of the Province gave him his assistance; dreadfull balls of fire breaking out near the foundation with frequent sallies, burning up sundry times the workmen, made the place inaccessible. And thus the Enterprise ceased, the Element directed by a peremptory destiny beating them off from their work.</hi>

the Apostles could not fail to have the Life of Christ written, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the erroneous attempts of the Pragmatical, to satisfie the Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Believers, or in obedience to divine Instigation. <hi>11.</hi> That it is as incredible that the Apostles neglected the writing of the Life of Christ, as that a wise man in the affairs of the World should neglect the writing of his Will when he had opportunity of doing it. <hi>12.</hi> That, it being so incredible but that the Life of Christ should be writ, and there being found writings that comprize the same, it naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That they are they.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THese Testimonies out of Heathen Writers may suffice to take off that fond and groundless suspicion of the whole History of Christ being a mere Allegory or Fiction. A thing that the greatest Enemies thereof had never the face to object to the Christians, neither <hi>Iews</hi> nor <hi>Pagans,</hi> nor our modern Atheists, especially the more nasute sort of them, such as <hi>Pomponatius</hi> and <hi>Vaninus,</hi> who do not only acknowledge Christ's Person, but his Miracles; only forsooth they referre them to the influence of the Stars and celestial Intelligences, of which I shall speak in its proper place. The <hi>Iews</hi> also acknowledge his <hi>Miracles,</hi> but add that he was a <hi>Magician</hi>: And <hi>Iulian</hi> himself and <hi>Celsus,</hi> who wrote against the Christians, never had the face to deny but that <hi>Iesus</hi> of Nazareth did once live in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> and did strange things; though the one revolted from him, and the other never believed in him. And <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocles,</hi> that highly-moral Pagan, does not deny the <hi>Miracles</hi> of Christ, nor the excellencie of his Person, but contends that <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus</hi> may at least come into competition with him. And to say nothing of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> his purpose of having him entred into the catalogue of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Deities by a decree of the Senate, because the report thereof is from parties, viz. from <hi>Eusebius</hi> out of <hi>Tertullian</hi>; we may more appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely adjoin that <hi>Adrianus Severus</hi> and <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> though in vain, attempted afterward the same thing. And particularly of <hi>Severus, Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pridius</hi> an heathen Historian writes, that this Emperour intending to erect a Temple to Christ, and to worship him amongst the rest of the Gods, was hindred by the Priests, <hi>qui consulentes sacra, repererant omnes Christianos futuros, si id optatò evenisset, &amp; templa reliqua deserenda: who by some way of divination or other had found out, that if the Emperour's mind was fulfilled all would turn Christians, and the other Temples would be left desolate.</hi> So that there was a very high and venerable opinion of Christ, even with those that were not Christians.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Which evidences out of prophane Writers surely even alone, can have no small force to beget the belief of that which I now contend for, viz. That Christ did once live here on Earth, and that he was a Person very famous and remarkable for <hi>some things in him, done by him or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to him.</hi> To which <hi>Testimonies</hi> if you add those <hi>clear Prophecies</hi> that foretold that the Jews <hi>Messiah</hi> was to come about that time that Christ is said to have lived (in which both the Heathen and Christian stories do agree) and those Characters that we know for a <note n="*" place="margin">See c. 9. sect. 2.</note> certain do belong to him, such as I have already largely enough insisted upon; it is
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:55305:175"/>
impossible, unless Scepticism be heightned unto a disease as perfect as either Madness or down-right Mopedness, but that any one should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve more of Christ then I contend for at this present.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And yet the Characters of his Person set out in the Prophecies are still more exact then what I have produced hitherto, to prove that he was indeed the expected <hi>Messiah.</hi> As that he should be of the Family of <hi>David,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Iuda</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> born of a Virgin, and in <hi>Bethlehem</hi>; that he should open the eyes of the blind, and make the lame walk, and other such like miracles; that he should be put to such a death as that his hands and feet should be pierced, that they should cast lots for his garment, and give him vinegar to drink, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But these particularities having no force till we have proved that the History of the Gospel is true, we must defer making any use of them till we have cleared that point. In the pursuit whereof we must endeavour to prove these three things. 1. That the Life and Death of Christ was writ in a serious manner by some or other; not <hi>Romantically</hi> but <hi>Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch, Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Suetonius</hi> are conceived to have writ the Lives of Illustrious Persons and Emperours. 2. That it was mature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly writ, while there were living Eye-witnesses of the things related. 3. And that those Gospels we receive now-adays, are the true Copies of those that were so maturely written.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The first part seems to me fully demonstrable from what we have proved already, without any recourse to the History of the Gospel, viz. That there was a very transcendent Eminency in the Person of Christ, as to whom both the Time and main Characters of the expected <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi> did so exactly agree: Whence he could not but attract the eyes of the World after him, and gain very zealous and faithfull Followers, that would at least by word of mouth divulge the things they saw and observed so strange and Miraculous in him. Whence he could not escape having his Life and Death written by some Pen or other, especially it being so certain he <note n="*" place="margin">See further ch. 13. sec. 4, 5. and ch. 8. sect. 2.</note> rose from the dead, as it is.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For the Jews having crucified him, nothing could be more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them then that report of his Followers, That God miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously raised him from the dead; whereby Christ was acquitted by a special hand of Providence of all their wicked aspersions and false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, and themselves condemned of the highest crime they could imagine themselves capable of, even the murdering of their <hi>Messiah.</hi> Wherefore the attestation of that which would make them so odious and execrable even in their own eyes, if it were true, must needs make the Attestors thereof very hatefull to them and unsupportable; and therefore raise against them all the mischief they possibly could. Whence it is impossible that the Disciples of Christ should maintain so hainous a falshood, no not if they had made no conscience of <hi>lying</hi>; and yet still more impossible, if we consider their <hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>Innocency,</hi> a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in them of which I think it never came into the mind of any one to doubt. I conclude therefore, That a Person so plainly prefigured by ancient and sacred Prophecies, so refulgent in miraculous Vertues and unheard-of Providences, one who for the Wonders he did, by the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:55305:176"/>
unbelieving <hi>Iews</hi> was accounted a <hi>Magician,</hi> by the Heathen Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Atheists acknowledged a Worker of Miracles, and by his own Followers proclaimed the expected <hi>Messiah,</hi> and the onely-begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of God, whom he had miraculously <hi>raised from the dead</hi> after the <hi>Iews</hi> had crucified him; I say, That a Person thus wonderfully qualified above any that ever yet came into the World, should fail of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Life historically recorded, is a thing farre more incredible then the greatest Miracle that ever was yet upon Record.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And now in the second place, That this History or Record of his Life and Death was timely enough written, viz. while the Eye-witnesses of those things which he did or hapned to him were yet living, is also very clear, if we consider the great importance of compleating such an History in due time. For certainly it could not but seem a matter of very weighty moment, Christ being believed by his Disciples to be so holy and divine a Person as he was, and that their faithful adherence to him was their onely assurance of Everlasting Life. Which great Truth of a blessed Immortality they were evidently taught by that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess their <hi>Messiah</hi> had upon earth, which was as ill as could be, he being so spightfully abused and crucified in so ignominious a manner; whenas yet they might with the rest of the <hi>Iews</hi> have expected that he should have broke the <hi>Romane</hi> yoke, and been a glorious and victorious Prince to their great advantage in this World. But they saw that Providence wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this, and by an high hand exalted him into another Kingdome, raising him from the dead and taking him visibly into Heaven. Which was so palpable a Demonstration of the Soul's Immortality, and of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar advantage to the followers of this great Favourite of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, when they were to enter into that other state; that the power of Conscience and the Sense of their own good in the other Life would make them very careful and officious <hi>to preserve the memory of their Divine Teacher,</hi> who both shewed them the way to and the certainty of Immortal Happiness. Which piece of Gratitude they were still more strictly bound to perform, it being so obvious for them to look upon Christ as a publick gift of God to the <hi>World,</hi> not to be restrained to <hi>that Age</hi> then present, but to be transmitted to <hi>all Posterity</hi>; nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within that little handful of Followers he left behind him, but to be made known to all <hi>Israel:</hi> nor could they long be ignorant but that the Gentiles also should have share in him, especially upon his Rejection by the Jews, and so he was to become the Light and Salvation of all Nations from Age to Age according to the Prophets.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That this was the early sense of the Church concerning the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ for eternal Salvation, the nature of the thing it self, as I have already intimated, doth plainly demonstrate. For what meaning could they possibly make of God's raising him from the dead, and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly assuming him into Heaven, but that he should be a palpable Pledge of that future Happinesse which was to accrue to them that would be his faithfull Adherents and Followers? This questionlesse was the belief of the Apostles and all succeeding Christians, as the <note n="*" place="margin">See Lucian his Philopatr.</note> Heathens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves witnesse of them, though in a jearing manner. <gap reason="foreign">

Which though I may seem too hasty in naming so soon, while I am but driving on a method to demonstrate That there are very time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Records of Christianity within the Ages of Eye-witnesses of the things that are recorded; yet I think I have not done preposterously, if we consider that there is a peculiar kind of Self-evidence in that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's writings that they are not supposititious or fictitious: It being, in my judgement, out of the power of man to imitate that unaffected fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, those natural and yet unexpected Schemes of high and serious zeal, those parenthetical exundances of weighty sense and matter, swelling out, I had almost said, beyond the bounds of Logical cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that vigorous passion and elevation of spirit, and yet all so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suspectable of any humane artifice, that we cannot but be assured that he that wrote these Epistles was throughly possessed and transported with the belief of the things he wrote. I am sure I cannot but be assured, and find my self in an utter incapacity of doubting thereof, who yet am naturally as melancholy and suspiciou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as other Mortals, as I could prove by early specimens of this kind, if modesty would permit me to parallel the follies and errours of my childhood with the mature conclusions of such as have affected the repute of being the great Wits of the World.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Wherefore being so fully perswaded in my self, and never meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with any one that could have the face to deny but the Epistles of S. <hi>Paul</hi> were the Writings of one that was in very good earnest, my appeal to them in this place for the sense and meaning of the first and Apostolick faith I could not hold unseasonable. But it is evident in these Epistles that the Writer of them lived within the Age of the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witnesses of the wonderful things that were either done by, or hapned to Christ. Whence it plainly appears also, That that sense of the Gospel which <hi>Paul</hi> declares in these Epistles was the first and most early meaning that the Apostles conceived concerning the Mystery of Christianity, viz. That Christ's Passion was an expiation for sin, and that we are purified by Faith in him, and that our Eternal Salvation depends on the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Now I appeal to the most Sceptical man living, if a matter of so vast moment as this, that concerns the common Salvation of Mankind in that future and Eternal state, can be sluggishly and carelesly prosecuted by those that knew both the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>importance</hi> of that affair, and had a more then ordinary engagement to look after it, and whose consciences could not but threaten them with the loss of Everlasting life, if they did not use all honest endeavours to set on foot the most effectual way they could the certain knowledge of so concerning a Mysterie. And whether it be possible to conceive the First Christians so sottish and devoid of sense, as not to see how necessary it was to record the circumstances of the Birth, Life, and Death of our Saviour, and all the Miracles that he did, while the mouths of unbelievers and gainsaiers might be stopt by recourse to Eye-witnesses of the things that were to be related of him.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:55305:177"/>10. And if we could imagine any such supine carelesness or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness in the Apostles themselves, who were the fittest to write these Records, or at least those that were throughly informed by them; yet the Forwardness and Pragmaticalness of others, who could not hold their hands from writing of such strange matters as hapned in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> though not sufficiently instructed in the truth of them, would even force them to write down the truth of the History of Christ so timely, for the preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of errour, and to set their own name to the Record. To say nothing of the Importunity of the newly-converted Christians, who could not but be extremely desirous very punctually to know all things concerning that Divine Person whose name they now religiously professed, and whom they acknowledged to be <hi>the onely-begotten Son of God.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostles themselves, or else some throughly instructed by them, could not chuse but draw up a Narration of the Birth, Life, and Death of Christ, and the many considerables therein, for the Comfort and satisfaction of their Proselytes, and that there might be a true Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these things to Posterity for ever. To all which you may adde, That if it were possible that all these should fail, (which I think is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible,) yet Providence would not fail, and supernatural Inspiration, to drive them on to the seasonable Accomplishment of so important a Work.</p>
               <p n="11">11. In my Judgement these are an undeniable Demonstration, that the History of Christ has been so timely recorded as we contend for, by either the Apostles or those that were intimately acquainted with them. And that it is infinitely more improbable that this has not been done, then that one of a great estate and many children, and wise in the affairs of the World, should, when it was in his power to write, neglect the writing of his Will. A thing that none would believe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less this Will of his after his decease could not be found; nor then haply neither, but rather suspect some body has burnt it. But if it be found, and appear such as becomes a man of his wisdome and discretion to have made, it will not be in the power of any man to doubt of it that is not interessed in the matter: and if any do, he will be looked upon as a very fool or fraudulent fellow, that sought some advantage by questioning the Will.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The case is very highly the same here, in these Records of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity we speak of. For according to plain deduction of Reason we see it impossible but that they should be writ so timely, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Event answers punctually to these Demonstrations of our own mind. For there are two Records of the Life and Death of Christ written by two of his Apostles, viz. <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> a third by <hi>Mark</hi> who was much conversant with the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> and a fourth by <hi>Luke</hi> who was a great companion of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> whose Acts together with others of the Apostles he also recorded, and ends the narration before <hi>Paul</hi>'s departure from <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>Spain.</hi> Whence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that <hi>Luke</hi> wrote his Gospel while <hi>Paul</hi> was yet alive, of whose transactions himself was an Eye-witness, as <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> of all the things they wrote, or at least most of them; and the rest they had from
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:55305:177"/>
other Apostles, who were by when they were not, or from the mouth of our Saviour himself. This Conclusion is so plain, that it is as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to deny it, as for one to deny the above-mentioned Will, which none can do without being hooted at for a Fool. For when we see external Events such as plain and undeniable Reason cannot but compute even necessary to come to pass, it must be either Folly or Fraud that makes any doubt or deny they are really come to pass, when they are exhibited thus manifestly to their outward senses.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THis it self was a sufficient Demonstration to prove that the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Life of Christ was writ so timely as I affirm, and namely by some of his own Apostles, and those that were coetaneous to them, particularly by <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> according as the Title of each Gospel does import. But we will not neglect to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what <hi>Grotius</hi> also makes use of in this place, viz. That these Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels are cited under these names by <hi>Iustin, Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Clemens,</hi> the first Fathers of the Church: That <hi>Tertullian</hi> affirms that in his time the original of some of them were extant, though betwixt an hundred and two hundred years after they were written: That all the Churches acknowledged them as <hi>Authentick,</hi> before there was any cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Councils about that matter: That neither Jew nor Pagan ever made any controversie thereof: That <hi>Iulian,</hi> though an enemy to Christianity, did expresly confess that these Writings that are under the name of <hi>Peter, Paul, Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> were indeed their writings: and lastly, That it is as fond a thing to doubt thereof, as to question whether those Poems that go under <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi>'s names be in very deed their Poems or no. Which arguments certainly cannot but have their due weight with them that are not over-pervicacious: but, as I think, I had sufficiently evinced the Conclusion before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Against which I do not see what the most perverse Wit can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or object, unless he will say That the first Records the Evangelists wrote, and the faithful Copies taken from them, were burnt, and that these that we have now-adays are an After-Forgery of the Church. Which is as bold and foolish an allegation, as if a Son, who did not like his share appointed him in his Father's Will, though the Will appear as authentick as any can do, should pretend that they had burnt the true Will, and forged this to his damage: whenas yet he cannot prove the least tittle of this Imputation. Nay I may say it is far more
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:55305:178"/>
foolish then this. For this may be feasable, to burn a single Writing, and then make a new one in the stead. But it is altogether impossible for the Enemies of the Church ever to have suppressed or made away with those First true Copies of the Gospel; which doubtlesse were in the custody of many thousand persons in severall parts of the world. For the Writings being so very little in bulk, and of so great concernment, what Christian would not have a copy of them that was but able to reade? Besides that there is not the least hint in History of any such thing. Nor indeed can any Historian witnesse of matters of this kinde. For who could assure him, if there had been any attempt of burning them, that they were all burnt? and if any were but left, they would multiply again in a moment: and that but few would be delivered up, we may be very well assured, when they bore such love to that Truth they conteined, that they preferred it before their own lives.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is therefore undoubtedly true, that the Copies that we have this day of the <hi>Evangelists</hi> are Transcripts from their first Originals, without any Interruption. The only scruple that remains now is concerning our third and last Conclusion, whether they may not be altered and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in some measure in so long succession of time, either by <hi>chance,</hi> or the <hi>pious frauds</hi> of the Church. To which I answer in the first place, That it is incredible but that the Gospels should escape as well as the Writings of <hi>Plato, Aristotle,</hi> or <hi>Tully,</hi> if we look at only such alterations as may proceed from the heedlesnesse of the Transcribers; and yet no man doubteth but that their Writings do now fully communicate their mindes to the World concerning those things they do declare, as fully and perfectly as they themselves writ them. And as for any <hi>pious frauds</hi> of the Church, I answer, That the Church was more simple and honest in the Apostolical times and some Ages after, within which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe so many Copies of the Gospel were extant, and so dispersed throughout the World, that they could not adulterate those Writings if they would. For as I have said already, those Writings being of so little a bulk, and consequently the Transcription of them so easie, the Copies would be multiplied almost equally to the number of Christians, I mean of those that could reade; and being so holy a Writ, the Transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption be made with all possible care and circumspection. For certainly Christians were very serious in their Religion in those dayes. Besides it is very reasonable to believe, that a special Providence would keep off both <hi>chance</hi> and <hi>fraud</hi> from wronging so Sacred Writings in any thing materiall; and if not materiall, what are they the worse? Not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion how Awe and Reverence to such holy Writings would naturally hold them off from mingling any thing by way of fraud or intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with them: and the Effect makes good this presage. For in peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of them we plainly discover that Harmony and agreement of one thing with another, that we may be well assured that there is nothing spurious or adulterate foisted into the Text. The multitude of <hi>various Lections</hi> also further confirms our Conclusion; which is an argument of the multitudes of Copies I spoke of: and the collection of these <hi>various readings</hi> a Testimony even of the faithfulnesse of these later Ages oft he

Church, and of the high reverence they had to these Records, in that they would not so much as embesell the <hi>various Readings</hi> of them, but keep them still on foot for the prudent to judge of. And lastly, upon perusall of those <hi>various Readings,</hi> the clear discovery that nothing at all is lost of the Truth of Christian Religion by any of them (and consequently no detriment or prejudice done to any but such as are more for factions and opinions then the real power of Godliness) this also ratifies the Truth we drive at, namely, That those Copies of the Gospel which we daily peruse are incorrupted, and that therefore those things contained in them are certainly true, as being writ by the pens of those who had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient knowledge of what they declare, being either Eye-witnesses of the same, or conferring with them that were, and both of that unsus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Integrity, that the like is not to be found in any Witnesses else in the World.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THus have we undeniably demonstrated the Truth of the Gospel and the things therein contained, and consequently the Certainty and Reality of the Christian Religion: which being done, we can now more seasonably adde some few Characters more of the Person of the <hi>Messiah</hi> so particular and expresse, that it may justly ravish us with the admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of so punctuall a Providence as is discoverable therefrom in Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Prophecies. I will not instance in many, because we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy finished our designe; and those that love to abound more in matters of this nature, may consult others that have handled them more fully and copiously. We shall only resume what we above mentioned, of <hi>his being born at Bethlehem, of the Family of David,</hi> and that <hi>of a Virgin; his making the blinde to see and the lame to walk; the piercing of his hands and feet; and their casting lots for his vesture.</hi> That these things were true of him, the Gospel plainly testifies: and that they were prophesied of him, is as plain out of the Prophecies of the Old Testament, which we shall here recite.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And first that of <hi>Micah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Micah 5.2.</note> 
                  <hi>But thou</hi> Bethlehem Ephratah, <hi>though thou be little among the thousands of</hi> Judah, <hi>yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be Ruler in Israel, whose goings forth are from old, from the dayes of Eternity.</hi> This is a very particular description of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the <hi>Messiah</hi> from the <hi>place of his birth.</hi> And it was the confessed glosse of the chief Priests and Scribes upon this Text, as appears <hi>Matt.</hi> 2.4, 5. To which <hi>Episcopius</hi> addes the suffrage of the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrast</hi>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:55305:179"/>
and <hi>R. Solomon Iarchi.</hi> But that which makes this prediction and the divine Providence more admirable are the Circumstances of its comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For <hi>Bethlehem</hi> was not the Town of abode of either <hi>Ioseph</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> nor went they thither at that time of their own accord, nor upon an ordinary occasion: but <hi>Augustus,</hi> (surely not without some special inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from above,) made a Decree that all the World, that is, all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, should have their names enrolled in publick Records. Wherefore all went to be enrolled, every one into his own Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Whence it was that <hi>Ioseph</hi> also went up from <hi>Galilee</hi> out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Nazareth</hi> into <hi>Iudaea,</hi> unto the City of <hi>David</hi> which is called <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi> because he was of the house and lineage of <hi>David,</hi> to be enrolled with <hi>Mary</hi> his espoused wife, being great with child. Whence, as <hi>Groti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> would infer, it is evident that <hi>Mary</hi> was of the house of <hi>David</hi> as well as <hi>Ioseph,</hi> else she would have resorted to the City of her own stock or kindred, and not to <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> But the admirable hand of Providence that all take notice of in this matter is this, That from this act it was so manifest to all the World that Christ was of the lineage of <hi>David,</hi> and was, according to the Prophecie, born at <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> A thing which if it had not been true, the <hi>Iews</hi> could have easily confuted. But the Christians were able to make good what they asserted, by appealing to these Records kept in the Roman <hi>Archiva,</hi> and were to be seen, as <hi>Iustin, Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Chrysostome</hi> do affirm, in their Ages. Which blows away all the foolish and fabulous Parachronisms of the <hi>Iews</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the time of <hi>Iesus</hi> at one blast.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The next Character of his Person is that he was to be <hi>born of a Virgin.</hi> Which the Evangelists affirm he was, and two Prophecies predict he should be. The first <hi>Genesis</hi> 3. from God's own mouth, <hi>That the seed of the woman should break the serpents head.</hi> Which <hi>seed</hi> certainly was <hi>Christ,</hi> who could not be properly called <hi>the seed of the woman</hi> more then <hi>the seed of the man,</hi> but that it was a prefiguration that Christ should be <hi>born of a Virgin without the help of a man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other Prophecie is that of <hi>Isaiah</hi> ch. 7. v. 14. <hi>Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign: Behold, a Virgin shall conceive, and bear a sonne, and shall call his name Immanuel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Prophecie I confess is applicable, and that with much ease and perspicuity, to some certain Maid or Virgin, suppose one that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Esay</hi> was to take to wife, at the time he spoke this Prophecie to King <hi>Ahaz.</hi> The first sense whereof is only this, That within such a compass of time that this Maid should be married, bring forth, and educate her infant, that is to say, within the time of his infancy, the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> and <hi>Israelitical</hi> forces should unsuccessfully leave <hi>Iudaea,</hi> and in the interim there should be no such scarcity as was feared by <hi>Ahaz,</hi> which is intimated in that Phrase, <hi>butter and honey shall he eat,</hi> &amp;c. The name also of the Child was therefore called <hi>Immanuel, God with us,</hi> because he was used as a sign of God's special assistance and Providence over <hi>Ahaz</hi> and his Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Moreover I cannot affirm that any of the ancient or modern Jews ever interpreted this Prophecie of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Of which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:55305:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there can be no worse consequence then this, That the first meaning thereof being so easie &amp; obvious, and made good by event, and none of the Jews ever venturing to applie it to the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that nothing but the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge of the Evangelist that Christ was indeed thus born, could move him to make this application of it to the manner of his birth. But that being certainly known, as also that Principle of the Jewish <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of giving an higher and fuller sense to the Historical or Prophetical pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in the Old Testament (all things hapning to them in types) it were impossible but that this Interpretation should be made of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie; it belonging more perfectly and properly to Christ then to <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saiah</hi>'s son: whose mother was only a Virgin before she was his mother, but <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of Christ was a Virgin both before and after; and the Prophets son merely a nominal <hi>Immanuel,</hi> but Christ was truly <hi>God with us,</hi> in whom the fulness of the Godhead dwelt bodily: And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Prophet bidding <hi>Ahaz</hi> ask a sign of God, either in the <hi>depth</hi> or in the <hi>height above,</hi> it is plain that by <hi>a sign</hi> is meant some <hi>wonderfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious sign out of the course of Nature.</hi> And therefore when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet saies, God himself will give <hi>a sign, Behold, a Virgin shall conceive, and bear a son,</hi> &amp;c. it is manifest that <hi>this sign</hi> is to be <hi>prodigious</hi> or <hi>preternatural</hi>; which was never fully nor properly accomplished before the true <hi>Emmanuel</hi> was born of his ever-blessed mother the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> For the deliverance of <hi>Iudaea</hi> from the two Kings within the space of the Childs infancy was not a Sign, but the thing signified, and a Type of the great deliverance to be wrought by Christ.

                  </gap> signifies properly <hi>a Virgin,</hi> such as never knew a man. Which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears both from the derivation and the constant use of its signification. To which you may add, That it is thus translated in this very place by <hi>Onkelos, Ionathan</hi> and the <hi>Seventy.</hi> Insomuch that this Prophecie seems to me more certainly to be applicable to Christ in the most proper sense thereof then any Prophecie else (which has any other reference then to him alone) that was ever applied to the <hi>Messiah</hi> by the Jews themselves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That of the <hi>lame,</hi> the <hi>deaf</hi> and <hi>blind,</hi> is in <hi>Isaiah</hi> ch. 35. v. 5. <hi>Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing.</hi> Which words though they may have a <hi>Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> completion in the daies of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> yet there is no question but the proper and reall fulfilling of them was intended for the <hi>Messiah,</hi> as is very sutable to what goes immediately before, vers. 4. <hi>Behold your God will come, he will come and save you.</hi> And certainly God could never be said to <hi>come</hi> so properly at any time, as in the person of our blessed Saviour, who is rightly styled <hi>God blessed for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. My last instance shall be <hi>Psalm</hi> 22. which the ancient Rabbins do freely and apertly confess to be a Prophecie concerning the <hi>Messiah.</hi> In which some particular passages, however express and precise, did never happen to any other that they can entitle to the Psalm, but did punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and literally happen to <hi>him.</hi> As that vers. 18. <hi>They parted my gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

But the particular prediction of that former circumstance seems admirable, that <hi>the manner of his death</hi> should be so punctually set down by the Prophet. For this was very really and literally fulfilled in his <hi>Crucifixion</hi>; wherein the <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>feet</hi> of Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors were <hi>pierced</hi> with nails whereby they were fastned to the Cross.

For when they have made the best they can of it, yet are they, whether they will or no, forced to acknowledge that there is some special execution or mangling done on the hands and feet, by the sense of the Text. But that it is just so as we ordinarily interpret it, the suffrage of the most learned of the Jews themselves,<note place="margin">See <hi>Grotius</hi> on Psal. 22. v. 18.</note> as <hi>Iacob Ben Chaiim, Moses Hadarsan,</hi> and the <hi>Seventy</hi> do sufficiently confirm.

being certain of it, by reason of the great hazards they underwent thereby.</head>
               <p n="1">1. I Might note other remarkable Particulars out of this Psalme and other places that do contribute to the more punctual characterizing the Person of Christ; but I have already exceeded the limits of my own design, which was to engage in these things only so far as might suffice to demonstrate the <hi>Reality</hi> of the Mystery we treat of. Which when we have confirmed by one Argument more, and answered an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection or two, we shall then put an end to this Third part of our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
               <p>The last Argument therefore is briefly this, A Religion so unassisted by men, nay, so opposite to them, both their natural Belief and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, could never have spred it self so in the World, if it had been false and fabulous, and not really true at the bottome. How mightily it spred it self, appears out of the History of the Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles, as also out of the Epistles of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> even then when the greatest opposers of it, the Jews, were upon the spot, to whom it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for them first to preach it, and who had opportunity to enquire diligently touching the matter of Fact, of every thing that was alledged by the Apostles after the Passion of Christ, as done by him or hapning to him, or done by themselves, after they had received the Gift of the Holy Ghost according to promise, and wrought such Miracles as he did. There were many thousands of the Jews converted, whom it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to imagine, at least all of them, (and the more inquisitive and nasute might have undeceived the rest) to have been so supine and careless, as not to enquire diligently into things in a matter of so great importance as their Eternal Salvation, and of so present dammage and loss to them that they forfeited the favour of all their countriemen, and unavoidably charged them and their Rulers with the most impious Crime that ever Mortals could commit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the <hi>Success</hi> rested not here, but reached out of <hi>Iudaea</hi> into all parts of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, there being gained innumerable companies of Believers every where, till at last Nations and Kingdomes and Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptres, and, in a word, the whole Roman Empire became Christian. This is the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>story,</hi> which no man can deny; and that this <hi>story</hi> could not be <hi>true,</hi> unless the Christian Religion be true also, I mean those <hi>miraculous</hi> things which are recorded of Christ and his Apostles, is further demonstrable, as well from the <hi>harshness</hi> as the <hi>incredibility</hi> of the Doctrine of this Religion, as also the <hi>weakness</hi> and <hi>contemptibleness</hi> of the <hi>first Founders</hi> and Disseminators of it. For whether we consider the <hi>Precepts of Christianity,</hi> they are very <hi>strict</hi> and <hi>severe,</hi> very unkind and unwelcome to flesh and bloud, such as the <hi>Animal life</hi> cannot at all relish nor entertain, unless some extraordinary thing be adjoined, that forces admittance. <hi>Self-denial, Mortification,</hi> the putting a man in a way of necessary or very probable <hi>persecutions</hi> and <hi>afflictions</hi> from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, besides the <hi>renouncing of those pleasures</hi> that no external power hinders him of, can be no acceptable news to the natural man. Besides
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:55305:181"/>
the <hi>Scoffs</hi> and <hi>Reproaches</hi> of the world that would undoubtedly follow their change of Religion. Which change could not but seem still more grievous and intolerable, in that it was to be whole and entire from the present Superstition they were educated in, which they were utterly to renounce. Whence their hazard and infamie could not but be greater.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the undergoing of which hardships they had nothing to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themselves but the belief of such things which a man would think might startle them most of all, that is, their Reward after this life, no other waies ascertained to them, but by the rising of one from the dead after he had been three daies buried; which was exhibited to them as a pledge of that blessed Resurrection which those that embraced the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian doctrine should enjoy at the burning of the World, and turning the Earth into ashes and cinders. A thing so <hi>incredible</hi> to humane wit, that no man unless he was really convinced by some infallible way that it was so indeed, could ever admit of, or abstain from denying with an addition of scoffs and derision, as it fell out with the <hi>Epicureans</hi> and <hi>Stoicks,</hi> Acts 17.18. Wherefore without all controversie the first embracers of Christianity entertained it upon no other terms but manifest proof of Eye-witnesses, and the Evidence of such persons as they saw very faithful and serious, and as had the effect of this great power of God, that raised <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> from the dead, manifestly residing upon themselves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were able to doe Miracles; as is also recorded in the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now for the <hi>First</hi> Authours and <hi>Founders</hi> of this Religion, how <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>contemptible</hi> they were as to worldly concernments, appears plainly from hence, that they were not recommended to the World ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their nobility of Birth, or skill in humane Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, nor had they any secular power to assist them, nor any force of arms to either overcome others, or defend themselves, for all they were exposed to so great and imminent dangers perpetually. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himself was but of mean Parentage, a Carpenters Son, crucified betwixt two thieves as a hainous Malefactor. What therefore can there be imaginable that should move his Apostles and Disciples to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to him so faithfully after his death, and to expose themselves to all manner of jeopardies, all manner of sufferings, whippings, imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, long journies, tortures, and death it self? What should cause them to disturb their own peace so, and the peace of all men, if there were not some very miraculous thing at the bottom, and such as was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to alarme all the World? What message could they have brought to those several Nations they travailed to, that themselves would not be ashamed of carrying, if it had been only so, That the Jews had cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied one <hi>Iesus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ioseph</hi> a Carpenter, betwixt two thieves at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> who yet was a very good and Just man? It may be so, would the Gentiles say; More shame for them; what is that to us? But this man was the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> and did very strange Miracles, cast out devils, healed all manner of diseases, and was declared the Son of God by an audible voice from the Heavens. As for the <hi>Miracles</hi> you mention, would the Gentile reply, we have heard strange things done by those
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:55305:181"/>
that are called <hi>Magicians</hi>; and we had no acquaintance with the party you speak of, to discern whether he was so good as you pretend. For mens Judgments are ordinarily partial out of affection and friendship: and it is strange that if he were so good as you make him, and declared from the clouds to be the Son of God, that God would suffer him so ignominiously to die betwixt two Thieves on the Cross. Which is a sign that if he did any <hi>Miracles,</hi> they were but from such powers as are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Magistrate, and through that faithfull Providence that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the affairs of men, can doe nothing when the <hi>Magician</hi> is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, imprisoned and condemned. Truly if there had been no more then this in the Story, it seems impossible that the Cause should have had such <hi>Success</hi> as it has had.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Wherefore certainly the <hi>First Preachers</hi> of the Gospel added to all this, to the admiration and astonishment of the hearers, That this <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> whom the Jews had thus crucified, was by the miraculous hand of God raised out of the grave the third day; That after his Resurrection he conversed with his disciples both apart and together; That he was seen of above five hundred at once; That he staid upon earth for <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 1. v. 3.</note> fourty daies, and was seen visibly afterward to ascend into Heaven. Which things as they were above all expectation marvailous, and did, if they were true, fully argue not only the Innocency but transcendent <hi>Divinity</hi> of the Person of <hi>Iesus</hi>; so were they so <hi>incredible,</hi> that none could believe them, especially to their present peril, unless from such as were Eye-witnesses of the same, and could send them to many more that were Eye-witnesses, and of unsuspected integrity of life; or for the better compendium, shewed that they were true messengers sent from God, by some <hi>Signs</hi> or <hi>Miracles</hi> they did upon the spot.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This therefore was the main of their message, which was nothing but matter of Fact, which themselves knew certainly to be true, and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and earnestly declared it to the World, not by any Art or Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. For the Apostles were but poor illiterate persons, Fishermen, Publicans, and the like, had no other weapons to win men to the Faith, but by a simple, though earnest and serious, narration of those things they knew for certain, and did avouch with that confidence, that they gave up their ease, livelihood and lives, for a pledge of the truth thereof. Which Testimonie could not possibly be false, it being (as I said before) concerning matter of Fact, namely, the Resurrection of Christ, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in so many could not be deceived: Nor is it imaginable how they should goe about to deceive others against their own Consciences, or without sufficient knowledge in a thing that gained them nothing but perpetual Hatred and ill will, Imprisonments, Tortures and Death. In the mean time, by these poore contemptible Instruments, that had neither Political power on their side (but were oppressed by it) nor had any Art nor Eloquence (excepting only <hi>Paul,</hi> who yet made use of neither) and by succession of such as they had converted, within a few Ages all the World in a manner swarmed with Christians of all qualities and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, noble and ignoble, learned and unlearned, though invited thereto by no secular advantage, but rather being perpetually exposed to misery
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:55305:182"/>
and persecution. All which things seriously considered together with the <hi>exactness</hi> and <hi>perspicuity</hi> of <hi>Prophecies</hi> concerning the <hi>Messiah,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but seem to any indifferent judge a Demonstration for the Truth of Christian Religion no less certain then Mathematical.</p>

THE <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 13. sect. 1.</note> Objections we were a mentioning are from two hands; from the <hi>Iew,</hi> or from the <hi>Atheist.</hi> That from <hi>Iew</hi> is chiefly this, That the condition of the times under Christ is not conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to what is prophesied concerning the times of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> There is not that Peace and Concord, no not in Christendome it self, neither in the Church nor State; nor is Idolatry extirpated, nor the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> replanted and setled in their own land: all which things notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing are foretold to come to pass in the dayes of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Whence, say they, it is plain he is not yet come.

That the nature of the Gospel tends altogether to the accomplishing of those Promises of universal Peace and Righteousness, and did begin fair in the first times of the Church as much as respects the Church it self. 3. That whatever Relapse or Stop there has been, things are not so hopeless but in time they may be amended; and that they, in those days when they are true Converts to Christ, may, if they will then desire it, return to their own Land. But after this serious conversion and real renovation of their Spirits into a true Christian state, I cannot believe they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue so childish as to value such things; but will find themselves in
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:55305:182"/>
the Spiritual <hi>Canaan</hi> already, and on their march to that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> which is above, the Mother of us all, and that it will not be in the power of any but themselves to turn them out of the way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other Objection, or rather Evasion of that wholesome use that may be made of the Truth of the History of Christ, is from that sort of Atheists that love to be thought <hi>Aristoteleans:</hi> For there are two chief kinds of Atheisme, <hi>Epicurean</hi> and <hi>Aristotelean.</hi> The former denies all <hi>Incorporeal substance</hi> whatsoever, and all <hi>Apparitions, Miracles</hi> and <hi>Prophecies</hi> that imply the same.

The other are not against all <hi>Substances Incorporeal,</hi> nor against <hi>Prophecies, Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Miracles,</hi> though of the highest nature; insomuch that they will allow the History of Christ, his Resurrection, and Appearance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death, the Prophecies concerning him, and what not? But they have forsooth this witty Subterfuge to save themselves from receiving any good therefrom, in imagining that there is no such <hi>Particular Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> as we would inferre from hence, because all this may be done by the <hi>Influence</hi> of the <hi>Celestial Bodies,</hi> actuated by the <hi>Intelligences</hi> apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to each Sphere, and deriving in a natural way from him that sits on the highest of the Orbs such influences as according to certain Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodical courses of Nature will produce new Law-givers, induing them with a power of working Miracles, assisting them by Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Visions of Angels, making them seem to be where they are not, and appear after they cease to be, namely after their death: when in the mean-time there be neither Angels, nor Souls separate, but all these things are the transient Effects of the power of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Configuration of the Celestial bodies, which slacks by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and so the Influence of the Starres failing, one Religion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caies and another gets up. Thus <hi>Iudaisme</hi> has given place to <hi>Christianity,</hi> and Christianity in a great part of the World to <hi>Mahometisme,</hi> being Establishments resulting from the mutable course of Nature, not by the immediate finger of God, who keeps his throne in the Eighth sphere, and intermeddles not with humane Affairs in any particular way, but onely aloof off hands down, by the help and mediation of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Intelligences and power of the Starres, some general casts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence upon the Generations of the Earth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A goodly speculation indeed, and well befitting such two witty Fools in Philosophy as <hi>Pomponatius</hi> and <hi>Vaninus:</hi> the latter of which seems not to give himself up to this fine figment altogether fully and conformably to the ancient doctrine of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> but having a great pique against Incorporeal Beings, is desirous to lessen their number as much as he can, and seems pleased that he has found out, That one only Soul of the Heavens will serve as effectually to do all these things as the <hi>Aristotelean Intelligences</hi>; and therefore ever &amp; anon doubts of those, and establisheth this as the onely Intellectual or Immaterial Principle and highest Deity; but such as acts no otherwise then in a natural way by Periodical Influences of the Heavenly Bodies. Where you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the craft and subtility of the man, what a care he has of his own
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:55305:183"/>
safety, and how he has imprisoned the Divinity in those upper rooms for fear of the worst, that he may be as far out of his reach as the Earth is from the Moon. So cautious a counseller in these matters is an evil and degenerate Conscience.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This is the chiefest <hi>Arcanum</hi> that the <hi>Amphitheatrum</hi> and famed <hi>Dialogues</hi> of this stupendious Wit will afford; who was so tickled and transported with a conceit of his own parts, that in that latter Book he cannot refrain from writing down himself a very Good for wisdome and knowledge. Whenas, assuredly, there was never any mans Pride and Conceitedness exceeded the proportion of his wit and parts so much as his. For there is nothing considerable in him but what that odd and crooked Writer <hi>Hieronymus Cardanus</hi> had, though more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly, vented to the world before: onely <hi>Vaninus</hi> added thereto a more express tail of bold Impiety and Prophaneness.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I have elsewhere intimated how the attributing such noble Events to the Power of the Starres is nothing but a rotten relick of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Pagan Superstition; and have in my Book <hi>Of the</hi>

                  <hi>Immortality of the Soul</hi> plainly enough demonstrated that there is no such inherent Divinity in the Celestial Bodies as that ancient Superstition has avouched or modern Philosophasters would imagine. And I shall here evidently prove against this great Pretender, That his removal of the Deity at that distance from the Earth is impossible. For there are scarce any now that have the face to profess themselves Philosophers, but do as readily acknowledge <hi>the Motion of the Earth,</hi> as they do the reality of the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> or the <hi>Circulation of the Bloud.</hi> I would aske then <hi>Vaninus</hi> but this one question, Whether he will not admit that the Sun is in that Heaven where he imagins his <hi>Anima coeli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> and whether this Heaven be not spred far beyond the Sun, and be not also the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence of this celestial Goddess of his. There is none will stick to answer for him, that it is doubtlesly so. Wherefore I shall forthwith inferre, that let his unskilful phansy conceit us at this moment in as low a part of the Universe as he will, within the space of six months we shall be as far above or beyond the Sun as we are beneath him now, and yet then phansy our selves as much beneath him as before. Which plainly implies that our Earth and Moon swim in the liquid Heavens, which being every where, this Deity of <hi>Vaninus</hi> must be every where, though his degenerate Spirit was afraid of so holy a Neighbourhood, nor could abide the belief of so present a <hi>Numen.</hi> Thus has the Annual Course of the Earth dashed off all that Superstitious power and sanctity that ancient Paganisme has given and the <hi>Aristotelean</hi> Atheist would now give to the Sun, Planets and Starres; and we are forced even by the light of Nature and humane Reason to acknowledge the true Principle from whence all miraculous things come, that is, a God, every where present, in whom we live and move and have our being.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Besides this, suppose that all Prodigies, Apparitions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies were from the intermediate Influence of the celestial Bodies, these Intelligences or that <hi>Anima Coeli</hi> working thereby upon the persons of men, to inspire them, and turning the Aire into representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:55305:183"/>
and visions to converse with them; This covering is too scant to hide the folly of this sorry Sophist, his Supposition plainly ruining it self. For he does acknowledge that those Inspirations and Prophecies are true that are thus derived from those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>idereal Powers. But it is evident that those that have been the most illustrious Prophets, have had converse with Angels, and talked with them, and have so recorded the matter to the World. As for example, the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> who discoursed with the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi>; Christ also discoursed with <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> on Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> with the Angel of God on Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> Besides Christ, who was so highly inspired and assisted from Heaven, has over and over again pronounced a future Happiness after this life. All which, allowing them for a while to be the dictates or representations of the Astral Influences, I demand of <hi>Vaninus,</hi> how he comes to be wiser then those that were so miraculously assisted, That these Visions of Angels should not be so as they that saw them have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> should not be the Spirits of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> but onely transient Figurations of the Aire raised by the Influence of the Heavens. Moreover I would ask of him if he think that that Heavenly assistance that can according to his own acknowledgement inform men of things to come at a thousand years distance, (for such was the prediction of the death of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> in the Senate, though a matter very contingent,) cannot certainly inform them whom it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses so wonderfully to assist, whether the Souls of men be mortal or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, which is far more cognoscible to those aethereal Powers then the other. Wherefore this wretched Figment of his to excuse himself from the acknowledgement of the Existence of Angels or Daemons, and the Subsistence of the Soul after death, from which he so much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors, will stand him in no stead, but argues him more intoxicated, whif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and giddy, in admitting the truth of such Narrations, and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the genuine consequences of them, then they that give no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the Narrations themselves.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That which was objected of <hi>Christianity</hi> justling out <hi>Iudaisme,</hi> and of <hi>Mahometisme</hi> in a great part of the World justling out <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> is partly false and partly nothing to the purpose. That <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> has properly justled out <hi>Iudaisme,</hi> is very false. For <hi>Iudaisme</hi> has rather been ripened into the perfection of <hi>Christianity,</hi> then been sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled and sufflaminated by any Counter-blast of those sidereal Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he dreams of. For we see how things have gone on in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued design from <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 5. chap. 17. sect. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> to Christ, as the <hi>Prophecies</hi> and the <hi>Predictions</hi> in Scripture plainly testifie. God promised to <hi>Abraham</hi> that in his seed all the Nations of the Earth should be blessed. <hi>Iacob</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells on his death-bed, that the Jewish Polity and Religion should not fail till the <hi>Messiah,</hi> a <hi>Iew</hi> and Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> was come, to whom the gathering of the Gentiles should be: and so in other <note n="*" place="margin">Book 7. ch. 5, 7, 8.</note> Prophecies which we have already recited and applied. From whence it is manifest, that it is the hand and counsel of God who is constant to himself, and whose Wisdome and Providence reaches from end to end, that has begun and carried on this matter according to his own will and purpose, and not
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:55305:184"/>

Nor could any thing but Levity of minde and Vain-glory induce <hi>Cardan</hi> to pretend the calculating of our Saviours Nativity, whenas the year of his Birth is so uncertain amongst the most accurate Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers, and Astrology it self a thing wholly groundlesse and frivolous, as I shall demonstrate anon. Nor is it any <hi>specimen</hi> of his Wit, but of his grosse Impiety, so boldly to equalize the rise of <hi>Mahometisme</hi> to that of <hi>Iudaisme</hi> and <hi>Christianity,</hi> as if <hi>Moses, Christ</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> were all <hi>Astrall Law-givers,</hi> alike assisted and inspired from the influence of the Stars. A conceit that <hi>Vaninus</hi> is so transported with, that he cannot tell what ground to stand upon when he cites the passage out of <hi>Cardan,</hi> he is so tickled with Joy. But that this exultation of his is very chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish and groundlesse, appears, both in that he falsly attributes <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Divine Laws</hi> and <hi>Miracles,</hi> to the influence of the Stars (a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious errour that arises only out of the ignorance of the right Systeme of the World;) and then again (if it were true) that he imagines <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> (who was a mere crafty Politician, and did neither Miracles, nor could prophesie) to be a Law-giver set up by the miraculous Power of the Heavens, such as enables Divine Law-givers and Prophets to do reall Miracles. To which you may adde the ridiculous obstinacy of this perverse Sophist, who the more we give him of what he contends for, (<hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Mahomet</hi> also is a <hi>Star-inspired</hi> Prophet, that is to say, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated from the <hi>Anima coeli,</hi> which according to his opinion is the highest and most infallible principle of miracles and divine wisedom,) the more ample testimony we have against his own folly, that so perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily denies the existence of <hi>Daemons,</hi> and Subsistence of the Soul after Death. Which are openly avouched by this third Witnesse of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing: and therefore he abhorring so from such Truths as are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly dictated from the <hi>Celestiall Bodies,</hi> did not excesse of Pride and Conceitednesse blinde his judgement and make him senseless, he could not but have found himself stung with that lash of the Satyrist,

               <p n="1">1. I Shall therefore make this short Digression to expose to your view the extreme folly and frivolousness of the pretended Art of Astrology, whose main general Reasons and particular Principles are in brief as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>First, They alledge, that it is a thing beyond all belief, that such an innumerable company of Starres, whose light is not considerable, nor their position so exact for ornament, should be made for nothing else but to look upon. Therefore, say they, there is some other Mystery in it, and that they are endued with certain hidden Influences, and have their severall peculiar Virtues, as distinct as the Herbs and Flowers of the field, and it is their Art of <hi>Astrology</hi> that professeth the Knowledge thereof.</p>
               <p>Again, the Earth and Water being such <hi>simple bodies</hi> as they are, the <hi>various</hi> productions in Nature could not be, were it not for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Variety of those Celestiall bodies, the Starres, and their severall influences upon the Earth. This their great Champion Sir <hi>Christopher Heydon</hi> urges as a principall Argument for them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That it is plain that the <hi>Moon</hi> hath a moist influence, and that at her full the Brains of Beasts generally, the Eyes of Cats, and the meat of Shell-fishes are swell'd to a greater bigness; and that they are lessened in the change.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That the <hi>Moon</hi> also, to our wonderment, guides the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea, whose influence is equally seen when she is under the Horizon as when above, when near our <hi>Nadir</hi> as when near our <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith.</hi> Whence, say they, it is plain that the Heavenly bodies have not only a power or influence, besides <hi>Light,</hi> but more searching and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating then Light it self, as being able to make its way through the thickness of the Earth, and to reach its effect on the further side there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Both which wonders they further confirm from the <hi>Magneticall Needle,</hi> hat looks toward the <hi>Pole-starre,</hi> though on the other side of the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn</hi>; where the Northpole will be hidden twenty or thirty degrees below the <hi>Horizon.</hi> Whence it is manifest, say they, that the influence of the <hi>Pole-starre</hi> pierces through the bowels of the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:55305:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Earth, and is a notorious argument of that secret and irresistible virtue of the rest of the Heavenly bodies.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Station, Direction and Repedation of the Planets is a thing so strange and mysterious, that it is not likely they should make those odde motions, unless those waglings this way and that way, those goings backward and forward were a certain reeling or spinning the Fates and Fortunes of Things or Persons here below.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and lastly, Yearly experience teaches us that the approach of the Sun renewes the World, and makes an annuall Resurrection of Plants and Insects, and such living creatures as are born of Putrefaction, and have no other Father then the fiery-bearded Sun. If then this one Planet does such rare feats, certainly the rest of the Planets and fixed Starres do not stand for cyphers, but have their virtues and operations as well as he, whose efficacy and influence, say these Starre-gazers, our Art does punctually and particularly define. You may adde if you will out of <hi>Origanus,</hi> the heat of the <hi>Dog-Starre,</hi> and the moist influence of <hi>Arcturus</hi> and the <hi>Hyades.</hi> These are the <hi>generall</hi> Plausibilities that these Deceivers endeavour to countenance their Profession by. But we shall now set down the main <hi>particular</hi> Principle and fundamentall Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of their so-much-admired Science, as they would have it estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and then shall orderly answer to them both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. According therefore to <hi>Origanus,</hi> whom I shall chiefly follow in setting down these Astrologicall Principles, I do not say all, but what is sufficient; nor will I set down any but what they acknowledge for Principles, nor omit any that are so considerable as these I set down;</p>
               <p>First, It is taught by them, That the <hi>Planets</hi> have the most influence upon Terrestriall bodies, but that the <hi>fixt Stars</hi> also as well as they have virtues so potent as to pierce the very penetrals of the Earth: That of the Planets the <hi>Sun</hi> is hot and moist rather then drying: That <hi>Mars</hi> is hot and parchingly drying: That <hi>Saturn</hi> hinders the warm influence of the other Starres, and is in an high degree frigefactive, as also exsicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. From these two Qualities contrary to the Principles of life, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> is termed <hi>Infortuna major, Mars, Infortuna minor</hi>; because heat is not contrary to life, though driness be. <hi>Iupiter</hi> is also deemed <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuna major,</hi> because he has sufficient moisture well tempered with heat. But <hi>Venus, Fortuna minor,</hi> because her moisture exceeds her warmth. From this distinction of <hi>hot, cold, dry</hi> and <hi>moist,</hi> the Planets are also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into <hi>Masculine</hi> and <hi>Feminine, Diurnall</hi> and <hi>Nocturnall,</hi> &amp;c. So that if these conceits of <hi>drinesse, moistnesse, coldnesse,</hi> and <hi>heat</hi> fail, all the rest fail.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But I think that Principle more observable which is touched upon already, That the influence of the Starres and Planets do pass freely through the Earth: which is implied in that Aphorisme of <hi>Ptolemy</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Origanus, Masculescere &amp; efficaciores dici Planetas, qui ab Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zonte ortivo vel occiduo deducuntur ad Meridianum supra vel infra terram. Effoeminari verò qui contrá.</hi> Which plainly implies, that their influences pass as easily through the Earth as through the Air: otherwise surely
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:55305:185"/>
those Planets that tended from the Western <hi>Horizon</hi> toward the <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> under the Earth, would have the disadvantage of it. That also goes upon the same <hi>Hypothesis</hi> that the Earth is no impediment, namely, That <hi>Iupiter</hi> being <hi>Consignificatour</hi> in the second House, denotes Riches; and that by how many more Planets there be in the sixth House, by so much more subject to diseases the Childe will be. That the sixt Starres and Planets do most potently act in the <hi>Cardines</hi> of the <hi>Celestiall Theme,</hi> of which <hi>Imum Coeli</hi> is one. Which supposes the Earth as pervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as the very Air to the Celestial influences.</p>
               <p>To omit other divisions of the Signes into <hi>Mobilia, Fixa,</hi> and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporea,</hi> into <hi>Masculine</hi> and <hi>Feminine,</hi> &amp;c. I shall only set down that more noised division of them into <hi>Trigons, viz.</hi> The Fiery Trigon, <hi>Aries, Leo, Sagittarius</hi>; the Earthly, <hi>Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn</hi>; Aere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, <hi>Gemini, Libra, Aquarius</hi>; Watery, <hi>Cancer, Scorpius, Pisces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They teach us also fine things of the <hi>Dignities</hi> of the Planets: which are either <hi>essential</hi> or <hi>accidentall.</hi> An <hi>essentiall Dignity</hi> is nothing else but the encrease of the innate virtue of the Planet by being in such or such a signe of the Zodiack, as <hi>Origanus</hi> has defined.</p>
               <p>The first <hi>essential</hi> Dignity is <hi>the House</hi> of the Planet. As for example, <hi>Leo</hi> is the House of the Sun, <hi>Cancer</hi> of the Moon. And because there are more Signes then Planets, it fals to the share of the rest to have two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses apiece, so aspected to the Houses of the Luminaries as becomes the goodnesse or malignity of their Natures. As for example, <hi>Capricorn</hi> and <hi>Aquarius</hi> must be the Houses of unfortunate <hi>Saturn,</hi> because their aspect is opposite to the Houses of the Luminaries. <hi>Sagittarius</hi> and <hi>Pisces</hi> the Houses of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> because the aspect to the foresaid Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Sun and Moon is a benigne aspect, namely, <hi>Trine.</hi> But now <hi>Mars</hi> has <hi>Aries</hi> and <hi>Scorpius</hi> for his Houses, because he forsooth himself being a malignant Planet may have his Houses in a malignant posture to the Houses of the Sun and Moon, namely, in a <hi>quartile</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, &amp;c. And as to be in their own Houses is a <hi>Dignity,</hi> so to be in the Signe opposite they call <hi>Exilium,</hi> and account it a great detriment to the Planet.</p>
               <p>To second essential Dignity is <hi>Exaltation:</hi> as <hi>Aries</hi> is the exaltation of the Sun, because his efficacy is so apparent in Spring, and therefore his <hi>Casus</hi> must be in <hi>Libra:</hi> which must on the contrary be the exaltation of <hi>Saturn,</hi> that Planet being of a cold temper contrary to the Sun. The <hi>Dragon's head</hi> also is exalted in <hi>Gemini,</hi> as <hi>Albumasar</hi> out of <hi>Hermes</hi> has given us to understand, and depressed in <hi>Sagittarius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third essential Dignity is <hi>Triangularity</hi> or <hi>Triplicity,</hi> whereby certain Planets are constituted the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of their respective <hi>Trigons. Sol</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> of the <hi>Fiery Trigon</hi>; the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> of the <hi>Earthly Trigon; Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> of the <hi>Aereal:</hi> and because there are not eight Planets, but seven only. <hi>Mars</hi> is the sole <hi>Trigonocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> of the <hi>Watery Triplicity.</hi> I omit to say any thing of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:55305:187" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. WHerefore to their <hi>First general Pretence,</hi> That the very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Starrs and Planets would be useless, if there be nothing in the Art of Astrology, I answer, That though there were certain virtues and influences in every one of them, yet it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that they are discovered in their Art: and then again, That though there were none saving that of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Heat</hi> in the <hi>Fixt Starrs,</hi> it will not follow that they are useless. Because the later and wiser Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers have made them as so many <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 3. ch. 1. sect. 6. Also <hi>Immortal.</hi> Book 3. ch. 19. sect. 4, 5, 6.</note> Suns: which Hypothesis our Astrologers must confute before they can make good the force of their first Argument. And for the <hi>Planets,</hi> they have also suggested that they may have some such like use as our <hi>Earth</hi> has, i. e. to be the mother of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures, though they have defined nothing concerning the natures of them; whereby their opinion becomes more harmless and unexceptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, as it is in it self highly probable: Forasmuch as the <hi>Earth,</hi> as well as <hi>Saturn, Iupiter</hi> and the rest, moves about the <hi>Sun,</hi> and is as much a <hi>Planet</hi> as any of them; as the best Astronomers doe not at all stick now-adaies to affirm. Which does utterly enervate the force of this first general Pretence of the Astrologians.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the Second I answer, That the <hi>Starrs</hi> are but Lights of much the same nature as our <hi>Sun</hi> is, only they are further removed, so that their contribution is much-what the same. And again, Nothing turns off their more subtil Influence, according to their own concession; and therefore though there were this <hi>Variety</hi> in them, yet because all this <hi>Variety</hi> reaches every point of the Earth, the Product would be the same, unless the particles of the Earth were diversified by some other cause, which assuredly they are. And thirdly, That neither their own <hi>Variety,</hi> nor the <hi>influences</hi> of the Heavens, if they be merely <hi>material,</hi> are sufficient causes of Productions here below. Fourthly, That the <hi>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Matter</hi> is every where, and that the Earth swims in it, as Wood does in Water, so that we need not have recourse to so remote un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known activities. And lastly, That that general <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> is also every where ready to contrive the <hi>Matter</hi> into such shapes and virtues as its disposition makes toward. And this is enough and more then enough to take off the edge of the Knights ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I do acknowledge that the <hi>Moon</hi> in her full swells certain things with moisture; which Effect is both sensible and palpable, and also rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, by reason of her proximity and of the reflexion of the Sun's beams from her body, which being but of a moderate power, melt the Air and Vapours into an insinuating liquidness, but do not dissipate them, as his direct beams doe by day. Which feat I do not doubt but that any other of the Planets would perform, if they were so plac'd that their <hi>discus</hi> would seem of equal bigness with the <hi>Moon</hi>'s, and she were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into their place. But it is an insufferable folly to argue from such both reasonable and palpable effects of the Moon, that the other Planets also and Fixt Starrs have as powerfull effects upon us; which yet we can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend by neither Reason nor Experience.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:55305:188" rendition="simple:additions"/>4. The like may be answered concerning <hi>the Flux and Reflux of the Sea</hi>; the ground whereof is rationall from what <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> has set down in his <hi>Princip. Philos. part.</hi> 4. namely, That the <hi>Ellipsis</hi> of the celestiall Matter is streightned by the Moons body, which makes the <hi>Aether</hi> flow more swift: which is a plain and mechanicall solution of the <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi> And then we finde by certain experience that this <hi>Flux and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux</hi> depends on the course of the Moon, so that there can be no deceit in the business. But when there is no <hi>Reason</hi> nor sufficient <hi>Experience</hi> that this is the Cause of that, to attribute the one to the other is no good Logick. And to that of the <hi>Loadstone</hi> and <hi>Polar-Starre</hi> I say again, as I have said already, That it does not follow, because there are some sensible effects from the Heavens, certain and constant, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may imagine what effects we please to proceed from this or that particular Starre without due <hi>Experience</hi> or <hi>Reason</hi> for the same. And then in the next place, That it is not so much the influence of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as the <hi>Magnetisme</hi> of the Earth, in which this direction of the <hi>Needle</hi> toward the North consists. For the Needle varies in certain Meridians, and some three miles from <hi>Rosseburg,</hi> a Town near upon the very corner where the <hi>Finnick</hi> Seas and <hi>Sinus Finnicus</hi> are joyn'd, the <hi>Needle</hi> amidst a many Sea-Rocks turns about, nor ceases so to do for the space of a whole mile. Which is a further demonstration that the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Needle</hi> depends upon the <hi>Magnetisme</hi> of the Earth. But truly if the Events that Astrologers take upon them to predict did as steadily point to the Causes they alledge, this Planet or that Configura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Planets, Signes or Starres, as the <hi>Needle</hi> and <hi>Axis</hi> of the Earth to the North; though they could give no reasons thereof, I could easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allow their Art. But there being such demonstrative Reasons against their Grounds, and no certain Experience for them, these particular Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations concerning the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Pole-Starre</hi> will stand them in no stead.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Station</hi> and <hi>Retrogradation</hi> of the Planets is a very consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Argument against them, and shews how foolish and imaginary their Art is that is upheld by such gross mistakes. For they that understand the right Systeme of the World, know very well that those <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> are not <hi>reall</hi> but <hi>seeming:</hi> which is a scurvy slur to these Astrologers. But this I shall meet with again hereafter.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To the last I answer, That neither the <hi>Dog-Starre, Arcturus,</hi> the <hi>Hyades</hi> nor <hi>Orion</hi> are conceived to have any such Effects as are attributed to them, but then when the Sun is in such places of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> as himself without them would bring forth. And therefore they do fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laciously attribute to those Starres what is really the virtue of the <hi>heat</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> approaching nearer us, or abiding longer upon us. And as for the wrath of the <hi>Dogge,</hi> which is abated already in some consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable measure, how tame a creature think you will he be, when the <hi>Anticipation</hi> of the <hi>Aequinoxes</hi> shall appoint him his Kennell as low as <hi>Capricorn,</hi> if the World should so long continue? These may serve for Poeticall Expressions (such as that of <hi>Virgil,</hi> who attributes that to the Signes which belongs to the Sunne;

but they will not endure the severity of the Laws of an Art, which is, to speak properly, not to entitle things circumstantiall and concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to reall Causality. But as for the Sun's efficacy it self, I will not deny it, nor yet acknowledge it any more then in the generall influence of <hi>heat,</hi> which cherishes and excites the seminal Principles of things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to act and perfection. Which is no more mysterious then the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Livia</hi>'s Maids of Honour hatching of Egges without the help of the Hen; the same which the <hi>Sun</hi> does to the Ostriches left upon the sand. And I will also acknowledge that the rest of the Stars do not stand for cyphers, but that at a competent distance they will have their effect: which the Sun it self has not when removed from us but to the other side of the Aequator, whereby his rayes become more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique. How inconsiderable then think you would he be, if he were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved as farre as the fixt Starres, all whose influence put together can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not supply his absence in the depth of Winter? Whence it is plain, that it is a very fond inference to argue that those remote bodies of the fixt Starres and Planets have an influence upon us, because the Sun and Moon that are so near us have; whenas if they were as far removed, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence would assuredly be as insensible as that of the five Planets and fixt Stars.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And yet notwithstanding such is the intolerable Impudence of the Inventours of Astrology, that they have at randome attributed such things to the other Planets and Starrs as they have only ground for, if any at all, in the two Luminaries. As for example, because they might observe some more sensible mutation in the Air and Earth at the Sun's entring <hi>Aries,</hi> it would be the more tolerable to phansie that Sign his <hi>Exaltation.</hi> But now to appoint places of <hi>exaltation</hi> to other Planets, as <hi>Taurus</hi> to the <hi>Moon, Libra</hi> to <hi>Saturn,</hi> is a mere running the Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goose chase from one single hint to matters where there is nothing of like reason or experience. So likewise because they had some intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make <hi>Leo</hi> the House of the <hi>Sun,</hi> his heat being then most sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and <hi>Cancer</hi> the House of the <hi>Moon,</hi> because then she would be most vertical to us; they have without either fear or wit bestowed Houses two apiece upon the rest of the Planets, though there be neither rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son nor effect answerable.</p>
               <p>And lastly, for <hi>Aspects,</hi> in all likelihood the sensible varieties of the <hi>Phases</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> in <hi>Opposition, Trine</hi> and <hi>Quartil,</hi> gave them first occasion to take notice of <hi>Aspects:</hi> and then another thing happening, though independent on the course of the <hi>Moon,</hi> namely, that every se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, in an <hi>acute</hi> Disease, is Critical, and that there are usually at those returns the greatest stirrs and alterations in the Patient, and the Quartil Aspect of the Moon happening also about seven daies from the Conjunction, and then about seven daies more she being in Opposition; this natural circuit of <hi>Fermentations</hi> in <hi>acute</hi> Diseases, has given them
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:55305:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>
occasion to slander the Moon in those cases, and for her sake to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the aspects of <hi>Opposition</hi> and <hi>Quadrature</hi> in all the rest of the Planets. Such small hints as these are the solidest foundations of the phantastick structure of <hi>Astrology.</hi> Which we shall now something more nearly lay battery to, and so shatter it, that it shall not so much as find room in the Imaginations of men.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To begin therefore with the First of their Principles I have set down, That they prefer the <hi>Planets</hi> before the <hi>Fixt Starrs</hi> (I mean those so remote ones, that they seem but about the bigness of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Starrs) is without all reason; the <hi>Planets</hi> being but heaps of dead matter much like that of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and having no light but what they reflect from the <hi>Sun.</hi> For that which seems to be the <hi>innate light</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> is but the reflexion of the <hi>Sun</hi>'s beams from the <hi>Earth.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their activity and influence may justly seem less then that of the <hi>Fixt Starrs</hi> which shine not with borrowed but <hi>innate</hi> light. And for their powerfull penetrating into the Bowels of the Earth, that is a mistake arising from the supposed influence of the <hi>Moon</hi> on the <hi>Flux</hi> and <hi>Reflux</hi> of the Sea, even when she is on the other side of the Earth; to which with the like fallacious inference I have <note n="*" place="margin">See sect. 4.</note> answered already. But then, for the <hi>Qualities</hi> of the Planets, where they define the <hi>Sun</hi> to be <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>moist</hi> rather then <hi>drying,</hi> but <hi>Mars hot</hi> and parching <hi>dry,</hi> and <hi>Saturn dry</hi> and <hi>cold</hi>; what will not these impudent Impostours dare to obtrude upon us, when they will vent such stuff as is liable to confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by our very Senses? For does not our very Sense tell us that the <hi>Sun</hi> is the <hi>most hot</hi> and <hi>drying</hi> Planet that is? His heat it is, and not that of <hi>Mars,</hi> that withers the grass and flowers, and parches the tops of Mountains, and even rosts the Inhabitants of the Earth when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their bodies to his more direct raies. But what Faculty could ever inform us that <hi>Mars</hi> was such a parching and heating Planet, and <hi>Saturn</hi> so cold? Assuredly he that will expose his head to their <hi>Acronychal</hi> raies, which are most potent, and shall profess he feels more cold from one and heat from the other, then he does from the other parts of Heaven, will approve himself as mad as that old Dotard that pretended that he could as often as he listned plainly hear the Harmony of the Celestial Sphears. All the Planets are <hi>opake</hi> Bodies, and whatever their colour is, are as <hi>cold</hi> as Earth. For neither yellow nor red clay cast any more heat then white, nor has any soil any sensible influence but what is drawn in by the nose, which sometimes proves wholesome and savory and sometimes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ensive. But how our Star-gazers <hi>Proboscides</hi> should be drawn out to that length as to smell out the different virtues of the Planets, I can no way understand. Wherefore the pronouncing of <hi>Mars hot</hi> and <hi>dry,</hi> and <hi>Saturn cold</hi> and <hi>dry,</hi> &amp;c. is a shameless foolery, and a demonstration of the vanity of the rest of their allotments of the <hi>first qualities</hi> to the Planets. And since from these they are reputed <hi>Benign</hi> or <hi>Malign, Masculine</hi> or <hi>Feminine,</hi> and the like, all this part of their pretended Science is but a Rhapsody of Fooleries also.</p>

proof, as I have already evinced: and then Secondly, If I give them it, they will be fain to vomit it up again, it being destructive to their whole Art. For if the raies and influence of the Stars and Planets have free passage through the body of the Earth, the whole Ceremonie of erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Scheme for such a Longitude and Latitude is needless; nay, as to the Heavens, the fates of all men would be alike. For that hidden influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which governs all would reach to all points from all parts of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at once.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Thirdly, Concerning the division of their <hi>Signs</hi> into <hi>mobilia</hi> and <hi>fixa</hi> and <hi>hicorporea.</hi> The <hi>mobilia</hi> are the Equinoctial and Solstitial Signs. The latter whereof might deserve better the name of <hi>fixa</hi> then <hi>mobilia.</hi> And in my apprehension the Tempers of the Year might as well be said to be <hi>begun,</hi> suppose the cold in <hi>Sagittarius</hi> and <hi>fixed</hi> in <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and the heat in <hi>Gemini</hi> and <hi>fixed</hi> in <hi>Cancer,</hi> as begun in <hi>Capricorn</hi> and <hi>fixed</hi> in <hi>Aquarius,</hi> &amp;c. But we will wink at small matters. That of the <hi>fiery, earthy, watry</hi> and <hi>aiery Trigons</hi> is more notorious, and I cannot but smile when I read the Effects of them. As for example, in Physick, as <hi>Dariot</hi> has set down, the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Ascendent</hi> in the <hi>Fiery</hi> Signs comfort the virtue <hi>attractive,</hi> in the <hi>Earthy</hi> Signs the <hi>retentive,</hi> the <hi>Aiery</hi> the <hi>dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stive,</hi> and the <hi>Watery</hi> the <hi>expulsive.</hi> Would any man dare to administer Physick then without consulting the precepts of Astrology? Also in Husbandry that's a notable one of Sir <hi>Christopher</hi>'s,<note place="margin">See Sir <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Heydon</hi> his Defence of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, c. 7. p. 186.</note> who tells us how we may cause a Plant to shoot deep into the Earth or higher into the Air, by setting of it at such an aspect of the Moon. Namely, if the Moon be in the <hi>Earthy Triplicity,</hi> the root will shoot more downward into the Earth; if in the <hi>Aiery,</hi> more upward into the Air. Which is a rare Secret. Now to omit the groundless and arbitrarious division of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> into these four <hi>Trigons,</hi> of which there is only this one hint, that I can imagine, namely, the fitness of <hi>Leo</hi> for one part of the <hi>fiery Trigon,</hi> the Sun being most hot in that Sign; (From which little inlet all the four Elements flew up into Heaven, and took their places in their respective <hi>Triplicities</hi> in the <hi>Zodiack</hi> with great nimbleness and agility, playing at leap-frog &amp; skipping over one anothers backs in such sort, that dividing themselves into three equal parts, every <hi>Triental</hi> of an Element found it self a fellow-member of a trine Aspect:) The best jest of all is, that there is no such <hi>Zodiack</hi> in Heaven, or, if you will, no Heaven for such a <hi>Zodiack</hi> as these Artists attribute these <hi>Triplicities</hi> to. For this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and this <hi>Zodiack</hi> we speak of is only an old errour of <hi>Ptolemie</hi>'s and his followers, who not understanding the true System of the world, and the motion of the Earth, in which is salv'd the anticipation of the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxes, have phansied a Heaven above the <hi>Coelum stellatum,</hi> and a <hi>Zodiack</hi> that did not recede from West to East as the starry Zodiack does. And this Figment, which later Ages have laughed off of the Stage, is the only Subject of these renounced <hi>Trigons</hi> and <hi>Triplicities,</hi> which therefore are justly laughed off of the Stage with it. Which discovery is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration that the whole Art of <hi>Astrology</hi> is but upon frivolous and mere imaginary Principles, as we shall further make manifest. And therefore those Physicians proclaim themselves either <hi>Cheats</hi> or <hi>Fools,</hi>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:55305:190"/>
that would recommend their skill from such vain observations.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Fourthly, Now for the <hi>essential Dignities</hi> of the Planets, sith it is nothing but the increase of their innate virtue by being in such or such a <hi>Sign,</hi> and these being the <hi>Signs</hi> of that <hi>Zodiack</hi> which has no Heaven, nor is any thing; it is manifest that the whole doctrine of <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Dignities</hi> falls to the ground. But we will also cast our eye upon the distinct parts of this vain Figment. And therefore as to the first <hi>essential Dignity,</hi> the <hi>House</hi> of the Planet; There is no sagacious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son but can easily smell out the meaning of making <hi>Leo</hi> the House of the Sun; namely, not that that Sign has any virtue to increase heat, but that the Sun then has been long near the Tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and so has more then ordinarily heated the Earth by so long a stay in so advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a posture. And this is it, not the being in his House then, that makes the heat so great; for those beyond the other Tropick sure are cold enough. The same may be said of <hi>Cancer,</hi> the Moons House, that it is posture, not the nature of the place, that makes her virtue more then to us, but less to our <hi>Antoeci.</hi> From this small hint from Sense and mistakes of Reason, have they without all Reason and Sense bestowed <hi>Houses</hi> on the rest of the Planets, guiding themselves by the conceit of the Malignity and Benignity of <hi>Aspects.</hi> Which to be a mere Figment I have <note n="*" place="margin">See sect. 7.</note> noted already, it having no ground but that rash joining together of Critical daies with the Aspects of the Moon.</p>
               <p>What a small preferment Astrological <hi>Exaltation</hi> is, you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand from <hi>Albumazar</hi>'s liberality, who amongst the Planets has advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the head and tail of the Dragon to the same Dignity, which yet are nothing but Intersections of the imaginary Circles of the course of the Moon and the Ecliptick. But of this Dignity I have <note n="*" place="margin">See sect. 7.</note> spoke enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and therefore I pass to the next.</p>
               <p>As for the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Lords of the Trigons,</hi> what great pitty it was there were not just eight Planets, that each <hi>Trigon</hi> might have had its two <hi>Consuls,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> not rule solitarily in his watry one? But the foolery of the <hi>Trigons</hi> being already confuted, I need add nothing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning this Dignity. The Prerogative of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is destroyed by that first general Argument, the parts of the Signs being as fictitious as the whole. And as for the <hi>Carpentum</hi> or royal Seat or Throne, it being a compound Dignity compacted of the former, the parts being but imaginary, it is evident that the whole is a mere No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>And that <hi>Persona Planetae</hi> or <hi>Almugea</hi> is as little, appears from hence, in that <hi>Aspect</hi> is an empty conceit, raised upon no solid ground, as I have more then once already intimated.</p>
               <p>And that the Lords of the <hi>Decanats</hi> have but imaginary Provinces, is again plain, for that their whole <hi>Zodiack</hi> wherein all those fripperies are lodged is but imaginary, and their order also of assignation upon a false Hypothesis, viz. according to that ranging of the Planets that is in <hi>Ptolemie</hi>'s System.</p>
               <p>And lastly, <hi>Gaudium,</hi> the last of the Essential Dignities, supposes two falsities; that there are Houses in this fictitious <hi>Zodiack,</hi> and that
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:55305:190"/>
Planets are <hi>Masculine</hi> and <hi>Feminine</hi>: which Supposition has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed already. So that all these <hi>essential Dignities</hi> are devoid of all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and reality, and the numbring of their particular <hi>Fortitudes</hi> is the telling out so many nullities to no purpose.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Nor can you hope for a better account of their <hi>Accidental</hi> Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. <hi>Cazimi, Combustion,</hi> and <hi>Freeness from combustion,</hi> how fond and inconsistent conceits are they? For first it is unreasonable, if they know the nature of the Planets, of the Sun, and of the celestial <hi>Vortex,</hi> to make a Planet in <hi>Cazimi</hi> to gain five Fortitudes. For beyond the Sun the Planet is at the furthest distance it can be from us: and <hi>Saturn, Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> a whole diameter of the Suns orbit more distant then when they are in opposition to the Sun: and <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> half of their own. Besides, how can their virtue pass the body of the Sun, or the bearing of the <hi>Vortex</hi> against the Planet and against us, and all the attemps of influence from the Planet not be eluded? Again, if <hi>Cazimi</hi> on this side the Sun be good, why should not beyond the Sun be bad? And if <hi>Venus</hi> or <hi>Mercury</hi> in the body of the Sun be so consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, how much more are the spots of the Sun that are far greater? which their ignorance could never reckon in the compute of their Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. Besides, what wilde and disproportionable jumps are these, That <hi>Cazimi</hi> should be five <hi>fortitudes,</hi> and yet <hi>Combustion,</hi> which is to be but a little distance from the Sun, should be five <hi>debilities</hi>; and yet to be <hi>free from combustion,</hi> that is further removed from the body of the Sun, should be again five <hi>fortitudes?</hi> Things so arbitrarious ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, that none but sick-brain'd Persons can ever believe them.</p>
               <p>That also is notoriously foolish, That <hi>Saturn, Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> from their <note n="*" place="margin">See chap. 15. sect. 5.</note> conjunction with the Sun to their opposition should have two <hi>fortitudes,</hi> and from their opposition to their conjunction should have two <hi>debilities.</hi> For in a great part of that Semicircle that carries from opposition to conjunction, they are far nearer, and therefore much stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then in the beginning of that Semicircle that leads from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction to opposition.</p>
               <p>Moreover those <hi>Dignities</hi> and <hi>Debilities</hi> that are cast upon Planets from <hi>Direction, Station</hi> and <hi>Retrogradation,</hi> the thing is mainly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a mistake of the Systeme of the World, and ignorance of the Earths annuall motion, and from an Idiotick application of accidents or phrases amongst men. And therefore because when things succeed ill they are said to <hi>go backwards,</hi> and when we are weary we <hi>goe more slow</hi> or <hi>stand still</hi> to breath us, or when we are most vigorous we <hi>run swiftest</hi>; therefore must <hi>Station</hi> be two <hi>debilities, Retrogradation</hi> no less then five, but <hi>Direction</hi> must be five <hi>fortitudes.</hi> Whereas in reason <hi>Station</hi> should rather seal on the effect of the Planet more sure. But the truth is, a Planet is neither <hi>stationary</hi> nor <hi>retrograde</hi> truly, but in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and therefore these <hi>Debilities</hi> no true ones but imaginary.</p>
               <p>The last <hi>Accidental</hi> Dignity is <hi>Configuration</hi> or <hi>Aspect,</hi> the vain grounds whereof have been <note n="*" place="margin">See Sect. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> already taxed. To which I add, That it is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unreasonable to conceive that <hi>Sextil</hi> and <hi>Trine</hi> should be good, and yet <hi>Quartil</hi> that is betwixt both be stark naught. Nay it were far more
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:55305:191"/>
reasonable to conceive that if <hi>Conjunction</hi> and <hi>Sextil</hi> were good, that <hi>Quartil</hi> should be better then <hi>Trine,</hi> as being further from <hi>Opposition,</hi> and because the Planets thus aspected are in better capacity both of them to strike with more <hi>direct</hi> raies on the Earth, then if they were in a <hi>Trine</hi> Aspect. And therefore I know no reason imaginable that could move them to have so ill a conceit of <hi>Quartil</hi> aspect, but because of the great unquietness of <hi>acute</hi> diseases that happens about every seventh day, which is the time also of the Quartil aspect of the Moon: and therefore the whole mystery of <hi>Aspects</hi> is to be resolved into this rash Misappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>You have seen now how little worth all the <hi>Astrological Dignities</hi> are; and yet out of these huge Nothings of their fictitious Art is the whole fabrick built of whatever <hi>Predictions</hi> they pretend to: So that we may be <hi>assured</hi> that all is vain and ridiculous.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Concerning their <hi>twelve Houses of the Nativity,</hi> the division is arbitrarious, and their <hi>erecting of a Scheme</hi> so many waies and that with like success, an evidence that the success is not upon Art but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous.

                  </gap> or <hi>Alfridarii</hi> do intimate that the whole business is but a Figment, going upon that false Hypothesis of <hi>Ptolemie,</hi> That the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets and the Earth have not the Sun to their Centre. But this is not all we have to say against these Celestial Tenements. For either the <hi>Earth</hi> is pervious to all the raies of the Planets and Starrs, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath as above the Horizon, or only they above the Horizon shed their Virtue on the Child. If the former be true, all Nativities are alike. If the latter, why have they any more then <hi>six Houses,</hi> and why any at all under the Horizon? And in good sadness what is the meaning that their <hi>Horoscope</hi> and the sixth House, being Houses of so great concernment, should be under the Horizon; especially when they are pleased at other times to pronounce that a Star or Planet that is Vertical is most efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? And can it be thought any thing but a mere phancie that led them to make the <hi>Horoscope</hi> the House of Life, namely, because the Starrs arise from thence, and are as it were <hi>born</hi> into the World? whence (as I have shewed their custome to be in other things) they have feigned the rest of the Houses at random. And that you may still be more sure that there is nothing in these Houses, (or rather that the Houses them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are nothing) they are but the Distribution of that imaginary <hi>Zodiack</hi> and Heaven, which (I told you <note n="*" place="margin">See sect. 10.</note> before) the errour of <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> brought into the World, into twelve imaginary Sections, beginning at the East point of this Zodiack: So that their Art is perpetually built upon Nothing.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Now for the exact time of the Nativity, <hi>That one should know the very moment when the Child is born,</hi> I say it is a Curiosity nothing to the purpose. For first, if the hard and thick Earth be pervious to the raies of Heaven, how easily may those thin coverings of the Womb be penetrated continually by the power of the Starrs? and therefore even then is the Childe as much exposed to them, as when it is newly born. Or if it be not; why may not it some moments after its being
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:55305:191"/>
born, be still as liable to their influence as in the moment when it was born? For cannot these Influences that penetrate the very metalline bowels of the Earth pierce a Child's tender skin without any resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? But supposing this Curiosity to be to the purpose; how hard and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricous a matter is it to come to that exactness that they pretend to be requisite? For first they must know the <hi>exact Longitude of the Place,</hi> (a thing of extreme uncertainty) or else the <hi>exactness of Time</hi> will doe them no good. And yet again, their affectation of exactness seems ridiculous, when we cannot well determine the proper Time of his Birth. For he is born by degrees, and few or none come out, after first they appear, in a shorter space then half a quarter of an hour. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Head being exposed to the starry influence, why should not that celestial infection pervade their whole body? But suppose that to be the moment of their birth, wherein the whole body is first out, how shall this moment be known? By an exact minute watch, such as <hi>Tycho</hi> had, and Sir <hi>Christopher Heydon</hi> professes himself to have had, which would exactly give him the minute and second Scruple of Time. But how few Nativity-casters can boast of the same priviledge? Or if they could, to what purpose is it, when it seldome happens that they are in the same house, much less in the same room where the party is delivered? Wherefore the report of the Midwife is the best certainty they have: and how many Nativities have been cast without so much as that? And yet they will confidently predict Fates and Destinies upon an uncertain time given them. For they can, say they, correct it, and reduce it to the right moment of the Nativity, and that by no less then three several waies; by <hi>Trutina Hermetis, Animodar,</hi> and <hi>Accidentia Nati</hi>: which how bold and groundless a boast it is, let us now see.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>Trutina Hermetis</hi> goes upon this ground, That that degree of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> the Moon is in at the time of Conception, the same is the <hi>Horoscope</hi> of the Nativity. But what a foolish subterfuge is this, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the exact time of Conception is as hard to be known as that of the Nativity? And if it were known, there is yet no certainty, some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming sooner, some later, as every Mother, Nurse or Midwife knows full well; nor will any of them presume to tell to a day when a woman shall be brought to bed.</p>

If the <hi>Interlunium</hi> precede the time of the birth, the degree is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in which it happens; if the <hi>Plenilunium,</hi> that degree in which that Luminary is that is above the Horizon in the time of Opposition, the Sun by day, the Moon by night. The degrees thus given, the <hi>Almu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Almusteli</hi> is to be found out, which is the Planet that has most <hi>digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> in that place of opposition or conjunction; which are <hi>Trigon, House, Altitude,</hi>

For I need not hold on; enough has already been said to demonstrate the whole process a ceremonious Foolery. For the computation being to be made from the place of the <hi>Almuten Almusteli,</hi> and his election by
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:55305:192"/>
                  <hi>Dignities,</hi> and <hi>Dignities</hi> being nothing but empty phansies and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as I have already proved, the Correction of the Nativity by <hi>Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar</hi> must needs be idle and vain. Besides that, the <hi>Almuten</hi> being one and the same, as belonging to one and the same Conjunction or Opposition of the Luminaries, how can it be a rule to Children born at the same times in divers <hi>Climates?</hi> For it is evident the <hi>Horoscope</hi> alters with the Clime And lastly, not only <hi>Picus,</hi> a foe to Astrology, professes how false both this method of <hi>Animodar</hi> as also that rule of <hi>Hermes</hi> is, and clashing one with another; but <hi>Origanus</hi> himself, a friend to the Art, advises us rather to listen to the relations of Mother Midnight then to give any credit to either of these waies.</p>
               <p>The most certain way of <hi>correcting a Scheme of Nativity</hi> in <hi>Origanus</hi> his judgment, is <hi>per Accidentia Nati,</hi> whether good or bad, as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Preferments, Gifts, Sickness, Imprisonment, Falles, Conflicts, &amp;c. which way notwithstanding at the first sight is very lubricous. For it is at least disputable and uncertain, whether there be Liberty of Will in man or no. But I will venture further, that for my own part, I think it demonstrable from inward Sense, Reason and Holy Writ, that there is Free-will in men; whence it will necessarily follow, <hi>Quòd mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta accidunt hominibus praeter naturam praeterque fatum.</hi> Diseases there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Imprisonments, Disgraces and Preferments may be brought upon us by the free Agency of our selves or others, and that sooner or later ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as mens Vertues or Vices act. Which takes away all certainty of computation <hi>per Accidentia Nati.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. Besides that the manner of it is very frivolous and ridiculous. For it being threefold, as <hi>Origanus</hi> has set down, <hi>Profection annual, Transition,</hi> and <hi>Direction</hi>; there is none of them that are any thing more then mere phansies and figments. For what can be more vain and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then their <hi>annual Profection,</hi> which makes the <hi>Horoscope</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Houses</hi> move thirty degrees a year till the whole period be finished in twelve? Is this circuit of the Nativity-Scheme any where but in their own brain? And then their Predictions or Corrections are by Aspects of the Cuspe of the Root with the Cuspes of the present Scheme cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for this or that year. And how Aspects themselves are nothing, I have again and again taken notice.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>Transition,</hi> what is more monstrous then to think that a Planet by passing the same place in which it self or other Planets were at the Nativity, should cause some notable change in the party born? As if the Planets walked their rounds with perfumed socks, or that they smelt stronger at the Nativity then other times, and that another Planet come into the trace thereof should exult in the scent, or the same increase the smell: or what is it that can adhere in these points of Heaven that the Planets were found in at the Nativity? or why is not the Whole tract of the same scent? or why not expunged by the passage of other Planets? But what will not madness and effascination make a man phansie to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his own Prejudices? And truly these two <hi>Origanus</hi> himself is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to quit his hands of, as less sound and allowable: but <hi>Direction</hi> is a principal business with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:55305:192" rendition="simple:additions"/>Which yet in good truth will be found as frivolous as the rest. For as in <hi>Transition,</hi> so also in <hi>Direction,</hi> the great change must hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen when a <hi>Planet,</hi> or <hi>Cuspe,</hi> or <hi>Aspect</hi> come to the place where such a Planet or Cuspe were at the Nativity. When the <hi>Significator</hi> comes to the place of the <hi>Promissor,</hi> then the feat does not fail to be done. For the <hi>Promissor</hi> is conceived as immovable, and such as stands still and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects the arrivall of the <hi>Significator:</hi> which is a demonstration that this <hi>Promissor</hi> is either <hi>Imaginary space</hi> or <hi>Nothing</hi>: and which of these two think you will keep promise best? Nay the <hi>Significator</hi> also, if it be the <hi>Horoscope</hi> or any other House, is imaginary too, as I have demonstrated. And if it be a Planet, seeing yet the Planets move not as a Bird in the Aire, or Fishes in the Waters, but as Cork carried down the stream; it is plain how this Planet never gets to that part of the celestiall Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in which the <hi>Promissor</hi> was at the Nativity, the <hi>Promissor</hi> ever sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding away with his own Matter in which he swims: and therefore if he hath left any virtue behinde him, it must again be deposited in an Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Space. Which is an undeniable argument that the whole mystery of <hi>Direction</hi> is imaginary.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if <hi>Profection annuall, Transition</hi> and <hi>Direction</hi> are so vain that they signifie nothing forward, how can we from Events (though they should be judged and reasoned from exactly according to these phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick Laws) argue backward an exact indication of the time of the Nativity? If they could have pretended to some Rules of Nature or Astronomy to have rectified a Geniture by, they had said something; but this recourse to their own phantastick and fictitious Principles proves nothing at all.</p>
               <p n="17">17. And thus have I run through the eighth and ninth Sections of the foregoing Chapter before I was aware. And he that has but moderate skill in the solid Principles of <hi>Naturall Philosophy</hi> and <hi>Astronomy,</hi> and but a competent patience to listen to my close reasonings therefrom, cannot but acknowledge that I have fundamentally confuted the whole Art of Astrology, and that he has heard all their fine terms of <hi>Horoscope,</hi> and <hi>Celestiall Houses, Exaltation, Triplicity, Trigons, Aspects Benigne and Maligne, Station, Retrogradation, Combustion, Cazimi, Significator, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missor, Apheta, Anaereta, Trigonocrator, Horecrator, Almugea, Almuten, Alcochodon,</hi> together with the rest of their sonorous Nothings, to have fallen down with a clatter like a pyle of dry bones by the battery I have laid against them. And truly here I would not stick to pronounce that I have perfectly vanquished the enemy, did I not espy a little blinde Fort to which these Fugitives usually make their escape. And surely by the Title it should be a very strong one; they call it <hi>Experience</hi> or <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Events,</hi> which they boast to be accurately agreeable to their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. BUt here their Hold is not so strong as their Impudence great, that they will so boldly bear us in hand, that by virtue of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their Art they have foretold any thing to come. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ludicrous wayes of <hi>Divination</hi> wherein no man is in good earnest, and yet the Predictions and present personall Descriptions of men some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fall right: but no sober man will impute this to Art but to Chance. It was but a fallacy of <hi>Neptune</hi>'s Priest, when he would have carried the Spectator into admiration of that Deity from the many Donaries hung up in his Temple by <hi>Votaries.</hi> But he whom he would have thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon was too cunning for him. For he demanded straightway a Catalogue of those <hi>Votaries</hi> that had suffered Shipwrack. And so do I of those Predictions that have proved false. <hi>Cardan,</hi> a reputed Prince in this faculty, complains that scarce ten in fourty prove true: And <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> a narrow searcher into the Art, professes that he has found of his own experience nineteen in twenty false; and that in the Prognosticati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Weather, where no free Agents intermeddle to interrupt or turn off the naturall influence of the Stars.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But all the Aberrations that either themselves or others may have observed will not bring off the more devoted Admirers of <hi>Astrology</hi> to acknowledge the vanity thereof. For their excuse is, first, That by Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, private information, and by their own experience they are assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the <hi>Predictions</hi> do sometimes fall punctually true to a year, nay, to a day, and sometimes to an hour, and that the circumstances of things are so particularly set out, that it cannot be <hi>Chance</hi> but <hi>Art</hi> that arrives at that accuracy. And then secondly, That the profession of others, and also their own observation, does witness to them, that when there is any mistake, the Errour is in the Artist, not in the Art. For when they have examined their <hi>Astrologicall Scheme,</hi> they finde the Event was there signified, and that it was their own oversight to miss it. But to
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:55305:193"/>
answer to the latter first, I say, they cannot pretend their Observation universall; and they that understand Astrology best, will acknowledge there is that intanglement usually and complication of things, that it requires a very long time to give due judgement according to Art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Nativity. And therefore, I say, the Representation of the Event being so doubtfull, if they chance to predict right at first, they easily perswade themselves that was the meaning of the <hi>Celestial Theme.</hi> If they miss, they will force on their way further, till they finde out what is answerable to the Events; which then must needs be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Art, though the Artist oversaw it: nor will they urge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to any further accuracy of inquisition, for fear they should finde it disagree again; or rather out of a strong credulity that if it hit right, it is surely from the true meaning and principles of their beloved Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: whenas in truth their <hi>Themes</hi> have no certainty in their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation, but are as a piece of changeable Stuffe or creased Pictures, look this way it is this colour, that way that, this way a Virgin, that way an Ape; or like the Oracles of <hi>Apollo,</hi> who was deservedly called <hi>Loxias,</hi> whose crooked Answers winded so this way and that way, that nothing but the Event could tell whither they pointed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I might adde further, that the pretence of the <hi>Schemes</hi> themselves (be they never so exact) I say the pretence of <hi>their alwayes representing the Events aright,</hi> is a most impudent and rash Presumption; because (as I have intimated already) the Objects of their Predictions are so alterable by the interposall of <hi>free Agents,</hi> which interrupt ever and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non the <hi>series</hi> of Causality in naturall inclinations. Whence in reason a man can expect no certain Predictions at all from the significations of the Stars, nor that any triall can be made whether there be any thing in the Art or no. And it cannot but seem to every one a very bold sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, to imagine that all that fall in one fight by the edge of the Sword, or suffer shipwrack in one Storm, or are swept away in one Pestilence, had their <hi>Emissors</hi> and <hi>Interfectors</hi> in their Nativity answerable to the times of their Death. The Artists themselves dare not avouch it, and therefore bring in an unobserved caution of having recourse to <hi>Eclipses, Comets,</hi> and <hi>blazing-Stars,</hi> to calculate the generall fortune of the place, nay, of their Parents and Ancestors, and of their familiar Friends, of which there is no news in the most famous Predictions of Astrologers: and therefore these and the like considerations being left out, it is a signe their divinations fell true by chance. Wherefore it is a shameless piece of Imposture to impute the truth of Predictions to Art, where the Rules of Art are not observed; I may adde where they are so palpably by Experience confuted. For so it is in <hi>Twins,</hi> whose <hi>natures</hi> should be utterly the same according to their Art; and if they could be born <hi>at one moment,</hi> the <hi>moment of their death</hi> should be the same also. And yet those undissevered Twins born in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who lived till twenty eight years of their age,<note place="margin">See his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, cap. 11.</note> prov'd very often dissenting brethren, would wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and jangle; and one also died before the other. In answering to which instance, in my judgement, that ingenious Knight Sir <hi>Christopher</hi> is very shrewdly baffled.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:55305:194"/>4. And now to the<note n="*" place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> former, I say, The reasoning is not right, to conclude the certainty of the Art from the punctuall correspondence of the Event to the Prediction. For it is also true that the Event has been punctually contrary thereto. And therefore this is as good a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration that it is no Art, as the other that it is: But it is easie to conceive that both may happen by Chance. Again, as for that exact Punctuality of time, it is most likely to be by <hi>Chance,</hi> because (as I have proved above) there is no way of rectifying a Nativity to that accura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they pretend. And for particular Circumstances in Horary Questions, why may they not be by under-hand information, or some tricks and juglings that are usuall amongst Cheats? But if the Predictions of Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers be free from this, and yet be punctuall in time and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and so many that it may seem improbable to be imputed to Chance, (though <hi>Chance</hi> has such a latitude, that it is difficult to say any thing is not by <hi>Chance</hi> that happens, suppose but four times seldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer then the contrary) it will not yet follow that they are free from other things which are assuredly worse, more horrid, and more execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; such as <hi>the consulting of Ghosts and Familiar Spirits</hi>: a wickedness that that zealous Patron of Astrology, Sir <hi>Christopher Heydon,</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges to be too frequently palliated under the Pretence of this Art.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And truly for my own part I do not much doubt but that <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> it self is an Appendix of the old Pagans Superstition, who were Worshippers of the Host of Heaven, and whose Priests were Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates of the Devil; and therefore it is no wonder if <hi>Daemonolatry</hi> creep in upon <hi>Astrology,</hi> and renew their old acquaintance with one another. And assuredly it is a pleasant Spectacle to those aiery Goblins, those Haters and Scorners of Mankinde, to see the noble Faculties of men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based and intangled in so vile and wretched a mystery, which will avail nothing to <hi>Divination</hi> unless these <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> these <hi>malicious Deceivers</hi> act their parts in the Scene. For it is not unconceivable how these invisible Insidiators may so apply themselves to a mans curiosity that will be tampering and practising in this Superstition, that (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) in Horary Questions, they may excite such persons and at such a time to make their demands, that according to the foreknown Rules of Astrology the <hi>Theme of Heaven</hi> will decypher very circumstantially the Person, his Relations, or his Condition, and give a true solution of the demand, whether about <hi>Decumbitures, Stollen goods,</hi> or any such questions as are set down in <hi>Dariot</hi>'s <hi>Introduction.</hi> Which needs must enravish the young Astrologer, and inflame him with the love and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of so strange an Art. And as for <hi>Nativities</hi> and punctuall <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the time of ones death,</hi> and it may be of the <hi>manner</hi> of it, (which either only, or most ordinarily happens in such as are addicted to, or devoted admirers of this Art) it is very suspicable that the same <hi>invisible Powers</hi> put to their helping hand to bring about the Effect; and so those whose misfortunes and deaths are predicted, must to the pot, to credit the Art, and be made Sacrifices to the lust and ambition of those rebellious Fiends, to whose secret lash and dominion men expose
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:55305:194"/>
themselves when they intermeddle with such superstitious Curiosities as are Appendages to ancient Paganism, and were in all likelihood inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or suggested by those proud and ludicrous Spirits, to entangle man in by way of sport and scorn, and to subjugate him to the befoolments of their tricks and delusions. For it is not unreasonable to think that by certain Laws of the great Polity of the <hi>Invisible World</hi> they gain a right against a man without explicit contract, if he be but once so rash as to tamper with the Mysteries of the <hi>Dark Kingdome,</hi> or to practise in them, or any way to make use of them. For why not here as well as in the Ceremonies of <hi>Witchcraft?</hi> (But I must not make too large excursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.) And therefore I think it the safest way for every one that has given his name to God and Christ, not to meddle nor make with these Superstitious curiosities of <hi>Astrology,</hi> either by practising them himself, or consulting them that do, that no ill trick be put upon him by being made obnoxious to the invisible scourge, or by making others so in whose behalf he consults.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I say then, these vagrant <hi>Daemons</hi> of the Air either secretly insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating themselves into the actions of Astrologers, or after more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently offering themselves to familiarity and converse, for to grace their profession by oral revelation of things past, present, or to come in such a way as is above humane power; I demand how it shall appear that <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi>'s, for example, and <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sueton, in vita Domitiani</hi> sect. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Ascletarion</hi>'s deaths, and others more punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that I could name, predicted by themselves or others, was not by the familiarity of <hi>Daemons,</hi> but the pure principles of <hi>Astrology.</hi> And so of whatsoever Honour or other Events that have been found to fall out just according to Astrological predictions, I demand how it can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that <hi>Astrology</hi> was not here only for a <hi>vizard,</hi> and that a <hi>Magician</hi> or <hi>Wizzard</hi> was not <hi>underneath.</hi> By how much accurater their Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are, by so much the more cause of suspicion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now therefore to conclude, seeing that the Principles of Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy are so groundless, frivolous, nay contradictious one with another, and built upon false Hypotheses and gross mistakes concerning the Nature and System of the World; seeing it has no due object by reason of the interposing of the free Agency of both men and Angels to interrupt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually the imagined natural series of both Causality and Events; seeing there is not sufficient Experience to make good the truth of the Art, they that have practised therein having not observed the pretended Laws thereof with due accuracy, and therefore if any thing has hitherto hit true, it must be <hi>Chance,</hi> which quite takes away their plea from Events; so that their Art is utterly to seek, not only for <hi>Principles,</hi> which I have demonstrated to be false, but for <hi>Experience</hi> and <hi>Effects,</hi> which hitherto have been none; (And assuredly they make nothing of pronouncing loudly that such or such a Configuration will have such an Event, though they never experienc'd it at all, or very seldom: as it must needs be in the conjunction of <hi>Saturn, Iupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> which returns not in seven hundred years;) seeing also that those Predictions that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have fallen right are so few, that they may justly be deemed to have fallen right by Chance, and that if any thing has been foretold
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:55305:195"/>
very punctually and circumstantially, it may as well, nay better, be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to proceed from the secret insinuations or visible converse with the <hi>aiery Wanderers,</hi> then from the indication of the Stars; and lastly, seeing there is that affinity and frequent association of <hi>Astrology</hi> with <hi>Daemono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> and ancient Pagan Superstition; that person certainly must have a strangely-impure and effascinable passivity of Phancie, that can be bound over to a belief or liking of a Foolery so utterly groundless as <hi>Astrology</hi> is, and so nearly verging toward the brinks of Apostasie and Impiety.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I have now finished my Astrological Excursion, to which I was strongly tempted, in a just zeal and resentment of that unparallel'd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption and wicked sauciness of the vain-glorious <hi>Cardan,</hi> who either in a rampant fit of pride and thirst after admiration, or out of a malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous design to all true Piety, would make the world believe that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity and Sacrosanctity of Christian Religion was subjected to his imaginary laws of the Stars, and that the fate of Christ the Son of God, miraculously born of the Holy Ghost, was writ in his Nativity, which forsooth he pretended to have calculated: As if all that <hi>Iustice, Meekness</hi> and <hi>power of working of Miracles</hi> were deriv'd upon our Saviour from the Natural influence of the Configuration of the Heavens at his Birth; and as if he did not <hi>willingly</hi> lay down his life for the World, <note n="*" place="margin">John 10.18.</note> as he himself professes, but were surprized by <hi>Fate,</hi> and lay subject to the stroke of an <hi>Astrological</hi>

WE have no finished the Third part of our Discourse, and have sufficiently proved, That Christianity is not only a <hi>Reasonable</hi> and Intelligible Idea of something that may be worth Providence's setting on foot some time or other, or as a <hi>seminal Form</hi> lurking unactive in the seed under ground; but that it has shot it self into Real existence, and is as a grown Tree that spreads its arms far and wide. It remains now that we consider the Branches and Fruit thereof. And I dare boldly pronounce that this is the Tree whose leaves were intended for the <hi>Healing</hi> of the Nations, not for a <hi>Pretence</hi> and <hi>Palliation</hi> for Sin; and that the Fruit thereof to the true Believer is Life and Immortality. This is a brief comprehension of the glorious End and great Usefulness of the Gospel. But we shall be something more explicate in a matter of so mighty importance. You may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand out of what has been said in the First part concerning the <hi>Nature of the Mystery of Godliness,</hi> that the Gospel is a kind of Engine to raise the <hi>Divine life</hi> into those Triumphs that are due to it, and are designed for it from everlasting by the all-seeing Providence of God. Let us now consider how fit <hi>the Dispensation of the Gospel</hi> is for this purpose, that is to say, <hi>Those things that are testified in it,</hi> or <hi>prophesied of it,</hi> or <hi>intimated by it,</hi> how all these things aim and conspire to this End; partly by affording the most effectual means imaginable for the re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalling the Soul into an higher state of Righteousness here, then any other Dispensation that has yet appeared in the World, and thereby more certainly transplanting her hereafter into a blessed state of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Life; and partly by exhibiting such warrantable grounds of doing Divine Homage to the Lord Jesus Christ, in whom this Life we speak of resideth so plentifully, he being anointed therewith far above the measure of his fellows. So that in this respect, though the other design has taken so little effect in the World, yet we cannot but acknowledge that the <hi>Divine life</hi> has not been disappointed of all her exteriour Pomps and Triumphs. We shall begin with the former kinds of the <hi>Powers</hi> of this <hi>Engine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The First wherof consists in this, <hi>In that it is so plainly and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared in the New Testament, That the great End of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the World was to remove Sin out of it, and to purifie mens Souls from all uncleanness and wickedness</hi>; as is apparent from sundry
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:55305:196"/>
places. As 1 John chap. 3. <hi>He that committeth sin is of the Devil; for the Devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the Devil. Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is born of God, doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</hi> Again, Tit. chap. 2. <hi>For the grace of God that bringeth Salvation hath appeared to all men; tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching us, that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, righteously and godly in this present world; Looking for that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed hope and glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ; who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie to himself a peculiar people, Zealous of good works.</hi> Also Ephes. ch. 5. v. 25. <hi>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctifie and cleanse it with the washing of water, by the word: That he might present it to himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might add several other places, but I shall content my self with but one ratification more of this truth from the mouth of our blessed Saviour, who professes <hi>he came not to destroy the Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 5.17.</note> 
                  <hi>but to fulfill it,</hi> that is, to set it at an higher pitch, as appears by the whole scope of his Sermon upon the Mount. The observance of which Precepts he does seriously require of his disciples and followers; as appears from that Similitude he closes his discourse withall, where he pronounces that they that kept and practised his sayings, should be safe as one that builds his house upon a Rock;<note place="margin">Matth. 7.24.</note> but those that heard and practised not should be as he that built on the Sand, that is, upon a false and deceitfull foundation. And a little above he does plainly protest even against such that may have prophesied, cast out Devils and done Miracles in his name, (which yet are greater matters then either the making or hearing of long Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or long Sermons,) because they kept not this Law of Righteousness he there propounds, he does protest that in the day of Judgment <hi>he will not know them,</hi> but bid them <hi>depart from him,</hi> as <hi>Workers of Iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is sufficient to demonstrate That the End of the Gospel is to renovate the Spirits of men into true and real inherent <hi>Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> which in counter-distinction to the <hi>Animal life</hi> (which had do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineered in the World so long, not only in the prophane Actions but also in the very <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 3. chap. 6, &amp; 7.</note> Religious Rites of the Heathens, as I have already shewn at large) I have denominated <hi>the Life Divine,</hi> and numbred out those Three parts it most consists of, namely, <hi>Humility, Charity</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi>; and therefore it will not be unseasonable to shew how expresly and particularly urgent the Gospel is for the promoting these three Graces.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Saviour Christ Matth. 11. makes a solemn invitation to the first of these Vertues, propounding himself an Example; <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you shall find rest unto your souls.</hi> And Matth. 5. v. 5. <hi>Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</hi> It is a promise from the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:55305:196"/>
same mouth. The meaning of both which places is, That <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Meekness</hi> beget a great deal of Peace and Tranquillity and enjoyment of a mans self even in this life, whenas <hi>Pride</hi> exposes a man to perpetual Discontent and Impatiency. Besides that the <hi>Proud</hi> man is as it were the Butt that the Almighty shoots his Arrows against to gall, wound and vex; the very hackstock of Divine vengeance, and the sport and pastime of Misfortune.<note place="margin">James 4.6.</note> 
                  <hi>God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.</hi> But my purpose is not to interpret such easie places as I alledge, but merely to bring them into the Readers view.</p>
               <p>And there are many more yet that testifie of the Excellency of this Grace of <hi>Humility.</hi> For our Saviour again (<hi>Matth.</hi> 11.) entitles those Vertues especially to the knowledge of the Mystery of the kingdome of God. <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, because, thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemeth good in thy sight.</hi> And <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. Christ being asked who is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven, called a little childe unto him, and set him in the midst of them, and said, <hi>Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of Heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little childe, the same is greatest in the kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And Chap. 20.25. <hi>Ye know that the Princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you; but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your Minister; and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will be chief among you, let him be your servant. Even as the Son of man came not to be ministred unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransome for many.</hi> In which passage is insinuated, that useless and pompous honour is to have no place in the Church of Christ; but that if any mans office be <hi>more honourable</hi> then another, it must be also <hi>more serviceable,</hi> especially in matters appertaining to Religion.</p>
               <p>For to the like purpose is that <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. where the <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie</hi> of the Scribes and Pharisees is taxed. <hi>For they binde heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>and grievous to be born, and lay them upon mens shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. But all their works they do to be seen of men: they make broad their Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, and love the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most rooms at Feasts, and the chief seats in the Synagogues, and greetings in the market-places, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.

Thus expresly does the Gospel recommend <hi>Humility</hi> to the World.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THe next Branch of the <hi>Divine Life</hi> is <hi>Christian Love</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> then which nothing is more inculcated in the New Testament. Christ has left it as his Motto, and the Motto of his Church, the <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolum</hi> or Word whereby it may be known to whom they belong. <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.34. <hi>A new commandement I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye love one another.</hi> As if he should have said, You may have heard something indeed out of <hi>Moses</hi> of loving ones neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as himself; which Precept as it did not reach so far as I intend this of mine, and that which it reached at is utterly laid aside and neglected, I now afresh set it on foot, and upon such terms and in such a degree and manner as never was yet. For I would have you <hi>love one another even as I have loved you,</hi> that is, so heartily and sincerely, that you will be ready to lay your lives down one for another, if need require. Which is more express, Chap. 15.12. <hi>This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. Greater love hath no man then this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</hi> Which Christ doing for his Church, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in those circumstances he did, is an unparallel'd <hi>specimen</hi> of true love indeed, and the highest obligation that can be of our loving both him and one another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Which things while I consider, I cannot with patience think upon the gross imposture of that bold <hi>Enthusiast of Amsterdam,</hi> who giving no sound evidence of any such <hi>Love</hi> as may be deemed rightly either <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> or <hi>Divine,</hi> only tumbling out a Rhapsody of swelling words, distor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:55305:197"/>
Allegories, and slight allusions to the History of Scripture, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingling them or strinkling them ever and anon with the specious name of <hi>Love,</hi> (though there be no motive nor reason that urges the thing it self all the while,) would give out himself such a Master of this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, as that Christianity must be super-annuated, and all the devotio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Homage due to our Saviour laid aside, all his Offices silenced, his Passion slighted, nay derided, his visible Return to Judgement antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated and eluded, his Resurrection and Ascension misbelieved, and the promise of Eternal Life swallowed up in the present glorious enjoyments and enrichments of them that will give up their soundness of judgement and reason to be led about with the May-games and Morrice-dances of that sweet Sect that have usurped to themselves the Title of the <hi>Family of Love.</hi> Whenas the Authour of this Faction, as I am well enough informed, was more likely to prove a Pimp or second <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> then a true Instructor of the World in so holy a Mystery; being infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for having suspected Females in his House, and living splendidly and deliciously above his rank; noted for his crimson-Satten doublet and other correspondent habiliments, as also for his large Looking-glass, wherein he often contemplated his whole begodded Humanity; and composing his long beard, and stroaking down his Satten sides, might strut in admiration of himself, that he found the World so favourable to his false Impostures; and lastly, ridiculous for his women-Scribes, and other such like soft doings, not to say impure and obscene. All which to any man that has but a moderate nasuteness cannot but import, that in the title of this Sect that call themselves the <hi>Family of Love,</hi> there must be signified no other love then that which is merely <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal</hi>; though the Preacher of this <hi>Love-mystery</hi> bears himself so aloft, and is so high upon the wing, that he cannot phansie himself any thing lesse then that <hi>Apocalypticall Angel</hi> flying in the midst of Heaven, and preaching the <hi>everlasting Gospel</hi> to the Inhabitants of the World. And truly this Gospel of <hi>Henry of Amsterdam</hi> is likely to be as lasting as the <hi>generations</hi> of men, and, I may adde, as universall as both <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Brutes.</hi>

Iudgement also will I lay to the line, and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the plummet, and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lyes, and the waters shall overflow their hiding-places.</hi> That this <hi>corner-stone</hi> and <hi>sure foundation</hi> is <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.6.

                  <hi>Christ</hi> that suffered at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> we are infallibly informed by those that were truly inspired, the blessed Apostles. That the <hi>refuge of lyes</hi> and <hi>hiding-place</hi> is most naturally applicable to this skulking Family, is apparent, in that the summe of their Religion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a bundle of <hi>lying Allegories</hi> and <hi>Canting Terms,</hi> whereby they deal falsly with men; and under the pretence of fine Mystical spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, would thrust out of the World the choicest and most beneficiall Truth that ever was imparted to the Sons of men; I mean the Truth of
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:55305:198"/>
the Gospel in the plain simplicity thereof, whereby we are so clearly taught what we are <hi>to be, to do,</hi> and <hi>to expect.</hi> And <hi>the Storm that shall overtake them,</hi> and <hi>the Deluge that shall fall in upon them in their hidden dwellings,</hi> shall be those Torrents of Reason and that irresistible convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the sincere and true-hearted followers of Christ.</p>
               <p>Tell me therefore, O ye conceitedly-inspired, whose phancies have blown you above Gospel-dispensations, why do you run into the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Jews, and refuse this <hi>precious corner-stone,</hi> this <hi>sure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and build upon disunited Sand and rotten Quagmires, that will bear no weight? Why do you lay aside Christ in the truth of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, the most palpable pledge of Divine Providence, of God's Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to men and of future Happiness, that ever was exhibited to the World, and chuse for your Guide a mere Allegorical Whisler, an Idol-Puppet dressed up in words and phrases filched out of the Scripture, but perverting and eluding the main scope and most usefull meaning thereof?</p>
               <p>Why have ye forsaken the only-begotten Sonne of God, and given your selves up to the deceivable conduct of a mere carnall man, and wholy destitute not only of true faith in God and Christ, but of all substantial Knowledge and Reason? Why are you so rash and giddy as to believe one that only testifies of himself, and is so impudent a Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giary as to offer you no wares but such as he has stolne from you, if you pretend to be of the Christian Church; and those so poisoned and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated, that you cannot receive them without the danger of being struck into a misbelief of the truth of Christs Gospel, and of revolting from him to whom so many illustrious Prophecies of old, so many Miracles done by himself, to whom his wonderfull Resurrection from the dead, and audible voices from Heaven while he was living, gave ample testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that he was indeed the true Son of God?</p>
               <p n="4">4. What indearing evidence or argument has this Mercer of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam</hi> given you of true compassion and love to mankinde, that you should vaunt him so transcendent a <hi>Mystagogus</hi> in so divine a Mystery, that you equalize him to, nay, exalt him above Christ and his Apostles? Did he not live a lazy, easie, soft life, as other rich Shop-keepers do; whenas not only our Saviour himself but also his Apostles lived an hard <hi>Asketick</hi> life, full of dangers and afflictions also from without? Let S. <hi>Paul</hi> speak for the rest, for they were in a manner all of them in the same case, and might justly expostulate with these high fanatick Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders in the same words:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.23, 24, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Are they Ministers of Christ? (I speak like a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths often.

and torturous deaths which most of them underwent at last: and all this out of a faithfull love to their Lord and Master Jesus Christ, and a dear regard to the good and Salvation of mankinde. But what was it wherewith this <hi>H. N.</hi> obliged the world so that all due homage and divine reverence to the Person of Christ must be laid aside, and this bold Impostor silence the constant faith of Christians, by his high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions of being the Head and Father of such a <hi>Family</hi> whose <hi>Inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> must be <hi>Love,</hi> who with this Family of his, is <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Cherubims</hi> and <hi>Seraphims, Angels</hi> and <hi>Arch-Angels</hi> already busie in their office of judging the quick and the dead, and gathering the elect from all the corners of the Earth?</p>
               <p n="5">5. But in my apprehension at the very first sight he shews himself very injudicious, if not malicious, in making a difference betwixt the true <hi>Houshold of Faith</hi> and <hi>Family of Love</hi>; besides his gross and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent injustice in usurping that <hi>badge of honour</hi> to himself that was won by another in a <hi>field of bloud.</hi> For, as I was going to say, what has this <hi>H. N.</hi> done to merit this title more then in scribling many fanatical Rhapsodies of unsound language, abusively borrowed from the sacred Scriptures, and in perverting the sense and supplanting the end by his wicked elusions and vain Allegorical evasions, and so under pretense of beginning an higher dispensation of Righteousnes and Religion in the world then ever was yet, treacherously introducing in stead of true Religion nothing but <hi>Sadducisme, Epicurisme</hi> and <hi>Atheisme?</hi> This voluminous <hi>Enthusiasme</hi> of his, together with the gracing of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the splendour of his crimson habiliments, is all I find that can pretend to any contestation or competition with the true Master of Divine Love, or to any obligation of his Followers.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I must confess our Saviour compiled no Books, it being a piece of Pedantry below so noble and Divine a person. But that short Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which he writ with his own most precious bloud, <hi>As I have loved you, so love you one another,</hi> is worth millions of Volumes, though written with the truest and sincerest Eloquence that ever fell from the pen of an Oratour. Nor did he wear any gay Clothes, but when by force the abusive souldiers put a scarlet robe upon him inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight and mockery. Nor was he resplendent in any colours but what was the die of his own bloud in his solemn and dreadful Passion, when he was so cruelly scourged, when out of agonie of mind he sweat drops of bloud, when he was nailed to the Cross, and the lance let bloud and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of his side. All which ineffable and unsupportable torments this innocent Lamb of God suffered for no demerit of his, (for what thank is it to suffer for a factious Impostor or open evil doer?) but out of mere compassion and hearty love to mankind, that he might by this bitter Passion of his, and the glorious consequences of it, his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Ascension, gain us to God. And now let all men judge if there can be possibly any Authour or pretended Instructer of the World, in that <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>divine Love</hi> indeed, comparable to the Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> who has given this unparallel'd demonstration of his love unto us.</p>

III. <hi>1.</hi> The occasion of the <hi>Familists</hi> usurpation of the Title of <hi>Love. 2.</hi> Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest precepts out of the Apostles to follow Love, and what kind of <hi>Love</hi> that is. <hi>3.</hi> That we cannot love God, unless we love our neighbour also. <hi>4.</hi> An Exposition of the <hi>5</hi> and <hi>6</hi> verses of the <hi>1</hi> chapter of the <hi>2</hi> Epist. of S. <hi>Peter. 5.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s rapturous commendation of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. 6.</hi> His accurate description thereof. <hi>7.</hi> That <hi>Love</hi> is the highest participation of the Divinity, and that whereby we become the Sons of God. And how injurious these Fanaticks are that rob the Church of Christ of this title to appropriate it to themselves.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>HEarken therefore to me, yet that would follow after righteousness, ye that seek the Lord:<note place="margin">Isa. 51.1.</note> Look unto the rock whence you were hewen, and to the hole of the pit from whence you were digged.</hi> Look upon him whom ye have pierced, and whose bloud is the seed of the Church, whose Spouse was taken out of his side as <hi>Eve</hi> out of the side of <hi>Adam.</hi> Acknowledge your original, and recount with your selves the price of your Redemption, even the inestimable bloud of that immaculate Lamb Christ Jesus. The sense whereof is the strongest cement imaginable to unite us to our Saviour and one unto another.</p>
               <p>But the Church having been given up so long a time to bitter facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and persecutions, to warre and bloudshed, and all manner of enmity and hostility one against another, it is no wonder if a stranger has invaded that Title, which she may justly be thought to have either refused or forfeited. For my own part, I know not how to apologize for either the fond opinions or foul miscarriages of the Wilderness of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But sure I am That the <hi>Banner</hi> over the <hi>true Spouse of Christ</hi> is <hi>Love:</hi> That Love is the badge and cognoscence of all his faithful mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, by which they are known to be His living members indeed: That Love and Peace is the last Legacy which was left to the disciples by their dying Lord and Master; an inheritance entailed upon all the true sons of God for ever: That Love is the fulfilling of the Law, and has filled almost every page of the Gospel and all the Writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; and when they speak of <hi>Faith,</hi> it is none other <hi>Faith</hi> then that <hi>which worketh by Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Out of the many repetitions and inculcations of this holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Vertue I was a gleaning out some to present you withall, for an evidence how serious the Gospel of Christ is and how sufficient in the urging of his indispensable duty. We go on therefore, and adde to what we have already cited these following places. Galat. 5.6. <hi>For in Iesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but Faith which worketh by Love.</hi> And if <hi>Circumcision</hi> be nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Faith working by Love,</hi> what can <hi>Baptizing</hi> or Rebaptizing or any external ceremony be without this true <hi>Faith</hi> whose life and spirit is <hi>Love,</hi> which the Apostle directs us to? And after v. 13, 14. <hi>For, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:55305:199"/>
ye have been called unto liberty; only use not your liberty for an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. For all the Law is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in one word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self.</hi> Where this <hi>Law of Love</hi> is so carefully described, that the abuse of this Title to Lust and Libertinisme is plainly excluded, against such as talk so much of <hi>Love,</hi> and are but <hi>Libertines</hi> at the bottom. Which cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on also is very soberly and prudently put in by S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> Ep. 1. chap. 5. v. 2. <hi>By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his Commandements.</hi> Which is a plain demonstration that that <hi>Love</hi> which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> exhorts to so copiously in his Epistle, is a <hi>Love pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divine,</hi> and such as no man can be assured he doth practise, unlesse he keep all the Commandements of God. For even a carnall man may love the Children of God, because he findes them harmless, peaceable and beneficiall, or because himself is of a good sanguine benigne complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But this Love, in a man that makes not conscience of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God, is merely <hi>animal</hi> and <hi>natural</hi>; not proceeding from that community of the Divine Spirit which all the Regenerate partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of, but out of <hi>complexion</hi> and <hi>self-love,</hi> which will adhere to any thing that it feels a naturall comfort from. But if this Childe of God prove something spinose and harsh in opposing, rebuking, or it may be not complying with some dearly-beloved humours of this good-natured sanguine; his corrupt bloud will then begin to boyl against the Son of God, and return him hatred for his good will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And as this blessed Apostle and peculiarly-beloved of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our has made so carefull a caution, that the <hi>Love</hi> he recommends to the world should not slack so low as to draggle in the dirt; so has he wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided against the Hypocrisie of high-flown <hi>Religionists,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be so transported with love to God and his service, that they quite forget their neighbour: and therefore at the end of the foregoing Chapter he does plainly pronounce,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.20.</note> that <hi>If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a lyar: For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? And this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement have we from him, that he that loveth God, love his brother also.</hi> Which duty of the Second Table being most hard, and the most l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>able to be cast off through the Hypocrisie of mens hearts, the inculcation thereof is most frequent with the Apostles. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> chap. 4. ver. 31. <hi>Let all bitternesse, and anger, and wrath, and clamour, and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kinde one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christs sake has forgiven you. Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear Children; and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an Offering and a Sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour.</hi> And <hi>Colos.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Put on therefore (as the elect of God, holy and beloved) bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of mercies, kindenesse, humblenesse of minde, meeknesse, long-suffering; Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, even as Christ forgave you. And above all things put on Charity, which is the bond of perfectnesse: and let the peace of God rule in your hearts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Peter</hi> also, in his first ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Epistle,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:55305:200"/>
through the Spirit, unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ver. 5.</note> And in his second Epistle, ch. 1. <hi>And besides this, giving all diligence, adde to your faith vertue; and to vertue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; and to patience, godlinesse; and to godlinesse, brotherly kindnesse; and to brotherly kindnesse, charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The coherence of this golden chain of Divine Graces is so admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable that I cannot passe it by, though it be beside my present purpose to speak any thing of the places I cite. But we shall not so well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the fit connexion of these Vertues with themselves, nor of the whole link of them with the precedent Text, without rectifying the Translation in a word or two. The Apostle in the foregoing verses in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates to them how God has provided for them <hi>according to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power all things appertaining to life and Godlinesse, through the knowledge of his Son Iesus Christ, who hath called us in glory and</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>power.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and given us exceeding great and precious promises, that having e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped the corruption that is in the World through lust,</hi> we should <hi>be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the divine nature:</hi> and then comes in what has been recited, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which they have rendred, <hi>And besides this.</hi> Which Translation makes no connexion of sense with the former words, but is very abrupt, nor will the phrase I think bear that meaning. It is better sense and more laudable Criticisme to render it thus, <hi>And therefore forthwith,</hi> or <hi>without any more adoe, adde to your faith ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> &amp;c. Which latter words are not well rendred neither. The Greek is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Grotius</hi> would have <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant there; so that his suffrage is for the English Translation. But for my own part I think that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is so far from being redundant, that it is essentiall to the sentence, and interposed that we might understand a greater Mystery then the mere adding of so many Vertues one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which would be all that could be expresly signified if <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> were left out. But the preposition here signifying <hi>causality,</hi> there is more then a mere enumeration of those Divine Graces. For there is also implied how naturally they rise one out of another, and that they have a causall dependence one of another.</p>
               <p>Therefore the sense is, That God having on his part fitted all things for their Salvation, and they having obtained like precious Faith with the Apostle himself, that through the efficacy of their Faith they should also acquire <hi>Virtue,</hi> that is, Strength and Fortitude. For high and noble Promises excite courage and resolution to set upon the difficulties through which they must passe that would obtain the Promises. And this encountring with the difficulties that are in a Christian mans way, while he is not a talker of Christianity but a reall actour and cordiall endeavourer to follow the Precepts and Example of Christ, will beget not verbal but true <hi>Knowledge</hi> in him, that is, <hi>holy Experience</hi> in the wayes of God. And in this <hi>Experience</hi> he is taught how those fleshly and worldly lusts and desires have often deceived him, and led him out of the way, blinding his judgement by their importunate suggestions, and extinguishing, or at least dulling, those more religious and divine
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:55305:200"/>
senses of the Soul, when their importunities are listened to and their cravings satisfied. And therefore this <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> begets <hi>Temperance,</hi> that is, a more rigid resolution of curbing and keeping un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of all worldly and carnal desires, and a peremptory refraining from giving any answer to their impudent beggings and cravings.</p>
               <p>Which things if a man seriously attempt in its due extent and lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, questionless he will put himself upon a very intolerable task, and there will be no remedy but <hi>Patience</hi>; which he will find so mightily out of his power, that he will be forced upon his knees to the God of heaven to comfort, assist and strengthen him in his agony and conflict against his domestick enemies, and to support his spirit in so great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and pain. Whence it is plain that we cannot keep close to the laws of <hi>Temperance,</hi> but that <hi>Patience</hi> will necessarily emerge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from; nor be kept in this Spirit of <hi>Patience</hi> without the invocation and acknowledgment of Divine assistance, which is an unquestionable fruit of <hi>Godliness</hi> properly so called.</p>
               <p>Nor can we applie our hearts seriously and sincerely to this kind of <hi>Godliness</hi> long, but we shall find answers to our praiers and breathings after God, beyond both our own expectation and the belief of others: and therefore enjoying the victory through the Divine grace that is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for us, and getting so glorious a triumph over our lusts, we finding our Souls transported with an high sense of thankfulness to our Redeemer and Benefactour, who wants nothing of our retributions himself, the stream of our affections is naturally driven downwards to his Church,<note place="margin">Psalm 16.2, 3.</note> to the Saints that dwell upon earth, and those that excell in vertue, or at least pretend unfeigned endeavours after it. And this is properly <hi>brotherly Kindness,</hi> which carries our affections to those that profess the same Religion with our selves. Which <hi>brotherly Kindness</hi> arises not only out of this consideration of thankfulness toward God, but out of the very temper and condition of the Soul thus purified: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what S. <hi>Peter</hi> intimates, that having purified our Souls in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth through the Spirit, the end and result thereof is the loving our brethren. Or else what serves this Purification for?</p>
               <p>Shall Envy, shall Hatred, shall Lust, shall Ambition, shall Luxury, shall those enormous desires and affections be cast out of the Soul by Sanctity and Purity, that she may be but a transparent piece of ice or a spotless fleece of snow? Shall she become so pure, so pellucid, so crystalline, so devoid of all stains and tinctures, of all soil and duller colours, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but still shadows and Night may possess that inward diaphanous Purity? Then would she be no better then the nocturnall Air, no hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier then a statue of Alabaster. All would be but a more cleanly sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre of a dead starved Soul. But there is no fear of so poor an event upon so great preparations. For <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Desire</hi> are so essentiall to the Soul, that she cannot put them off but change them. She is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Psellus</hi> calls her, <hi>an immaterial and incorporeal fire,</hi> an unextinguishable activity, and will catch at some Object or other. And therefore if she has ceased to love the world and the Lusts of her own body, she will certainly love the body of Christ, the Church, and study
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:55305:201"/>
how to help them and advantage them. Nor can she stop here, but this pure and quick flame mounts upwards and is reflected again downwards, and vibrates every way, reaching at all Objects in Heaven and in Earth, as natural fire enters all combustible matter. And therefore in her pure and ardent speculations of the Godhead and his unlimited Goodness, and also her observations of the capacity of the whole Creation of receiving good both from him and one another, she overflowes those narrow bounds of <hi>brotherly Love,</hi> and spreads out into that ineffably-ample and transcendently-divine grace and vertue, <hi>universal Charity,</hi> which is the highest accomplishment the Soul of man is capable of either in this life or that which is to come: and thus at last she becomes <hi>perfect, as her Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This is that <hi>most excellent way</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks so transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly and triumphantly of, 1 Cor. ch. 13. Where having first numbred out the manifold Gifts that God bestowed upon his Church, as Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Prophesying, working of miracles, gifts of healing, and diversity of tongues, he immediately breaks out in the rapturous commendations of <hi>Charity</hi> above all. <hi>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and have not Charity, I am become as a sounding brass and a tinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling cymball. And though I have the gift of Prophecie, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have no Charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not Charity, it profiteth me nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And after he has raised our expectation and estimation of this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly grace with these high words of his, he does not, as the vain <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiast</hi> does, heat our phancies and leave our judgment in the dark; but he does very distinctly and copiously describe to us the nature of this Divine vertue; so that we may plainly know where to be, and what to seek after, and how to be satisfied whether we have attained to it or no.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Charity suffereth long, and is kinde; Charity envies not; Charity vaunteth not it self, is not puffed up, doth not behave her self unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evill, complies not with iniquity, but rejoiceth with the truth; Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</hi> This is a very full and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly description of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and the character of the sweetest and Heavenliest perfection that is communicable to the nature of man; and so warmly poured out from the sincere heart of this rich possessour of it, the holy Apostle, that it is to me more moving then all the canting language of the highest fanatical Pretenders to the profession of this Mystery.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This is the highest participation of Divinity that humane nature is capable of on this side that Mysterious conjunction of the Humanity of Christ with the Godhead; and therefore this is that whereby we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> has evidently declared in his 1. Epistle general, ch. 4. <hi>Beloved, let us love one another: for Love is of God; and every one that loveth, is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is Love.</hi> And vers. 10. <hi>Herein is love,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:55305:201"/>
not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be a propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. No man hath seen God at any time: If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.</hi> And again vers. 16. <hi>God is Love; and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi> Several other Testimonies there are of the high estimate the true Church of Christ has of this holy Vertue of <hi>Love</hi>: but what I have already ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is sufficient to shew how urgent the Precepts of the Gospel are for this excellent branch of the <hi>Divine life,</hi> which we call <hi>Charity</hi>; as also how inexcusably injurious, impious and blasphemous to Christ those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical Impostors are that revolt from the Church, superannuate Christ's offices, and antiquate the Christian Religion, under a pretence of an higher dispensation and Revelation upon which they have set the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or Superscription of <hi>Love,</hi> adorning themselves with the Churches colours, that by this evil stratagem they may the more safely fall upon her and destroy her, at least seduce the most simple and, many times, the best-meaning members of the Church from their true Head, Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, who ransom'd them with his own most precious bloud. Whose Soveraignty over his Church cannot cease, himself not ceasing to be; but he is a Priest and King for ever according to the Prophecies.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THE third Branch of the Divine Life is <hi>Purity.</hi> In the urging whereof both Christ and his Apostles being so earnest, it is plain, that that <hi>Love</hi> which they recommend to the World can be no suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted affection, like that which the canting language of the <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> may justly be thought to favour; but that it is that <hi>pure and holy Love</hi> indeed, which deservedly we have styled <hi>Divine.</hi> And how severely this <hi>Purity</hi> we speak of is required, I shall give you some few but very sufficient instances. Matth. 5.27. <hi>Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery already with her in his heart. And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is better for thee that one of thy members should perish, then that thy whole body should be cast into Hell. And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee,</hi> &amp;c. What more serious and earnest monition can there be made to Continence and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:55305:202"/>
from sensual pleasures then this of our Saviour, who upon no less penaltie then the torments of Hell interdicts us all looseness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness; forbidding us all preludious preparations to the foul acts of Lust, and not permitting so much as an imaginary scene of illicit trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, to which our will could really assent if opportunity were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered?</p>
               <p n="2">2. And we shall find the Apostles insisting in the footsteps of their Master in this matter. 2. Corinth. 6. <hi>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separated, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you: And I will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. Having therefore these promises (dearly beloved) let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</hi> And 1 Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. 5. <hi>The God of peace sanctifie you wholy; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> And in the former chapter, ver. 3. <hi>For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication: That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour; not in the lust of concupiscence, as the Gentiles that know not God.</hi> And 1 Corinth. 6. ver. 13. <hi>Now the bodie is not for fornication, but the Lord; and the Lord for the bodie: And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also quicken us by his own power. Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doth, is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. What? know ye not that your Body is the Temple of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorifie God in your bodie and in your Spirit, which are God's.</hi> Also Coloss. 3.5. <hi>Mortifie therefore your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which are upon the earth, Fornication, Uncleanness, immoderate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, evil Concupiscence, and Covetousness, which is Idolatry. For which things sake the wrath of God cometh upon the children of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> Parallel to which is that Ephes. 5.3. <hi>Walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us: but fornication and all uncleanness and covetousness, let it not be so much as once named amongst you, as becomes saints. Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, which are not convenient; but rather giving of thanks. For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an Idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdome of Christ and of God. Let no man deceive you with vain words; for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. Be not you therefore partakers with them.</hi> And 1 Corinth. 6.9. <hi>Know ye not the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdome of God? Be not deceived, neither fornicatours, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdome of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I have made a more ample collection of the enforcements of this duty of <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Sanctity</hi> then I intended; and yet I cannot abstain

from adding of two more: the one out of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Epist. ch. 2. <hi>Dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims to abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul.</hi> The other out of him which I have already so often cited, Rom. 13.12. <hi>The night is far spent, and the day is at hand; let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and put on the armour of light. Let us walk honestly as in the day, not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambring and wantonness, not in strife and envying: But put ye on the Lord Iesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. I have now abundantly shewn how plainly and explicitly Christ and his Apostles urge all men that are hearers of the Gospel to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and conscionable doers of the same, that they should be holy even as Christ was holy in all manner of conversation; that they are bound to endeavour and aspire after the participation of the Divine life and all the Branches thereof, <hi>Humility, Love</hi> and <hi>Purity, hating even the garment spotted by the flesh,</hi> as the Apostle <hi>Iude</hi> speaks. And how this Holiness and Righteousness is required of them with no less seriousness and earnestness then upon the forfeiture of their eternal Salvation if they do not act according to those Precepts. Insomuch that I stand amazed while I consider with my self that hellish and abominable gloss that some have put upon the Gospel, as if it were <hi>a mere school of loosness, and that the end of Christs coming into the world was but to bring down a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the sons of men whereby they might be enabled to sin with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> I am sure with all desirable security and impunity; nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing required on their part but to believe that Christ died for them, and upon no other condition then that bare belief: as if Christ did not give himself to redeem us from sin, but to assert our liberty of sinning; which is the most perverse and mischievous misconstruction of the grace of God revealed in Christ that possibly could be invented, and point-blank against the end and design of his coming into the world. <hi>For he gave himself for us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 2.14.</note> 
                  <hi>that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Yet as repugnant and irrational as this Errour is, it had attempted the Church betimes; as appears by sundry monitions of the Apostles, when exhorting their charge to holiness of life and real righteousness, they often intimate their proneness of being <hi>deceived</hi> in thinking they had leave to be remiss in these matters. Some instances you may have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served already: to which you may add that of S. <hi>Iames,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 1.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers onely, deceiving your own souls.</hi> But that of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> is most express and emphaticall,<note place="margin">1 John 3.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Little Children, let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you; he that doth righteousness, is righteous even as he is righteous,</hi> that is, even as Christ was righteous, who was not putatitiously and imaginarily righteous, but really so indeed: though it seems by this caution there were that went about in those times to perswade it might be otherwise. And I could wish that this errour were not so taking in the Church as it is at this day: then which notwithstanding no greater I think can be committed nor more dangerous, it rendring this admirable Engine (as I have termed it) which God has set up in the world for

Therefore that I may make all throughly glib and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, I find an obligation upon me not to rest in these, though never-so-evident testimonies, <hi>That we are strictly bound to inherent sanctity and holiness</hi>; but to clear also to the judicious the unwarrantableness and weakness of the grounds of this Errour, which they would obtrude upon the world as the chief Mystery of the Gospel, namely, <hi>That if one do but believe, though devoid of all sanctification, yet he is approved as holy and righteous by the imputation of Christs righteousness, and so consequently shall inherit everlasting life, let him live here as he will.</hi> I shall take the rise of my discourse from that grave and affectionate counsel the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apostle has given to young and weak Christians, and which I even now mentioned, <hi>Little children, let no man deceive you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THAT which <hi>Plato</hi> commends in Law-givers and Institutors or Governors of Commonwealths, that they have a special and prime care of Childhood and youth; as the diligent in Husbandry make peculiar fences for their young plants to save them from the dangers their tenderness exposes them to; that also is observable in the blessed Apostle, who amongst many other provisions he has made in the behalf of all younglings in Christianity, has also armed them and fenced them with this caution against being mistaken so dangerously in Christianity as to conceit they may by a bare professing themselves Christians be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, though there were neither any real Righteousness in their hearts nor any fruits of it in their hands. A wicked Errour which several Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers tempted men to, such as were <hi>Nicolaus, Marcio</hi> and <hi>Carpocrates,</hi> as Historians have taken notice of.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:55305:203"/>2. And because there can be no better Antidote then the being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that there is an obnoxiousness in younger Christians to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, I shall diligently search out and set forth the causes whereby they become obnoxious; that finding themselves so, they may have the greater care to keep themselves from being smitten with this pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiall infection.</p>
               <p>Where we shall finde that come to pass in Spirituall things that often happens in Natural. For as weak bodies contract diseases from meats and drinks, nay, from that which is so perpetual and palpable a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of life that we can scarce live one moment without it, I mean, the refreshing Aire, which casts many tender bodies into Agues and Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and other distempers: so tender and weak Souls often by ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction turn the very bread of Eternal life, the Word of God, into mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick matter; and in stead of getting growth and strength by feeding thereon, weaken the Divine life in them, and sink themselves into most dangerous and desperate maladies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The first cause then of the proneness of young Christians to this present Errour, is certain places of Scripture, the meaning whereof they not rightly understanding, make bold to interpret them in favour to their own carnality and fleshly desires. It would be too voluminous a business to cull out all the places that are perverted to this ill purpose. We shall content our selves in producing the chiefest, in answering to which we shall naturally satisfie all the rest.</p>
               <p>And these I may cast into two sorts. For they are such as either seem to import, That a bare Faith will justifie us, and so we may become righteous by an empty belief; or else such as seem to say, That the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ becomes ours, or, That we are righteous by that righteousness that is in him.</p>
               <p>And of the first kind is that <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. Now to him that worketh, is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward not reckoned of Grace, but of debt; but to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>For Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to every one that believeth.</hi> And at the ninth verse of the same Chapter, <hi>If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and shalt believe in thy heart that God has raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</hi> Which places seem to imply, that a mere belief that Christ has done or suffered this or that is our Justification and Salvation. I might adde <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. ver. 16. But I shall defer it till its proper place.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We come now to the second sort of Testimonies of Scripture which seem to impute the righteousness of Christ to us, and to teach us that it is that by which we become righteous. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>But of him are ye in Christ Iesus, who of God is made unto us Wisedom and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and Sanctification and Redemption.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>Therefore as by the offence of one judgement came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men to justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:55305:204"/>
of life. For as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</hi> From these and such like places young and unskilful Christians are prone to infer, that they may be righteous by the obedience or righteousness of Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied or imputed to them, though they have no real righteousness in their own Souls, nor care to act righteously. And this is the first cause of their proclivity to this unwholsome Errour. But there is another behinde, without the concurrence of which this former would be ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall. For all the passages in holy Scripture are certainly both sound and true; but it is the unsoundness and corruptness of our own mindes that draws poison out of these Herbs and Flowers of Paradise.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I say therefore in the second place, That the main cause of the propension of Christian Childehood to this gross Errour is in the very condition it self of those that are <hi>but Children</hi> in Christianity. For this <hi>childish state</hi> I conceive to be this; When a man makes indeed a free o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Profession of Christianity, and with all possible expressions of thanks to God for his rich mercy in the bloud of Christ for the remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sins, laies fast hold (as he thinks) on this grace by faith; having also some more weak inchoations of the life of Righteousness: But the old man is still very strong, the body of Sin very little subdued or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, so that whensoever they are encountred, the toyl is very heavy, and a world of work still behinde, and such ungrateful work and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that it is no <hi>Metaphor</hi> nor <hi>Hyperbole</hi> to say, it is <hi>a perpetual death,</hi> a <hi>continued crucifixion.</hi> This being then the condition of one that is but a little young childe in Christianity, I appeal to any one if there can chuse but be a very considerable proneness in such persons to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this toil and torture of Mortification, whereby they are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into higher degrees of Righteousness and life. And now we being very easily drawn to believe those things which make for our own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and the accomplishment of our desires, it must needs be that if any thing sound towards that sense, we shall easily make it up with a lusty belief that it is so indeed, and (it may be) thank God to boot for this <hi>amabilis insania,</hi> for these dear mistakes and dreams of ours. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at length to assume, The Scripture therefore seeming at first sight something to favour this opinion of being righteous without any reall Righteousness in our selves, but by that which is at a wide distance remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from us and placed in another; to save the pains of the great anguish and agony that the aspiring to inward real Righteousness will cost in this weak estate of Christian childehood, it cannot be but that he that has arrived to no higher condition, should very easily close with this so wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a notion, and having once embraced it, be angry at the very heart at any one that would rouze him from this so pleasing repose, or dissettle him from this false ease and joy: The weak and fainting heart of this tender age chusing rather (for present avoiding of smart) an hasty palliation then a sound cure.</p>
               <p>But that I may not rather confirm then bring off these Younglings from this dangerous Errour, by noting their most pregnant places and saying nothing to them; I shall endeavour to make it plain that, if they
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:55305:204"/>
please, they may understand those places otherwise then they do: and then, because that their gloss is not so consonant to Reason, nor the rest of the Scripture, that they ought to relinquish this unwarrantable sense which they have harboured in favour to their own vices and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And for our better preparation for this designe, we will first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the notion of the terms that so frequently occurre in the Epistles of S. Paul, and which so nearly concern our present matter. Such as are <hi>Faith, Righteousness, Iustification, Imputation,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>And first of <hi>Faith,</hi> which is so highly commended by the Apostle, I say, it signifies nothing else but this in general, <hi>viz. An high sense of and confidence in the Power, Iustice and Goodness of God, and a firm belief that he will assuredly bring to pass whatsoever he has promised, seem it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so unlikely and difficult to flesh and bloud.</hi> And this is that which was so commended in <hi>Abraham,</hi> as it is plain in the fourth to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4.18.</note> 
                  <hi>who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the Father of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations: And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, nor yet the deadness of Sara's womb; being fully perswaded that what God had promised he was able to perform. And therefore</hi> (saies the Apostle) <hi>it was imputed to him for righteousness.</hi> That is to say, God approved of him for a good and pious man, who not consulting with the natural improbability of the thing, but giving firm credence to the Promise of God, did that which was due to the Goodness and Power of God, and becoming a good and righteous man. So that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is nothing else but to <hi>be approved as a good man,</hi> or <hi>a doer of what is righteous and good, and that because he does that which is good and righteous.</hi> As this act of the Soul exerting her self above the low and sluggish tenour of Nature, and winging her self by lively sense of divine Power and Goodness, to the assenting to and resting in such things as the present state of Nature can never bring about, certainly is, and is esteemed and approved of God as a very righteous and good Act, and to proceed from a good and holy temper, which is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which signifies any vertue or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in a man whatsoever: So that act of <hi>Phinehas,</hi> when he so zealously did vengeance on <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi,</hi> it is said in the 106 <hi>Psalm, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it was looked upon by all succeeding generations as a very noble and eminent act of Righteousness,</hi> i. e. it was reputed according to its own nature. But the meaning is not, that this was in stead of all other Righteousness to him, and that he was reputed as righteous all over now, although he were not so at all in any other things.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now for <hi>Iustification,</hi> we shall best understand the meaning of the word from the Greek <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="8">
                  <note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note>8. Wherefore, to that in the 4. to the Romans: whose force will be the greater if we adde that also which is written a little before in the 3 chap. v. 28. <hi>Therefore we conclude, that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the Law</hi>; and what he inferrs also vers. 9. <hi>That Iews and Gentiles and all are under sin.</hi> Wherein the meaning of the Apostle is to magnifie, as was most fit, the ministration of the Gospel; and so he signifies to the world that whatsoever is discovered hitherto, is imperfect, lapsed and ruinous, all but weak and sinful before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of Christ, even <hi>the works of the Law</hi> themselves, and that smooth external Righteousness of <hi>mere Morality</hi> and <hi>Ceremony.</hi> So that all the world are found guilty before God, and by the deeds of the Law there shall be no flesh justified in his sight. <hi>For by the Law is but the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of sin,</hi> vers. 20. it gives no strength to perform.</p>
               <p>Wherefore now reckoning nothing upon all these things, we are as it were to begin the world again, and to endeavour after such a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness as is by Faith in Christ Jesus; and not to rest in any thing that may be done by the ordinary power of the flesh, but to aspire after that Righteousness which is communicable to us by that Spirit which raised Jesus Christ from the dead. But neither Abraham nor any one else can be justified by any carnal righteousness of their own; but that highly-spiritual act of Abraham reaching beyond the common rode of Nature, who against hope believed in hope, that was that which commended Abraham so much to God. And thus from the Example of Abraham would the Apostle commend the Christian faith to the world, and in particular to the Jews the Offspring of Abraham. For at the end of the fourth chapter he makes this use of Abraham's faith being imputed to him for Righteousness (that is, reputed by God as a very excellent good act,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.24, 25.</note> as it indeed was) that we might also be brought off to <hi>believe on him that raised up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>esus our Lord from the dead, who was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification.</hi> In which verse are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the two grand priviledges of the Gospel, that is, the <hi>forgiveness
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:55305:205"/>
of sins</hi> upon the satisfaction of Christs death, and the <hi>justifying</hi> of us, that is the making of us just and holy through a sound faith in him that raised Jesus from the dead. Which interpretation the 11 verse of the 8 Chapter doth sufficiently countenance, <hi>But if the Spirit of him that raised up Iesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortall bodies, by his Spirit that dwelleth in you,</hi> viz. to Righteousness: as is plain out of the foregoing verse, <hi>And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousnesse</hi>; that is, <hi>The body of death which we desire to be delivered from,</hi> as the Apostle speaks, appears by the presence of Christ in us to be thus deadly a body by reason of sin, we feeling for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent nothing but an heavy indisposition to all holinesse and goodnesse in the body and its affections, and all sinfulnesse and unclean Atheisticall suggestions from the flesh, which is death to the Soul. <hi>For to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally-minded is death.</hi> So that by reason of the sinfulnesse of our body and the sad heavinesse thereof, it appears as deadly and ghastly a thing to us as <hi>Mezentius</hi> his tying the living and the dead together, when once Christ is in us: but our <hi>Life</hi> is then that <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> which is of the Spirit, we finding a comfortable warmth and pleasure in the gratefull arrivals of that holy and Divine sensation. But he that raised Christ from the dead, will in due time even quicken these our mortall bodies, or these dead bodies of ours, and make them conspire and come along with ease and chearfulnesse, and be ready and active complying Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in all things with the Spirit of Righteousness.</p>
               <p>Which belief is a chief Point in the Christian Faith, and most of all parallel to that of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s, who believing in the Goodness and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Faithfulness of God, had, when both himself and his wife <hi>Sara</hi> were dry and dead as to natural generation, and so hopeless of ever see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any fruit of her womb, who had, I say, <note n="**" place="margin">

For <hi>Isaac</hi> is the Wisedom, Power and Righteousness of God flowing out and effectually branching it self so through all the Faculties both of mans Soul and Body, that the whole man is carried away with joy and triumph to the acting all whatsoever is really and substantially good, even with as much satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and pleasure as he eats when he is hungry, and drinks when he is dry. And thus by our entrance and progress in so holy a Dispensation, are we <hi>well approved</hi> of by God, and being <hi>justified thus by faith, we have peace with him through our Lord Iesus Christ, Rom.</hi> 5.1.</p>
               <p>So that this <hi>Iustification</hi> is not a mere belief that Christ died for us in particular, or that he was raised from the dead, whereby anothers Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is imputed to us: but a believing in God, that he has accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bloud of Christ as a Sacrifice for sin, and that he is able through
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:55305:206"/>
the power of the Spirit to raise us up to newness of life, whereby we are encouraged to breath and aspire after this more inward and perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse. Which advantages God propounds to all the hearers of the Gospel, without any respect of works or former demurenesse of life, if so be they will but now come in and close with this high and rich dispensation, and be carried on with couragious resolutions to fight against and pull down the man of sin within themselves, that this living and new way of real Divine righteousnesse may be set up and rule in their hearts. I say, if they be encouraged to this holy enterprise by Faith in Christ for the remission of sins, and for the power of his Spirit to utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eradicate and extirpate all inward corruption and wickednesse, this <hi>Faith</hi> is presently imputed to them for Righteousnesse; that is, they are, and are approved by God as dear children of his, and as good men, and are of the seed of the Promise. For they are born now not of the will of man, nor of the will of the flesh, but of the will of God; and their will is wholly set upon righteousnesse and true holinesse, which they hunger and thirst after as sincerely and eagerly as ever they did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their natural meat and drink: and God who feeds the young Ravens is not so cruell as to deny them this celestial food; which food they reach at and as it were wrest out of his hands by Faith in the power of his Spirit, whereby they account themselves able to doe <note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 4.13.</note> all things.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And this is the only warrantable notion that I can finde, of <hi>being justified by faith.</hi> Nor do those places above recited prove any other then this.

                  <hi>his faith is counted for righteousness,</hi>] may very well be interpreted according to that tenour of sense I have already declared. For that is the great and comfortable priviledge of the Gospel, that without any respect of former works, if so be we do but now believe remission of sins in Christ, and believe in his power that <hi>justifies the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,</hi> (i. e. that makes just the ungodly, and purifies and purges them from all sin and iniquity, from which by their own naturall power they could not purged, and restores them to inward reall righteousnesse by the working of his Spirit) this Faith is imputed for Righteousnesse. For they that do thus believe, are good and righteous men for matter of sincerity, so that they have peace with God through the bloud of Christ, and by the power of that Spirit that is now working in them, are renewed daily more and more into that glorious image and desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble liberty which arises in the further conquest of the Divine life in them, and makes them righteous even as Christ was righteous.</p>
               <p>And now the hardest is satisfied, the other places alledged will easily fall of themselves by the application of what has been said concerning this nature of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Iustification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. As for those places of Scripture that seem to attribute the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ to us, as where he is said to <hi>be made unto us wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption,</hi> the sense is only this, that he <hi>works</hi> in us wisedom, righteousness, &amp;c. Otherwise it might be
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:55305:206"/>
inferred that we shall have only an imputative Redemption, and that we shall not be really saved and redeemed. As for that other, <hi>As by the disobedience of one man many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one man many shall be made righteous,</hi> I say it is a place against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: For by <hi>Adam</hi> we became really sinners and sinful, contracting original corruption from his loins; therefore by Christ we are to be made really righteous. And this was the end of his obedience that <hi>was obedient even to the death of the crosse, that we being buried with him by baptisme into death, like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life,</hi> Rom. 6.</p>
               <p>Wherefore there really being no ground in Scripture for this childish mistake, and it being as unreasonable that one Soul should be righteous for another, as that one Body should be in health for another; if I shew that the Scripture it self does expresly require of us that we be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy in our own persons, there is then nothing wanting to the full discovery of this childish and ungrounded conceit of being righteous without any Righteousness residing in us.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And in my apprehension this very Text of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> is a clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this Truth,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.7.</note> it plainly declaring that they are mistaken who ever conceit themselves righteous without doing righteousnesse, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being righteous in such a sense as Christ himself was righteous. There are also several other Testimonies of the Apostles to the same purpose, some whereof I have noted already; as where he saith, <hi>That Christ was manifested to take away our sins,</hi> and <hi>that he came to destroy the works of the Devil</hi>; and <hi>that he that is born of God, sinneth not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the seed of God abideth in him,</hi> that is, a permanent Principle of Divine life and sense, whereby he seeth and abhorreth whatsoever is wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and unholy.

               <p n="1">1. AS for that Text which we deferred to speak to, we shall now take it into consideration. It was <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Iesus Christ, even we have believed in Iesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the Law: For by the works of the Law shall no flesh be justified.</hi> From this place of Scripture also there are some that would inferre a superannuating and annulling of all moral ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty and reall Righteousness whatever, pretending that nothing but <hi>mere Faith</hi> is required to make us approvable before God. And indeed they fansy that this whole Epistle administers invincible arguments to maintain this mischievous Conclusion, though there be not to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Judge any solid reason of so full a confidence. Which we shall easily understand, if we take notice that the designe of this Epistle is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reduce those <hi>Galatians</hi> again to the truth of <hi>Christianity,</hi> that were almost apostatizing to <hi>Iudaisme</hi> and the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moses. Ye observe dayes and moneths and times and years; I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed labour on you in vain,</hi> Chap. 4.10, 11.</p>
               <p>But the main scope of the Apostle is against <hi>Circumcision,</hi> as is plain upon the very first perusall of the Epistle; which he beating down toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and extolling the Faith in Christ, seems sometimes to excuse a man from walking according to the <hi>moral Law</hi> under the pretence of <hi>Faith in Christ.</hi> But as S. <hi>Peter</hi> hath well obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>there be many things</hi> in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles <hi>hard to be understood,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Pet. 3 16.</note> 
                  <hi>which foolish men pervert to their own destruction.</hi> But that we be not led into the same errour and mischief, it will be of no small concernment to trace the footsteps of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that so we may wind our selves out of this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Maze or Labyrinth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas then he seems to nullifie or vilifie at least <hi>the Law</hi> in the advancing of that <hi>Righteousnesse that is by faith</hi>; let us see what this <hi>Righteousnesse that is by faith,</hi> and what <hi>that of the Law,</hi> is. Chap. 2.19. <hi>For I through the Law am dead to the Law, that I might live unto God: I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. I through the Law am dead unto the Law,</hi> what a riddle is this! that <hi>the Law</hi> should deprive it self of its disciples. And yet it doth so: For it is a Schoolmaster to Christ, or rather an Usher, which when it hath well tutour'd us and castigated us, removes us up higher, to be made in Christ perfect, who is the perfection of the Law. But the Law it self makes nothing perfect; and this is the reason that Righteousness is not of the Law.</p>
               <p>And to this purpose speaks the Apostle in this very Epistle at the 21 verse of the 3. Chapter, <hi>Is the Law then against the promises of God? God forbid. For if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousnesse should have been by the Law; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, A law that could enliven and enquicken us.</hi> But that is beyond
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:55305:207"/>
the power of the <hi>Law</hi>: That's the title and prerogative of Christ, who is the Way, the Truth and the Life. <hi>I am the Resurrection and the Life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die,</hi> Joh. 11. This therefore is the Righteousness of Faith or belief, far above the Righteousness of the Law or killing letter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wherefore when this Faith is come that worketh us up to a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving frame of Righteousness within us, we are no longer under the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> but are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. Now none are the children of God but those that are led by the Spirit of God, as the Apostle elsewhere witnesseth in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the <hi>Romans.</hi> And those that have the Spirit of God, what fruits they bring forth is amply set out by the Apostle in this to the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> chap. 5. v. 22. <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentlenesse, goodnesse, faith, meeknesse, temperance: against such there is no law.</hi> For indeed there is no need of it, they being a law unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. So we see how those that are in Christ are not <hi>under the Law,</hi> because that inward fountain of obedience or living law in their hearts is above it: They do really and truly fulfill it through the Spirit that is by faith. For that Spirit is the begetter of <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law. For all the Law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self,</hi> Gal. 5.14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This I say then, walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary one to another, that ye may not do the things ye would.</hi> Which certainly is the true and genuine sense of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Grotius</hi> also has noted. <hi>And these are contrary,</hi> that is to say, <hi>oppose one the other,</hi> namely, the Spirit the flesh, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to the end you may not do those things that your own corrupt will or carnall minde inclines you to</hi>: which naturally coheres with what follows, <hi>But if you be led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.</hi> For <hi>against such there is no law,</hi> as was said before. Which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes, if they be not led by the Spirit, they are liable to the curse of the Law, to death, hell and damnation. For so also speaks the Apostle, when he hath reckoned up the works of the flesh, <hi>That they that do such things, shall not inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> ver. 21. And v. 25. he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly declares, <hi>That they that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. So we see plainly that the <hi>Righteousnesse that is of faith</hi> is not a mere <hi>Chimaera</hi> or phansie, but a more excellent Righteousness then that of the Law. For <hi>the Law</hi> is no quickening spirit, but a dead letter: But Christ is the Resurrection and the Life. And he is God our righteousness, mighty to save, and can with ease destroy the powers of death, darkness and the Devil out of the Soul of man; but we must have the patience to endure the work wrought in us by him. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Christ li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in me.</hi> And if we will still cloak and cover our foul corrupt hearts with forged conceits of Hypocrisie's own making, and excuse our selves from being good to one another or to our selves, because God in Christ
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:55305:208"/>
is so good to us; hear what the Apostle speaks in the sixth and last Chapter of this Epistle at the seventh verse. <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked: For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The aim therefore of the Apostle is not to extenuate or discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance <hi>real Vertue and Righteousnesse,</hi> but to point us to it, and shew us where it may be had: Not in <hi>dayes</hi> or <hi>years,</hi> not in <hi>New Moons</hi> or <hi>Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,</hi> not in <hi>Circumcision</hi> nor in the <hi>dead letter</hi> of the Law; but in <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> in the renewed <hi>Image</hi> of God, in the <hi>new birth,</hi> in the <hi>new life,</hi> in the <hi>second Adam</hi> from Heaven, in the <hi>new Creature. But God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6.14.</note> 
                  <hi>by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world. For in Christ Iesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4.22.</note> Which the Apostle elsewhere cals the <hi>new man; That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, that is corrupt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the Spirit of your minde: And that you put on the new man which after God is created in righteousnesse and true holinesse,</hi> that is, not in external Ceremonial holiness or outward sanctimonious shew, but in the regeneration of the inward Spirit to a new life from the very heart. And again, <hi>Colos.</hi> 3. vers. 9. <hi>Lie not one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds, and have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of him that created him; where there is neither Greek nor Iew, circumcision nor uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free, but Christ is all and in all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. This <hi>new Creature</hi> then is nothing else but the <hi>Image of God in the Soul of man.</hi> So witness both these Texts: <hi>The new man which after God is created in Knowledge, Righteousness and true Holiness.</hi> The very same that <hi>Plato</hi> speaks at once in his <hi>Theaetetus, <gap reason="foreign">

Let every man examine himself by this Rule.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And as this <hi>Iustice</hi> is far above, yea, sometimes contrary to, the Justice of the Natural man (for with him to hate his enemies, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense evil with evil, is just;) so the <hi>Holiness</hi> is far transcending the Holinesse of either the ancient or modern Scribes and Pharisees and Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotical <hi>Ceremonialists.</hi> For all outward <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Place,</hi> of <hi>Gesture</hi> or <hi>Vestments, Rites</hi> or <hi>Orders,</hi> they are all but Signes and Shews; but the Body is Christ.

So that it is plain from the constant scope of the Apostle both in this Epistle and every where else, That he does not vilifie true Vertue and Morality, but drives at an higher pitch and perfection thereof; and that the <hi>Righteousness of Faith,</hi> which he prefers before the <hi>Righteousness of Works,</hi> is not by way of exclusion of <hi>Good Works</hi> out of the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Faith, but of urging us to <hi>exacter and more perfect works of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse</hi> then could be performed under the dispensation of the Law. How wicked a treachery therefore is it against the Church of Christ, and how impudent a piece of boldness in those false Teachers that would bear men in hand, <hi>That this doctrine of the being approved in the eyes of God by a dry and dead Faith, devoid and destitute of all real sanctity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,</hi> is not only a Christian truth, but the most choice and principal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in all Christianity; when there is not any footstep of any such thing in all the Instructions and Informations of either Christ or his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles?</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>1.</hi> That no small measure of Sanctity serves the turn in Christianity: <hi>2.</hi> As appears out of Scriptures already alledged. <hi>3.</hi> Further proofs thereof out of the Prophets; <hi>4.</hi> As also out of the Gospel, <hi>5.</hi> And other places of the New Testament. <hi>6.</hi> The strong Armature of a Christian Souldier. <hi>7.</hi> His earnest endeavour after Perfection.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WHerefore having sufficiently cleansed and oyled the first Wheel of this mighty Engine we are shewing the <hi>Usefulnesse</hi> of; we proceed now to the second, where if we do not use our diligence also, this <hi>Machina</hi> will not prove effectual for the purpose it was designed, <hi>viz. for the destroying of the works of the devil.</hi> Of whose stratagems and devices we being not ignorant, we will declare unto you what is most seasonable in this place; namely, That where he cannot corrupt our minds with this dangerous Errour <hi>of the sufficiency of an unsanctified and an unsanctifying Faith,</hi> he will in the second place endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us <hi>that a small measure of Holinesse will serve our turn</hi>; consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Passion of Christ is of so great price in the eyes of his Father, who accepts of his death for an atonement for our sins, and that by his bloud we are reconciled to God, and therefore any remisse desire, any lazy inclination to obedience will be enough; the Passion of Christ and the Imputation of his Righteousnesse will make out the rest.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But that this is really the suggestion of the Devil, not the meaning of the Gospel, I shall make evident from many Testimonies of Scripture. I might say, that many of those we have already alledged do clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate the same. For what means that of <hi>Iohn,</hi> where he declares <hi>That he that is born of God cannot sin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.9.</note> 
                  <hi>because the seed of God remains in him?</hi> What that of <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 2.</note> where he saith <hi>That Christ came to redeem us from all iniquity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and purchase to himself a Church without spot and wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle, a Church holy and without blemish?</hi> What means our Saviour Christ's setting the Rule of Righteousnesse at that exquisite pitch of perfection, accounting <hi>tacit assents</hi> to lust no lesse then adultery, rash and causlesse anger a degree of murder, who has not only condemned retaliation, but has commanded us to do good for evil? I say, what is the sense of all this, but that we Christians are called to <hi>a higher degree of perfection</hi> in life and sanctity then ever any Masters of Morality and Religion in the world hitherto put men upon? And therefore the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of Christianity is so far from allowing men in any immoral vices or defects, that it does not only cleanse from these, but lifts us up a degree higher, and never leaves till it has restored our Souls into a condition plainly <hi>Divine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That this is the state that every Christian is called to, and ought to be unsatisfied unlesse his conscience tell him he is aiming at, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in some measure towards it, both the Propheticall descriptions of <hi>the Kingdom of the Messiah upon earth,</hi> and several other Testimonies in
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:55305:209"/>
the Gospel and Writings of the Apostles do still more fully witnesse. For besides those places that describe <hi>the Reign of the Messiah</hi> from the abundance of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> which should overspread the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the waters cover the Sea; there are other particular passages that do prefigure <hi>a very great measure of Holinesse</hi> that the Church of Christ should be conspicuous by, with clearer knowledge and greater activity to walk in the wayes of God. And I do not doubt but that which was fulfilled in a corporeal sense in Christs time, had also a more spirituall and more permanent meaning; namely, that of <hi>Esay,</hi> chap. 35.5, 6. where <hi>the eyes of the blinde</hi> are said to be <hi>opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped, the lame to leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb to sing.</hi> Which lively does set out the condition of the true Christian believer while he makes his faithfull progress in Christianity, going on from strength to strength till he appear before God in Sion. Add to this Zech. 12. For that it is mystically applicable to our present purpose, appears from v. 10. <hi>They shall look upon me whom they have pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi>: but what we were going to recite was v. 8. <hi>In that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Ierusalem; and he that is feeble among them shall be as David, and the house of David shall be as God, as the Angel of the Lord before them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 11.11.</note> As our Saviour saith of John the Baptist, <hi>That the least in the Kingdome of Heaven is greater then he.</hi> I shall close the Prophetick predictions with that of Malachi, chap. 3. speaking of the Angel of the Covenant, viz. Christ, and that dispensation he was to set afoot in the world, <hi>Behold he shall come, saith the Lord of hoasts: But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiners fire, and like fullers sope. And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he shall purifie the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The very same thing which John the Baptist witnesses of Christ, Matth. 3. v. 11. <hi>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier then I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy ghost and with fire. Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaffe with unquenchable fire.</hi> To which you may add v. 10. <hi>And now is the axe laid to the root of the trees: Therefore every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.</hi> Like that Matth. 15. v. 13. <hi>Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</hi> Which Scriptures do plainly declare to us, That the design of Christ's coming was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume utterly and to tear up by the very roots all errour and wickedness out of the hearts of them that would receive him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And this were sufficient to discover <hi>what a high degree of Holiness</hi> is expected of him that will be in good earnest a Christian. But I will not omit other places that sound to the same purpose. 1 Peter 1.13. <hi>Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober and of a perfect hope in the grace that is brought to you through the revelation of Iesus Christ; as obedient children, not fashioning your selves according to former lusts
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:55305:210"/>

                     </gap>, in your whole conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in every thing you doe) Because it is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy.</hi> The same which our Saviour exhorts to in his Sermon on the Mount, <hi>Be ye perfect, as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</hi> Paul also to the Ephesians, ch. 6. v. 10. <hi>Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put you on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the Devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and bloud, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, even against the wicked Spirits of the air. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand in the evil day, and having vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breast-plate of righteousness, and your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace. Above all, taking the shield of faith, whereby you shall be able to quench the fiery darts of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: and take the helmet of Salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</hi> We shall add only a short speech to the Christian souldier thus harnessed from the Captain of our Salvation, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, Revel. 3. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to sit with me in my throne; even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his throne.</hi> Which things thus put together and carefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, cannot but awaken us out of that drouzy and lazy dream of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operative Faith</hi> and sluggish sordid slavery to sin under pretence of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible infirmity,</hi> into a full belief of the mighty power of Christ and of his Armature and Ammunition, whereby we are able to overcome all our domestick lusts, though abetted and incensed by the fiery Stratagems of the Devil.</p>

It is in this life we are commanded to kill and slay the old man in us with all his deceiveable lusts, who, while he is alive, will be alwaies plotting and inventing some evil device or other to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and root the Kingdome of Christ out of our hearts.

For the faithfull Christian Souldier is so well appointed (being girt with <hi>Truth,</hi> &amp; his Heart fortified with <hi>Uprightness</hi> and <hi>Sincerity,</hi> his Mind with <hi>representations</hi> of Eternal life, his feet with <hi>readiness</hi> &amp; unwearied resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>walking</hi> as becomes the Gospel of Christ, his Memory with the choicest and most useful &amp; encouraging Precepts of the Scripture, &amp; his whole Soul bearing it self strong in the <hi>Faith</hi> of the power of God against all assaults and temptations of the enemies of our Salvation) that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but get the day and stand Conquerour in the field, though his own

domestick lusts be assisted by the powers of the Prince of the Air that rules in the Children of disobedience. For this <hi>shield of Faith</hi> is able to <hi>quench all the fiery darts of the Devil.</hi> This is that Faith whereby the ancients <hi>have subdued kingdomes and wrought righteousness.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hebrews 11.</note> And this is that whereby every Christian shall advance his conquests against the Kingdome of Darkness and Unrighteousness as much as he pleases. For according to a mans Faith, so shall it be unto him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Wherefore those that plead for a lazy Slackness and Remisness in these attempts, are not faithfull Christians but false brethren got amongst us.<note place="margin">Luk. 9.62.</note> 
                  <hi>He that puts his hand to the plough, and looks back, is not fit for the kingdome of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 10.37.</note> Again, <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more then me, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more then me, is not worthy of me.</hi> Nay, he that loveth his own life more then Christ, is not worthy of him, nor can he be his disciple, as our Saviour himself has declared. How can then any be Christ's disciple that loves any lust whatsoever, though never so pleasant, though never so profitable, more then the Son of God that redeemed him with his own bloud? Wherefore all true Christians have been in this point in good earnest in both practice, profession and praiers, in breathing and contending after all exquisiteness of purity and integrity both of flesh and Spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God, as the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> According to which also S. <hi>Iames</hi> in his Epistle general, chap. 1. v. 4. <hi>Let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, being defective in nothing.</hi> Like that praier of <hi>Epaphras</hi> for the Colossians, chap. 4.12. who is said there <hi>to labour fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently for them in praier, that they may stand perfect and complete in the whole will of God.</hi> Which is the same with S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, 1 Epist. the last chapter, <hi>The God of all grace, who hath called us to his eternal glory by Christ Iesus, after that you have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.</hi> To which we will add that of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to the Hebrews,<note place="margin">Hebr. 13.20.</note> and so conclude. <hi>Now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Iesus, the great shepheard of the sheep, through the bloud of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work, to doe his will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Iesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever, Amen.</hi>

                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:55305:211"/>1. WE have made it very evident That that degree of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that the Christian is called unto is no lazy, sluggish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to holiness, no maimed, halting, Hypocritical following after Christ; but a sound and chearfull endeavour, and at last a joifull acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of such a degree of Sanctity and Righteousness as far surmounts the pretensions of all other Religions whatsoever; and is indeed so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite and perfect, that nothing better can be desired or imagined. So holy and Heavenly a calling is the calling of a Christian. And indeed the expectation is so great, that if our aids and assistances were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable, we could never arrive to the End of our calling. But our helps are in my apprehension far greater then our task, if we were not wanting to our selves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have hitherto seen how necessary inward Sanctification is to a Christian, as also to how ample a measure he is called. Both these he is indispensably obliged to endeavour and breath after perpetually; as is manifestly declared by Christ, his Apostles, and the Prophets before them. Wherefore these two, I mean <hi>The evidence that we are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and really righteous, and not only so, but in an extraordinary manner,</hi> are the <hi>two Powers</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> that comprehend our great and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate duty of <hi>being holy as he that has called us is holy,</hi> of <hi>becoming perfect as our Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi> The following <hi>Gospel-Powers</hi> all of them are aids and helps to this design. The first whereof is <hi>The Promise of the Spirit,</hi> through Christ's Intercession; the second, <hi>The Example of Christ</hi>; the third, <hi>The Meditation on his Passion</hi>; the fourth, <hi>on his Resurrection and Ascension</hi>; and the last, <hi>on the last Iudgement.</hi> These <hi>Powers</hi> are of such admirable efficacy, if rightly applied, that they are able to pul down every strong hold, and to cast out all evil ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and every high thing that exalts it self against the knowledge of God, and to bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ, as the Apostle speaks. No strength of habituated sin, no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of any lust shall be able to stand before them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The first of these <hi>Powers</hi> is <hi>The Promise of the Spirit</hi>; I do not mean for the <hi>doing Miracles,</hi> (for that was but a transient business, and accommodate only to the first Ages of the Church,) but for <hi>through-sanctification</hi> and cleansing us from all our sins, and for our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect growth in Righteousness and Holiness. That this Power is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant to the Dispensation of the Gospel in all true Believers, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent both from the predictions of the Prophets, and from the mouth of our Saviour and his blessed Apostles.</p>
               <p>Esay 44. <hi>Hear now, O Iacob my servant, and Israel whom I have chosen. Thus saith the Lord that made thee, and framed thee from the womb, and will help thee. Fear not, O Iacob my servant, and thou Iesurun whom I have chosen: For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground; I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed and my blessing upon thy offspring. And they shall spring up as among the grass, and the willows by the water-courses.</hi> Which <hi>Prophecie</hi> is most properly applicable to the Church of Christ who is <hi>the true seed

                  <hi>upright</hi> of heart and <hi>sincere</hi> seekers after God, those that truly hunger and thirst after righteousness; and therefore God will satisfie them by the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural assistance of his blessed Spirit.</p>
               <p>Again, Ezekiel 36. ver. 25. prefiguring the blessed dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Kingdome of Christ; <hi>Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will I put within you; and I will take the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments and doe them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Also Esay 41. v. 10. where certainly according to analogie of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of Prophecie, (<hi>the seed of Abraham</hi> being a Type of the <hi>Spiritual Church</hi> of Christ, and their <hi>warfare</hi> not carnal but <hi>spiritual,</hi> nor <hi>the waters</hi> promised by Christ such liquors as run in Brooks and Rivers, but emanations of the purifying and refreshing powers of <hi>the Spirit of God</hi>) we may see with what close and faithfull assistance God is pleased to adhere to his true <hi>Israel</hi> in whom there is no guile, but they are sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waging war and to the utmost resisting all the Temptations of the World, the Flesh and the Devil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But thou, Israel, my servant, Iacob, whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend; fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not dismaied for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee, yea I will help thee, yea I will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. Behold, all they that were incensed against thee, shall be ashamed and confounded, they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee shall perish. Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that contended with thee; they that war against thee shall be as nothing and as a thing of nought. For I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not, I will help thee. Fear not thou worm Iacob, and ye men of Israel; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I will make thee a new sharp threshing-instrument, having teeth; thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaffe. Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them; and thou shalt rejoice in the Lord, and shalt glory in the holy One of Israel. When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst; I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them: I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the vallies. I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.</hi> This Prophecie is an exquisite description of those full and complete <hi>Victories</hi> the Church gets against Sin and Satan by the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural assistance of the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>Which <hi>Promise</hi> is again repeated in the following chapter, which though it be larger then the former, and part cited already to another purpose, yet I cannot refrain from transcribing the whole, it being so plain a <hi>Prophecie</hi> of Christ (as appears from the fore-part thereof) and
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:55305:212"/>
of the power of his Kingdome through the Spirit for the vanquishing of all sin and wickedness in them that do truly believe. <hi>Behold my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant whom I uphold,</hi>

                  <hi>mine elect in whom my soul delighteth. I have put my spirit upon him, he shall bring forth judgement to the Gentiles. He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoaking flax shall he not quench; he shall bring forth judgement unto truth. He shall not fail nor be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, till he hath set judgement in the earth: and the Isles shall wait for his Law. Thus saith God the Lord, he that created the Heavens and stretched them out, he that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it, he that giveth breath to the people upon it, and spirit to those that dwell therein: I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for a light of the Gentiles; To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house. I am the Lord, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images. Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth, I tell you of them. Sing unto the Lord a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth; ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the Isles and the inhabitants thereof. Let the Wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit. Let the inhabitants of the rock sing: let them shout from the top of the mountains: let them give glory unto the Lord, and declare his praise in the islands. The Lord shall goe forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousie like a man of war; he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies. I have long time holden my peace, I have been still and refrained my self; now will I cry like a travailing woman, I will destroy and devour at once. I will make wast mountains and hills, and dry up all their hearbs; I will make the rivers Islands, and I will dry up the pools. And I will bring the blind by a way that they know not, I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I doe unto them, and not forsake them.</hi>

It is a very high representation of that mighty power of God from above that assists his Church, and how Christ by the dispensation of the Gospel does set us free from the bondage of sin; how he opens the understandings of the ignorant, and procures liberty for those that were shut up in the dungeon of a dark conscience, and held in captivity under sin; how those that are dry and barren like the wilderness and the tops of rocks shall be watered with springs of living water, and how the villages that <note n="*" place="margin">From <gap reason="foreign">

a facility of mystically applying of things to the great purpose they drive at. But what we shall adde out of the New, though they will not strike the phansy with so high language, yet they will, it may be, reach ones Reason more surely, and extort assent more powerfully even from them that are loth to finde it true, <hi>That there is such a mighty super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural assistance afforded from God,</hi> viz. <hi>the Cooperation of his holy Spirit in our conflicts against sin.</hi> Which perswasion is of great consequence to make us resolute in resisting all Temptations, and to gain the victory in every assault; and therefore we will produce sufficient evidences of the truth thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And the first that occurs to my minde, is that of our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. <hi>If ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your Children, how much more shall your Heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> And that this Dispensation of <hi>the Spirit of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi> is a common gift to all Christians, appears out of what we have already recited out of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> where <hi>Iohn</hi> professes himself only able <hi>to baptize with water unto repentance,</hi> but that <hi>the Baptisme of Christ</hi> should be <hi>with the holy Ghost and with fire,</hi> that is, with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Spirit that will melt and purifie us as silver is purified in the fire.<note place="margin">Ver. 35, 51, 54.</note> Also from <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. where Christ styleth himself <hi>the Manna that came down from Heaven,</hi> and declareth, that <hi>he that eateth his flesh and drinketh his bloud, hath eternal life</hi>; with other expressions of the like nature. Wherefore his Disciples began to be scandalized at it: but Jesus answered and said,<note place="margin">Ver. 62.</note> 
                  <hi>Does this offend you? What if you shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?</hi> That will be a very strange and stupendious spectacle to you, and such as will assure you of my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity; but withall remove my body so far from you, that you cannot then, if you would, mistake so grosly as to think I speak of <hi>this body and bloud</hi> I carry now about with me.<note place="margin">Ver. 63.</note> 
                  <hi>It is the Spirit that quickneth, the flesh profiteth nothing. The words that I speak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are life</hi>; that is to say, They are touching <hi>the spiritual body,</hi> which is the inmost Temple of the holy Ghost, and which you are in some measure to partake of here, and which shall have its compleat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement when I shall crown you with the perfection of <hi>Life Eternal</hi> at the last day. Or, They are simply concerning the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and that <hi>Life</hi> which I my self am according to my Divinity, <hi>viz. The Eternal Word</hi> in whom is <hi>the Life, and that Life is the light of men.</hi> This is that which you are to feed on, and to drink into your Souls, when you have not my particular bodily presence with you. For this <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> is every where to be taken in by them that breath and thirst after this Heavenly sustenance of their Souls; and so is that fulfilled which he declares v. 56. <hi>He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me and I in him.</hi> For the <hi>eating of the flesh</hi> is in some measure partaking of the <hi>spiritual body,</hi> and the <hi>drinking of the bloud</hi> the imbibing <hi>that life</hi> therewith that rayes out from the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> into all purged and purified hearts, whereby Christ dwelleth in them and they in him, and God in all.</p>

                  <hi>Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living waters.

And therefore is a good ratification of the <hi>Mystical</hi> sense of those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies we rehersed out of <hi>Esay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But these things are spoken more plainly and without a Metaphor, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.15. <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandements. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth, whom the World cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</hi> Which Precept and Promise is like that of <hi>Esay,</hi> chap. 58. which is, that (if we seriously compose our mindes to do due acts of obedience to God) he will pour out his Spirit upon us.<note place="margin">Ver. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Then shall thy light break forth like the morning, and thy health shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee, the glory of the Lord shall be thy rereward.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>He shall guide thee continually, and satisfie thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.</hi> That is, (as any spiritual Christian would be apt to interpret the place) If thou thirst after Righteousnesse, and in the mean time to thy utmost power do the outward functions thereof in thy duties to God and man, at length this Spirit of truth will break forth like the morning light within thee, and the emanations of the holy Ghost will so throughly refresh thee and strengthen thee, that with ease and pleasure thou shalt walk in all the wayes of God, which shall be like the flowry Alleys of a Paradise to thee, both to thine inward and outward man.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Not that our endeavours or desires are any obligation to God by way of <hi>merit</hi> on our part, but it is his mercy to the Soul that does in good earnest pant after him. For till he has compleated his work in us, all our works are worth nothing; and whenever they are worth any thing, they are not ours but his. And to this sense speaks <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> chap. 3. <hi>But after that the kindnesse and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, Not by works of righteousnesse which we have done, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the holy Ghost, which he shed on us</hi> (or <hi>poured out upon us,</hi> as the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal has it) <hi>abundantly through Iesus Christ our Saviour.</hi> Like that of the Prophet, <hi>Thou shalt be like a watered garden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Adde to these <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Iesus answered, Verily verily I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he can in no wise en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the kingdom of God.

Now if any man have not the Spirit of God, he is none of his.</hi> And vers. 26. <hi>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit it self maketh intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered.</hi> And also 1 Cor. 3.16. <hi>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in

(For it were infinite to reckon up all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture that tend to this purpose) <hi>For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, of whom the whole Family of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth is named, That he would grant you according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthned with might by his spirit in the inward man; That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled with all the fulness of God, who is able to do abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us.

               <p>We have also prevented all perverse glosses of false Teachers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they would slacken and enervate the strength and efficacy of these three Powers of the Gospel we have hitherto spoken of, by introducing a bare, fruitless and steril Faith, or the Imputation of an external Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, that, according to their compute, is further removed from us then the highest Star. Which errour, were it as harmless as groundless, any peaceable good Christian could be content to connive at it: but it being an old mischievous Stratagem against the Church, and so noted by the wisedom of the Apostles, an evil Machination found out by the Prince of darkness to undermine the Kingdom of Christ, no faithful Adherent to the interest of the Lord Jesus, and the advancement of his Rule and Power in the World, can with a good conscience slightly pass it over, but will use his best endeavour to undeceive the world in so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a mistake.</p>

(who unanimously have voted this opinion, <hi>of being righteous without doing righteousnesse,</hi> a very dangerous Imposture and Deceit) some ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Considerations that may make us still more sensible of the ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences thereof. For my own part, I must confesse that it is to me a thing utterly inconceivable how a man can be righteous here without Righteousnesse, or happy hereafter without Righteousnesse here; or how any true Christian can please himself in a Palliation more then a Cure, or can be satisfied with any thing but that Manna that came down from heaven, the very Flesh and Bloud of Christ in that sense I have interpreted it, or without feeding his Soul with that real Spirit of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, or the Divine Nature, which is <hi>meat indeed and drink indeed.</hi> For I do not understand how the condition of these Opposers of so Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential and Fundamental a Truth can be any other then what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <note n="*" place="margin">Esay 28.</note>

So shall the multitude of the Nations be that fight against Mount Sion.</hi> This is the condition of all Sects whatsoever that are contrary to them that thirst and hunger after righteousness: For these shall be really satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the dew of Divine grace shall plentifully showr down upon this <hi>Sion,</hi> and they shall be filled with Spiritual Manna from Heaven; whereas the other, their hunger and thirst (that is, their wants and defects) being real, but not after real Righteousness, are fed only by imaginations and dreams, and whenever they awake out of them, will finde themselves destitute.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nay, what is yet worse, a man may almost conclude that they are not so much as in a capacity of dreaming of celestial food. For that is a function of life, to dream of such things as are agreeable to such a <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of living creatures; and those that dream of such things as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous to their nature, it is because they have had an enjoyment of them, and do sometimes enjoy them according to the order of Nature. And certainly he that is a true Christian, is not a mere natural man, but is that <hi>New Creature</hi> that is framed in righteousness and true holinesse: and therefore he must be fed out of such Principles as he was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from, not of the will of man but the Spirit of God; and therefore he does not only dream of, but really feed of that Manna that is from Heaven, that inward essential Righteousnesse that is from God. And as it is impossible for one man to eat, to drink and to breath for another in a <hi>natural</hi> way; so also is it alike impossible for any one person to eat and drink and breath in a <hi>spiritual</hi> way for another. And if we were wholly alive to that life that is most certainly in every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian rightly so called, we should think it as inconvenient that any one should be righteous for us, as that he should be in health for us. For what comfort would it be, while we are in a tedious fever, a sharp fit of the stone or gout, that some other person should be sound and at ease for us?</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:55305:215"/>4. And therefore it is too shrewd an indication that men in this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary perswasion are in a manner <hi>past feeling,</hi> as the Apostle speaks, as being devoid of all divine life and sense; otherwise Sin and Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would be as harsh to their Souls as these Diseases are painful to their bodies. And hence it is that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, That <hi>he that is born of God sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not, because the seed of God remaineth in him</hi>; as I have noted above. For what Principle of life sins against it self? what Beast wilfully wounds it self? what Tree blasts it self? what life will so much as hurt it self any way? Will the Eagle swim in the Sea, or the Dolphin fly in the Aire? Will not all Creatures keep them to their own Element and Original, and fly their contrary Element as that which brings destruction, or at least a great deal of diseasement to them? What regenerate man then can endure to come near the Region of Sin? It can be no more pleasant to him then the Smoke to his eyes, or the Saw to his hearing. <hi>How can I do this wickedness, and sin against God?</hi> Nay how can I cut and launce and scorch my self, my better self, even Christ which lives in me, with whom I suffer as often as his image suffers?</p>
               <p>And this may serve for a more generall taste of the unreasonablenesse of this wicked and mischievous Imposture that has ever more or lesse attempted the Church of Christ. But I shall bring you in a more pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Bill of the losses and damages done thereby.</p>

be not righteous as Christ was righteous,</hi> that is, <hi>in doing of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> will sufficiently appear from this, That Righteousness and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is the only true way to Divine <hi>Wisdome</hi> and a sound judgement in things. Which may be made good both by manifold testimonies of Scripture, and from the nature of the thing it self. <hi>If any one will doe the will of God, he shall know of my doctrine,</hi> saith Christ <hi>whether it be from God, or whether I speak of my self,</hi> John 7. And in the Psalms, <hi>The fear of the Lord</hi> (by which is understood Righteousness, the <hi>eschew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil</hi> and <hi>doing good,</hi> as the Psalmist himself explains it) <hi>is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of wisdome; a sound Iudgement have they that doe thereafter,</hi> &amp;c. And elsewhere,<note place="margin">Psalm 25.14.</note> 
                  <hi>The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he is mindfull of his Covenant to make them know it,</hi> as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew will be well rendred. And Job 32. <hi>I said Daies should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdome: But there is a spirit in a man, and the inspiration of the Almighty gives them understanding.</hi> But how this Inspiration and Spirit of Wisdome has for its abode an heart really righteous, the Wisdome of <hi>Solomon</hi> will tell us; insomuch that he that is contented to forgoe Righteousness, must also of necessity fall short of Wisdome. <hi>Wisdome cannot enter into a wicked heart,</hi> saith he, <hi>nor dwell in a body that is subject unto sin. For the holy Spirit of discipline fleeth from deceit, and withdraweth her self from thoughts that are without understanding, and is rebuked when wickedness cometh in. Wisdome</hi> therefore and <hi>Unrighteousness</hi> cannot abide under the same roof. Our bodies cannot be both the Temples of the living God and of a deceitfull Idol.</p>
               <p>And if it were needfull to add any thing Allegorical and Mysterious to these plain Testimonies of Scripture, we might also urge that this precious truth, <hi>That Wisdome rises out of Righteousness,</hi> was also sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out in the fourth days Creation, wherein the lights of Heaven were made. For that mysterious Jew on the place records this observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble priviledge of the number <hi>Four, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, That the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternarie Number is the first Quadrate, pariter par,</hi> or <hi>equally equal, the measure of Iustice and Equity.</hi> Wherefore the number here of the Day being a Symbol of Righteousness, that which was created in that day, viz. the Lights of Heaven, may very well be the Symbols of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Knowledge</hi> or <hi>Wisdome,</hi> viz. the Sun of Righteousness, as Christ is called; intimating that <hi>the Divine Wisdome</hi> is conceived and brought forth, or, if you will, created in Righteousness. So that this Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sun does not arise and shine upon our Minds til this fourth day, the day of Righteousness. But then that in the Proverbs is made good,<note place="margin">Proverb. 4.18.</note> That the path of the just is as the shining light <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>that goes on and shines <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> til the firmitude</hi> or <hi>stability of the day</hi>; and that's at Noon, which is the Solstice of the day, where his altitude does not so sensibly vary. So that the sense is, That the path of the righteous is like the course of the Sun, who still climbs up, til he fully reach his Meridian: But <hi>the way of the wicked is as darkness,</hi> (as it is in the following verse,) <hi>they know not at what they stumble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="402" facs="tcp:55305:216"/>2. And thus it is plain from Testimonies of Scripture, That <hi>divine Wisdome</hi> and a sound Mind is not to be attained unto but through <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:</hi> And that consequently he that forgoes <hi>real Righteousness,</hi> must of necessity lose <hi>true Wisdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beside this there are also innate arguments taken from the things themselves, whereby the same Truth may be proved. For it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that Corruption of the Will, like rust, eats away the strength, defaces the beautie, and obscures the brightness of the Understanding, and dulls the edge of the natural wit. But to point out more at large some Reasons why the <hi>unrighteous</hi> must be also <hi>unwise.</hi> The first is, <hi>From the falseness of the wicked heart</hi>; the second, <hi>From the asym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry or incongruity the vitious Mind has with divine Truth.</hi> And for the former, it is a manifest reason why God does not commit the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of <hi>Wisdome</hi> to the unrighteous. For he will not put it into the custody of false men. How carefull the divine Wisdome is in this point, <hi>Siracides</hi> has very fitly described, chap. 4. <hi>For first she will walk with a man by crooked waies, and bring him unto fear and dread, and torment him with her discipline, until she have tried his soul, and proved him with her judgements: Then will she return the straight way unto him, and comfort him, and shew him her secrets, and heap upon him the treasures of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> But why she will not commit this great and pretious treasure to polluted and unholy minds, is, as I have said, because of their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness, they being so likely to abuse it: that is, they will either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn it, as a swine does a pearl, preferring either the sensual pleasures or the riches or the honours of the world before it, and so quenching the good grace of God by their base lusts and evil desires, are cast off by God in a deserved scorn; (For <hi>the divine Wisdome</hi> is not so vile and cheap a thing as to intrude her self like an impudent woman into the familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men, but is rebuked and checked and goes her way at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance and appearance of her bold corrivals, if they be entertained, viz. <hi>The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life:</hi> and many such affronts will quite chase her away, so that whereas she sought after us before, she now sought after by us will be hard to be found:) or else if we do not seem to contemn her and slight her, yet we may shew our selves faithless and treacherous in betraying her to other uses then God intended her. As if so be we should thence endeavour to exalt our own name, and please our selves in our own arrogancy, setting our selves above others; or use the quickness and sagacity of our Understandings to deceit, or the patronizing of evil in our selves or others; I say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the unrighteous man would be subject to abuse thus treacherously the great gift of God, therefore <hi>the divine Wisdome</hi> may not lodge in his false heart: but in stead of that any fortuitous Opinions which his own natural inclinations, practices, education, or confusion of his own mind and conscience shall heap together in him hand over head; which he taking for Truth shall notwithstanding abuse, and shew <hi>the divine Wisdome</hi> how he would also use her if he could come at her, 'tis likely worse, or rather he would abuse himself worse with her then with those; that meat being worst for the sick which is best for them that are well.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="403" facs="tcp:55305:216"/>But beside that the counsell of God is such that he will not give the gift of <hi>Wisdome</hi> to the wicked heart, there is also an incongruity, if not an incompossibility, in the thing it self. The wicked man is uncapable of it. <hi>The natural man perceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally discerned. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, The Sun cannot be seen by the Eye, unless the Eye receive the likeness of the Sun,</hi> as <hi>Plotinus</hi> speaks. Wherefore we doe very foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly in that we bestow so much time in the exercise of our <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and so little in the preparing and fitting of it, that afterward the use of it may be with good effect. If the Eyes be weak, muddy and dim, even almost to blindness, we are not so foolish as to think to perfect our sight by looking long, or often, or on many Objects; it makes our sight rather worse: but the disease of the Eye is first to be taken away, and then with ease and in a moment we may see more then before we could in many years by wearisome poaring with our short sight; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which is more to the purpose) we should be able to discern such things as in our former condition we should never have been able at all to discern.</p>
               <p>So the Soul of man, in its unrighteous and polluted condition, does very unadvisedly with so much curiosity and anxious labour to endeavour the discoveries of divine Truths; for there is as yet <hi>Laesum organum,</hi> and she ought to commit her self first to the skill of a faithfull Physitian, to Christ, who is the healer of the Souls of men as well as he was of their Bodies, and so to be re-estated again into that state of health and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, (and Righteousness is this soundness of the Soul,) and then to use her Faculty when it is able to receive that whereby the Object is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. <hi>In lumine tuo videbimus lucem, In thy light we shall see light.</hi> But if the Eye receive no light, it discovers no Object: So if the Soul receive no impresse from God, it discovers nothing of God. For it is most certainly true, <hi>That like is known by like</hi>; and therefore unless the <hi>Image of God</hi> be in us, which is <hi>Righteousness</hi> and <hi>true Holiness,</hi> we know nothing of <hi>the Nature of God,</hi> and so consequently can conclude nothing concerning him to any purpose. For we have no measure to applie to him, because we are not possessed of any thing homogeneal or of a like nature with him, and this only can be a measure; for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the Philosopher speaks. But when we are arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to that Righteousness or rectitude of Spirit or uprightness of Mind, by this, as by the Geometrical Quadrate, we also comprehend with all Saints what is that spiritual breadth and length and depth and height, as the Apostle speaks. What the Rectitude of an Angle does in Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical measurings, the same will this Uprightness of Spirit doe in The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological Conclusions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And not to make this loss of <hi>Wisdome</hi> a jot less then it is, I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther add, That Unrighteousness is encumbred with many distempers and impediments whereby even <hi>Natural knowledge,</hi> as well as <hi>Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> is much hindred in a man. Such are <hi>Anger, Impatience, Self-admiration</hi> or <hi>Self-conceitedness, Admiration of persons,</hi> or <hi>a pusillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:55305:217"/>
Over-estimation of them; Desire of Victory more then of Truth; Too close attention to the things of the world, as Riches, Power and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; Immersion of the Mind into the Body, and the slaking of that noble and divine fire of the Soul by Intemperance and Luxury,</hi> with such like. All which certainly are very great enemies to all manner of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> as well <hi>Natural</hi> as <hi>Divine.</hi> And as for <hi>Anger,</hi> which appears in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, that it blinds the Judgement, is an acknowledged truth, as those Proverbial sayings witness, <hi>Impedit ira animum,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Ira furor bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis</hi>; and <hi>Madness</hi> and <hi>Wisdome</hi> do not consist together. This Passion placed upon Religious objects is called <hi>Zeal,</hi> and the Apostle, that there may be no mistake, calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>bitter Zeal.</hi> But this <hi>inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Anger,</hi> be it in things Humane or Religious, it is really a Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde in our Soul, and carries up with it dirt and straws and dust and all in to the Understanding, and does alwaies more or less blind the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And how great an enemy <hi>Impatience</hi> is to that choice piece of <hi>Natural knowledge</hi> which lies in <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> is evident from hence, That those Sciences either find or make the studiers of them of calm and quiet Spirits, as <hi>Petiscus</hi> truly observes. But whether <hi>the Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our selves, or of other Persons,</hi> be more mischievous to the Truth, is not easie to define. For though we be more prone to admire our selves, yet we may with less checking admire another; it looking some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like Friendship or Modesty: though commonly, if not alwaies, we have some lurking interest involved in the same, and so admire our selves in another with less Envy and Suspectedness. Wherefore the next way not basely to admire another is not conceitedly to admire ones self, or more favourably to look on a mans own conceits then on a strangers. For it will be very hard for one whom Self-love does not impose upon, to be imposed upon by any other person, whom he cannot love better then himself.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>Desire of Victory,</hi> the sense of that folly is, <hi>That a man had rather seem wise, then be so,</hi> or have the glory and fame then the possession of Wisdome. And he that is thus affected, must of necessity follow such things as are most obvious, plausible and popular; and so become <hi>a fool amongst wise men</hi> as well as seem <hi>a wise man amongst fools.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for <hi>close Attention to the world,</hi> that man ought to hold there be more Souls then One in a mans body, that will hold that <hi>ambitious</hi> and <hi>covetous</hi> men have any leisure to be much seen either in <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Natural</hi> things. For their plottings after Wealth and Honour, and the putting of their plots in execution, will take up the Animadversion of the Soul so much, that one <hi>Animadversive</hi> will not suffice for both these Provinces. So that it is possible that men that have not addicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to any such projects, but have been ever imploied in the single search after <hi>Wisdome,</hi> may understand more in <hi>Divinity and Nature</hi> then they who by long diligence and industry have at last scrambled up to the top of Honour and Riches; a Position never allowed of either by the <hi>Iewish Prelates</hi> of old or the present <hi>Cardinals.</hi> Which has made the one bold persecutors of Christ, the other of the chief Christian Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers. As is manifest in the story of <hi>Galileo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:55305:217"/>Lastly, <hi>Immersion of the Mind into the Body, Sensuality</hi> and <hi>Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> that these be main impediments to <hi>Knowledge,</hi> is most plain. For seeing that the Soul in this state does depend on the <hi>Brain</hi> for <hi>Phansy</hi> and <hi>Memory</hi> (without which there can be no <hi>Understanding</hi>) as well as on the <hi>Eye</hi> and <hi>Ear</hi> for <hi>seeing</hi> and <hi>hearing</hi>; it will follow that the <hi>Brain</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altered and distempered by frequent excess, the Faculty of <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> will also goe to wrack. For if the very clime or temper of the Air wherein men are bred and born does avail so much for wit or dulness, as has been alwaies acknowledged that it does, whence is that by-word of <hi>a Boeotian wit</hi>; certainly distemper in Diet will as much, if not much more. And it is known by too frequent and wofull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, how many men of good natural parts have either buried them in <hi>Gluttony,</hi> or drowned them in <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> or consumed them by <hi>Lust.</hi> This Truth indeed is more easie to be understood then worthily to be deplored.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I have now sufficiently proved, That we are assuredly cheated of <hi>true Wisdome</hi> and <hi>a sound Mind</hi> by that mischievous conceit, That a man may be righteous, though he be not righteous as Christ was righteous, that is, really righteous.</p>
               <p>And that we are also cheated of <hi>all noble and profitable Actions</hi> is as plain. For from whence should they arise but from these two fountains, <hi>Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Wisdome?</hi> And the former is here supposed to be wanting, from whence has been clearly proved the want also of the other. Wherefore the good and happiness of Mankind does here most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably goe to wrack.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And therefore thirdly, <hi>There is no ground of deserved Reputation amongst men.</hi> But their mouths will be closed in silence, if not opened in reproach. For the <hi>unrighteous Nature</hi> will work in those that be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally unrighteous; and the actions of unrighteousness, in those that will however be reckoned in the number of the righteous for some other cause then for being so indeed, will be more lavishly spoken against for their numbring of themselves amongst those that are godly. For the miscarriages of those that make no shew of Religion nor pretend to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, are noted only by them that are holy, and they only take offence at it; but when they that are reckoned amongst the <hi>Religious</hi> do trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, even the Wicked themselves, that are willing to wink at one another, will take great offence at these, and talk very loud against them. For their wicked Acts breaking through that external covering and outside of Religion, they are deservedly laught at; as the Ass by the beasts of the Forrest, when his unsutable ears appeared through the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons skin, and his rude braying betraied his nature.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>This imaginary Righteousness does rob us also of Tranquillity and Peace of Mind.</hi> For he that acts unrighteously, is in actual rebellion against right Reason and the Spirit of God; and he that is only imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily righteous, will not fail to act unrighteously; for <hi>real Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> will have its <hi>real effects,</hi> as well as poisonous Plants their fruit, and Serpents their spawn. Wherefore he that has no more then imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary righteousness, carries a Kingdome of Rebellion in himself; and
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:55305:218"/>
unless he be given up to a reprobate sense, the peace and tranquillity of his mind cannot but be shaken. For verily the Rational Soul of man is not so utterly estranged from all Vertue and Goodness, nay indeed there is that congruity and connaturality betwixt them, that it will be a hard task utterly to break off that ancient league. For Vertue is natural to the Soul, Vice and Immorality extraneous and adventitious; else why do they call the cleansing of the Soul from Vice, the <hi>Purging</hi> of her? For <hi>Purgation</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the <hi>Platonists</hi> well define it, <hi>the taking away of what is unnatural and improper.</hi> Wherefore seeing that Vertue is natural to the Soul, it is reasonable to conceive it is better rooted then to be expunged quite or a sudden by any one Phansy or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and that the sense thereof will not so easily be washed out. And therefore it remaining there, and yet a man acting according to some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural or irrational conceit that he has taken up he knows not how una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, he acting, I say, against this noble and innate sense of the Soul, he must needs be wounded and disquieted.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Divine Ioy and Triumph of the Soul is taken away.</hi> For what is <hi>Ioy and Triumph</hi> but the more fully and easie of any Nature ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its own principle? As the Flame when it has broke through the smoke and raw smotherings of the fewel into more free activity and more uncurb'd vibrations of its own splendour and light. And verily the Soul has found its own freedom and force and easie activity and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral complacency in the Spirit of Righteousness, when once it has from many incumbrances of the flesh and of the world broke out into that Divine flame, and so felt what is most perfective of her self and of her own happiness, and what suits her better then any thing that ever she had a sense of before. Which is a sign again that this is most natural to the Soul, her sense being most satisfied therewith. And in the high enjoiment of so enravishing a good, what can she doe less then breath out her pleasure in such like ejaculations as these, <hi>Rejoice in the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, and again I say, rejoice</hi>; and with the Psalmist, <hi>Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous, for it becometh the just to be thankfull?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>That Health and Safety is taken away by this substituting of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination for real Righteousness,</hi> is plain. For if the keeping of the Law is <hi>health to the navel and marrow to the bones,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 3.8.</note> as the wise man speaks, what must Unrighteousness be, but a canker in the flesh and rottenness to the bones? And if that of the Apostle be true, <hi>Who is he that will harm you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.13.</note> 
                  <hi>if you be followers of that which is good?</hi> then what harm may you not fall into if you adhere to what is evil?</p>
               <p n="9">9. As we are deprived of <hi>Health and Safety here,</hi> so also shall we be defrauded of our <hi>Eternal Happiness hereafter</hi> by this imposture where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we are imposed upon by our own selves. For to say nothing by way of argument from the Reason of the thing, how incompetible and incongruous Heaven is to an unrighteous Soul, the Testimony of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is plain in this matter; <hi>For no unclean thing may enter into the holy City.</hi> And 1 Cor. 6.9. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdome of God? Be not deceived; neither Fornicatours, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor Abusers of themselves
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:55305:218"/>
with mankind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners, shall inherit the kingdome of God.</hi> And Hebr. 12.14. <hi>Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.</hi> And thus we see that all the <hi>Happiness</hi> of man and his real good is utterly subverted and destroyed by this mischievous imagination of being righteous otherwise then by true and living Righteousness.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And it is as plain that this imposture will <hi>rob God of his Glory,</hi> as well as defeat man of <hi>his Happiness.</hi> For whether we understand by the <hi>Glory of God</hi> the Image of God communicable to men; as the Image, that is, the light of the Sun, is the glory of the Sun: or whether we understand the acknowledgment of that Excellency and Perfection that is in God, first deeply conceived in our hearts, and then fully and freely professed by our mouths: both these are assuredly taken away by this false conceit. And of the former there is no doubt, being that the Spirit of Righteousness is that very <hi>Glory of God</hi> or <hi>Image of Christ.</hi> Wherefore whatever does intercept this, does really eclipse the <hi>Glory of God.</hi> And it is as true also of the other. For seeing that the most rich and precious Excellencies of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> cannot be discovered by the Soul as they ought to be, but by becoming <hi>Divine, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, If thou beest it, thou seest it,</hi> as <hi>Plotinus</hi> speaks; it must needs be that they cannot be worthily admired and extolled by any Soul but such as is <hi>Divine,</hi> that is, such a Soul as God has poured the Spirit of Righteousness and true Holiness on, without which it is impossible to see God.</p>
               <p>To all which Particulars that concern every private man you may add that great summe of an incomputable damage that respects the Publick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For what Peace or Faithfulness can there be amongst men where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Mysterie of their Religion is the Explosion of real Righteousness?

                  <pb n="408" facs="tcp:55305:219" rendition="simple:additions"/>
acknowledge the fondness of their opinion by their contrary practice. <hi>5.</hi> An appeal to the Light within them, if the Christian Religion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the literal sense be not true. <hi>6.</hi> That the Operation of the <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> is not absolute, but restrained to certain laws and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as it is in the <hi>Spirit of Nature. 7.</hi> The fourth <hi>Gospel-Power,</hi> The <hi>Example of Christ. 8.</hi> His purpose of vindicating the Example of Christ from aspersions, with the reasons thereof.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WE have now gone through the Three first <hi>Powers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi>; of which Three the last, namely, <hi>The Promise of the Spirit,</hi> may seem so sufficient of it self to some, without any thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I am sure does so to others, that professedly they take up here, and exclude, or at least neglect, all that advantage that accrues from the History of Christ, and hereby do antiquate the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. These are those great <hi>Spiritualists</hi> that talk so much of <hi>The Light within them,</hi> and <hi>the Power within them</hi>; and boast that they want nothing without to be their Guide and Support, but that they can goe of themselves without any external help. For keeping to <hi>the Light within them,</hi> the Power of God and the Spirit of God will assist them, and will lead them into all truth. And truly I cannot but say Amen to what they declare. For I know assuredly that it is most true, if they would leave off their canting language, and say in down-right terms, That keeping sincerely to the dictates of Reason and Conscience, and the perpetually denying themselves in such things as they know or suspect to be evil, with devout addresses to the Throne of Grace for the assistance and illumination of the Holy Spirit, to discover and overcome all Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, Falseness, Pride and Hypocrisie that may lurk in their hearts; I say, I am well assured that this Dispensation, faithfully kept to, will in due time lead unto all Saving Truth; and that such a one at the last can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail to become a Christian in the soundest and the fullest sense, such as firmly adhered to Christ in the first and most unspotted Ages of the Church. But if they will call any hot, wild Imagination or forcible and unaccountable Suggestion, <hi>the Light within them,</hi> and follow that; this is not to keep to <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi> but to be delivered up to <hi>a reprobate sense,</hi> and to expose a mans self to all the temptations that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devil or a mans own Lust or a sordid Melancholy can entangle him in.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wherefore by <hi>the Light within them</hi> they must understand an <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable and rational Conscience within them,</hi> unless they be perfect Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks or Mad-men, or, what is worse, mere Impostors and Cheats, who would pretend to a <hi>Conscience,</hi> but yet <hi>irrational</hi> and <hi>unaccountable</hi> to any one, and hereby have the liberty of doing what they please, being given up at length to nothing but <hi>Fury</hi> and <hi>Lust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then lastly, <hi>This Conscience within them</hi> is not a thing so absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly within them, that it can take no information from what is <hi>without.</hi> For it is manifest that this <hi>Lamp of God</hi> that burneth in us, is fed and nourished from external Objects. <hi>For the invisible things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly seen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1.19, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>being understood by things that
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:55305:219"/>
are made</hi>; for by these <hi>from without</hi> are we advertised <hi>of his Eternal power and Godhead.</hi> And as we are thus taught by the <hi>outward Book of Nature</hi> concerning the <hi>Existence of God</hi> and his <hi>general Providence</hi> in the world as to the necessities of life both of Men and Beasts; so may we also by <hi>external VVritings</hi> or <hi>Records</hi> be more fully informed of <hi>a more special Providence</hi> of his to the Sons of men, concerning the State in the other world, and of that Eternal life manifested by Christ. But I grant that it is still this <hi>Light within us,</hi> that judges and concludes after the perusal of either the <hi>Volumes</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> or of <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But as he that gives his Mind to <hi>Mathematicks, Architecture, Husbandry, Gardening,</hi> and the like, if he out of a foolish conceit of <hi>Light and Reason</hi> being <hi>only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>hin one,</hi> and <hi>not without,</hi> (as certainly neither Ink nor Paper, nor both put together, are any more partakers of the Light of Reason then of Sense and Life) would make no use of the Writings of <hi>Euclid,</hi> suppose for Mathematicks, nor any other Authour that has writ of such matters, and so of the rest of the Faculties I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, nor converse with any man by word of mouth, nor cast his eyes upon what they have done, but only think with himself and sit still by the light of his own lamp within dores; will be a very sorry Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician, Architect, Husbandman or Gardener: So certainly for <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> Truth, he that will be so taught by himself, that he will not use outward advantages, such as the Holy Scriptures especially afford, will be found at last to have been the Scholar of a very foolish and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Master.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Besides that, these men contradict themselves in their own practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For they vilifie that by which they have been taught, and retain the very phrases of what they have learned out of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and know not how to speak without <hi>Scripture-terms,</hi> nor can make any show with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Scriptural</hi> allusions; and that grand Document of <hi>keeping to the Light within us</hi> they borrow out of S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Gospel: and yet they are so phrantick and peevish that they would fling away the staffe without which they are not able to make one step in Religion. Moreover if this <hi>Light within us</hi> is so precisely within us, that it wants no informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>without us,</hi> why do they themselves scribble such abundance of Pamphlets, make Catechisms, set out Prophecies? why do they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, rebuke, nay reproach and raile against men to convert them, if what is <hi>without</hi> cannot reach that which is <hi>within?</hi> or why do they meet together to hear some one of their Assembly (after he has fallen down as in a trance, and got up again) dictate Oracles out of his distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed breast? For his words which they hear are <hi>without,</hi> and beat upon the Ear; they are <hi>not the Light within.</hi> Wherefore it is plain, that <hi>the Light within</hi> may be informed by something which is <hi>without,</hi> whether by voice or writings: And if so, there is an obligation upon this <hi>Light within</hi> to be so considerate, as to seek the most punctual information it can from what is most likely to inform it from <hi>without.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. And therefore they are with all diligence to examine the most ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Records of Religion, and especially of that Religion under which they were not only born, but which is absolutely of it self the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:55305:220"/>
most renowned Religion that ever was in the World. Which therefore none but such as are utterly averse from all Religion, as being wholy given up to lust and prophaneness, can without examination dare to relinquish; and if they will examine it, I mean the Christian Religion, (as it referrs to the Person of Christ, that died betwixt two thieves at Jerusalem, but rose again the third day, that ascended visibly into Heaven, and shall again return in a visible manner to judge the quick and the dead,) I appeal to this <hi>Light within them,</hi> to their <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi> and that of the most cunning Impostors amongst them all, or of whoever will join with them, if the evidence for this Religion from <hi>Prophecie, History,</hi> and from <hi>the Nature of the Religion it self,</hi> is not such, as that nothing but Ignorance of the true meaning thereof and of its right design can hinder it from being acknowledged as a most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truth by any, but those that are afraid that any Religion that leads to Holiness, or promises any thing after this Life, should be found true.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As for that Objection taken from the mighty <hi>Power of the Spirit of God,</hi> as if that were so sufficient of it self, that belief therein and assistance therefrom would anticipate the mention and use of any other power whatsoever that may seem to confer to the End of the Gospel, the Sanctification of our Souls; I answer to this, That they that do after this manner argue, do erre not knowing the Scriptures. For this <hi>Power of the Spirit</hi> communicable to Believers is not an <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent</hi> Power, not to be resisted, not to be frustrated, if there be not due means and wise accommodations concurring with its workings or attempts to work. But I may in some manner illustrate the condition thereof from what is observable in <hi>the Spirit of Nature,</hi> the Principle of all natural Generations, Growths and Perfections; in which there is a kind of <hi>Hypothetical Omnipotency</hi> as to the work of Nature; that is, That this Spirit will not fail to assist and complete, provided that such and such circumstances in Corporeal Agents be not wanting. So is it also in this <hi>Divine Spirit,</hi> or the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as it is communicable to us; it will certainly assist and finish its work, if there be no impediment on our side, which it behoves us to remove out of the way, nor any thing wanting which we can applie our selves to for the advance of our Faith &amp; perfecting of the holy life; such as Meditating on the Scriptures, Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with Holy men, experienced Christians, &amp; Using with devotion and reverence all the Ordinances of Christ. For though this assistance of the Holy Spirit be unspeakably powerfull to the sincere and diligent; yet in the negligent and perverse, as I said, his attempts are frustrated. And therefore <hi>Steven</hi> expostulates with the Jews in this sense,<note place="margin">Acts 7.51.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in hearts and ears, ye do alwaies resist the Holy Ghost:</hi> and elsewhere we are exhorted <hi>not to</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ephes. 4.30.</note> 
                  <hi>grieve the Spirit, nor</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">1 Thes. 5.19.</note> 
                  <hi>quench the Spirit.</hi> Which expressions do plainly demonstrate that the Communication of the Spirit is not <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>omnipotent,</hi> but recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved according to certain laws and waies of God's own appointing; who of his infinite wisdome has traced out such a method in Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as is most accommodate to gain Souls to himself: of which we
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:55305:220"/>
have heard part already, and shall now proceed to the Four last <hi>Powers</hi> of the Gospel, which are mainly instrumental to the work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon the Hearts of all true Believers.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And the first of these is <hi>the Example of our ever-blessed Saviour,</hi> who has given us no other <hi>Precepts</hi> then what himself was the exactest <hi>Pattern</hi> of; and himself such a <hi>Pattern of Life,</hi> that is, of <hi>Faith in God,</hi> of <hi>Humility, Love</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi>; that we cannot doubt in following his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps that we are in a wrong way, he being by voices from heaven and by his miracles upon earth proved and declared to be the only-begotten Son of God. Wherefore the nearer we keep to his path, the surer we are that we walk upon sound ground. Besides that he is our Lord and Soveraign, and therefore natural Ingenuity will urge us forward to compose our lives so as is most agreeable to his fashion. And he does expresly require this as a Testimonie of our love and loyalty to him; <hi>If you love me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 14.15.</note> 
                  <hi>keep my commandements:</hi> Of which a principal one is, <hi>That as I have loved you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 13.34.</note> 
                  <hi>ye love also one another.</hi> So he gives his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples an Example of being <hi>humble</hi> one to another, in that he washed their feet. <hi>If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye ought also to wash one anothers feet. For I have given you an Example, that you should doe as I have done to you,</hi> John 13. And Matth. 11. <hi>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. But I need not insist much upon this subject; I having amply enough shewn in the Second part of my Discourse, how the whole Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of Christ, all his actions and deportments of himself, tend to the most effectual recommending of <hi>the Divine Life</hi> unto us. We shall only take the opportunity here to wipe off such stains as the foul and unsound breath of some blasphemous mouths have of old or of late en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to stain this bright Mirrour of Divine perfection withall. Which will be not only a piece of indispensable duty and loyalty to the Person of our Saviour, but also the better encouragement to his sincere followers; especially when I have added the Parallel of such accusations and imputations as bear very close analogie with those of our Saviours himself.<note place="margin">Matt. 10.25.</note> For he has foretold of old what would come of it, <hi>That the disciple should not be above his Master, nor the servant above his Lord. And if they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of the houshold?</hi> But how just the calumnies are against the one and the other, we shall now see.</p>

               <p>These are the several dunghills from whence wicked and perverse men would industriously dig out dirt to cast in the face of him who was <hi>the perfect Pattern of divine Purity and Righteousness.</hi> But let them ply themselves as fast as they can in these several foul pits, it will not be hard to find wherewith to wipe it off as fast as their impious diligence shall be able to cast it on.</p>
               <p>And first let us consider what work they make in the first place as concerning <hi>Blasphemy.</hi> John 10. For declaring God his Father, and that He and his Father was one, he is there furiously accused of <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> and ready to be stoned. And John 8. They are also there ready to
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:55305:221"/>
stone him for saying <hi>He was before Abraham.</hi> And <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.3. He is there also accused of <hi>Blasphemy</hi> for saying, <hi>Son, be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here in this first accusation <hi>de facto constat</hi>; Christ confesses, That <hi>he is one with God,</hi> That <hi>he is the Son of God,</hi> and that he has <hi>power to forgive sins,</hi> That <hi>he was before Abraham:</hi> but it is utterly denied, that in any of all this Christ did <hi>blaspheme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For first, consider the very words of Christ, <hi>I and my Father are one.</hi> How unreasonably and inconsequently did these dull and peevish Perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the words of him whom they so entirely hated for his good life and doctrine, deduce from that saying, <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> that he, <hi>being a man, made himself God?</hi> For it is as childishly and ineptly inferred from thence by them, <hi>That he made himself God</hi>; as if they should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That the <hi>Body</hi> is the very <hi>Soul,</hi> because the <hi>Body</hi> and the <hi>Soul</hi> are <hi>one,</hi> that is, <hi>one man.</hi> And it is no more <hi>Falshood,</hi> much lesse <hi>Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> for the <hi>Humanity</hi> of Christ (who was so really and lively actuated, informed, and united with <hi>God,</hi> as the Body is with the Soul) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce of himself as if he were very God, then it is for the <hi>Tongue</hi> to say, <hi>I understand, I believe, I perceive,</hi> when neither the Body nor it <hi>believes, perceives,</hi> or <hi>understands</hi> any thing, but only the <hi>Soul</hi> with which it is so intimately united, and of which that which the <hi>Tongue</hi> speaks in such cases is to be understood.</p>
               <p>And if this be duely considered and taken in, Christs saying also, <hi>That he was before Abraham,</hi> will not prove any <hi>Blasphemy.</hi> For Christ by reason of his so near union and essential conjunction with God, which <hi>Athanasius</hi> well resembles to that of <hi>the Body and Soul,</hi> may as properly and naturally professe himself to be <hi>before Abraham,</hi> yea, to <hi>have been before the world was made,</hi> as the <hi>Tongue</hi> of man may utter, <hi>I shall survive after the death of this my body</hi>; in which there is no ill sense nor incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity in the judgement of most sober men. But besides this, that which the blinde Jews understood not, being hoodwinked with the thicknesse of their own particular Religion and unregenerate Nature, sometimes Christ speaks of himself under the notion of a <hi>Divine Life</hi> and <hi>Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> communicable to the Sons of men in all Ages and Places. Wherefore the sense is this, That whereas the <hi>Iews</hi> Religion and <hi>Topical</hi> and <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary</hi> Holiness began but as high as from <hi>Abraham</hi>; that of Christs, which he exhibited in that fulnesse to the World, was truly <hi>Universall</hi> both for <hi>Time</hi> as well as <hi>Place</hi>; a Light that enlightneth every man that cometh into the world; the Eternal Wisedom of God, that in all Ages makes those that receive it <hi>friends of God and Prophets,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wisd. 7.27.</note> as the Wise man speaks.</p>
               <p>And it is no wonder that <hi>Divine men</hi> according to their higher or more intimate union with the Divinity lose their sense and remembrance of their <hi>Particularities,</hi> and pronounce of themselves rather according to the things they are so livingly united with, then according to their own vanishing circumscribed corporeal persons.</p>
               <p>And now it being no <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> as is plain, to admit that one may be thus lively actuated by and united to God, in whom, if any where, the
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:55305:222"/>
minde of God must dwell; who can more reasonably <hi>remit sins</hi> then such an one and so manifest a Prophet as our Saviour declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by his signs and miracles done among the people? But our Saviour has so excellently answered for himself, and so apposite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as to the condition of his Opposers, that when I have rehearsed it, this <hi>first accusation</hi> will be more then satisfied.<note place="margin">Joh. 10.34, 35.</note> 
                  <hi>Is it not written in your Law, I said, Ye are Gods? If he called them Gods unto whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken; Say you of him whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works; that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me and I in him.</hi> And surely at the very first sight this is a right sober plea to any unprejudiced Judge, that our Saviour was so far from a <hi>Blasphemer,</hi> that for <hi>his Life</hi> he was a <hi>Saint,</hi> or rather the Pattern and Original of all Saintship, for <hi>his Miracles</hi> the <hi>Power of God,</hi> and for his <hi>Nature</hi> and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Filius Dei, the Son of God,</hi> in a very safe <hi>Scriptural</hi> and <hi>Judaical</hi> sense; to trouble their low apprehensions with no higher nor harder conceptions. Which Conceptions are notwithstanding not so hard as true: and the Writings of the Apostles and the Evangelists being judge (to whom every Christian is bound to appeal) I conceive it will easily appear to indifferent men, That <hi>the Godhead</hi> belongs to Christ <hi>really</hi> and <hi>essentially,</hi> not <hi>titularly,</hi> being as necessarily included in the <hi>formalis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi> of his nature, as three Angles in the notion of a Triangle. And in my own judgement, I cannot acquit those men who are so busie against the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Christ (whenas yet they would be called and esteemed Christians) from being guilty not only of high indiscretion, but of a very grand errour in Christianity.</p>
               <p>But the Jews, to whom this great Mystery of <hi>the Coalition of God and Man into one person</hi> was not then revealed, did very perversly to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret Christs words into such a sense as they might with confidence call <hi>Blasphemy</hi>; whenas they might have interpreted them according to what was more compliable with the tenour of their own Faith. In this, I say, was their malice very remarkable, that they would not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford <hi>his saying</hi> an ordinary benigne interpretation, <hi>whose works and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> were so miraculous and divine, and his life so full of Goodnesse and Innocency.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But such was the perversenesse of this stupid Nation, that even those things that should have wrought an acknowledgement of their <hi>Messias,</hi> made them more obstinate; and they must be less his friend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was a foe to the Devil, and deem him a Conspiratour against God, when it was his businesse to dislodge <hi>Satan</hi> whereever he found him.</p>
               <p>Christ in the <hi>second accusation</hi> must by all means be represented to the world as a <hi>Conjurer, and a dealer with the Devil,</hi> Matt. 12.22. Where the people being much amazed at that great Miracle that Jesus did in healing the possessed that was blinde and dumb, insomuch that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to bethink themselves that this man might very well be the <hi>Messias</hi>;
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:55305:222"/>
the wicked and envious Pharisees most impudently calumniate him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>This man doth not cast out Devils, but by Beelzebub the Prince of the Devils.</hi> But Christs Reply to this so hainous Calumny is as solid as milde.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every kingdom divided against it self is brought to desolation; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry city or house divided against it self cannot stand. And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand? And if I by Beelzebub cast out Devils, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. But if I cast our Devils by the Spirit of God,</hi> &amp;c. And here he clears himself by two excellent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The first supposes the Devils to be so wise and to love them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so well, that they knew how to conserve, and would endeavour to conserve their own Commonwealth and Power; but if they should enable Christ to cast out their fellow-devils, it were a plain begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of sedition and dissension, and a portending of ruine to their State. Nor could it be reasonably suspected that Christ was so deep a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotter with the Rulers of Darknesse, and that he was of so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy or interest with them, that this was done by way of <hi>Collusion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Devils and him, that in something else he might subvert the kingdom of God with greater ease and effect. For there can be nothing conceived more contrary to the Devils nature and interest, then <hi>that Life</hi> which Christ both taught and practised; besides his recommending of<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 4.23, 24.</note> spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual worship, which destroys Paganisme and the worship of Daemons. Wherefore it was the more perversly done of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> to impute <hi>this Miracle</hi> to the Power of the Devil rather then the Spirit of God; whenas also their own Sons and Disciples were conceived by them to cast out devils by no evil Art, but merely by the Power of God; as divers Writers testifie, that both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> were known to cast out unclean spirits by conjuring them in the name of the God of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and sometimes in the <hi>Nomen</hi>

               <p>Our Saviour being very craftily tempted to declare himself to be of judgement either for or against <hi>Caesar</hi> (<hi>Matth.</hi> 22.) by this Question, <hi>Is it lawful to pay tribute to Caesar, or no?</hi> he as warily avoids giving his sentence, for the justnesse of this or that cause, as may be; returning only this well-attemper'd Answer, <hi>Give unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.

               <p n="5">5. What semblances they can feign of <hi>Injustice</hi> or <hi>Partiality,</hi> will be picked out of such passages as these; His unseasonable cursing the Fig-tree for not bearing fruit, whenas the time of year was not for fruit; His blaming the Pharisees for long Prayers, when himself is recorded to have prayed a night together; and lastly, His quitting the woman that was taken in the very act of Adultery.</p>
               <p>But as for the first; As <hi>the Fig-tree</hi> felt no hurt, so no hurt was done in withering it: but this was merely a <hi>Symbolical</hi> passage, whereby the judgement of God was prefigured against the unfruitfull Religion of the Jews,<note place="margin">See Book 4. c. 8. sect. 5, 6, 7.</note> as I have above noted.</p>
               <p>For <hi>long Prayers</hi>; Whereas our Saviour is said (<hi>Luke</hi> 6.) to have gone out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God; the Greek has it <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which is more likely to signifie <hi>in proseucha Dei,</hi> or <hi>Divine Oratory,</hi> or <hi>Place of Prayer to God</hi>; as is plain from that of the <hi>Satyrist,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Ede ubi consistas, in qua te quaero proseucha.</l>
                  </q>
However it is to be conceived our Saviour condemned rather the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie and effectedness of <hi>long Prayers</hi> then the mere length of them; it
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:55305:223"/>
being impossible for any of so accomplished a Spirit as our Saviour to blame either the <hi>shortness</hi> or <hi>length</hi> of mens devotions arising out of a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly-guided affection, not a vain affectation.</p>
               <p>For <hi>the acquitting the Adulteresse,</hi> it cannot be interpreted as a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing of any such foul miscarriage, but as an exprobration to the Jews of their own wickednesses, which whenas they ought to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious to themselves of, they should not have been over-forward to do execution upon those that were but sinners as themselves, especially that power of condemning and punishing being then in a manner taken out of their hands by the <hi>Romans.</hi> And here Christ did also worthily of that divine and benigne nature which dwelt in him, of which this fruit was but as an handful to that full Harvest the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> afterward reaped from his Doings and Sufferings.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As for <hi>the Imputation of railing</hi>; One of the worst speeches that ever fell from his lips was when he called the Scribes and Pharisees <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites</hi>; which, according to the propriety of the word, is as much as <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striones</hi> or <hi>Stage-plaiers:</hi> and indeed the Scribes and Pharisees of old and their posterity ever since have so dressed up themselves and their Religion too, that that Title might deservedly have been entailed on them and their seed for ever. But Christ elsewhere seems more bitter, where he speaks out in plain English,<note place="margin">Joh. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil.</hi> But it was a Title that fell out so fittingly for them upon their vain boast of their Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> whose Sonship they had forfeited by being quite of a contrary nature to him, that it had been a piece of inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable Forgetfulnesse not to have reminded them of their true Descent and Pedigree, he having so full authority thereto.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That seeming <hi>injurious and tumultuary Zeal,</hi> where he whips the Tradesmen out of the Temple, and overthrows the Tables of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-changers, the very manner of the doing of it does justifie the act; it being plainly miraculous, that a private man, destitute both of arms and authority from men, should drive so many both from their station and gain. Nor would this zeal, seem it never so tumultuous, look mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becomingly, if we did consider from whence it sprung. Our Saviour certainly conceived high indignation and sorrow in his heart, while he observed that scorn and contempt those blinde <hi>Superstitionists,</hi> the <hi>Iews,</hi> bore against the poor despised <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in thus profaning their Place of worship. But I may not stay here, especially having touched upon this <note n="*" place="margin">Book 4. c. 8. sect. 3.</note> Objection already. I will only cursorily note this, <hi>That there was nothing could more effectually attempt to move that milde Spirit of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to Ire and Impatiency, then the scornful Pride and smooth Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie of great Pretenders to Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. What is alledged against him of <hi>Despair</hi> and <hi>Distrust in God,</hi> is from those last dreadful and Tragical words, <hi>Eli, Eli, lama sabacthani:</hi> which being uttered in the very pangs of death and insufferable torture, if they had been more harsh and unreasonable then they seem, there had been little reason to accuse Christ for them; Christ then, according to his humane nature, being at the same disadvantage that those that lye in the highest Paroxysms of sickness, the actions of whom are rather to
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:55305:224"/>
be deemed <hi>Actiones Hominis</hi> then <hi>Humanae,</hi> and so they to be acquitted of them. But those words are so sober, that they want no such Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie: especially if it be free to interpret them according to the latitude of the Hebrew Text, from whence they are taken. For <hi>lama</hi> will signifie <hi>how</hi> as well as <hi>why</hi>; and then it is nothing but a speech of one bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself in the present sense of his insupportable desertion.</p>
               <p n="9">9. What others gather of <hi>Distractedness</hi> in our Saviour and broken Forgetfulness, that he should pronounce himself <hi>forsaken of him</hi> who himself was, (for he was God,) and so complain of an impossibility; that Allegation argues more shortness of Understanding in themselves. For the <hi>Humanity</hi> of Christ was not God; for so he had not been <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>twice God:</hi> but he being only God by <hi>Union,</hi> even that union holding, there may be this desertion of the Humanity. As the Sun, at Christ's Passion, not disjoined from the World, yet for the time deserted the World by withdrawing its light from it. But if this will not doe, there is another way to make good this <hi>Imputation of Madness</hi> against <hi>Him</hi> who was deservedly styled <hi>the Wisdome of God.</hi> And this they will confirm even by the verdict of his own friends, Mark 3.21. <hi>And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hands on him; for they said, He is beside himself.</hi> But indeed this is the fate of all almost that are <hi>more then ordinarily wise,</hi> to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted little better then <hi>mad.</hi> For they having either higher or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary apprehensions to the vulgar, and consequently acting many times contrary to them, they can hardly escape the suspicion of <hi>Madness</hi>; the multitude of their judges, even the meanest of them, having not so mean a conceit of himself, but that he is even infallible in those things which he has for so long a time together held as true, without any controll in himself or of others. And I remember a passage somewhere in <hi>Tris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megist,</hi> where the Instructer in high mysteries, when he had enlightned his Son <hi>Tatius,</hi> forewarns him of the reproach he would undergoe from the Vulgar, that he would certainly seem to them as a man <hi>distracted.</hi> And this also was the condition of <hi>Democritus,</hi> whom the people out of over-much pitty and officiousness desired <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to use his best skill to cure, as troubled with the <hi>Phrensy:</hi> which he intending to set to the next day, was over night advertized by a divine vision or dream, that it was not <hi>Democritus</hi> that was <hi>mad,</hi> but the People. And to return again to the Text alledged, if we follow the not-unprobable conjectures of some, the people will also be here found to be the <hi>mad-men,</hi> and not Christ, For <gap reason="foreign">

For the people did tumultuously flock toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and was so troublesome, it seems, that men could not eat their meat quietly for them: wherefore there being that fervour and heat in the multitude, Christ's friends went out <gap reason="foreign">

As for the Tenth and Eleventh accusations of <hi>Debaucherie and Looseness of life, Prodigality and needless Lavishments,</hi> which are a near strain to the height of the worst kind of <hi>Madness</hi>; they are expresly set down in Scripture. And our Saviour himself knew what a fame went of him. Luke 7.33, 34. <hi>Iohn the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a Devil. The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and Sinners.</hi> For in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verses that woman in the city, which is said to be <hi>a sinner,</hi> which bestowed so much cost and affection upon our Saviour, was such an one, <hi>prostitutae pudicitiae mulier,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> interprets it: But what her demeanour was toward our Saviour Christ is there set down, <hi>She stood behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</hi> Which ointment in the other Gospel is said to be <hi>a box of Spikenard very pretious.</hi> Which familiar and affectionate officious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and sumptuous cost, together with that sinister fame that woman was noted with, could not but give much scandal to the <hi>Pharisees</hi> there present. For that dispensation of the Law under which they lived making nothing perfect, but only curbing the outward actions of men; it might very well be, that they being conscious to themselves of no better motions within then of either <hi>Bitterness</hi> or <hi>Lust,</hi> how fair soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they carried without, could not deem Christ's acceptance of so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and affectionate service from a woman of that fame to proceed from any thing better then some loose and vain principle; and that therefore the Prophet was grown idly-minded, or that he was no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet at all. But he was both <hi>a Prophet,</hi> and <hi>constantly sober-minded,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamable even in this matter. For he knew that she had been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time <hi>a Convert,</hi> as well as heretofore <hi>a Sinner,</hi> whose <hi>Conversion</hi> our Saviour, he having several times conversed with her, either begun or confirmed by that his conversation. For he balk'd no company, as a good Physitian declines no patient nor disease. And certainly that great miracle which <hi>Iesus</hi> wrought upon her brother (for this was <hi>Mary</hi> the sister of <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> whom Christ raised from the dead) could not but fully settle her in a firm faith and love of God and Jesus Christ whom he had sent. Whereby her heart at that time being full of the joiful remembrances of the mercy and goodness of God every way exhibited to her by this man Christ, (as Remission of sins, true Instructions in Righteousness, Newness of life, and the regaining of her dear brother <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the grave;) out of a deep sense of the love of God, and thankfull regard to him through whom all that was manifested and made good to her, she did overflow with kindness and thankfulness: the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions whereof moving no sense of evil to our Saviour, (his sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied body being as pure and immovable as consecrated marble, the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wings of the Cherubims in the Temple, or that very alabaster that bore in it the pretious ointment,) it had been not only Incivility but even Impiety to have given any check or discountenance to this devout Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert in this her full carier of sincere love and thankfull affection. Which
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:55305:225"/>
certainly, whatever it seemed to those pittifull Spectators, those strait-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Pharisees,</hi> was an odour of sweet savour unto God, and as holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense filled the court of Heaven, as well as the opening of the box of ointment filled the house with an acceptable sent to all but <hi>Iudas</hi> (whose <hi>Covetousness</hi> made him with a handsome pretence to the poor, exclaim of the act as <hi>profuse</hi> and <hi>prodigal</hi>;) and to the abovesaid <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who doubtless thought all the perfume lost, saving that fee thereof they felt in their own Nostrils.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But it is observable that such was the perverse and wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genie of those crooked <hi>Superstitionists,</hi> that true Goodness in no kind of dress would please them. In <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> there was that eminent Severity and Austerity of Life, accompanying and unreprovable Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Purity of heart, that he might, one would think, have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to that which was good; but he must have <hi>a melancholy Devil in him.</hi> Our Saviour came in a more pleasant and careless garb, laying aside that awfull and rough severity that was in the other, intermingling himself with all companies, taking not at all upon him, being as other men are in every thing, sin only excepted; (which manner of life as it is of more perfection then the other, as supposing more Benignity of nature, and more firm radication in Goodness, so fewer men are capable of it, much less unsteddy and unresolved youth, who are to fly from suspected company as from the devouring plague;) yet, I say, these wretched <hi>Pharisees,</hi> as true Detesters of real Holiness and Godliness, whatever they pretend in the shadow thereof, cannot give our Saviour a good word, but interpret his good nature <hi>good-fellowship,</hi> or <hi>debauched company-keeping,</hi> and his serviceable intermingling himself with all sorts of men (Publicans and Sinners not excepted) for their good, <hi>friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and countenance to what is evil.</hi> But our Saviour Christ has suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently apologized for himself in this matter in these few words; <hi>The whole have no need of the Physitian, but those that are sick.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Similitude he fitly represents their cross nature by what is said of those in the song the little children sung in the market-place; <hi>We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not lamented:</hi> that is, These inept and unwieldy-spirited fellows, the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> could not be moved to what was truly good, neither by the <hi>sad</hi> and <hi>austere</hi> deportment of <hi>Iohn,</hi> nor by the <hi>more free</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected</hi> carriage of our Saviour.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And therefore let us leave them at last as remediless, &amp; examin the last allegation, which is taken out of one of his own followers and friends, Hebr. 12. v. 2. <hi>Looking unto Iesus the Authour and finisher of our faith; who for the joy set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</hi> Here cavillers will insinuate to the derogation of that perfect Righteousness in Christ, that he was a <hi>Self-seeker</hi> in all that toil and sorrow he underwent for the Sons of men, nay an ambitious <hi>Kingdome-seeker,</hi> (For <hi>That Ioy</hi> which sustained him was <hi>This Throne</hi> mentioned in this Text; as I confess can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied by any:) and that therefore all these <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> of our Saviour, that seemed so <hi>Heroical,</hi> do proceed but from a Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

Principle. But this Allegation is very easily answered. For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we understand by <hi>This Throne or Kingdome</hi> a more undisturbed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiment of the Divinity and fuller possession of God, which speaks a more powerfull and high exaltation of the <hi>Humane</hi> nature of Christ, and his more free fruition of the <hi>Divine</hi>; and this respects our Saviour Christs own good; or whether we understand That Power he should be endued with, whereby he led Captivity captive and procured gifts for men, trampling down the powers of Hell and Darkness for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue of the Sons of Adam from their long bondage; <hi>This Throne, This Kingdome, This Power</hi> aimed at, implied in our Saviour neither <hi>Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> nor <hi>Mercenariness.</hi> For the desire of a fuller Fruition of God was not <hi>Ambition,</hi> but <hi>Divine Love</hi>; which he not affecting in that Lucife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian way, <hi>Similis ero Altissimo,</hi> but through an humble enravishment of Spirit in the remembrance of that Divine Beauty, was so far from committing any sin, that he did that which is Weakness or Sin not to commit. And as <hi>Iacob</hi> could not properly be said to be either a <hi>Self-seeker</hi> or <hi>Mercenary</hi> in respect of <hi>Rachel</hi> for whom he served so many years, and whom he so entirely loved, but in respect of <hi>Laban</hi> and his sheep-keeping he might be said to be <hi>Mercenary,</hi> and a <hi>Self-seeker</hi>; (for he served him only for <hi>Rachel</hi>'s sake:) so Christ being enamoured of the Divine Nature, for love whereof he went through so much drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and misery upon Earth, could not in respect of that glorious and soul-ravishing Beauty which he sought to enjoy, be said to be either <hi>Self-seeking</hi> or <hi>Mercenary</hi>; when it was the very Presence of God that he was so taken with, as a Friend is with the lovely person of his Friend.</p>
               <p>But now for <hi>That Power</hi> he foresaw he should be invested withall, of leading Captivity captive and procuring gifts for men; being that it was for the Universal good of others, why might he not please and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace himself in it in the midst of his many tedious encumbrances, without the least suspicion of <hi>Ambition</hi> or <hi>Blame?</hi>

               <p n="1">1. AND thus you have seen Christ vindicated from all those several Suspicions and Aspersions laid upon him by malicious and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant men, whereby they would represent him as not possessed of, nor acting from so Noble and Divine a Principle of Righteousness as he himself profest, and his Followers have ever witnessed of him. In which I confess I have been something more large then might have been expected in pleading the cause of a Person so perfectly pure and innocent. But I considering our Saviour Christ not so much <hi>in himself,</hi> as <hi>in his members,</hi> I mean, <hi>his true members,</hi> who have one common Spirit with him; and how they are liable to the same accusations and misconstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of spightfull and inconsiderate men that himself was in the flesh: I thought it fit more fully to insist upon the clearing and well and rightly interpreting of all the Carriages of Christ; that thereby those that call themselves <hi>his members,</hi> may know better how to interpret one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or if they be not so themselves, that they may however learn not to judge rashly and inconsiderately of them that are, and walk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as he walked.</p>
               <p>And that my foregoing pains may be the more effectual to this purpose, I shall not stick to second them, so far as to shew how men or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily cast the same or the like soil and dirt upon <hi>the truest members of Christ,</hi> that they did upon <hi>Christ himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And that you may take in this with the more evidence, give me leave to prefix in your mind the <hi>right Image of a true Christian,</hi> or <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving member of Christ.</hi> And such an one is he, who is a branch of the

                  <note place="margin">Matth. 7.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>To know and acknowledge the only true God, and Iesus Christ whom he hath sent.</hi> And surely whosoever has this in its due measure and vigour of life, is conscious to himself and finds the sweet of so great and glorious an accomplishment of Mind, that whatever the Wit or Humour of man can add to it, will seem of little more value then dust and straws we tread under our feet.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And now I have told you what a true and living Member of Christ is, let me also tell you what <hi>a false</hi> or <hi>titular</hi> or <hi>Pharisaical</hi> Christian is. And he is this, One that has not the Divine Sap or Spirit derived to him, as being and growing in, and becoming one with the true Vine Christ Jesus; and is not possess'd nor is sensible of that Sufficiency, Joy and Satisfaction that is in the inward Life of Christ, and the Spirit of Righteousness and eternal and undispensable Truth of God: But being dead to what is most necessary, pretious and saving in Christianity, and only alive, or mainly, to the Spirit of the world, loves himself with all his heart and all his soul, and God and his Neighbour only for his own sake: or rather uses and rides his Neighbour, having haltered him or obliged him with some prudentially and judiciously-bestowed cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies; and worships God rather then loves him, <hi>nè noceat,</hi> beseeching him that upon a special Dispensation, though he be no better then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor ever intends nor hopes to be better, yet that it may be better with him in the end then with other folk.<note place="margin">Num. 23.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my latter end be like his.</hi> Or it may be, what is little better then that, in stead of the living Righteousness of Christ, he will magnifie himself in some humorous pieces of Holiness of his own. For he imagines there is a God, and that it is safe to make a friend of him one way or other; and therefore, that his conscience may be the better excused from those things that are more weighty and substantial, he will take up things according to his own humour and phansie, as fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twice in the week, making long prayers, hearing long sermons, stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing curiously to some unnecessary, uncertain and fruitless opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God and Religion, such as are warrantable neither out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture nor Reason, and growing very hot and zealous in the agitation of these things (though to the Disturbance of the Church of God and Injury of his Neighbour) yet these trinkets and trumperies of his own humour and complexion, this Heat, this Noise, this Zeal, these are the Altar, Fire and Holocaust wherewith he sacrifices to God, and presents himself an <hi>Oblationer</hi> before the Almighty. And all this to be excused from that which is the very End of all Religion and Worship, that is, the sacrificing of our own corrupt life, and acquiring that prize that is set before us, the holy Spirit of Righteousness, Equity and Purity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whose moderation and guidance is the Light of the world and the Life of man.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:55305:227"/>4. And having thus, though but loosely and rudely, scattered the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments of these two opposite professours of Christianity (the <hi>true Christian</hi> and <hi>Pharisaical Humorist,</hi>) I shall from hence, as from the Cause and Original, derive evidence and light to what I shall now propose to you by way of <hi>Parallelisme</hi> betwixt what our Saviour in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son suffered of false Accusations and Aspersions, and what his true and living Members are obnoxious to from that Spirit of <hi>Pharisaisme</hi> that has ever and does to this very day rule still in the world.</p>
               <p>And first of the first Accusation that was laid to our Saviours charge, viz. <hi>Blasphemy, He hath spoken Blasphemy, Matth.</hi> 26. It is apparent, the Pharisaical nature being desirous to be excused from destroying and bringing to nothing in ones self all haughty and ambitious Designes, Self-seeking, Covetousness and Intemperance, doth easily endeavour to make amends for this, and to pacifie the conscience and approve ones self to God, by laying out all our parts in spinning excellent high Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties and amazing Mysteries from any hints taken in Scripture, and in adorning the nature of God and Religion according to the garishness of a mans own natural Phansie and Nicety of Wit. Whence it may come to pass that these Traditionary <hi>Pharisees</hi> having made it their business to rack their natural unregenerate minds to find some magnificent concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (as they imagine them) to bestow upon the Deity; that one freed by Christ (who is <hi>the Truth that makes one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> free indeed</hi>) by not admitting or gainsaying these high and divine inventions of theirs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God and Christ, wherewith they have wrapped him and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed him (though they doe but what <hi>Dionysius</hi> did to the golden vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> take them off and put on a linsy-wolsy one,) may well be suspected and accused of <hi>Blasphemy</hi> and injury to God, when it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a refusal of the <hi>groundless Conclusions</hi> of rash and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men, or else worse, that of purpose cloth God and Christ and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present him to the people in such a dress as will make most for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing their own Hypocrisie, Profit and Interest. I will only name one instance of many. How has the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy forced and rack'd their wits to make good the grand mystery of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> whose ordinary Priests must have greater power of working miracles then the Devil could invent to puzzle our Saviour withall? For what is <hi>the turning a stone into bread</hi> in comparison of <hi>turning bread into God incarnate?</hi> And yet a Mass-priest after the uttering of a few formal words of Consecration, has brought about the prodigie. And he that will be so bold as to call <hi>bread but bread,</hi> and <hi>not Christ</hi> or <hi>God,</hi> how can he chuse but be thought to <hi>blaspheme?</hi> But yet this <hi>Blasphemy</hi> is not against the Nature of God or Christ, but against the forgery and ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, and so indeed is no more <hi>Blasphemy</hi> then <hi>Bread is Christ</hi> or mans Phansy the Deity. The Rule therefore that Christians are to take notice of here is this; There being so much Humour and Interest and Stupour of Education that may begin or continue false conceptions of God; if any one professe himself that he cannot conceive such things as some so peremptorily and imperiously obtrude upon his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that he is not straightway to be accounted <hi>a Blasphemer of God,</hi> it
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:55305:227"/>
haply being but a dissent only from the conceits of men.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The second Aspersion cast on our Saviour was, <hi>That that miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous good that he did, was from the power of Satan, not of God.</hi> And methinks it is not hard to find something parallel to this in some Asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions cast upon his true members by rash <hi>Pharisaical</hi> censure. Which is this; The eximious and exemplary life of good and holy men is many times (by those that are more addicted to such a dress or outward plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of Religion consisting of certain Ceremonies and Opinions, then to the truth and essence of Religion it self) imputed to corrupt natural principles, such as <hi>Vain-glory</hi> and <hi>the esteem of the World, Political ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,</hi> and the like; which answers to the <hi>Pharisees</hi> giving out that Christ cast out Devils by <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the Prince of the Devils. So say our modern <hi>Pharisees</hi> of such as are not of their Sect; if those men live never so holily and unblamably in this present evil World, exercising Vertue and avoiding Vice, that it is not from any Divine Principle in them, but from the instigation of <hi>Pride</hi> the Prince of Vices.</p>
               <p n="6">6. So in the third place, They that affect even more then a <hi>Iudaical</hi> strictness <hi>in the observation of the Sabbath,</hi> (though God knows it is too many times that their consciences may be the more free to work unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness all the week after,) yet they will take upon them to censure them of no less crime then <hi>Prophaneness</hi> that observe neither the same measure of Superstition nor Hypocrisie with themselves.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Fourthly, <hi>Neutrality and cold Indifferency in publick controversies,</hi> how can it possibly chuse but seem very abominable to the <hi>Pharisee</hi> or formal Professour? For they knowing no other Religion then what consists in certain dispensable and unnecessary Opinions and Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; when they are shaken and hazarded, he that will not engage to the utmost then, as if God and true Religion it self were at stake, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be deemed very unworthy and detestable. Whenas to be but coldly and indifferently affected in things indifferent, is in all reason to be esteemed just and good.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Nor is it a whit strange to hear the <hi>Pharisaical</hi> Tribe complain of the true regenerate Christian as <hi>Unjust</hi>; whenas the one acts according to an outward Rule or Tradition which was made for the meeting with their own wicked and untamed corruptions, <hi>(malo nodo malus cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus)</hi> and which notwithstanding they craftily and perversly make use of by leguleious cavills to the injuring of one another or them that are better then themselves; but the true Christian acts and judges accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the living Law of Equity and the Eternal Love of God spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in his heart.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Sixthly, As for the accusation of <hi>Railings and Revilings,</hi> even a sober and wel-carriaged Christian may well be subject to that calumnie. For the <hi>Pharisee</hi> bearing himself very high in the opinion of his own either Formal or Phantastical righteousness, making a shift rather any way to perswade himself he is righteous and religious then by partaking of true Religion and Righteousness indeed; he acting therefore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature he really has, not according to what he phansies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:55305:228"/>
to be; it cannot but happen that the true Christian, endued with the Divine nature and spirit of Righteousness, not intending at all to <hi>raile</hi> or <hi>revile,</hi> but using the most easie and unaffected propriety of words, calling a Spade a Spade, as the Proverb is, doing but so as <hi>Adam</hi> did in innocency, giving the creatures names according to their natures, it cannot but happen, I say, that the Actions and Persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foully bad of such as notwithstanding be in their own conceit as good as any, when they be called by what names express the truth of their natures and no more, that yet they will presently judge the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a <hi>Railer</hi> and <hi>Reviler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Now for <hi>tumultuary Zeal,</hi> I must confess that <hi>Pharisaical</hi> Hypocrisie is such an abominable provoking thing in the sight of all the Sons of God, that it can scarce fail scorching and heating their tender and lively spirits, no more then a natural flame can fail to swinge and pain our natural flesh; which none of us can suffer with such patience, but we are ready to testifie our sensibleness both by gestures, actions and words. Besides that in a moderate and well-guided zeal against the <hi>Pharisaical</hi> Interest, all being so rotten there, so sore and patched over with pitiful plaisters; the least Action or Opposition will make them cry out, even afore they be hurt, being conscious to themselves how unsound and unable they are to abide the least measure of rough handling. So that the least vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of Opposition in good earnest against their hypocritical and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable waies will by them be deemed but <hi>bitter and tumultuous Zeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eighthly, The just and seasonable bemoanings of the dear servants of God and fellow-members of Christ, when Nature is very much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with adversity or torment, are not to be judged rashly the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes of Impatience or Despair. For the expressing of the sense of ones Misery is no Vice, since the suppressing thereof may be no Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but rather a Symptome of <hi>Pride,</hi> or affectation of <hi>Sparta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. And now in the ninth place, as for that <hi>Aspersion of Madnesse and Phrensy</hi> the true Christian has often cast upon him by the <hi>Pharisaical Religionist,</hi> the Cause of it is plain from either of their natures, or from the nature of <hi>Madness</hi> it self. For as <hi>Sottishnesse</hi> and <hi>Dotage</hi> is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishing of Reason in <hi>Phlegme</hi> or <hi>Cold</hi>; so <hi>Madness</hi> is the disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, discomposing and dissipating the Phansy and Reason in the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of <hi>Heat.</hi> Wherefore, whereever the <hi>Heat</hi> exceeds the Sense and Reason of him that speaks or acts, there comes in so much of <hi>Madnesse</hi> as there is of that Excess. But as concerning <hi>Sense and Reason,</hi> sith it is all one to be absent as not to appear, therefore it must needs follow, that those that speak with much zeal &amp; vigour things very true in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet to others very incredible or unintelligible, must be by them reputed no better then <hi>mad-men.</hi> And hence it was that the Governour told <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>too much learning had made him mad.</hi> And hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably may be the ground of that ordinary saying, <hi>Nullum magnum inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium sine admixtura insaniae.</hi> Partly because no great Wit can well be but with some good measure of natural Heat and Activity of Spirit;
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:55305:228"/>
and partly, or rather mainly, because the improvement of these parts and wit by subtil search into things have produced such Conclusions, so Paradoxical and opposite to the vulgar conceits of men, and yet of such evidence of Reason to the Inventors of them, that they asserting with heat and confidence the Conclusions to be true, to such men as were not capable of the subtilty of the reasons which infer them, could not chuse but get to themselves for their pains the reputation of men whose brains were seasoned with some strinklings at least of <hi>Madnesse and Phrensy.</hi> And according to this analogy may it very well be said, <hi>Nullus insignis Christianus,</hi> &amp;c. That there is no notable Christian that will not seem to have some spice of madness in him, especially if he be judged by the formal stiff <hi>Pharisee,</hi> whose Postures and Actions are alwaies kept as it were in an outward wooden frame, as a childe in a standing stool; his Traditions and accustomary Opinions being as deeply scored and carved in his Memory, as the outward and obvious shows of things at the first sight in the world are scralled out in the rude furrows of an Idiots brain. And as the unskilfull Rustick would suspect him scarce sound in his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that should confidently speak any thing that should palpably cross or cancell those gross scrallings the sensible shew of this world has writ in his Imagination: so certainly the formal <hi>Pharisee</hi> would not stick to judge him mad, that with zeal and boldness pronounced such things that were not parallel nor agreeable to the Preconceptions and Prefigurations of his prejudiced Mind; but most of all if such things as he could get no conception at all of, they being not upon the same levell opposite, but so high removed, that they would be out of his reach of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Surely the more earnest a true member of Christ should be in such points, the more <hi>mad</hi> he would appear in the eyes of the cool pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential <hi>Pharisee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. As for the three last <hi>Aspersions</hi> that were cast on our Saviour, and his true Members are accordingly liable unto, the mere formal Christian being judge, viz. <hi>Debauchery and Looseness of life, Lavishments and Prodigality, Ambition and Self-Interest</hi>; I shall briefly dispatch them all. And to the first this general consideration appertains, By how much every one is weak himself and obnoxious to temptations, by so much more suspicious he is that others transgress, when there is any thing that may tempt out the corruptions of a man; or where there are any Signs or Effects of that which in some persons is naught, though those Signs or Effects in themselves are neither good nor bad. Here the formal Christian consulting with what is alive and operative in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, viz. his inward corruption, judges the best of men after his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; and concludes that how he should be affected, what he should doe or suffer in such or such cases, that any one placed in the same cases and conditions doth suffer or act the like. And the more scandalous and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive must the conversation of the most perfect and purified be, for as much as their Invulnerableness and Insensibleness in the midst of such vanities as others are moved with that are alive unto sin, cannot but make them more innocently free and careless in things that of themselves are not really evil.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="428" facs="tcp:55305:229"/>13. As for the matter of <hi>Prodigality,</hi> it is obvious to conceive that <hi>Covetousness</hi> sitting judge, even <hi>Frugality</hi> it self shall be branded with that name; and that <hi>Covetousness</hi> being so clean and dry and creditable a sin, (as being so perfectly opposite to the mad roaring garb of the Spend-thrift) there will scarce be found a <hi>Pharisee</hi> that will be so imprudent as not to retain so profitable a Vice. Wherefore the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee</hi> being <hi>covetous,</hi> the true Christian, whom that <hi>Noble and Divine nature</hi> according to which he is regenerate has made more <hi>liberal,</hi> must needs by him be sentenced as <hi>Improvident</hi> and <hi>Prodigal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. Lastly, for the imputation of <hi>Ambition and Self-interest.</hi> It is no <hi>Ambition</hi> or <hi>Pride</hi> earnestly to endeavour as much as in us lies to be renewed into that glorious and divine Image of Christ, and to contend to the utmost for the accomplishment of the same. For in this Image is very eminently contained that most healthfull and comely disposition of the Mind, <hi>unaffected Humility.</hi> For whereas the Image of Christ grows not up but from the destruction and (if it were possible) perfect annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of our own stubborn and stout Will, that eagerly and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ever seeks its own satisfaction, and whenever it finds it glories and arrogates to it self the success; it must needs be, by how much more perfectly the true Image of Christ is recovered in us, that by so much the more fully we are freed from all <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Arrogancy.</hi> So that as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the puff of Pride that should drive us on to endeavour after so high a pitch of <hi>Perfection,</hi> but the Divine breath of God in the Soul; no more can that pitch of <hi>Perfection</hi> once attained to be any cause of <hi>Pride,</hi> sith that <hi>Humility</hi> is of the very Essence thereof. For it is as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictious and unreasonable, as if we should say that we become <hi>proud</hi> by becoming <hi>humble.</hi>

As for <hi>Self-interest,</hi> the accusation is of that nature of the Devil's against Job, <hi>Doth Iob serve God for nought?</hi> Men devoid of the Spirit of Righteousness and unacquainted with the Power and Pleasure of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worth and Grace, can phansy nothing there desirable but the external fruits thereof, such as Honour and Esteem among men, or a future Reward from God. Wherefore it must needs be that the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see</hi> or outward <hi>Formalist,</hi> perceiving nothing of pleasure and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Holiness and Vertue in himself, if he observe others much devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto, that he must judge them to make use of those things for some other more pleasant enjoiment, as <hi>Praise</hi> and <hi>Applause,</hi> or a <hi>future Reward</hi>; and that they are not delighted with the things themselves. Whenas certainly a true member of Christ and one really regenerate into his Image, could no more cease from pleasing himself and enjoying himself in the sense and conscience of this <hi>Divine Life,</hi> and the results thereof, all holy and becoming actions, then the Natural man can cease from the enjoiments of the Body, though he knows ere long his Body shall afford him no more enjoiments. And yet I must also add, That it is the next door to an Impossibility, that one that is become thus <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> should not have his Heart fully fraught with the most precious hopes of future Immortality and Glory: <hi>He asked life of thee, and thou gavest him even a long life for ever and ever.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. AND truly this fifth <hi>Gospel-Power, the Passion of Christ,</hi> is of so great efficacy and concernment, that our Saviour seems with more then ordinary delight to have ruminated on the wonderfull effects that it would have in the world. John 12.32. <hi>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me; signifying thereby what death he should die,</hi> as the Text witnesses. This shews what <hi>a powerful Engine</hi> our Saviour himself thought <hi>his Death</hi> would prove to draw all the World after him. Which is a demonstration that the Mind of a Christian ought to dwell very much <hi>in the meditation of the Death and Passion of Christ.</hi> The use whereof appears in another intimation of
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:55305:230"/>
our Saviour's, though more Typical, yet the Analogie is so plain, that no man can miss it. John 3. <hi>And as Moses lifted up the Serpent in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, so shall the Son of man be lifted up; That whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life.</hi> This is so perfect a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of our Saviours Passion, that I cannot but blame my self for not entring it amongst other Prophecies that I alledged for the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi>'s suffering.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And it will still appear more plainly that it was intended a Prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration or Typical Prophecie of Christ, if we consider that <hi>Moses</hi> was not put upon it by any natural skill, as if the Effigies of this Brazen Serpent did by any power of <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> heal the <hi>Israelites</hi> of their bitings of the fiery flying Serpent. But it was an immediate direction of God, by whose supernatural power the cure was wrought: As the Authour of the Book of <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 16.6.</note> Wisdome expresly has noted, namely, <hi>That he that turned towards that</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as he styles it, <hi>the sign of Salvation, was not saved by the thing that he saw, but by him that is the Saviour of all.</hi> For beside that the whole mystery of <hi>Telesmes</hi> is but a superstitious foolery, much-a-kin to and dependent of that groundless Pretence of such wonderfull influences as the ancient Pagan Ignorance attributed to the Stars; the very matter of this Serpent was inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and improper for this Effect, as Interpreters on the place have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. To which I might add that there is not any example of any <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesmes</hi> that were ever known to cure the diseasement after this sort, that is, by only looking thereunto. And that those that have been made against Scorpions or other hurtfull Creatures, they have chaced them out of the place or killed them upon the Spot; but if any one were stung by these venomous Serpents, there was a tactual application of the Remedy to him that was hurt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And yet I will not so much stand upon this, as that the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of <hi>Telesmatical</hi> Preparations is superstitious, and that they have no Effect by any natural Virtue or Influence. This methinks I plainly discover out of their Collections that seem most pleased in the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting of these Curiosities to the eye of the world in their Writings; <hi>Gaffarel</hi> especially, who does with plenty of words, but no reason at all, endeavour to make us believe that the power of <hi>Telesmes</hi> is natural: but I never knew any cause managed with more slight, more loose and more frivolous arguments in my daies. But out of his own mouth I shall be able to condemn him, and upon these two accounts. First, in that according to his own Conjectures and Relations, the erecting and preparing of these <hi>Telesmes</hi> is, as we contend, superstitious or pagani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Religious: and then secondly, That the effects of them, where they have any, are plainly beyond the power of any natural cause.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As for the first, himself does profess that he is of opinion that the first Gods of the <hi>Latines,</hi> which they called <hi>Averrunci</hi> or <hi>Dii Tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lares,</hi> were no other then these <hi>Telesmatical Images.</hi> And his reason is, that they made some of these <hi>Tutelar Gods</hi> under certain Constellations: which is no wonder say I, the Host of heaven being the Deities of the Pagans, &amp; <hi>Telesmes</hi> and <hi>Astrology</hi> both rags of that ancient Superstition.
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:55305:230"/>
And <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus,</hi> who trotted and trudged about the world so much to restore the Heathen Religion, had an excellent gift (if Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians do not belie him) of consecrating <hi>Telesmes</hi> against <hi>Storks, Gnats, Inundations of Rivers, Winds</hi> and <hi>Storms</hi> and other <hi>noxious Things</hi>: Which notwithstanding that nasute Sophist <hi>Philostratus</hi> was willing to omit in his Legend of him, as being very solicitous to save him harmless from the imputation of being a <hi>Magician,</hi> as a man may observe by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral passages in him. So that either way the natural efficacy of <hi>Telesmes</hi> is discovered to be but a figment.</p>
               <p>But that their Formation is but a Paganical Superstition, those more exact Collections and Transcriptions of <hi>Gregory</hi> will further clear, if a man do but peruse them. For there he may see how in the building of Cities they did not only consult the Rules of Astrologie for a fit Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration of the Heavens, but also sacrificed, and that sometime with mans bloud, to the <hi>Genius</hi> of the place, erecting a figure of Brass where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, as they thought, they <hi>Telesmatically</hi> conveyed the <hi>Tutelar Deity</hi> of the City. Which Statue was therefore placed in some safe Recess, or else in some eminent place: but whereever it was, there they conceived was contained the Fate or Fortune of all. Of this sort doubtless was the Trojane <hi>Palladium,</hi> and <hi>the Lame and the Blinde that the soul of David so hated,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. as <hi>Gregory</hi> has with very good reason, I think, concluded.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This is enough to intimate from what Principle these <hi>Telesmatical</hi> Fooleries sprung, let them be of what kind they will. And the <hi>Effects</hi> of them, such as are recorded, are plainly such as cannot be imputed to the power of the Heavens, if we carefully consider the circumstances of things. As for example, what influence from Heaven can be derived upon a City for having the first stone of it, or any one stone of it, laid under such an Aspect? What is this to the whole City that shall be so many months, it may be years, in building afterwards? Besides that I have already demonstrated the whole Artifice of <note n="*" place="margin">Book 7. chap. 15, 16, 17.</note> Astrology to be but a Foppery. So that certainly it is nothing but the Consecration of the City and the Recommendation of it to the Tutelage of a <hi>Daemon.</hi> And though we should admit that the <hi>Telesmatical</hi> Figure of a <hi>Stork</hi> (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) or a <hi>Scorpion</hi> may drive away <hi>Storks</hi> or <hi>Scorpions,</hi> how should the <hi>Telesmatical</hi> Statue of a Man drive away Men, and keep a Fort or Country impregnable from the incursions of the enemy? as the sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Statues did buried in the confines of <hi>Thracia</hi> and <hi>Illyria,</hi> that <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> commanded to be digged up and taken away: upon which those countries within a few daies after were overrun with the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Hunns.</hi> Besides, it is much that the humane Statues should make such a difference as to take part with some men and be against others, when the <hi>Telesma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Figures of other Creatures drive away Creatures only of the same <hi>Species.</hi> Which are things utterly inexplicable from the Laws of Nature.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If there by any Natural Power in these things, it must be from <hi>Similitude:</hi> but it is most ridiculous to think that this <hi>Similitude</hi> has any thing to doe with the Stars. For though there be the name there sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:55305:231"/>
of a <hi>Scorpion,</hi> yet there is no <hi>Scorpion</hi> there nor the Image of one. But if there were any <hi>Antiscorpionical</hi> Power in that Constellation; that Matter or Metall that will receive it at all, will receive it in any other figure as well as in the figure of a <hi>Scorpion,</hi> and in some, it's likely, better. But this Influence, being nothing but some thin particles that must pervade the pores of this Brazen Serpent, can as easily goe out as come in, and will give place to the next influence, and so never be the same. It is simply therefore the <hi>Similitude</hi> of a brazen Scorpion that must drive away the Scorpions: which no man can imagine any reason for, if the experience be true, but the communitie of the <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> and that Instance of one Chord trembling while that which is unisone to it is struck, and of Sympathie in Persons by reason of <hi>Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> and <hi>Cognation</hi>; as in those two young children, brothers, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely like one another, born at <hi>Riez</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who if one were sick, sad, sleepy, the other would be so also. Which are the most plausible reasons that <hi>Gaffarel</hi> alledges for his so-dearly-beloved Conclusion. If therefore Scorpions and Gnats fled from the place upon the making of such a Figure of a Gnat or Scorpion (suppose) in brass or in any other metall, I should think the reason was, because <hi>the Spirit of Nature</hi> being harshly affected in the body of that which has so complete a similitude with such a creature, may in some measure raise an harsh sense in those creatures, and therefore finding themselves in such a place in an unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing temper, they will be sure to keep far enough from it. But if this be a right cause, such a <hi>Telesme</hi> may be made without any regard to the Configuration of the Heavens. Whence again all these <hi>Astrological</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies will be demonstrated to be but Fooleries.</p>
               <p>But I shall demonstrate further that this also is a Foolery, and that there is no <hi>Natural</hi> efficacy at all in <hi>Telesmes,</hi> and that from their own Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story. For either <hi>Gregory</hi> or <hi>Gaffarel</hi> tells us, that if part of a <hi>Telesme</hi> be broken off, the Effect ceases. (Which we might have alledged as an argument that the virtue is in the Figure merely.) And they instance in a <hi>Telesmatical</hi> Crocodile whose chap was broken off; For then the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles returned. Which to me is an Indication that the Effect is not from the <hi>Spirit of Nature,</hi> but from some ludicrous and deceitfull <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> that love to befool Mankind. For if <hi>Telesmatical</hi> Emerods and the <hi>Phallus</hi> work upon those parts, why should not the above-named <hi>Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile</hi> that wanted but a chap work upon all the parts of the Crocodiles but their chaps; which would be diseasement enough to keep them away? And the <hi>Phallus Gregory</hi> mentions, (which he rightly, I think, reckons amongst these <hi>Telesmes</hi>) <hi>cured</hi> or <hi>diseased</hi> the privy parts of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> according as they received the Deity to which they were conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated. From whence a man may conjecture concerning the rest of these Trumperies.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Again, these <hi>Telesmes</hi> are made against such things as have no life nor sense in them, as against <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Water.</hi> Of which the engrave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can have no such similitudes, one would think, as to engage the <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> to act any way; and yet <hi>Gaffarel</hi> tells us a very reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend story of a <hi>Telesme</hi> against <hi>Fire</hi> found under a bridge at <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  <pb n="433" facs="tcp:55305:231"/>
VVhich certainly if it had any <hi>natural</hi> power to preserve the City from great Fires, such as would destroy the Houses, it would also have h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ndred them from lighting their candles at a tinder-box, and warming their fingers in a frosty morning. And yet this curious Philosopher seems to lament the losse of that <hi>Telesme,</hi> they having thereby, as he saies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the City to frequent Scale-Fires ever since. But let the <hi>Telesma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Sculpture of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>VVater</hi> be never so like, insomuch that we may hope that it may affect <hi>the Spirit of Nature</hi> something; there being no sagacity nor sense in the River <hi>Lycus</hi> (suppose) which <hi>Apollonius</hi> curb'd with such a device, nor in Fire now existent, (much lesse that which is to come) how can they <hi>withdraw</hi> themselves from such places where <hi>Telesmes</hi> are laid up, they having not, as Animals have, the power of spontaneous motion?</p>
               <p>Lastly, There are <hi>Telesmes</hi> that have no similitude at all with the things they are to keep off; as that Man on Horseback in brasse set up at <hi>Constantinople</hi> against Pestilential Infection, which (say they) being once demolished, the City has been extraordinarily subject to Plagues and fearful Mortalities. That Ship also of brasse there <hi>Telesmatically</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated against the dangers of that tempestuous Sea, it had no similitude at all of either the Water or VVinde: but yet of such force it was, that a piece of it being broke off and lost, the Sea returned to its former Unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse; but being found and put together, the Sea became quiet again. They took it therefore apieces again, for experience sake, and the Windes and Sea were suddenly rough and boistrous, so that a Ship could not come up into harbour; but the brazen Ship being again hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely compacted, the Windes and Sea were again peacefull and calme.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if a man do but cast an indifferent eye upon the whole matter, it will be very difficult for him not to pronounce, That he that can believe that the power of <hi>Telesmes</hi> is natural, is more irrationally credulous then the most simple <hi>Superstitionist</hi> in the world.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Out of what has been said it is evident that the <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by <hi>Moses</hi> in the Wildernesse was not a <hi>Telesme</hi> in that sense <hi>Gaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farel</hi> would understand the word, that is, a Sculpture, Statue or Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of something made so by Astrological Art, that what Effects it has for the keeping off evil or remedying what has already befallen, is merely from the concurrence of natural causes, though the Application of them was Artificial; the chief whereof is the Influence of the Heavens and the Figure of the <hi>Telesme.</hi> For it is apparent there can be no such. But if they mean by a <hi>Telesme,</hi> such a Figure of some creature consecrated in a way of Religion for the services above-named, nothing hinders but that the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Serpent</hi> may be a <hi>Telesme,</hi> whether from the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifies an <hi>Image,</hi> or from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which denotes <hi>Consecration.</hi> And this of <hi>Moses</hi> was both a warrantable and effectual <hi>Telesme.</hi> For it was by the prescription of God himself, and throughly did the effect it was set up for. But the cures that it did being supernatural, and neither the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure nor the Matter of the Serpent contributing any thing to the healing of them that were bitten by those fiery flying Serpents, it is plain that <hi>Moses</hi> had been left free from making any such <hi>Telesme</hi> of the Figure of
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:55305:232"/>
a Serpent, (there being nothing in the thing it self to invite him to it) had not God moved him thereto. Nor can we imagine any other cause why divine Revelation should suggest such a thing unto him, unlesse there were some mystery in it. Something therefore that did notably concern the Church of God was denoted thereby; and what I was a going to say at first, having removed all obstacles I now again resume and dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, That it was a plain, though Typical, Prophecy of the <hi>Messias</hi> his Passion, and of the use of it, and so clear, that no words could have more punctually prefigured it to us. For the Analogy and Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance is most exquisite, if we cast our eye upon the whole Scene of things.</p>
               <p n="9">9. For how naturally doe the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the Wildernesse represent the Church of Christ in the World; and their being bitten with fiery fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Serpents, our being poisoned and pained with vexatious lusts, and remorse of conscience when sin has entred into our Souls? What could more lively represent our Saviour upon the Crosse, who knowing no sin, yet was made <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 5.21.</note> sin for us, then this <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi> set upon a pole in the Camp of <hi>Israel?</hi> Which indeed had the outward shape of a fiery flying Serpent, but was so far from being a Serpent, that it had nothing of a Serpent but external form thereof, and healed all them that were bit with those poisonous and deadly Serpents. So our blessed Saviour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void of Sin himself, yet being in the most ugly outward appearance of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse that could be put upon him (he suffering betwixt two criminal Malefactors,<note place="margin">Isa. 53.12.</note> as it was prophesied of him, <hi>that he should be numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the transgressors</hi>) he is in this posture (where he looks so like Sinfulnesse it self) unto the whole Church of God, when they are smitten with the fiery excitements of Sin, or the deadly pangs or remorse of Conscience, those rancorous wounds that Sin leaves in the Soul when she has been once bitten therewith, he is, I say, thus hanging upon the Crosse, if they look upon him with the eye of Faith, the most soveraign Remedy and the most presentaneous asswagement of their Pain and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady that can be offered to the thoughts of men, I am sure, of any hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and well-meaning man.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But for those that are self-conceited, of a perverse Reason, and of an high-flown <hi>Luciferian</hi> Temper, that prefer the subtilty of their own opinionated Wit and curious search into all secrets, and magnifie their own natural Worth before the Friendship of him that loved us even to the death; these men are not fit Relishers of the Sweetnesse of that abundant Goodnesse and kinde Condescension of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his manifestation of Jesus Christ to the world: as neither the fiery <hi>Enthusiast,</hi> filled with the sense of his own foolish Revelations and Divine Visitations (as he phansies them,) so stout, so stiffe, and so perfect (as the flatteries of his own Imagination would bear him in hand) that he findes nothing but God and himself worth thinking of, and will be an immediate Reteiner to the Almighty, without any Interposal whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. To that height and hardnesse is he swollen in his own conceit. But the true Character of him is that which the Apostle <hi>Iude</hi> has given him, that he is but a mouth <hi>filled with great swelling words, puffed up, sensual,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:55305:232"/>
knowing not the Spirit.</hi> Such as these are those in too great a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that wholly neglect <hi>the meditation on Christs Passion,</hi> though it be of so great efficacy for the quenching and suppressing of all the restlesse and fiery motions of Sin in them. But execrable Blasphemers are they, whose Pride and Conceitednesse has made them reproach the person of Christ in his highest Agonies on the Crosse, and impute that to a sinful weaknesse and imperfection, that was but the due effect of the weight of his Sufferings, who bore the Sins of the whole world, and made an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onement with God for them. Yet because he cryed out in the words of that Psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 22.</note> which is a lively Prophecie of his Sufferings, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> therefore must that Fanatick Fool of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and his illuminate Elders, that boast so much of <hi>Perfection,</hi> be more perfect then the Son of God himself, whose certain appearance in the World is so clearly demonstrated out of the ancient Prophecies of the Old Testament, and so manifestly ratified by the Miracles recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the New.</p>
               <p n="11">11. I appeal to all men if <hi>Satan</hi> himself could vent any thing more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spightful and scornful against the endearing sufferings of our ever-blessed Saviour, who out of tender love to Mankind underwent those dreadful agonies of Death, and waded through the heavy wrath of God for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, then these Wretches have, that would recommend themselves to the VVorld under the false Flourish and Hypocritical Title of <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Love</hi>; whereas by antiquating the use of the <hi>Passion of Christ,</hi> and thus villainously reproaching Christ upon the Crosse, they demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate to all the world, that they have not the least sense or skill in so <hi>Divine a Mystery,</hi> but are wicked <hi>Apostates</hi> from God, who is that pure and Divine Love, and Underminers of the Kingdome of his Son Jesus Christ: In which neither such high-flown <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> nor any dry churlish <hi>Reasoners</hi> and <hi>Disputers</hi> shall have either part or portion, till they lay down those Gigantick humours, and become (as our Saviour Christ, who is the unerring Truth, has prescribed) <hi>like little Children</hi>; for <hi>of such as these onely is the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. <hi>1.</hi> The End of Christs Sufferings not onely to pacifie Conscience, but to root out Sin; witnessed out of the Scripture. <hi>2.</hi> Further Testimonies to the same purpose. <hi>3.</hi> The Faintnesse and Uselesnesse of the Allegory of <hi>Christs Passion</hi> in comparison of the Application of the History thereof. <hi>4.</hi> The Application of Christs Sufferings against Pride and Covetousnesse. <hi>5.</hi> As also against Envy, Hatred, Revenge, vain Mirth, the Pangs of Death, and unwarrantable Love. <hi>6.</hi> A General Application of the Death of Christ to the mortifying of all Sin whatsoever. <hi>7.</hi> The celebrating the Lords Supper, the use and meaning thereof.</head>
               <p n="1">1. BUT that this is <hi>the meaning of Christs Sufferings,</hi> that is, That we should also suffer in the Flesh, and mortifie our sinfull mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, besides what our Saviour himself has intimated in comparing himself to <hi>the Brazen Serpent</hi> in the VVildernesse, the sight whereof did not onely asswage the pain of them that were bitten, but take away the poison, (whence we may reasonably conclude, that the looking on Christ on the Crosse is not onely to heal the Stings of Conscience upon sin committed, but to destroy the Poison and corruption of Sin out of us, that we may not sin any more) is plain, in that the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves also do urge the Use of <hi>Christ Crucified</hi> to both those ends and purposes. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> 1 Epist. chap. 2. <hi>My little Children, these things write I unto you that you sin not. But if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Iesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our sins.</hi> But <hi>this use</hi> of the Crosse, namely, <hi>Propitiation and the Peace of Conscience,</hi> all men catch at. There is more need of producing such places as shew the <hi>other use</hi> thereof, for <hi>the Mortification of our sins.</hi> That of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Epist. chap. 4. is very expresse. <hi>For asmuch therefore as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm your selves likewise with the same minde: for he that hath suffered in the flesh, hath ceased from sin; That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh, to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. For the time past of our lives may suffice to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lust, excesse of wine, revelling, banquettings and abominable Idolatries.</hi> To which sense he speaks at least as fully, Chap. 2. ver. 19. <hi>For this is thank-worthy, if a man for conscience towards God endure grief, suffering wrongfully. For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an Example, that we should follow his steps; Who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth; who when he was reviled, reviled not again, when he suffered, threatned not, but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously; who his own self bare our sins in his own Body on the tree, that we being dead to Sin, should live unto Righteousnesse; by whose stripes we are healed. For ye were as Sheep going astray, but are now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Shepherd and Bishop of your Souls.</hi> What can war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:55305:233"/>
the use of the Crosse for the cure of sins more plainly then this?</p>
               <p n="2">2. But we will hear also what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> chap. 2. ver. 11. <hi>This is a faithful saying, If we be dead with Christ, then shall we also live with him; if we suffer, we shall also reign with him; if we deny him, he will also deny us.</hi> This is most certainly true as well of <hi>inward Mortification</hi> as of <hi>outward trouble</hi>; and the mention of <hi>the death of Christ</hi> is to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our Spirits in the enduring of both. And <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. ver. 10. <hi>That I may know Christ, and the power of his Resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death</hi>; viz. That as Christ died upon the Crosse, so he might be crucified to the world and all the vain Lusts thereof: and those that walk otherwise, he cannot but proclaim them <hi>enemies to the Crosse of Christ, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is their shame, who minde earthly things,</hi> ver. 18. And Galat. 6.14. <hi>But God forbid that I should glory save in the Crosse of our Lord Iesus Christ, by which the world is crucified to me, and I unto the world</hi>; that is, The world is but a dead spectacle to me, my affections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead to it. I will close all with that excellent place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Know ye not that as many of us as were baptized into the Lord Iesus Christ, were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme into death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newnesse of life. For if we have been planted together in the likenesse of his death, we shall be also in the likenesse of his Resurrection. Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroied, that henceforth we might not serve sin. For he that is dead, is freed from sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. You see how the most urgent Exhortations of the Apostles to kill and overcome our Lusts are back'd and edged, if you will, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion upon the Crucifixion of our Saviour. Which allusion, if it were no more then that odde perverse Sect (which I have so often named) would make it, (who desire to <hi>allegorize</hi> away the whole History of Christ to a mere Fable, as if it were nothing but a mere fictitious Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of things to be morally transacted in us) truly the Argument were nothing. For the death of a Ram or a Goat would serve to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the sacrificing of our sensual Lusts, rather better then the death of Christ, who was so innocent a person. But the stress of the Argument lyes in this, That a person not onely so immaculate and innocent, but so holy and sacred, so honourable and Divine; that the Son of the living God, declared so from Heaven, foretold evidently by the mouths of the most infallible Prophets, and that at the distance of so many Ages, and undeniably demonstrated to be such by his own Miracles, and by that Miracle of Miracles, his Resurrection from the dead, and his visible Ascension into Heaven in the eyes of his Disciples; that this so noble and Divine a Person, that this Son of God should in dear Compassion and Love to Mankinde give himself up, not onely to a poor despicable beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly life, but be contented to be whipped and scourged, and put to a death both painful and shameful with Thieves and Malefactors, and this merely to atone the wrath of God, and open the gates of Heaven to
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:55305:234"/>
bewildred mankind that were wandring further and further from their primeval Happiness; This is such an Argument as would melt the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Heart; and awake the dullest Understanding into a quick and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful apprehension of that duty that so nearly concerns him, viz. to be, if it were possible, more resolvedly willing to die to all his sins and worldly vanities, then Christ was to lay down his life to redeem him from them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>This mighty Power of the Death of Christ</hi> is of such invincible effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to them that will but seriously dwell upon the Meditation thereof, that no strong hold of Sin will be able to resist it; no evil and inordinate affection, but the consideration of this <hi>Passion</hi> will calm, keep under, and utterly subdue. The very counting <hi>the circumstances of his Sufferings</hi> will put us out of conceit even with those Vices that we have most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly entertained, and still all those Perturbations and Disquietnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Minde that the crossest accidents of the World and our own Weakness can expose us to. Art thou <hi>a lover of money?</hi> how canst thou abstain from blushing, whilst thou remembrest that <hi>Covetousnesse</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied and sold thy Saviour for thirty pieces of Silver? or refrain from communicating <hi>thy goods</hi> to the poor, when Christ has been so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal of <hi>his bloud</hi> for thee? Art thou <hi>proud?</hi> how canst thou but be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to exalt thy self, when the onely-begotten Son of God took upon him the form of a Man, yea of the lowest sort of men, and humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the reproachful death of the Crosse,<note place="margin">Philip. 2.5. 1 Pet. 4.1.</note> that he might teach us <hi>Humility, that the same minde might be in us that was in him,</hi> as the Apostle speaks? Art thou neglected, scorned, or reviled? Thy Saviour was buffetted, mocked and spit upon. Are thy Inferiours preferred before thee? <hi>Barabbas</hi> was held a more worthy person then <hi>Iesus.</hi> Are thy friends false to thee? Christ was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied by <hi>Iudas</hi> with a kisse. Dost thou fall from, or fall short of thy expected honours? <hi>Iesus</hi> wore no earthly Crown but that of Thorns, nor Scepter but a Reed, nor any Robe but such as the abusive Souldiers put on him to make legs to him and mock him. Art thou traduced for one as not sound in thy Religion? Thy Saviour was accused as <hi>a Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer.</hi> What motion therefore or disturbance of <hi>Pride</hi> shall be able to disquiet thy minde, if thou do but reflect on thy Saviours Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings?</p>
               <p n="5">5. And for <hi>Envy, Hatred and Revenge,</hi> how canst thou harbour the least touch or sense of them, while thou lookest upon him who out of love laid down his life for us, even then when we were Enemies to him, yea, for those very persons that crucified him, praying unto God for them,<note place="margin">Luk. 23.34.</note> 
                  <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do?</hi> And if thou be transportable into <hi>vain Mirth,</hi> what can better calm that giddy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per then the remembrance of <hi>his Sadnesse,</hi> whose Soul was sorrowful even unto death? And if the highest and most searching <hi>Afflictions</hi> attempt thee, what can more strongly arm thy <hi>Patience,</hi> then if thou ruminate on that bitter cup, the consideration whereof put thy Saviour into such an Agony, that he sweat drops of bloud that fell down to the ground? And lastly, if <hi>Lust</hi> and <hi>Wantonness</hi> do assault thy Soul, the most present
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:55305:234"/>
Remedy is the contemplation of thy dying Lord and Master, who with his out-stretched arms on the Crosse to embrace thee, presents himself a Corrival in thy strongest Affections. Look upon his inclined Head, not crowned with roses but wounded with thorns; view his half-closed Eyes, heretofore filled and beautified with lucid Spirits, whose milde motions were the perpetual Interpreters of his Kindness and Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Sons of men, but now overcast with the heavy cloud of Death. Kisse his cold and pale Lips, and receive his last breath, and tell me if thou didst not hear this whisper in it, <hi>Canst thou love any thing better then me, who out of love do undergo this painfull and reproachfull death for thee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. But what I have appropriated to this foolish Passion of <hi>Wantonnesse,</hi> may equally take place in <hi>any inordinate affection</hi>; and our Saviour may justly expostulate how unkindly, how ungrateful he is dealt with, when his pretended Disciples refuse to mortifie any <hi>lust</hi> whatsoever for him, who gave up <hi>himself</hi> to death for them. This consideration is so ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and convictive, that none that have the least spark of Ingenuity can be able to resist it. And therefore whatever conceited high-flown Fools may imagine of <hi>the Cross of Christ and the meditation of his Crucifixion,</hi> as a thing that may rather fit Children in Christianity then grown men; I say, it is <hi>the great Power of God to Salvation</hi>: and so long as a man findes any sin in him, he is to have recourse to it for his cure, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the Wildernesse, as often as they were bit with the fiery flying Serpents, were to look up unto the Brazen Serpent which <hi>Moses</hi> had erected in their Camp. And those that make no use of the benefit thereof, I should suspect them to be no <hi>Israelites,</hi> but a gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ration of <hi>Vipers</hi> or <hi>Serpents</hi> themselves, to whom the poison of Sin is so congenerous, that it is their nature and pleasure, no pain at all to them; so that they desire no cure, but flee from the Crosse, as <hi>Scorpions</hi> do quit the place where a <hi>Telesme</hi> is erected against them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But our Saviour Christ knew <hi>the power and efficacy of his Passion</hi> so well, that he made a speciall provision for the <hi>Commemoration</hi> of that often which it was fit he should suffer but once. This we usually call the <hi>Eucharist</hi> or <hi>the holy Communion.</hi> A Solemnity never to be antiquated, till our Saviour return again to judgement visibly in the clouds of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> intimateth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>For as often as you eat this bread or drink this cup, you do shew the Lords death till he come.</hi> For the solid use of it cannot cease till then when all is accomplished. For so long as men are to have any growth in Godlinesse, or are to animate themselves to any holy designes, or sin is to be encountred with, or thanks to be given for the victories of the Cross, the holy <hi>Eucharist</hi> cannot possibly cease.</p>
               <p>For the most proper <hi>Preparation</hi> for the receiving of the Sacrament is <hi>a serious Meditation on the Passion of Christ,</hi> which is <hi>commemorated</hi> therein. The consideration whereof, what mighty power and efficacy it has for the vanquishing and subduing of all manner of sins and corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, I have given sufficient intimation. So that every Celebration of the Communion should be as it were a repeated Resolution and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborated
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:55305:235"/>
Conspiracy in the bloud of the New Covenant, to do our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most against all the Powers of Sin, of Darkness, and of the Devil; and this upon the sense of that great Love and Loialty we owe to our dear Saviour and Soveraign <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who died for us, and poured out his own bloud to glue and cement us to himself and to one another. So that the Mystery of Christian Religion is a Mystery of the deepest and dearest Friendship, and of the most indissoluble Union of Affection that can possibly be excogitated. Wherein neither Distance of Place nor Time can make any division, but it holds together Heaven and Earth, and bindes what is past to what is present, and actuates and invigorates what is present, to a prosperous and successful bringing on that which is to come. Thus it is with all those that are true Christians, and do really communicate in the bloud of Christ; They have one Minde and one Heart, they have one Vote and one Interest, which is the Advancement of the Kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ in the world in Truth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and that Christian Peace, Faith and Love may flourish even to the ends of the Earth.</p>

                  <hi>and brought Life and Immortality to light through the Gospel.</hi> For truly what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Traditions there were amongst the <hi>Iewish Rabbins,</hi> whatever <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions</hi> or <hi>Conclusions</hi> amongst the Philosophers, whether <hi>Platonists</hi> or <hi>Aristoteleans,</hi> concerning the <hi>Soul's Immortality,</hi> they were either so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and fallacious in themselves, or so subtil and unintelligible to the People, that they could not satisfie the World concerning this so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a matter. And if a man should write never so accurately and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictically of this point, the use thereof would reach but to a few, namely such as are of a very patient and comprehensive Spirit, that have leisure and take delight in perusing of subtil and close-wrought contextures of Reason; which to most men is a toilsome and tedious thing. And when a man has writ and read all he can of this Subject, and has met with the very best and most Demonstrative arguments for the Conclusion; yet
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:55305:235"/>
for use and service, the Recollection of them is voluminous and cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, as well as the Collections from them doubtful and fallible, at least to them that are not fully masters of their Reason. But as the <hi>Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Ascension</hi> of our Saviour is certain, as known to be <hi>de facto</hi> by abundance of Witnesses; so is the Remembrance and Representation of it to our mindes at once, and strikes strong upon our Phansie, and reaches our Reason with that powerful conviction, that believing this, we cannot any longer doubt of either <hi>the Existence of God,</hi> or <hi>our own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</hi> And if we once be but well assured of <hi>the Existence of God</hi> and of <hi>our own Immortall state after this Life,</hi> methinks this alone should be able to lift us above all the Snares that Satan has laid in this World to entangle us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Mortality,</hi> one would think, if well considered, might give us some check from too eager pursuit of Honours and Riches, from worldly Plots and Designes, as also (for fear of diseases that accelerate death) from over-lavish Indulgence to Sensuality and Intemperance. But the <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of a Life to come,</hi> the condition whereof shall be such as our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour here layes the seeds of, whether for <hi>Happinesse</hi> or <hi>Misery,</hi> and that in a measure unspeakably above what happens, or can happen in this life; this consideration must have such virtue in it, if we duly meditate upon it, that it should win us with all willingnesse to forsake all the unlawful Pleasures and Projects of this transient World, to get some sure Interest in that which is to come, and not to trust all in one bottom, if any thing at all, I mean in the leaking vessel of this mortal Body, which is ever and anon ready to sink or topple over, and so to drown all the hopes we placed in it. Wherefore, as ye heard out of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whenas if they go out foul and impure, their Reception must be accordingly, they being given up into the power of those deformed Fiends of Hell, the very thoughts of whose sight and company might be enough to affright any man that is not Atheistically sortish from assimilating himself to those nasty Gaol-birds by repeated acts of Vice and Wickedness. Besides what smart of punishment shall reach both their outward Senses and guilty Consciences by the inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table rod of God's Justice upon them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. VVherefore it is most indispensably rational, <hi>to use this VVorld as if we used it not,</hi> and to addict our selves to such Pleasures as are most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the other State; such as are those most delicious touches &amp; senses of the Divine Love, or that pure and intellectual Affection which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Charity:</hi> VVhereby we delight in the good of another, as if it were our own; whereby we rejoice in the wisdome &amp; goodness of God displai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Creatures; whereby we ardently desire the advancement of the Kingdom of Christ infinitely before any private advantage whatsoever, and do faithfully assist and earnestly expect the joyful accomplishment and finishing of the great Mystery of Godliness in the fullest period

thereof, to a final Triumph over Sin and Satan, and a perfect Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Church of Christ into the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. These are the warrantable Pleasures of the Soul that has a designe upon the Life to come,<note place="margin">Colos. 3.1.</note> of a Soul that is risen with Christ, and therefore seeks those things that are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. And upon this very consideration the Apostle enforceth his Exhortation, <hi>Colos.</hi> 3. <hi>Mortifie therefore your members which are upon earth, Fornication, Uncleannesse, inordinate Affection, evil Concupiscence, and Covetousness which is Idolatry.</hi> And our Saviour in his Sermon on the Mount, <hi>Lay not up for your selves treasures upon Earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for your selves treasures in Heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</hi> And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> professes of himself (and exhorts others to imitate him) that his minde is wholly taken up with those things which are above, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Brethren, be followers of me, and mark them that walk so as ye have us for an example.

And if it were <hi>Conditional,</hi> as this of the Kingdome of Heaven is, we may easily conceive how much he were concerned to have a care punctually to observe the <hi>Conditions</hi> propounded, or earnestly to endeavour to get such <hi>Qualifications</hi> as that he may not forfeit the enjoiment of that Fortune which otherwise would naturally fall to his share. And how they are to be qualified that are to be Heires of that everlasting Inheritance, the Scripture doth plainly set out;<note place="margin">Revel. 21.27.</note> there must no <hi>unclean thing</hi> enter into the <hi>Holy City.</hi> None can be <hi>Heirs of this Kingdome</hi> but the <hi>sons of God,</hi> nor any be the <hi>sons of God</hi> but those that are <hi>led by the Spirit of God, Rom.</hi> 8.

<pb n="443" facs="tcp:55305:236"/>
Happiness</hi> is to the Believer, to make him endeavour to the utmost to be Partaker of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and to aspire to a due measure of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, without which we shall necessarily be frustrate of our expected Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. The consideration whereof cannot but wean him from all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant desires of the <hi>Pleasures, Profits</hi> or <hi>Honours</hi> of this World.

               <p n="1">1. WE come now to the Seventh and last Power of the Gospel, which is <hi>The consideration of the dreadful Solemnity of the Day of Iudgement</hi>; the very mention whereof from the mouth of <hi>Paul</hi> made <hi>Felix</hi> the Governour to tremble. And I must confess it is so hard an Engine, that it is more fit to beat upon the obdurate hearts of the Unbeliever and Unregenerate, that are crusted over with Iron and Flint, then for battery against the truly Regenerate and sincere Believers; for those other Powers of the Gospel are more proper and abundantly suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for carrying them on with courage and constancy in the waies of God. But there is in <hi>the Day of Iudgement</hi> an Object not misbeseeming their most serious thoughts; which is the perfecting and finishing of the Redemption of the Godly.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.51.</note> 
                  <hi>VVe shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</hi> and that for the better. For whatever is mortal, then shall put on Immortality; and none of the Saints shall be worse clothed then in a Body of an Heavenly and Aethereal consistence. This is that incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:55305:237"/>
crown of Glory, of Life and of Righteousness, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles mention, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly declares to be laid up for him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>that day,</hi> namely, the <hi>Day of Iudgement; Which the Lord the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Iudge shall give him at that day,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.8.</note> 
                  <hi>and not to him alone, but to all those that love his appearing:</hi> that is to say, Whose affections and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences are so sincere, that they longingly expect when he will consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and finish the happinesse of his Church; and should be so far from fear, that their hearts would exult for joy, to hear the sound of the Trump, and see the Sky grow bright by the overspreading of his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Camp in the Air.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Meditation therefore reaching as well the unconverted as the converted, it had been ill omitted of us. And that it may take the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter effect, we are to suggest what will be able to break down or prevent such false and foolish Fortifications as the Minde of man may rear up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, to bear off the powerful Assaults it makes upon his Soul and Conscience. These are chiefly two. The one, the long Intervall of time from hence to that Day, which makes the terrour thereof little, as things seem lesse the farther they are removed from our eyes. The second is, the hope that within so long a space they may have time to repent and be converted, though they live as they lift in this life: For they may prepare themselves for that Day in the other life which is to come. But to the first I answer, That the approach of this Day is very uncertain, (by reason of the obscurity of Prophecies and of the very Completions of them) and is left so, for the present exercise of the good, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual vexation of the wicked both in this state of things and that which is to come. His appearance therefore will be sudden like a Comet or blazing-Star, which no man could tell when it would first appear; but more terrible and minacious by farre, not threatning the death of this or that Prince, or the change of this or that State, but the overturning of all States and Kingdoms, and the burning up the Earth with all the Works and Inhabitants thereof with unquenchable Fire. And that evil which a man does not know but may begin to morrow, if duely thought upon, cannot seem at a great distance, but near at hand, and ready to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the other I answer, That he that wilfully rejects the offers of Grace and Opportunities of becoming holy and good in <hi>This life,</hi> he shall have no more priviledge in the other then the Devils themselves have, who, as S <hi>Iude</hi> expresly tels us, <hi>are reserved in everlasting chains of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse unto the Iudgement of the great Day</hi>; who shall then inevitably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the Fate of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> who <hi>are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal Fire.</hi> And what manner of Persons these are, <hi>Iude</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> have both very graphically described: such as had totally evaded all obligation to true <hi>Holinesse</hi> and <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> and were of an impure and foul conversation, <hi>Filthy dreamers, defiling the Flesh, despising Dominion, and speaking evil of Dignities; Followers of Balaam, perverting the truth for a reward; Spots in the Christian Societies, feeding themselves without fear; Clouds without water, blown about with every winde of false doctrine; Fruitless Trees; Raging waves of the Sea foa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:55305:237"/>
out their own shame; Wandring Starres to whom is reserved the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of darkness for ever.</hi> No more hope of them therefore then of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi> and his accursed <hi>Accomplices.</hi> And S. <hi>Peter</hi> pronounces the same sentence of them,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.10, 14, 17.</note> for they are plainly the same persons, namely, bold and daring spirits, arrogant and self-conceited, despising government and reproaching authority; such as <hi>speaking great swelling words of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, allure through the lusts of the flesh, in much wantonnesse, those that were clean escaped from them that live in errour; Day-rioters, having their eyes full of adultery, that cannot cease from sin,</hi> or forbear the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending of <hi>the liberty thereof</hi> to others, but <hi>beguile unstable souls; Having their hearts exercised with</hi> crafty and <hi>covetous practises; Wells with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out water; Clouds carried about with Tempests, adjudged to utter darkness for ever.</hi> For with the Devils <hi>they are cast down into Hell, and delivered up</hi> even as they <hi>to chains of darknesse, to be reserved to the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. So that there is no more hope of such impenitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that have laid waste their Consciences, and wilfully neglected or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted the manifold convictions, clear illuminations, and frequent offers of Grace and Assistance from the dispensations of the Gospel, after this life, then there is of those old Apostates, the wicked spirits that are kept as Prisoners in Hell, till that fearful and terrible Day of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That Day of the Lord</hi> wherein all unbelieving Flesh shall tremble, and every Face gather blackness. For this will prove <hi>a day of Wrath</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>a day of Anguish and Distresse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zeph. 1.15.</note> 
                  <hi>a day of Devastation and Desolate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, a day of Darknesse and of Gloominesse, a day of Clouds and of thick Darknesse; a day of the Trumpet and Alarm against the fenced Cities and the high Towers,</hi> not of <hi>Iudah</hi> only, but against all the Nations of the Earth. For the Lord himself will descend from Heaven to revenge him of his Enemies.<note place="margin">Wisd. 5.17.</note> 
                  <hi>He shall take to him his Iealousie for compleat Armour, and turn the whole Creation into weapons of his displeasure. His severe wrath shall be sharpened for a sword, and the World shall fight with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the unwise. Then shall the right-aiming Thunderbolts go abroad, and from the Clouds as from a well-drawn Bow shall they fly to the mark. And hail-stones of wrath shall be cast as out of a Stone-bow, and the waters of the Sea shall boil and rage against them, and hot scalding Flouds shall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow them and drown them:</hi> and they shall be blown about with fiery Windes, and wearied out with the whirlwinde, and they shall have no Peace nor Solace for ever. The Moon and Stars shall withdraw their shining, and the Sun shall be turned into bloud. For nothing but Mists and Fogs and Stench, nothing but sulphureous Vapours, smoring Heat, dark Clouds charged with horrid Thunder and Lightning, immense Earthquakes and innumerable Eruptions of subterraneous Flames, crackling <hi>Volcanoes,</hi> smoaking Mountains, high flakes and tortuous streams of Fire from burning Forrests and Woods, lowd Shreeks and howlings of affrighted Men and Beasts, grim and grisly Apparitions, deep and dreadful Groans of tormented Ghosts; nothing but such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable Objects as these shall fill up the Scene of the Earth and Air, when once that <hi>Final Vengeance</hi> has seised upon the Wicked.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="446" facs="tcp:55305:238"/>5. This is the sad <hi>Evening-close</hi> of that terrible Day of the Lord; and the Morning-Appearance thereof will not be much more chearful to either the Hypocrite or Prophane person. For the hopes of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite cannot but fail, and his heart sink like a stone, while he sees the righteous Judge that tries the heart and reins coming in the clouds of Heaven to execute vengeance on the wicked, and to deliver the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from that imminent fate that attends the Earth. And the proud scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing <hi>Epicurean</hi> that laugh'd at Religion as a piece of weakness and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, and impudently denied there was either God or Providence in the world, he will then to his utter shame and confusion acknowledge <hi>his own Philosophy,</hi> which he thought such an high piece of wit before, the most unhappy Folly and Madnesse he could have light upon. For he shall be confuted to his very outward Senses, when he shall see Christ himself appear with all his Heavenly Host attending him; when he shall hear the sound of the Trump, and see forthwith the whole Air filled with his glittering Legions consisting of Saints and Angels. <hi>For the Trump shall sound,</hi> saith the Apostle, and then those that have already departed this life shall immediatly appear in their celestial Harness, in their <hi>glorified bodies.</hi> For those that are alive shall not prevent those that are dead, but rather the contrary. For those that sleep in Jesus will God bring with him, and harness them with the bright Armour of Life and Immortality, whereby they become part of that glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Host wherewith our dread Soveraign and blessed Saviour Jesus Christ will face the Earth a while, to the exceeding great astonishment and terrour os the wicked World.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Out of which by the Ministry of his Angelical Troops will he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Saints that are found alive in the flesh from all the corners of the Earth, as the Angels plucked <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> when the City was to be destroyed with Fire and Brimstone from Heaven; a Type question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less of this Final Judgement. And whether it be by the quick descent of fiery Chariots, like that of <hi>Elias,</hi> who was safely thereby conveighed to Heaven, and about a thousand years after conversed with our Saviour on the Mount; or bright shining clouds, glistering with the glory and lustre of their celestial guides, be made foot-stools for them to get up on (for there is no fear that the weight of their Bodies should break through, their Earth and Flesh being of a sudden changed into pure <hi>Aether</hi>;) or whatever other pomp and solemnity there may be in their transportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the rest of the World unto that glorious Company that strikes all mens eyes with amazement, while they look up into the sky; This visible Selection of the Good from the Bad must needs fill the hearts of the Wicked with unspeakable Dread and Horrour.</p>
               <p>And that partly by reason of the present wonders of this unexpected supernatural Visitation, which thus suddenly has surprised them through unbelief; and partly from the sad presage of what will follow, even that horrid and dismal Tempest which we have already described, that end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Night of Thunders and Lightnings and Earthquakes, of roarings and howlings and utter confusion and destruction for ever.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Which direful vengeance having once entred upon that execrable
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:55305:238"/>
crue, forsaken of God and given up to the merciless Rage of the incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Elements, the victorious Church of Christ retreats with the rest of the Angelical Hosts, marching up the Ethereal Regions in goodly Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and lovely Equipage, filling as they go along the re-echoing sky with Songs of Joy and Triumph. For this is <hi>the greatest day of Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the highest Festival</hi> that can be celebrated in the Heavens; whose Inhabitants if they rejoice at the conversion of <hi>one sinner,</hi> what Joy and Rejoicing must they express at the complete <hi>Redemption</hi> of <hi>the whole Church?</hi> when Jesus Christ the Prince of our Salvation, <hi>who is able to save to the</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 7.25.</note> 
                  <hi>utmost,</hi> has perfectly redeemed us body and soul, and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Captivity captive, rescuing us from the power of Hell, Death and the Devil, does resettle us again in our own Land, and reestablish us into the ancient Liberties of the Sons of God, making us fellow-citizens with the pure and unpolluted Angels, and free Partakers of all the Rights and Immunities of the celestial Kingdom; even of that Kingdom where there is Order and Government without Envy and Oppression, Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without Superstition, Beauty without Blemish, Love without Lust, Sweetness without Satiety; where there is outward Splendidness with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Pride, Musick without Harshness, Friendship without Designe, Wisedom without Wrinkles, and Wit without Vain-glory; where there is Kindnesse without Craft, Activity without Weariness, Health with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sickness, and Pleasure without Pain; and lastly, where there is the Vision of God, the Society of <hi>Christ,</hi> the Familiarity of Angels, and Communion of Saints; where there is Love and Joy and Peace and Life for evermore.</p>
               <p>Upon the consideration of which ineffable Happiness, what inference can be more genuine then what S. <hi>Paul</hi> has made already on the same Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? <hi>Wherefore,</hi>

               <p n="1">1. I Have now sufficiently exposed to your view <hi>the Nature and Use of this seven-fold Engine,</hi> these <hi>Seven Powers of the Gospel,</hi> how potent they are to beat down every strong hold of sin, and to raise up <hi>the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life</hi> and Spirit of Righteousness in us. That they have done so little execution in Christendom hitherto, that disquisition I shall deferre
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:55305:239"/>
till its due place. In the mean time I appeal to all the World if there can be invented a Religion more powerful for this purpose then the Christian Religion is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But for the <hi>external</hi> Triumphs of the <hi>Divine Life</hi> in reference to <hi>the Person of Christ,</hi> the <hi>Usefulness</hi> of our Religion in that point is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable not only from the <hi>Frame</hi> thereof in it self, but from the long and constant <hi>Effects</hi> it has had in the Christian World. For as for <hi>the Frame of our Religion,</hi> we have therein a full warrant to do the highest Divine homage to Christ that we can express; He being so clearly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in declared <hi>The true Son of God,</hi> not only by several Testimonies from Heaven, but also by that supernatural manner of his generation in the womb of the Virgin by the overshadowing of the Holy Ghost, by his mysterious union with the Eternal Word, by his miraculous Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the dead, and by his visible Ascension into Heaven, and Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion now at the right hand of his Father. This is warrant enough to do all <hi>Divine homage</hi> to our blessed Saviour, as to <hi>the only-begotten Son of God.</hi> And truly the Church, to give them their due, has not been spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; the very constitution of our Religion being so effectual for this purpose. For so Divine a Person as Christ was, namely, <hi>The very Son of God,</hi> and yet condescending to undergoe so horrid a death for the World; how could engaged Mankind stint themselves from shewing of all manner of expressions of Love and Devotion toward him?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wherefore they erected innumerable magnificent Structures of Temples, Chappels, and other Religious Edifices, and consecrated them to his Name: They endowed the Christian Priesthood with ample Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Dignities; set up Church-musick, sung divine Anthems in honour of our Saviour, adorned their Churches, celebrated his Passion with unexpressible reverence, instituted Festivals, and filled both Time and Place with such variety of Ornaments, that a man might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that the greatest part of the Splendour and Pomp of Christendom was in reference to their Religion. Which certainly would have been a very goodly and lovely spectacle, if <hi>Superstition, Hypocrisie,</hi> and <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick Tyranny</hi> could have been kept out.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But this <hi>External Worship</hi> and the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> thereof, things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually performable by the evil and the good, by the regenerate and mere natural man, these took growth enormously, and like ranck Weeds choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Corn: or, what happens in full and over-fed bodies, in which natural heat and activity is very much lost, the huge load and bulk of <hi>visible Formalities</hi> extinguished the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But however <hi>this outward Homage to our Saviour</hi> continued and does continue in a great measure over the face of Christendom to this very day, though their expressions are not alike courtly every where. Which continuation of <hi>Divine Honour</hi> done unto him cannot but gratifie his faithfully-devoted Servants, they having a deep resentment of <hi>the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sufferings</hi> their Lord and Master underwent out of his dear love to them; and therefore do naturally rejoyce at this Tribute of Divine Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:55305:239"/>
the World gives to so holy and sacred a Person, it being so suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a part of compensation of his Humiliation and Reproach. Besides that they receive some satisfaction, that Divine Providence has so brought it about touching the true Members of Christ, whose Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are so opposite to the Guise of the world, and their Persons so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, that yet the World are fain with the lowest prostrations to adore that in Christ, which they kick about and trample upon so in his despised Members.</p>
               <p>But I will insist no longer on this Theme, having spoke enough of it elsewhere. We have now shewn <hi>the Usefulness of the Mystery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse in all holy and religious respects:</hi> I shall adde only a word or two <hi>in reference to things of this Life,</hi> and so conclude the fourth part of my Discourse.</p>

And by how much the enjoyments of this present life are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished, the more his thoughts are cast upon those that are to come.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This brief Intimation shall suffice to shew how serviceable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity is for comfort and solace in this present life to every true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian in his <hi>private Capacities.</hi> But I must not omit to discover also that advantage which a <hi>Communialty</hi> has by becoming truly Christian. Which I am forced to the rather, because some have not stuck to pronounce of Christianity as of a Religion never intended for <hi>bodies Politick,</hi> and very disadvantageous for <hi>publick Concerns:</hi> As if Christian <hi>Humility, Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Flesh,</hi> and <hi>Patience of Injuries,</hi> would so cow and soften a Nation, that it would make them as <hi>helplesse</hi> as <hi>innocent,</hi> and thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray them to the victorious Fierceness of their invading Neighbours; and the Precepts of <hi>Charity</hi> so indispensably urged but slacken the hands of those that are able to work, and fill the whole Land with lazy beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars. Such like Cavils as these have some ill-willers not only to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, but (as I suspect) to any Religion that would curb their inordinate affections, invented and cast abroad; but more to the detecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:55305:240"/>
of their own ignorance and shame, then of any Imperfection or Unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Christianity, whereby it may not be the Religion of the most flourishing States and Kingdoms that can be constituted.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In answer therefore to the proposed Objections, I will in the first place acknowledge with them, That the Gospel was not intended prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily for the advantages of this Life, nor bore in it any Politick design for the administration of Publick affairs of State; but for making men in their private capacities good and happy, and for working their spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such a frame of Life and Holiness as would most certainly assure them of that Joy and Glory that is laid up for Believers in the other World. But withall I cannot but take notice, By how much it is plain that there is no Political or Worldly Design in the Gospel, by so much the more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident it is that there is no deceit nor falshood therein; and that it is not the cunning contrivance of some <hi>crafty Law-giver,</hi> but an holy, sincere and infallible Testimony of the Will of God concerning the True way of Salvation, and of the everlasting Happiness of the Souls of men.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But though I have been so liberal as to allow them thus much, yet I deny That there is any thing in Christian Religion but what is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not inconsistent with, but highly advantageous to a State or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that becomes truly Christian. For empty noises and names of things do nothing. Wherefore I shall affirme, That whatever advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges other Religions may be thought to have for conscientious obedience to the supreme Powers and faithfull dealing betwixt man and man, (which is the universal scope of all Religions as they are made serviceable to bodies Politick) Christianity has these, and upon more evident and unquestionable grounds then any Religion else whatsoever. For what Religion is there in the World that can give that demonstration of <hi>a Life to come,</hi> that Christianity doth in the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of our blessed Saviour, that infallible pledge of immortal Happiness to all his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? The truth therefore of Christian Religion rightly represented being so irrefutably convincing to both the learned &amp; the unlearned, the Heart and Conscience not onely of the People but also of the Magistrate will be the more irresistably bound to the performance of their mutual du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties one to another. The Result whereof is an unviolable <hi>Peace,</hi> and with that, all such comforts of Life as the best Laws and Governments pretend to aime at for making a Nation happy.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Nay I adde further, that those things that they object against Christianity are such as, if a Nation become truly Christian, do most effectually reach the chiefest Ends of Political Government. Of which one main one is <hi>mutual succour in time of need.</hi> And what is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for this then <hi>Charity?</hi> Nor is there any fear that this proneness to help one another shall relaxate the endeavours of the generality of the body Politick, but it only sweetens their care and industry, and takes off that torturous solicitude that must naturally attend those that know too well, that if they cannot hold up themselves, they must certainly perish. Which desperate consideration forces them to all possible tricks &amp; frauds for <hi>Self-Preservation.</hi> Which uncomfortableness of life and the evil tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations thereof are prevented in <hi>a Common-wealth</hi> that is <hi>truly Christian,</hi>
                  <pb n="452" facs="tcp:55305:241"/>
and consequently <hi>sincerely Charitable.</hi> Neither will <hi>Laziness</hi> thereby be nourished; this same Christian frame of Spirit making them all more ambitious of <hi>doing</hi> then <hi>receiving good</hi>; according to that noble saying of our Saviour,<note place="margin">Act. 20.35.</note> 
                  <hi>It is a more blessed thing to give then to receive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. And as it is without controversie that <hi>Humility, the patient Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of injuries,</hi> and <hi>the Mortifying the exorbitant desires of the flesh,</hi> do tend most certainly, in a Polity that is become thus Christian, to a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Peaceableness</hi> and <hi>a faithful and impartial Administration of Iustice in all things,</hi> (For from whence is Warre and Dissension, Violence and Injustice, but from the inordinate lusts of the Flesh, from Pride and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of disproportionable Revenge?) so is it as true also that they make us not a whit more liable to the invasion of our Enemies, as becoming thereby more cow'd or soft in Spirit. For <hi>a due castigation of the lusts of the Flesh</hi> rendreth the <hi>Body more healthful and hardy</hi>; whenas <hi>Luxury</hi> will certainly make it <hi>rotten and effeminate,</hi> and expose it to all manner of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases. And it is a very unskilful conceit to think that <hi>Humility</hi> will make them such tame things, that the enemy may take them up and carry them away at his pleasure: For Christian <hi>Humility</hi> does not consist in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing content to be brought under bondage by men, but in not despising others, and not arrogating any thing to our selves, nor seeking unjust do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over others for our own pleasure and satisfaction.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Nor does <hi>Patience toward particular injuries</hi> inure the Christian at all to be remiss in making resistance against an unjust Invader of his Country and Liberties. For the very same Principle, namely <hi>the Divine Love,</hi> that prompted him to bear <hi>private wrong,</hi> the damages whereof he could better reckon up, will as forcibly urge him to resist such <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Violence</hi> done against the body of Christ, who are more dear unto him then the apple of his eye, and their Concerns as much beyond his private Interest as their Number exceeds his single Person. His <hi>Love</hi> therefore to Christ who died for him, and whose Cause then shall really lie at the stake; His sincere affection to his fellow-members, to whom their dying Lord left that sacred legacy of mutual love, sealing it on their mindes with his own stupendious example, who being so high above them, yet stooped to the shameful and bitter death of the Cross, that they might love one another so ardently and entirely, that if need required they would not stick to lay down their lives one for another; His firm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in the Providence of God and his special assistance to them that fight his battels; His moderate love of this present World, and certain expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the immediate enjoyments of the Happiness of the other life upon the quitting of this; The consideration, I say, of all these things will arme our Christian souldiery (let them be in their private demeanour as <hi>milde</hi> and <hi>humble,</hi> as <hi>tame</hi> and <hi>lamb-like</hi> as you please) with such miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>valour and courage,</hi> that I cannot but presage that that Benediction of <hi>Moses</hi> will not fail to attend their enterprizes,<note place="margin">Levit. 26.8.</note>

               <p n="1">1. WE have now finished the <hi>four Primary Properties of the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Godlinesse,</hi> having treated of <hi>the Obscurity, Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse,</hi> of <hi>the Truth,</hi> and <hi>Usefulnesse</hi> thereof: and have already intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that there arise from these <hi>four other properties</hi> (which if you please you may call <hi>Derivative</hi>;) as from the <hi>Obscurity</hi> of this Mystery arises <hi>Venerability</hi>; from the <hi>Intelligiblenesse, Communicability</hi>; from <hi>Truth, a Power of gaining Assent</hi>; and lastly, from <hi>Usefulnesse, an affectionate prizing of it, and a Zeal or desire of promoting the knowledge and virtue of it in the World as much as we can.</hi> It remains therefore that we speak something of these, but with all brevity possible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That a due measure of Obscurity makes a Mystery the more venerable,</hi> is a Truth suggested to us by several observations. How <hi>Shades</hi> and <hi>Silence</hi> affect our very Senses, every one can witness who is not of so course a contexture of Body that onely gross and fierce Objects can move him. But he whose Senses are more passive and delicate, can with pleasure relate how he is affected when he enters into some <hi>shady</hi> and invious <hi>VVood</hi> or <hi>Grove,</hi> the thickness of whose Trees and redoubled Shadows stops his sight and hopes of ever passing through all that growes on that Sacred ground; but what he sees, he approves of as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, and conceives a peculiar pleasure in that confused divination or obscure representation of things there, where his Eyes cannot reach, nor his Feet approach. The <hi>Silence</hi> also of the place encreases the <hi>solemness</hi> thereof, in which (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> saies well) there is something <hi>profound and mysterious.</hi> And for this very reason the <hi>shadiness and stilness of the Night</hi> ordinarily seems a very <hi>venerable</hi> object to those whose Senses are so quick and fine, that they can feel and rellish all manner of mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Nature: which impress enriched the Poets Phansie with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
<q>
                     <l>Noxque tenebrarum specie reverenda tuarum.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The common Suffrage also of all Religions gives with us, who have alwaies affected something not easily Intelligible at first sight: And their
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:55305:242"/>
Temples were so built as to have their <hi>Adyta,</hi> some more Sacred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible places in them. And we may further observe, that <hi>Sparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of speech</hi> and <hi>Reservedness</hi> in men does naturally conciliate <hi>reverence</hi> to them. For there is still something behind in them impervious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible, which if they would impart, they might lessen their respect and become more contemptible. For it is very obvious to humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to brood some strange over-weening conceit of those things they know not, and to neglect and slight that which they know. These are Thieves that willingly leave the house when they have carried away all the treasure. But perpetual expectation continues respect. And what makes matter if the bottom of the Well be fathomless, if the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we reach be but pure and useful? Wherefore those that contend for such an <hi>absolute plainness and clearness in all points of Religion,</hi> shew more of clownishness and indiscretion then of wit and judgement; and their zeal is not so much for Truth, as out of Pride &amp; Vain-glory; they taking it very ill that any thing in the Mysterie of Godliness should be so myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as that their conceited <hi>Reason</hi> should not be able to <hi>comprehend</hi> it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But I demand of those great Pretenders to <hi>Reason,</hi> who would usurp or monopolize that Title to themselves in matters of Religion, By what Faculty can they demonstrate, that the Divine Oracles should mention nothing to us but what is the adequate Object of our Understandings, and that we shall not be puzzled in our endeavouring to comprehend the <hi>modes</hi> and <hi>circumstances</hi> of that <hi>General Truth</hi> which they propose to us? For the <hi>General</hi> proposal may be useful to us, whenas the <hi>curiosity of Circumstances</hi> may serve for nothing but the feeding of our foolish desire of devouring all Truth we can meet with and priding our selves in the booty. I speak this in reference to the <hi>most obscure Articles</hi> of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, touching <hi>the Triunity of the Godhead</hi> and <hi>the Divinity of Christ.</hi> For that the Holy Scripture does affirm both,<note place="margin">Book 1. c. 4. sect. 8, 9, 10. and c. 5. sect. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</note> I have already suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently shown. And being that they come to us with the same authority that the whole new Testament does, we cannot with any face deny the assertions and yet profess our selves Christians. For the adverse party have no plea but <hi>the Incomprehensibleness of the manner of the thing:</hi> which allegation is most unjust and ridiculous.</p>
               <p>For that which comes to us by <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> is as certain as <hi>our Senses.</hi> But <hi>our Senses</hi> do assure us of such things as no faculty can conceive how they are such as <hi>our Senses</hi> warrant them to be. As for example, <hi>The immediate Union of Matter with Matter,</hi> and <hi>The power we have by Will and Thought to move any member of our Body</hi>; These things we know to be, but are as <hi>incomprehensible</hi> as any thing that the Scripture has declared of <hi>the Triunity of the Godhead</hi> or <hi>Christ's Divinity.</hi> And therefore all their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments against those two Articles are weak and vain. For it is sufficient that for <hi>those useful purposes</hi> I have often mentioned they be proposed in the Scripture; but in a more shady, obscure and general way; that being enough to serve the End they are proposed for. And if any one be at a loss how to conceive the Mystery, let him make it up with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout admiration and humble veneration: <hi>Affections</hi> better becoming every holy man, then a fierce and peremptory pursuit of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:55305:242" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Reason, and bold attempt to pry into those things that God has thought fit to hide from him. Which is a saucy and clownish as forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to unveil or unmask some noble Matron or modest Virgin whether they will or no.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But that no fraud be done to Truth, nor mankind left liable to all the incredible forgeries and fables of covetous Priests and Impostors, we shall more carefully limit this our exaction of <hi>Reverence</hi> only to such Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Religion as are recommended to us not only upon account of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation and Serviceableness to some laudable end,</hi> but are also <hi>clear from contradiction and incompossibility.</hi> For for my own part I am well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured That God, who made our Faculties, will never offer any thing to us to believe, that upon close debate does plainly contradict them. Else all Religions were alike credible, and the Moons coming out of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>'s sleeve as passable as the History of <hi>Ionas</hi> his being three dayes and three nights in the Whales belly, and afterwards coming out alive. Which, though it be miraculous, is not at all impossible.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And therefore I do with all confidence imaginable assert, <hi>That the Divinity of Christ, and the Triunity, so far forth as the Scripture has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declared it self in these points, have nothing of contradiction nor impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in them.</hi> Nay, I will go one step further. <hi>Athanasius</hi> his Creed, which one would think is expresse enough concerning this Mystery, if certain words in it be but varied in that latitude of sense which they are capable of, and not only so, but must of necessity have in the Creed, there may be such an interpretation made of it as the most captious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can finde no cavil against.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>1.</hi> That there is a latitude of Sense in the words of <hi>Athanasius</hi> his <hi>Creed,</hi> and that <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Unity</hi> has not the same signification every where. <hi>2.</hi> The like in the terms <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Omnipotent. 3.</hi> Of the word <hi>Equal,</hi> and to what purpose so distinct a knowledge of the Deity was communicated to the Church. <hi>4.</hi> In what sense the Son and Holy Ghost are God.

               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="456" facs="tcp:55305:243" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. NOw that there is necessarily understood <hi>this latitude of variety in the sense of several of the words of the Creed,</hi> is apparent from the consent of those that do subtilize this Mystery to the utmost curiosity. For it is impossible for them or any else to think that <hi>the Godhead of the whole Trinity</hi> is <hi>One</hi> in the same sense that <hi>the Father considered alone</hi> is <hi>One,</hi> or <hi>the Son</hi> or <hi>Holy Ghost so considered.</hi> For then there being no more <hi>Unity</hi> in the single <hi>Hypostases</hi> then in the whole <hi>Trinity,</hi> every <hi>Hypostasis</hi> will be <hi>Triune</hi>; which no man will assert. Wherefore there is <hi>a lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of sense</hi> in the word <hi>One</hi> or <hi>Unity</hi> allowable in the Creed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. So when <hi>the Father</hi> is said <hi>to be Omnipotent, the Son Omnipotent,</hi> and <hi>the Holy Ghost Omnipotent,</hi> it is evident that <hi>Omnipotent</hi> has not the same sense in all. For the <hi>Father</hi> has the power of Eternal Generation of the <hi>Son,</hi> and both <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Father</hi> of an Eternal Emission of the <hi>Spirit</hi>; but <hi>the Son</hi> does not proceed from <hi>the Spirit,</hi> neither is <hi>the Father</hi> genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>the Son.</hi> Yet <hi>the Spirit</hi> and <hi>the Son</hi> which are both from <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> how infinitely do they exceed the Creation of the World? And the like may be said of the term <hi>God</hi>; by which if you understand That which is first of all in such a sense as that all else is from him, and he from none, the <hi>Son</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> cannot be said to be <hi>God</hi> in this signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, because the <hi>Father</hi> is not from them, but they from the <hi>Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And therefore it is further manifest that the word <hi>Equal</hi> is not to be understood mathematically and absolutely, but in an <hi>useful reference to us.</hi> Which is a Key that will easily open the whole Mystery of the Creed, which God did not communicate to the world to spin and weave unprofitable cobwebs out of; but did thus explicitly impart the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of his Divine glory, that understanding <hi>the Distinctness</hi> of his <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> in the <hi>Triunity</hi> thereof, the <hi>Divinity of Christ</hi> might the better be conceived, and how warrantable an Object he is of our worship &amp; <hi>Divine Adoration.</hi> For it passing through the Titles of the Humanity to the Eternal Son of God, there cannot be the least scruple or show of <hi>Idolatry</hi> in such Divine worship.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For <hi>the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God, as well as the Father,</hi> that is to say, they are all <hi>Eternal, Omnipresent, Omniscient, Omnicre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant</hi>; and therefore <hi>Divine Adoration</hi> is due without question to <hi>the whole Trinity</hi> from the Creatures. And not upon this account onely, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are <hi>so perfectly One,</hi> and have <hi>the same indivisible Omnipresency,</hi> and therefore are <hi>One entire Godhead, One coequal Glory and Majesty coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.</hi> I say then that <hi>this latitude of sense</hi> being once admitted, which is necessarily implied, the meaning of <hi>Athanasius</hi> his Creed may prove such as no imputation of either <hi>Polytheisme, Idolatry,</hi> or unconceivable <hi>Impossibility</hi> can be alledged against it; and the end of this Mystery fully served in such an intelligible Interpretation. But I shall not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake any such Paraphrase in this place. And what I have already ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured at is rather by way of Essay or invitation to others to make trial, then peremptory assertion in so profound a point, that deserves rather our humble admiration then curious disquisition. It is sufficient that so far as Scripture has determined of this Article, it is without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Contradiction.</p>

                  <pb n="457" facs="tcp:55305:243" rendition="simple:additions"/>5. <hi>The Divinity of Christ</hi> in my apprehension is a more easie Object of belief, being as intelligible as the Union of our Soul and Body. For as they two make up one man, so God and Man make one Christ, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi> himself has expressed it. This the Schools call <hi>Hypostatical U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> which has no intricacy in it but what they themselves have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon it. For every <hi>Substance</hi> is of it self an <hi>Individual</hi> Substance, and <hi>Universals</hi> but a <hi>Logical</hi> notion arising from our comparing of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of like nature together. Neither is there any Substance but by due preparatory modifications may be capable of being united with some other Individual Substance, and these <hi>Two</hi> Individual Substances become <hi>One</hi> whole Substance.

For there is no Substance conjoinable with another, but remains this Individual Substance, even for that very reason because it is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, every Substance being of it self <hi>Individual,</hi> as I have already said, and yet conjoinable with another Substance: whence it is plain that the <hi>Scholastick</hi> notion of <hi>Suppositum</hi> is a mere foolery.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Out of which we may easily understand how that <hi>the Humanity of Christ</hi> and <hi>the Eternal Word</hi> may be <hi>Hypostatically</hi> united without any contradiction to humane Reason unsophisticated with the fopperies of the Schools, and both their Hypostases remain still entire. Of which I will exhibite this as a more sensible representation. Suppose a vast Globe made all of solid Gold, saving one very small section which we will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of Silver. This individual Gold and this individual Silver, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining still this individual Gold and Silver, make up one entire Globe, which is not an entire Globe without either. So in Christ, made up (as I may so speak) of the <hi>Second Hypostasis of the Trinity</hi> and of that <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Person</hi> that conversed at Jerusalem; He is that individual Silver, and the other that individual Gold, and both these together <hi>One Christ,</hi> the sphere of whose Divinity filling all things, and being every where at hand, cannot but be a warrantable Object of our Praiers and Invocations, as the passive Humanity of Christ the prop of our Faith and confidence by his bitter Passion and Intercession.</p>
               <p n="7">7. What <hi>Superstition</hi> therefore can there be, or least suspicion of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> when we <hi>pray</hi> unto Christ, if we do but think of him to whom we pray? For the <hi>Eternal Godhead</hi> does so outshine every thing in this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Devotion, that our minde is in a manner wholly transported into God, though with a due reflexion of honour upon the Person of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, in virtue of whose Death and Intercession we make our addresses. Which Truth might also passe with the Jew, without any scruple at all, if he do but call to minde with what devout Humility their fore-fathers have <note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 34.8.</note> adored <hi>the presence of Angels.</hi> To whom in their Law <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. c. 18, &amp; 19. Exod. c. 3, 14, 32, &amp; 34.</note> 
                  <hi>Iehovah,</hi>
                  <pb n="458" facs="tcp:55305:244" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the most holy name of God, is also attributed. And if an <hi>Angel,</hi> that sustains the Person of God onely by way of <hi>Embassy,</hi> has this divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; how much more then is due to Christ, who is <hi>Iehovah</hi> not onely by <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>external Function,</hi> but by <hi>real Union</hi> with the <hi>Eternal Son of God?</hi> Which the <hi>Platonists</hi> in their <hi>Triad</hi> also call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the same in Greek that <hi>Iehovah</hi> is in Hebrew.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Or if they could imagine that there was so extraordinary a kind of Union of these <hi>Angels</hi> with God, where so high a name is attributed to them, as being in such an <hi>universalizing</hi> Rapture that they had lost the sense of their own <hi>Personalities,</hi> and were wholly actuated by God, who used them as fully and commandingly as our Soul does our Bodies; yet this may fall short in a two-fold respect of that Union which is betwixt the <hi>Humanity of Christ</hi> &amp; the <hi>Eternal Word.</hi> For first, it may not be of the same kinde, but differs as much, it may be, as the union of a Spirit with a dead Corps does from the union of the Soul of Man in an healthful bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Or if it could be admitted that there was some Principle excited and awaked, or some way inserted into the Essence of an Angel, whereby he might have real and vital union with God, yet it being but <hi>temporary,</hi> it is not to be compared with this lasting and durable union in the <hi>Messias.</hi> Nor does the visible presence of the Angel warrant Divine worship more to him then to Christ. For Christ according to his higher and more adorable nature is every where present.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I conclude therefore that <hi>the Divinity of Christ</hi> is not at all repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Reason, I mean his <hi>Real and Physical union,</hi> as I may so call it, <hi>with the Eternal Word.</hi> For being that it was this <hi>VVord</hi> or <hi>Eternal VVis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> whereby God made all things, it is very decorous and congruous that that great Instrument of the restoring so choice a piece of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as <hi>Man</hi> is, should be united particularly to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Eternal VVord.</hi> Nor is it unconceivable how he may be united particularly and immediately to this Hypostasis, and not the other two, from what we observe in Nature. For even the Faculties of the Soul residing in the same part of the Soul, according as the part of the Body is tempered or modified, one Faculty may exert it self in the part, and another be silent and take no hold thereon. And further it is evident, that though the <hi>Holy Spirit of God</hi> and the <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> be every where present in the World, and lie in the very same points of space; yet their actions, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications or engagings with things are very distinct. For the <hi>Spirit of Nature</hi> takes hold only of <hi>Matter,</hi> remanding grosse bodies towards the centre of the Earth, shaping Vegetables into all that various beauty we finde in them; but does not act at all on our <hi>Souls</hi> or <hi>Spirits</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine illumination, no more then the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> meddles with remanding of Stones downwards, or tumbling broken tiles off from an house. Which things rightly considered and improved make this Mystery intelligible enough for those that are fit for such Speculations. So that I need adde nothing more, having already proceeded further then I intended, in zeal against the fraud of some, and indiscretion of others, who so confidently maintain, That some main Points in Christian Religion are not onely <hi>obscure</hi> (which I willingly acknowledge, and that thereby our Religion is
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:55305:244"/>
the <hi>more Venerable</hi>;) but also <hi>repugnant to Reason,</hi> which I utterly deny, and shall in its due place shew the sad inconvenience of so rash an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THE Second <hi>Derivative</hi> Property of the Mystery of Godliness is <hi>Communicability.</hi> For in that it is <hi>Intelligible,</hi> it becomes hereby <hi>Communicable.</hi> Whence it appears what <hi>Communication</hi> I mean: not such as is competible also to Magpies and Parots, that is, a sound of words or phrases, which those Birds are able to repeat after us; but a Rational impartment of the matter, whereby a mans Understanding is satisfied of the real grounds of our belief. This duty the ancient Christians were charg'd with, as appears 1 Pet. chap. 3. v. 15. <hi>Be ready alwaies to give an answer to every man that asketh a reason of that hope that is in you, with meekness and reverence,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And if we be ask'd a <hi>reason</hi> of our belief, and the Apostle requires us to answer, assuredly he was not conscious of any <hi>Unreasonableness</hi> of the Christian Faith in his time. That of that witty Father of the Church, <hi>Credo quia impossibile,</hi> however it might please the <hi>Answerer,</hi> it could never satisfie the <hi>Opposer.</hi>

                     </gap>
                  </note> This would not prove <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as S. Paul speaks, <hi>a defence and confirmation of the Gospel,</hi> but rather an exposing it to derision and contempt. For he that will acknowledge <hi>Impossibilities</hi> in his Religion, gives up the Cause without blowes, and yields at once all that his adversary desired, namely that his Religion is nothing but a Forgery or Foolery.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Intelligibleness</hi> therefore must precede <hi>Communication</hi> in him that communicates the Mystery to another, so far as he does venture to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</hi> it. Otherwise if he once give his Tongue leave to out-run his Understanding, what hopes has he of seeming <hi>intelligible</hi> to another when himself understands not what he saith? Whence unless he meet with a fool, he himself will be sure to be found one, or accounted an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor or Mad-man. So little edification can there be in such Discourses.</p>
               <p>But if a man would be a prudent Imparter of Christian Religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he is not onely to take care that what he pronounces of the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is <hi>intelligible</hi> to himself; but also to be very circumspect how he speaks any thing to any one before they be capable of receiving it. And therefore if he would use a right Method, he must <hi>begin</hi> with such
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:55305:245"/>
things as are the <hi>most easy to conceive</hi> and the most capable of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, and also are the most certain pledges of the Happiness which they may expect who desire to be real and cordial Embracers of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</p>
               <p n="3">3.
<q>
                     <hi rend="margQuotes">As for example, They are to declare how Christ is the <hi>Messias</hi> expected of old of the Jews, though rejected by them when he came: That he is the Son of God, miraculously born of a Virgin: That he was a Sacrifice for sin, and underwent the shameful death of the Cross out of love to us: That he was raised from the dead the third day, and ascended visibly into Heaven, and thence is to be expected as Judge of the quick and of the dead; and that then those that believe on him shall be crowned with the highest glory and immortality, their vile bodies being changed into the similitude of his Heavenly body: And that the Resurrection of Christ is a palpable earnest of the purpose of God to reward us thus with everlasting life.</hi>
                  </q>
Such like things as these are to be <hi>communicated first</hi> by way of proposal, they neither vexing nor wearying the apprehension or imagination of man by any difficulty of conception, but are so strange that they may well call out the closest at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and put a man upon the most eager inquisition to be satisfied whether they be true.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The terms of the question therefore being thus easily intelligible, in the next place it will be expected that they evidence <hi>the Truth of the Narration:</hi> which is to be done from those clear Prophecies of the coming of the <hi>Messias,</hi> in the <hi>Old</hi> Testament, and of what he was to do and to suffer; any by a rational eviction of the incorruptedness and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentickness of the History of Christ in the Gospels and the rest of the Writings in the <hi>New.</hi> And after this, orderly and by degrees, they are to be led on to those things that are more obscure and mysterious, and yet to the patient and well-prepared mind both true and intelligible. For though some few points in Christianity may be obscure; yet so far forth as the Scripture defines any thing of them, they are both intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and true. So that <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Intelligibility</hi> is in every warrantable part of Christianity, at least to those that have their understandings exercised in rational Speculations. But for others whose parts and imploiments have rendred them less fit for any meditation that is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and obscure, they may content themselves with the safe adhesion to the forme of Sound words delivered in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Out of which they are very intelligibly instructed of <hi>the Divinity of Christs Person,</hi> in that they read there how he was declared <hi>the Son of God</hi> by voices from Heaven: That he was begotten not by man, but by the overshadowing of the Holy Ghost: That he did such Miracles also as became <hi>the Son of God</hi> to do, being utterly above the power of nature: That in him <hi>dwells the fulness of the Godhead bodily,</hi> whenas it dwelt in the Temple of the Jews onely <hi>Typically.</hi> And therefore there is far greater reason that the devotions of Christians should be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 21.22.</note> towards Christ, then those of the Jews towards the Holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; towards which they alwaies worshipped, when they put up their supplications to God, though they were far distant from it. That <hi>the
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:55305:245"/>
Word</hi> also is said to be made <hi>flesh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 1.14.</note> to wit <hi>the Word that was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with God, when all things were made</hi>; and that <hi>this Word</hi> also <hi>was God</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> and that <hi>God was manifested in the flesh</hi> by the appearing of Christ in the World.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That these things are thus really and in truth, the Authentickness of the Scriptures makes good. But for such as are unexercised in Metaphysical speculations, that have not so much as considered <hi>the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their own Soul with their Body,</hi> nor once heard of distinction <hi>real</hi> and <hi>formal,</hi> and other setled notions requisite for the more express apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of such high points as <hi>the Conjunction of the Divinity and Humanity in Christ</hi> and <hi>the Triunity of the Godhead</hi>; the best instruction can be given to them by the <hi>Mystagogus</hi> is, that they would make that up in <hi>humble Adoration</hi> that they want in <hi>Knowledge:</hi> and that God of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy imparted these Mysteries to the World <hi>for use,</hi> and not for <hi>curious and vexatious speculation:</hi> and that they should be so modest as not to think that utterly unintelligible that themselves for the present cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That the Truth of the Gospel is a standing and immutable thing, not to be altered and changed according to the capacities of men; and that if nothing should be exhibited to their belief but what they will all affirm they have a satisfactory conception of, they will at last tread down Religion to nothing. For they will not stint themselves there, I mean in the rejection of <hi>the Divinity of Christ,</hi> and of <hi>a Triune Deity</hi>; but the notion of <hi>Angels and Spirits,</hi> and of an <hi>Immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> Soul, and lastly of any Being whatsoever that is <hi>truly spiritual,</hi> will appear so inconceivable to some, that at last Religion will be tumbled down as low as <hi>mere Body</hi> and <hi>Matter,</hi> and will find no Object but the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible World,</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Starrs</hi> must be the greatest Deities. And so either the ancient Pagan Superstition or else down-right Atheisme must take place.</p>

<pb n="462" facs="tcp:55305:246"/>
some sort he is; and therefore ought to be careful that he mistake not his errand in any thing, nor mingle of his own what he has no commission to speak, nor distort the truth out of fear or favour, nor make himself suspected by any levity or affected vanity in style or words, that are misbecoming a matter of so great importance. For quaintness of wit and studied eloquence may tickle the Ear for a time, like a Musical aire the while it is playing: but a faithful and serious declaration of the most weighty parts of our Religion will wound the very Heart, and captivate the Soul to the Obedience of Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And above all things, he that either of himself adventures, or has any better call to this office, let him ever have in his eye the <hi>Usefulness</hi> of the Mystery he indeavours to communicate, remembring that that is an <hi>Universal property</hi> thereof; and that, if either his inadvertency or curiosity has carried him into any <hi>Useless</hi> speculations or Theories, he is most certainly led out of his way, and that he is now imparting humane inventions which are nothing at all appertaining to the Gospel of Christ; that he is now feeding his charge not with the sincere milk of the Word, but the brackish sweat of some over-heated Brain. This is the most common and the most dangerous mistake that is to be observed in this Function; as if their very Art and Faculty were to let fly words for whole hours together, whereof not one is directed or intended towards the mark and scope of the Gospel, which is the rooting out of Sin and destroying the Kingdome of the Devil.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And yet it is a wonder to see the zeal and heat, and hear the noise of these <hi>Boanerges,</hi> these <hi>Sons of thunder,</hi> as if every sentence were fire and lightning from Heaven against the strong holds of Sin and Satan, and that they would humble every thought to the obedience of Christ, who came into the World to redeem us from all iniquity, and to purchase to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a Church pure, holy and undefiled, without either spot or blemish. Which End notwithstanding is for the most part not onely not aimed at, but too often crossed and supplanted by Hypocritical insinuations of either the <hi>Needlesness</hi> or <hi>Impossibility</hi> of these things. To be short, For the most part the discourse is so off and on, that a man knows not what they would have: but it is as if one should bring Grey-hounds into the field, and let them slip and cry <hi>allooe,</hi> when yet there is no game before them. Which noise though it may make them skip up and look about a while, yet they will presently finde themselves unconcern'd, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing in sight for them to pursue.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But if they would exhort <hi>to follow peace and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord,</hi> this were worth our pursuance indeed, as being the known and certain end of the preaching of the Gospel. But if we see no such design therein, and therefore act opposite to it, and vilify the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of that Day of righteousness that is to arise upon the World and to make that Habitations of Christendome a Land of joy and peace, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the people of God by telling them dreadful stories of the Sons of <hi>Anak,</hi> those invincible Giants, whenas there is nothing too hard nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible to the true <hi>Iosua,</hi> our Lord Jesus, the wisdome &amp; power of God; verily it is to be feared that this Function, which was intended by God a
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:55305:246"/>
Fortress against Sin, if it prove by unskilful zeal such a Bulwark of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness, that He may dig it down and remove it as a ruinous wall of a garden, whose dead rubbish and stones ever falling on the innocent herbs and flowers do smother and stifle them, or as an old decaied hedge which is to be pull'd up and carried away, the quick-set being grown.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But if we will work the works of the Lord in faithfulness and according to the design of the Gospel, we our selves shall become part of that Quick-set, and be made living stones to hold up one another in the Temple of God. And that those that are not thus enlivened may not take themselves to be so, by reason of their extraordinary promptitude and vivacity; I must not forbear to declare that this life we speak of is no natural heat, nor the external effects of it. Nor is that a living Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry according to this sense, that makes shew of the greatest zeal. For verily it is well known that cooling Physick may be administred in very hot broth. And it is too-too possible that such things may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the greatest heat and fervency imaginable, which once recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Minds of the hearers are so far from warming them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and spiriting them to true holiness and righteousness, that they even slake and extinguish the desire thereof: which yet is no less a crime then stifling the life of God in the World as much as in us lies, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining the Kingdome of Christ upon Earth. These things I could not but take notice of concerning the <hi>Communication</hi> of the Gospel, as being of very great use as well to the Hearer as the Teacher, that neither the one might mistake himself, nor the other be deceived by him.</p>

                  </gap>, which might be better rendred the <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>; but is capable also of being interpreted the <hi>New Law.</hi> For of so large an extent is the signification of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, it denoting both <hi>Law, Covenant</hi> and <hi>Testament,</hi> as <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> has observed out of <hi>Plato, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stophanes</hi> and <hi>Isocrates.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, if we consider what agreement and affinity they have one with another. For first, <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> agree in <hi>Sanction</hi>; especially publick Leagues and Covenants, which of old were made by the mactation of some beast, from whence <hi>Sanction</hi> is <hi>à Sanguine,</hi> from the bloud of the Sacrifice. For which cause also the Hebrew Doctours willingly deduce <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>succidere,</hi> as the Latins <hi>foedus à feriendo.</hi> Whence the phrase of <hi>striking a covenant</hi> is so obvious both in Hebrew, Greek and Latine Authors. And that there is <hi>Sanction</hi> in <hi>Laws</hi> as well as in publick <hi>Contracts and Covenants</hi> is plain, for that the bloud of him that transgresses is to satisfie the Law. <hi>In legibus Sanctio dicitur ea pars</hi> (saies <hi>Grotius</hi>) <hi>quae Sanguinem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquentis legi consecrat; In laws that part is called Sanction which conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates the bloud of the Delinquent to the law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Again, <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Testament</hi> have this common to them both, that neither are without <hi>covenanting</hi> or <hi>contracting. Nam &amp; haeres, eo ipso quòd haeres est, praestare debet factum defuncti; &amp; subjectus alterius impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perio, eo ipso quòd subjectus est, ejusdem legibus parere debet: For an heir or executor, as such, is hereby bound to perform the deed of the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and he that is a Subject, is, as such, bound thereby to obey the laws of him whose subject he is,</hi> as the same Author tells us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Lastly, <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Testament</hi> agree in this, that at first it is free to a man whether he will <hi>contract</hi> or no, and so whether he will <hi>take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration</hi> or no, or be such a mans <hi>heir.</hi> But it is not alwaies free whether a man will be such an ones Subject or no, whenas Subjection may unavoidably descend on one as born of such parents and in such an ones Jurisdiction.</p>

                  </gap>, we may the more easily judge which is the most competible to the nature of the Gospel; and observe the wisdome of the Ancients in making this Inscription rather then any other. For they might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled

                  </gap>, whose <hi>determinate</hi> sense had been then, <hi>The new Covenant.</hi> But then it would have hid that special sense of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>This is my bloud of the new Covenant.</hi> The same also you may read in <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke.</hi> So that here being mention of <hi>Bloud, Sanction</hi> properly so called, and which is most conspicuous in the nature of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> is herein manifested. The Author to the Hebrews does more accurately and fully prosecute this Matter, chap. 7, 8, and 9. where ver. 19. he plainly parallels the <hi>bloud of Christ</hi> to the <hi>bloud of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> made by God with the Jews. <hi>For when Moses had spoken every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to all the people according to the Law, he took the bloud of Calves and Goates, and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book and all the people,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See Exod. 24.8.</note> 
                  <hi>saying, This is the bloud of the Covenant which God hath enjoined unto you.</hi> To which bloud of the Jewish <hi>Covenant</hi> all along to the end of the chapter he compares the Sacrifice of Christ and the shedding his most precious bloud, when he did <hi>Foedus ferire, make a Covenant of peace</hi> with God for remission of sins to all Mankind.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The other reason why they have styled it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Covenant,</hi> rather then <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is because this Inscription more plainly insinuates unto us the sweet condescension of God Almighty and his singular goodness in the Gospel, who in sending of Christ hath not dealt with us <hi>summo jure,</hi> nor imperiously and minaciously, as severe Law-givers use to doe; but mildely and kindly, as those that contract and covenant in a familiar and kind way one with another.

                  </gap>, that they frequently set it in opposition thereunto. And if at any time they attribute that term to it, it is ordinarily not without some softning or mitigating qualification; as the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> not of <hi>Works,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>liberty</hi> Jam. 1.25. So that we see that there is a very sufficient ground why, notwithstanding the Jews call'd their <hi>Pentateuch</hi> and other holy writings <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But questionless that One most eminent, most solemn and most formal Covenant which God made with the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it at their going out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but perfecting it on <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> this is that <hi>Old Covenant chiefly</hi> glanced at by them that styled our Religion <hi>The New Covenant:</hi> and they had a very good warrant for it out of the Prophet Jeremy, ch. 31. v. 31, 32. <hi>Behold the daies come, saith the Lord, that I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Iudah: Not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the Land of Aegypt (which my Covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the Lord.) But this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel: After those daies, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they shall be my people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="467" facs="tcp:55305:248"/>Which promise also is recorded in the 54. of <hi>Esay, And all thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of thy children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that there is found an <hi>Old</hi> and a <hi>New</hi> Covenant set opposite the one against the other by the Prophets own ordering. The difference of whose natures consists mainly in this, That the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> is an <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Covenant,</hi> something without a man, the other an <hi>inwardly-ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted principle of Life.</hi> This is that word which is in our heart as well as in our mouth, of which Paul professes himself a preacher, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must be the gospel of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But you'l say, The <hi>Evangelists</hi> and the <hi>Apostles</hi> Writings are <hi>without</hi> too as well as the <hi>letter</hi> of <hi>Moses.</hi> I, but yet for all that it is very manifest and plain that they have not reached the Dispensation of the Gospel, that have not attained to an inward principle of life. Which being the great distinguishing design of the Gospel, we are to look upon it in this design and end, and that it has not done its work, and is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner nothing to us till this be done. <hi>He that believes in me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of water.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 7.38.</note> And John 6. <hi>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me, and I in him. As the living Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.</hi> Which passages plainly enough import the most inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate principles of life that may be; the <hi>divine nature</hi> being turned as it were <hi>in succum &amp; sanguinem</hi> within us, being converted into the juice and nourishment of our Souls.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But our conversation under the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Covenant, and our frame of Spirit there is but an ordinary accustomary temper or habit of doing or not doing such and such things; and consequently all that righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness but a fleshly rational fabrick of minde, which Fear and Custome have carved out in the surface as it were of our Souls; which characters by the same instruments are so preserved legible. But under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Christ, nor Fear nor Custome, but an inward spirit of life works us into everlasting holiness and a permanent Renovation of nature and Regeneration of the hidden man.</p>
               <p n="5">5. From whence the reason is to be understood of that difference the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> intimates betwixt the <hi>Old</hi> Covenant and the <hi>New.</hi> That the <hi>old Covenant</hi> was broken by his people, but the <hi>new</hi> one should not be broken. For the one being an external yoke, and the other the inward pleasure of life and radicate desire of the Soul; it is no wonder that what is forced lasts not long, but that upon the first opportunity and provoking occasion, like unmanaged horses, we cast off the burden that so pinches us and galls us, in lying so heavy upon us, and being no part of us. But the <hi>perfect Law of liberty</hi> becoming as it were our own life and nature, our greatest burden would be not to act according to it, and to act contrary thereto intolerable. For it were the wounding and tormenting a principle of life in us, or the Spirit of Christ in us, whereby we are not only aided and assisted to every good work, but take a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral delight therein: whereas under the <hi>Mosaical</hi> law we have no confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Spirit to either the purer Moral precepts, or any complacency in the luggage of a company of insipid and burdensome Ceremonies;
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:55305:249"/>
and yet the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Dispensation, though it give no strength to perform what it requires, yet like <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s hard task-masters requires the same tale of brick, though they withhold the straw.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And this gives us some light into the nature of the <hi>Two Covenants</hi> in reference to the Prophecie of <hi>Ieremie.</hi> But it being an argument of very great consideration, I will not content my self with so scant an account thereof, but make a more copious deduction of the whole matter out of Paul, Gal. 4. that we may the more fully understand so important a Mystery: and when I have from thence discovered the excellency of the state of the Second Covenant, I shall adde such things as tend to the more useful knowledge of the entrance into it and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in it.</p>

Which things are an Allegorie; for these are the Two Covenants, the one from the Mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.

               <p>In the words we have recited there is a double Similitude.

               <p>The particulars in the Second <hi>Protasis</hi> are <hi>Sarah</hi> the free-woman, and <hi>Isaac</hi> the Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> which he had of this free-woman, and lastly, the manner of his birth, it was not <gap reason="foreign">

For <hi>Agar</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> differ as <hi>Bondage</hi> and <hi>Freedome,</hi> and <hi>Ismael</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> as <hi>bond</hi> and <hi>free,</hi> and the condition of their births as <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>God.</hi> And consequently there must arise a real difference or contrariety in the particulars of the <hi>Apodoses,</hi> viz. betwixt the <hi>Old ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial Ierusalem</hi> and the <hi>New one from above,</hi> betwixt the Jew, Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see or outward Legalist and the true and real Christian, and lastly, betwixt the Flesh and the Spirit. And so to speak compendiously, this Text of the Apostle is nothing else but a description of the different conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Two Covenants, set out in an historical Allegorie, taken from <hi>Agar</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> and their two Sons, &amp;c. I shall therefore now fall upon them in that order as I have laid them out.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And First therefore of <hi>Agar,</hi> the bond-woman, which signifies the <hi>Covenant of the Law given upon Mount Sinai.</hi> For <hi>this Agar is Mount Sinai in Arabia.</hi> Which is spoken Synecdochically from a Town there called <hi>Agra</hi> by <hi>Plinie,</hi> and by <hi>Dion, Agara,</hi> and the people <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in Greek Geographers, as <hi>Grotius</hi> has pertinently observed. This allusion therefore to <hi>Agar</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> where the <hi>Law</hi> was given, does commend to us more handsomely and facilitate the Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry taken from the story of <hi>Agar</hi> and <hi>Sarah.</hi> But if there were not this Geographical advantage, the Application will be found very sutable and apposite even without it. And much of the nature of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New</hi> Covenant is hinted at even in the names themselves: as in this of <hi>Agar,</hi> which they ordinarily interpret <hi>Peregrina.</hi> What the relation of habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is betwixt the Soul of man and the things of the Old Covenant, is very fitly set down in the meaning of this Name <hi>Agar.</hi> For verily as
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:55305:250"/>
for those things that were Positive and Ceremonial in the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> they are but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>things strange</hi> and of no affinity with the Soul; and as for those things that are most precious and most indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably good in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> the Soul in no better a dispensation then <hi>under the Law</hi> is plainly <hi>a Stranger</hi> to them. For the Law conveies no life; but all congruity, sympathy and vital affinity must arise out of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of life. And hence it is that <hi>the Law makes nothing perfect,</hi> and that <hi>Righteousness cannot be of the Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Book. 8. c. 6. sect. 2.</note> as I have above intimated out of the Apostle. The <hi>Law</hi> therefore giving no life, a <hi>mere Legalist</hi> is even a <hi>stranger</hi> to those things he practices and imitates under the Law, and acts so as the Parot speaks, by external imitation, not from a due in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Faculty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This <hi>Agar</hi> her condition was a bond-woman: and what I pray you is it to be in <hi>bondage</hi> or not <hi>sui juris</hi> but to be constrained to act <hi>ad nutum alterius?</hi> And in this condition are all those that are <hi>under the Law.</hi> For they do not act according to a free inward and living Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in them, but are fain to be curb'd and fettered by an outward im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, which is perfect and proper bondage. And there is no bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage but to doe or suffer otherwise then a man would himself.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Of this <hi>Agar</hi> is begot <hi>Ismael.</hi> What's that? <hi>Ismael</hi> may signifie these two things: viz. either one that has only a knowledge of God by <note n="*" place="margin">Philo <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Deus,</hi> or so far as some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal letter conveies it to him, resolving all his faith in things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God into an outward Scripture only; and haply is so earthly and carnal that he would scarce believe there were a God, unless it were for the Scripture. Or else from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>obedire,</hi> from obeying God in a servile and external forc'd way. For <hi>Obedience</hi> implies some kind of reluctancy, or that that which we obey in goes something against the hair with us; but yet in obedience to the Commander we doe it nevertheless, as being bound to obey. And this is most of all proper to them under the first Covenant. For that Law not giving life, there is no Principle of life and natural and genuine compliance of the Soul of man with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality of the Law under the <hi>First</hi> Covenant; and therefore that of the Law which he endeavours to perform must needs go cross to him, and it will be merely the obedience to the Precept, not the love of the thing, that will make him endeavour the performance. And this is the true condition of <hi>Agar</hi>'s Son <hi>Ismael.</hi> And it would not be unseasonable to add also that he is a great and <hi>fierce</hi> 
                  <note n="**" place="margin">Philo <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> his hand is against every man, and every mans hand against him, as the Scripture witnesses of him. But I will not insist upon these things.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and lastly, This <hi>Ismael</hi> the Son of <hi>Agar</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he was <hi>begotten and born after the flesh,</hi> or according to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and accustomary power of Nature. And such an one is he that is merely under the First Covenant: He is not born of the Spirit, or regenerated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary power and assistance of God, which he that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> Covenant takes hold of by Faith in the Promise; but
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:55305:250"/>
toiles and tugs with that Understanding and ordinary Naturall power is in him of externally conforming himself to the proposed Rule: and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this poor dispensation, when he is come to the best of this his either birth or growth, he is but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he is but <hi>Flesh,</hi> and not <hi>Spirit.</hi> For that which is born of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> that is, of our own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural abilities, is but <hi>Flesh</hi>; but that which is born of <hi>the Spirit,</hi> that is, of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Divine seed</hi> in us, that is <hi>Spirit,</hi> the true Spiritual man, the Lord from Heaven, Heavenly, in a Mystical sense. But this under the Law is but the Son of the <hi>Flesh</hi> or the <hi>Earth</hi>; is not a Son of that <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem that is from above,</hi> the Heavenly <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which is the Mother of as many as are real and true Christians.</p>
               <p>For this is <hi>Sarah</hi> the Free-woman; but the old <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is in bondage with her Children, as the Apostle plainly tells us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And thus far have I described the condition or nature of the Old <hi>Mosaical</hi> Covenant, so far forth as is intimated in the Text. I proceed now to the <hi>Second</hi> or <hi>New</hi> Covenant under Christ. And the first Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in the <hi>Protasis</hi> here is <hi>Sarah, Domina,</hi> a <hi>Free-woman, libera à vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis ac ritibus,</hi> as the Interpreter speaks very well, one that is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded into obedience by others, but is <hi>sui juris,</hi> does what she pleases; and so she may very well, for nothing pleases her but what is good, and therefore fit to be done. For <hi>Sarah,</hi> or the <hi>New Ierusalem from above,</hi> is of one Spirit and one mind with Christ. And this is <hi>the true Church of Christians,</hi> in whom the body of sin being dead, they are free from it, as the Apostle speaks to the <hi>Romans</hi>; &amp; being quit thereof, they walk freely and safely, <hi>etiam custode remoto,</hi> that surly Paedagogue, <hi>the Law,</hi> no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er dogging them at the heels. For whatever it can suggest from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, the Spirit of God whispers to them from within, or indeed that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Form of all holinesse and righteousnesse, the Image of Christ reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in them, guides them as easily and as naturally to, as our external Senses guide our Natural man in this outward and visible world. This therefore is the condition of the Church of Christ and every true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of it, at least arrived to its due maturity and perfection, that every Soul there is as <hi>Sarah, Domina,</hi> as a <hi>Queen Regent</hi> in her little world, her self acting nothing forcedly but freely, as from a living principle, and keeping those under her in due order and subjection. Which condition undoubtedly the Scripture does point at in such phrases as these, <hi>He hath made us Kings and Priests</hi>; and elsewhere, <hi>You are a Kingly Priesthood</hi>; and the like.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Secondly, Of this <hi>Sarah</hi> was born <hi>Isaac,</hi> which signifies <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 8. chap. 5. sect. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Laughter,</hi> and is a signe of <hi>Chearfulness and Ioy.</hi> Because he that is a true Christian acts and walks with joy and chearfulnesse in the waies of holinesse and righteousnesse. And herein is he mainly distinguished from <hi>Ismael,</hi> who acts merely out of obedience to an external form, and so forces himself against the hair to do or omit that which, were it not that he was bound in obedience to do or omit, he would take the boldnesse to neglect; his inward principle being contrary to it. As for example, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, did not the Law forbid him; he would immerse himself into all manner of Sensual pleasures, were he not aw'd as an hungry dog by the
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:55305:251"/>
lash and penalty of the Law; and so in other things. But the Soul of a true Christian, in whom <hi>Isaac</hi> is born, does not act what is good or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit what is evil out of any force or fear of any external inconvenience, but <hi>naturally,</hi> as I may so speak, that is, from a <hi>Divine nature</hi> and power in him, and therefore with as much chearfulnesse and willingnesse as the natural man does eat and drink. And of this <hi>Isaac</hi> was born <hi>Iacob,</hi> who was called <hi>Israel,</hi> which <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew interprets, <hi>one that</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Philo</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. As if <hi>Israel</hi> were also to be deduced from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifying <hi>videre,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Deus.</hi>
                  </note>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> but you may be remembred that <hi>Ismael</hi> in the first signification of his name noted one that did <hi>onely know God by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,</hi> which is quite contrary to <hi>the seeing of God.</hi> For that priviledge is proper to the true Christian to whom <hi>Isaac</hi> is born, and from him <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:</hi> but he is quite out of the line of <hi>Ismael</hi>; having now nothing to do with <hi>hear-saies</hi> and <hi>conjectures,</hi> and <hi>fruitlesse disputacity</hi> upon the mistaken letter, and <hi>Polemical Divinity,</hi> and vain and ridiculous altercations and janglings; for he is now a Citizen of that <hi>New Ierusalem from above,</hi> and the onely true <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> according to the notation of the name, which they will have to signifie <hi>The vision of Peace.</hi> He is a living stone of the Temple of Him that is greater then <hi>Solomon,</hi> where there is not heard the noise of any axe or hammer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and lastly, This <hi>Isaac</hi> was not born according to the flesh, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. <hi>Per eam vim extraordinariam quam Deus promiserat:</hi> for it is a Metonymy, as the Interpreter rightly has noted <hi>Isaac</hi> was not born according to the power of Nature (for that Natural power of begetting and bearing Children was then extinct in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> by reason of old age, as the Text tells us;) but he was born by the power of God working extraordinarily in Nature: which power <hi>Abraham</hi> having a faith in, and believing the promise, he at the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time saw and enjoied the effect of it. And this is the precious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>Faith</hi> so mainly necessary, and yet so little spoken of by them that spake much in matters of Divinity. For without <hi>this Faith in the power of God, Isaac</hi> will not be born in us; and if he be not born in us, I know no warrant we have to conclude our selves <hi>Christians</hi> or men <hi>under the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Covenant.</hi> Wherefore it is a point mainly necessary to be insisted upon, that we may at length be really that which we pretend to be, that is, Sons of the <hi>Free-woman,</hi> and not of the <hi>Bond-woman</hi>; that the true <hi>Isaac</hi> may be in us, which is Christ according to the Spirit, the Wisdome and Power of God, a Divine vigor and life whereby we are inabled with joy and chearfulnesse to walk in the waies of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And verily it was this so necessary and useful <hi>Faith</hi> that was so commended in <hi>Abraham,</hi> that it was <hi>imputed to him for righteousnesse,</hi> as I have above noted, <hi>viz.</hi> his believing the Promise of God in things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the ordinary power of Nature. For it is the nature of men that make large professions of God and Divine Providence, yet never to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him further then in Natural Causes and humane probabilities. But this is not so much to believe <hi>God</hi> as <hi>Nature,</hi> nor to depend on him, but on our own cold and ineffectual Reason concluding from accustoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probabilities. Which if <hi>Abraham</hi> had done, it might well have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited the birth of his Son <hi>Isaac.</hi> And it will be very reasonable to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:55305:251"/>
our selves, if we do not now hinder the birth of the spiritual <hi>Isaac,</hi> by reason of our <hi>unbelief.</hi> For we finding the generality of men so evil as they are, and being conscious to our selves of abundance of corruption and all manner of weaknesse and proclivity to what is bad, and finding it so common a thing for men to continue in their evil wayes, and not to put off their wonted habits, and that in our own attempts and resolutions we have been often baffled and cast back again; we are likely, through a spirit of Infidelity, to conclude that that which is so hard to flesh and bloud, and is so seldome seen in the course of the World, will not be at all effected in us, and therefore either live as it happens, or at least make very small progresse in matters of true Religion and Piety, I am sure fall short of that high calling whereunto we are called, <hi>viz.</hi> that glorious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Sons of God, from the slavish inveiglements of all <hi>uselesse Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi> and <hi>real sins.</hi> And this is for want of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, who believed contrary to all probability of Nature, that for all his decaied body, and <hi>Sarah</hi>'s barren womb, yet God would raise up seed to him, and that they should have a Son in their old age. We are therefore to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithful; and what we finde our selves weak in, not to distrust but that God in his good time can make it out to us; and therefore with patience and perseverance to presse forward, and by <hi>Faith in the power of God,</hi> who raised Christ from the dead, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that after we have been made conformable to his death, we shall also partake of the Resurrection from the dead. For Christ in our Souls wading through the death with us, that is, supporting and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening us in our greatest Agonies, brings up himself and us into a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Resurrection from the dead: which you may call a <hi>Birth,</hi> if you please, as well as a <hi>Resurrection,</hi> using but the same liberty that is already in the Scripture; where speaking of his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> the Apostle cites that in the second Psalm, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> And this is the Son who, as he professes of himself, if he make us free, we are then <hi>free indeed.</hi> For he is the Son of <hi>Sarah</hi> the <hi>Free</hi>-woman, and we being of one Spirit with him do <hi>ipso facto</hi> become <hi>free.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. And if we would compendiously declare the grand difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the First and Second Covenant, it does consist mainly in these two points we are upon. First, That a true Christian, or one attained to the End and Scope of the Second Covenant, is what he is by Faith in a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural power working him to it. Secondly, That that condition he has attained to is a condition of true and perfect <hi>Freedome</hi> properly so called. But he that is under the <hi>First Covenant,</hi> is what he is by the power of <hi>Nature</hi> onely, and by applying himself as well as he can to the <hi>external Rule</hi> he has set before him. And verily he that does no more then thus in Christianity it self, that is, <hi>outwardly apply himself to the Letter of the Gospel,</hi> has not arrived to the End of the Gospel, nor is <hi>Isaac</hi> yet born in him, but is under an <hi>outward legal Form,</hi> in stead of <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life.</hi> And he cannot be born of the <hi>Free-woman,</hi> forasmuch as <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life</hi> is wanting in him, which does really <hi>free us from the Law of Sin and Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now by reason that a true Christian arrives to that happy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:55305:252"/>
he is in by a <hi>Supernatural power,</hi> (which condition is to be <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>naturally</hi> righteous and good, that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> by a <hi>Divine nature</hi>; which when we have attained to, we may be properly said <hi>naturally</hi> and without straining to do that which is good and righteous) we discover here a very eminent Object of our <hi>Faith,</hi> viz. this <hi>Divine power,</hi> by the help whereof we are to be wrought up into this happy condition of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving inward Righteousnesse, that is as near to us as our own Souls, and is the life and spirit of our Soul, as our Soul is of our Body. And thus are we <hi>made just by Faith,</hi> as I have elsewhere intimated, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Faith in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God,</hi> whereby he is able to raise Jesus Christ from the dead in us, or what is all one, whereby he is able to make the Spiritual <hi>Isaac</hi> grow in our withered and barren wombs, and to bring to passe in us that by his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting <hi>Grace</hi> which would never have come to passe by the mere strength of <hi>Nature.</hi> This I say is a very eminent and highly-considerable Object of our Christian Faith. And the want of this Faith the Prophet may seem to complain of in a mystical sense,<note place="margin">Psa. 53.1.</note> when he saies, <hi>Who has believed our report? or to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> that is, Men are very slow to believe that the power of God in Christ is so efficacious as it is to cast down every strong hold of Satan, and to kill and slay the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Sin in us, that the spirit of Righteousnesse may be revived and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored in us. And thus much briefly of the First point wherein the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Covenant</hi> differs from the <hi>First.</hi> The Second point is this, <hi>That the state of the Second Covenant is a state of Liberty, as that under the First of Bondage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. And this <hi>Liberty</hi> consists in these three things especially. First <hi>In that we are freed from the tedious and voluminous luggage of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, nor are any longer superstitiously hoppled in the toiles and nets of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Opinions,</hi> which tend not at all of their own nature to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Divine life</hi> and the Kingdome of Christ in the world. And verily it cannot sink into my minde how <hi>Zeal about unnecessary knowledge</hi> can be any better then the boiling of the <hi>natural heat</hi> in the behalf of that which is alike dear, nay more dear to Devils and Natural men then to the true Children of God, in whom the curious desire of <hi>Speculative</hi> knowledge is very much extinguished through their ardent thirst after <hi>Divine life</hi> and <hi>sense</hi>: which will most vividly possesse them upon a due measure of Regeneration, or the Resurrection from the dead, when we have risen with Christ as well as died with him. In the mean time while we are passing through the painful Agony of <hi>Mortification,</hi> all fine Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Curiosities of Religion will lie scattered and neglected about us, as toies and gew-gawes by a child that is deadly sick.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Secondly, the Second part of our <hi>Liberty</hi> consists in this, <hi>that we are free from Sin.</hi> They are the very words of the Apostle, <hi>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6.5, 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>we shall be also in the likeness of his Resurrection: Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroied, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead, is freed from sin.</hi> And hence I think it is very plain that a man that has had his due progress under the Second Covenant, I mean the Gospel of Christ, is freed from the rebellion and
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:55305:252"/>
tumult of the body of sin. And that we may not shuffle off so general a notion and elude the force thereof, I will particularize; He is freed from <hi>Pride,</hi> from <hi>Envy,</hi> from <hi>Hatred,</hi> from <hi>Wrath,</hi> from <hi>Grief,</hi> from <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness</hi> and from <hi>sensual Lust.</hi> And some of these are so incompetible with the nature of a Christian, as <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> that they are like the rankest poison, not in the least degree consistent with the condition we speak of. And though something in reason may be said for <hi>Hatred,</hi> yet I believe it will lie very crosly and unevenly in the heart of a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian; and I see no need of it, whenas <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Sorrow,</hi> that is <hi>Pity,</hi> will supply the place of it. And we may observe our Saviour Christ surprized with <hi>Anger,</hi> and melted in <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Pity</hi>; but there is not the least intimation of <hi>Hatred</hi> in any passage of our Saviours life. So that it is the safest and most warrantable to be <hi>angry at,</hi> or <hi>pity</hi> wicked men, not to <hi>hate</hi> them; lest we become in some measure hateful our selves by putting on that so deformed vizard. As for <hi>sensual Lust</hi> and all <hi>Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousness,</hi> it is so conspicuous an Object of mortification, that he that does not hit the mark there, and strike dead, kills nothing at all. For it is the most crass and gross enormity of them all, and the most scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, and the most importunate disturber of men that make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and the greatest extinguisher of true <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Sense in Divine things</hi>; and so besmears the wings of the Soul, as it were with bird-lime, that she cannot move upward, nor at all release her self from the impediments of the Body, nor have any phansy nor conceit of what is Heavenly and Divine.</p>
               <p>But now <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Voluptuousness</hi> being exterminated, it is plain that <hi>Covetousness</hi> will be set packing; for it is ordinarily onely a purveior for those two Vices. And those that are the most sordidly covetous, are well aware that Mony being able to do all things, (let men talk what they will) they really are not, nor can be despicable.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Third and last is his <hi>Freedome to Righteousness.</hi> And that this is true, is very plain from what has been said before. For he being <hi>free from that load of unnecessary Ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>from the intanglements of fruitless and superstitious Opinions,</hi> and <hi>from the body of Sin</hi>; what can now hinder that Divine principle of Regeneration from acting chearfully, freely and comfortably? For every mountain is cast down, and every valley is exalted, and all is made plain and even before him, that with pleasure, ease and joy he may walk in the wayes of that Everlasting Righteousness that Christ brings into the world. For the Eternal seed of the Word that is engrafted in him, or that living law of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse planted in his heart, does as naturally guide and actuate him as the Soul does move an unshackled Body; and it is no more constraint or bondage in him to do what is truly good and holy, then it is to the unregenerate to do that which is natural or vitious.</p>
               <p>And thus have I plainly and truly set before you <hi>the Idea of a well-grown Christian,</hi> that has made his due proficiency under the mighty advantages of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> the Gospel of Christ; that we may know what to aspire to and breath after, and that we may never be quiet till we be possessed of this blessed &amp; happy condition. Which designe is of
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:55305:253"/>
so high consequence, that I shall hold my self very defective in my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereof, unless I adde also what would be serviceable for direction touching the entrance into this <hi>New Covenant</hi> we have described, and for our advance and progress in the same. Which we shall doe by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the adequate Object thereof, the true Principle that moves us to covenant, and the most effectual means to make us faithfull pursuers of what we first purposed and agreed to.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>THE adequate Object of saving Faith</hi> or <hi>Christian Covenant</hi> (For I mean by <hi>Covenant</hi> our faithfull and sincere closing with the terms of the Gospel) is that which we ordinarily call <hi>The New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament</hi>; that is to say, those concerning Truths that are there upon record, as well <hi>Precepts</hi> as <hi>Promises:</hi> all these are to be believed and assented to. Or, to speak yet more comprehensively, All that Christ is said there to have done or suffered, to have acted or procured for us, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good he has done for us already or promised for the future on his part, this is to be believed without any evil suspicion or wavering: And what on our part is required to be done, is also with a free and plenary purpose of minde to be accepted and promised, and with all stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and sincerity to the utmost of our power to be endeavoured after, without any fraud or tergiversation, without any elusive tricks or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse misconstructions of the holy Precepts of the Gospel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the very Inscription of this Record we call <hi>the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, bears before it the Notion of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> that is, of <hi>mutual obligation:</hi> though it may also signifie a <hi>New Law</hi>; Which title would more roughly confute those Hypocritical Flatterers both of themselves and their Followers, who by their deceitfull Interpretations would make them believe that nothing is expected on our hand in this Gospel-dispensation. And besides, a <hi>Law</hi> is not for nothing defined in <hi>Aristotle</hi> by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Covenant,</hi> it being <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Lycophron</hi> has defined it, <hi>The Law being our common sponsour or underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker that there shall be just dealing betwixt party and party.</hi> Nor can they decline the truth we aim by pretending that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is only <hi>the New Testament</hi> in such a sense as relates to <hi>dying</hi> men, and therefore may
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:55305:253"/>
signifie a right conveied to another without any mutual obligation. For in this sense it cannot be called a <hi>New Testament,</hi> because there was no <hi>Old</hi> one answering to it. For the <hi>Law</hi> of God, or <hi>Covenant</hi> by <hi>Moses,</hi> could not be called a <hi>Testament</hi> in this sense: For God the Father did not die, nor is <hi>Moses</hi> his Law any Legacy or last Will and Testament in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to <hi>Moses</hi> his death.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It remains therefore that <hi>Christianity</hi> is an <hi>obligatory Covenant,</hi> whereby party is tied to party, that is, God to man, and man to God; &amp; that the Mediatour of this Covenant is <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> whose bloud shed upon the Cross is the <hi>bloud of this Covenant</hi>; as your most sacred and solemn Covenants amongst the Nations, and with the Jews too, were (as I have above intimated) with the sprinkling of bloud. Which Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of sacrificing and effusion of bloud was nothing but an insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a mutual imprecation or commination of the highest evil to one another, if they dealt treacherously in the Covenant. <hi>Grotius</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces an ancient form of the Pagan Religion, which is express to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; <hi>Qui prior defexit, tu illum, Iupiter, sic ferito, ut ego hunc porcum hodie feriam, tantóque magis quanto magis potes pollésque.</hi> And so the <hi>Trojans</hi> and <hi>Graecians</hi> making a solemn Covenant, and religiously obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging one another to stand to the terms thereof, upon the sacrificing of lambs and pouring out a drink-offering to the Gods, one uttered this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation or Commination indifferently to either party that should prove false.</p>

               <p n="4">4. From this general notion and meaning of the <hi>Bloud in the sanction of Covenants,</hi> we may the better understand what is the meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in that Covenant which God has made with us through the bloud of Christ. For at his last Passion he called <hi>the Wine his bloud of the New Covenant to be shed for many for the remission of Sins,</hi> that is, for peace and reconciliation betwixt God and man. But in these solemn Leagues, Pacifications and Covenants, which were made with <hi>bloud,</hi> though it were a Ceremonie of agreement, yet <hi>the effusion of bloud</hi> did not cease to be of a comminatory signification for those that were faithless in their Covenant. So it is also much more with the bloud of the Son of God. As the peace is of higher concernment, so is the breach of Covenant of the greater danger. This the Authour to the Hebrews does expresly take notice of, and shews that upon wilfull misdemeanours and perverse revoltings from God, the expiatory and pacificatory virtue of the bloud of Christ then ceases, and the comminatory part takes place;
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:55305:254"/>
Hebr. 10.26. <hi>For if we sin wilfully after we have received the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins: but a certain fearfull looking for of judgement, and fiery indignation which shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the adversaries. He that despised Moses law died without mercy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two or three witnesses. Of how much severer punishment, think ye, shall he be thought worthy who hath troden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the bloud of the Covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy thing, and hath done despight unto the Spirit of grace?</hi> And therefore, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks 2 Epist. 2. <hi>It had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, then after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.</hi> Which persons he decyphers in he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going verse, That they were such as had escaped the pollutions of the World through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, but were again entangled therein and overcome, being brought into the bondage of sin by giving place to the deceitfull doctrines of <hi>Libertinism</hi>; as you may see more at large in that Chapter.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Wherefore it appears out of what already has been said, That there are <hi>Terms</hi> to be performed on out part in this <hi>New Covenant</hi> as well as there are <hi>Promises</hi> on God's part, and that Christianity is no such loose, remiss and inert Religion as some Deceivers would make it: which we shall make still more plain from several other testimonies of Scripture. Matth. 11. <hi>The Kingdome of Heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</hi> Whence is plainly intimated that no lazy or careless endeavours will carry us on to the enjoiment of the Promises of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. As elsewhere, <hi>He that laies his hand to the plough and looks back, is not fit for the Kingdome of God.</hi> And Luke 13.24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the streight gate: For I say unto you, many shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able. Because streight is the gate and narrow is the way that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth unto life; but wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and many there be that goe in thereat.</hi> As it is in the parallel place of S. <hi>Matthew.</hi> Which plain places of Scripture one would think should awake those filthy dreamers out of their mischievous conceits &amp; opinions, whereby they would make us believe the Evangelical dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation is so soft and delicate a thing, that there is no laying of the hand to the plough, no crouding or striving, but that we shall be carried to heaven on that easie featherbed of <hi>unactive Faith</hi> or <hi>fanatick Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism.</hi> Whenas the Evangelical Oracles tell us that we are to <hi>work out our Salvation with fear and trembling</hi>;<note place="margin">Phil. 2.12. Ephes. 6.12. Hebr. 12.4.</note> that we are to <hi>run</hi> and to <hi>wrastle,</hi> to <hi>fight</hi> and to <hi>resist even unto bloud.</hi> 1 Cor. 9.24. <hi>Know ye not that they that run in a race, run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run that ye may obtain. And every one that strives for the victory, is temperate in all things. Now they doe it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly: so fight I, not as one that beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the air. But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest by any means when I have preached to others, I my self should become a cast-away.</hi> And yet S. <hi>Paul</hi> was as chosen a vessel as the choicest of these pieces that befool themselves so with self-flattery, that they think they have found an easier way to Salvation then <hi>Paul</hi> himself knew, that
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:55305:254"/>
think they shall get the victory and the crown by not fighting against their own corruptions, but by beating the Air with knackish forms of graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous speeches and vain grandiloquence that tends to nothing but the mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of their own Hypocrisie and unfaithfulness in the Covenant, and to the seduction and ruine of others.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But S. <hi>Paul,</hi> however they would abuse some passages in him to the favouring of their ill cause, is an utter disclaimer of such false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and does yet more expresly tell us That the promises of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel are conditional. <hi>This is a faithfull saying</hi> (saith he to Timothy, 2 Epist. chap. 2.) <hi>If we be dead with him, we shall also live with him: if we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he will also deny us. If we deal unfaithfully in the Covenant, yet he is faithful and cannot deny himself:</hi> He will stand to his Covenant in all the intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses thereof, whether to <hi>punishment</hi> or <hi>reward.</hi> And Rom. 8. <hi>There is therefore now no condemnation to those that are in Christ Iesus</hi>; but their qualification presently follows, <hi>that walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit:</hi> and ver. 8. <hi>They that are in the flesh, cannot please God. But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be the Spirit of God dwell in you: and if this Spirit be in you, the body is dead unto sin.</hi> And again, <hi>If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if through the Spirit ye mortifie the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</hi> And ver. 16. <hi>The Spirit it self bears witness with our spirits, that we are the Children of God. And if Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then Heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ; if so be we suffer with him, that we may also glorified with him.</hi> Which plainly implies that the Inheritance of Heaven, or Kingdome of glory, is a <hi>conditional</hi> Kingdome or Inheritance. And not to speak of Kingdoms, we shall not so much as have remission of sins but upon condition. Matth. 6.14, 15. <hi>For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses.</hi> What can be more evident then this?</p>

                  <pb n="480" facs="tcp:55305:255"/>
implied, or else it could be no <hi>Covenant.</hi> This therefore being premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, we shall the better understand what is that due affection and qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of mind that is required of him that would enter into this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or what it is whereby he has really entred into it. For it is not a mere <hi>Historical Faith</hi> or <hi>Belief</hi> of those things that are in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, and an acknowledgment that they all tend to the peace and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of man, and that he is obliged to live up to the utmost of his power to those holy Precepts that are there conteined; but further, there is a <hi>love and liking of the said Precepts as well as a desire of the enjoiment of the promise of Eternal life,</hi> and a sincere resolution of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring to live as near as he can according to those Evangelical Rules, and a chearfull expectation of <hi>Divine assistance,</hi> that God will enable him by the cooperation of his Holy Spirit to make such due progresses in life and Godliness as shall become an unfeigned professour of Faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He that upon the perusal of the Records of the Gospel, as they are found in the New Testament, or by what other way soever the substance thereof is communicated to him, and so upon informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his errours and mistakes, whether in opinion or practice, is thus affected as we have declared; it is manifest that he has already <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented</hi> him of his sins and errours, and is in a real mislike of his former Conversation, so far forth as it was unconformable to the mind of Christ. So that the state above described does plainly implie <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> which comprehends in it a rejection of such apprehensions as we now have discovered to be false, and an abhorrence from and sorrow for all our misdeeds, with a willingness to make satisfaction where we have done wrong, if it lie in our power, and a proneness to take revenge of our selves in curbing our selves and cutting our selves short of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary enjoiment of such things as are in themselves lawfull, they being for the present not so expedient for us, but rather hurtfull and dangerous.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He that is thus affected as we have described, and can thus willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and sincerely close with Christ, and receive him as <hi>King</hi> as well as <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Prophet,</hi> and holds himself bound in duty to live in the World as he lived, following his Example in all things, and has (as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready said) a love and liking of those Graces he has recommended to the World, is a fit <hi>New-Covenanter.</hi> For flesh and bloud has not revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led these things unto him, but the Spirit of God that remains in him; he being born again not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible, the word of God that lives and abides for ever. Of this state may be understood that of S. John, <hi>Whosoever confesses that Iesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him and he in God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 4.15.</note> and chap. 5. <hi>Whosoever believeth that Iesus is the Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 5.1.</note> 
                  <hi>is born of God.</hi> And this is that <hi>new birth</hi> without which there is no entrance into the Kingdome of Heaven, namely, unless a man be born of <hi>water and of the Spirit</hi>; that is to say, born of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> which is figured out in <hi>Baptismal water</hi>; which is the outward sign of this inward Regeneration, whereby a man is a capacity of thus Covenanting with God, obteins remission of sins in Christ, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a real and visible member of his Church.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="481" facs="tcp:55305:255"/>4. And when he is thus born into the Church, he is not then taken into the armes of absolute Omnipotency to support him, defend him, and nourish him: but there is much-what the same reason that there is of a young plant newly sprung out of the earth, or a young child newly born into the world; unless they meet, the one with a carefull and skilfull Gardener, the other with good Nurses, they are both in hazard of being spoiled with one sad accident or other; their growth may be hindered, if not life extinguished, by neglect or untoward handling. For the influence of Grace is not always irresistible, nor the purpose of it undefeatable, but is much-what as the power of Nature and her offerings and attempts towards the perfection of those <hi>Species</hi> of things she produces,<note place="margin">Book 8. ch. 11. sect. 6.</note> as I have also above noted. She works alwaies towards the best, but may be checked or stopped; and the Spirit (the Apostle saies) may be <hi>quenched</hi> as well as natural Fire. And though Nature freely offers that comfortable principle of life, the fresh Aire, yet the Lungs of the child may be so stuffed by the unwholsome milk of a wretched and unfaithful Nurse, that he cannot receive it, to continue life and health, but the poor Infant must be forc'd to yield to the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the disease, and to dy by their hands who professed to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister life and nourishment to him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is the same reason in those that are as yet Infants in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, that have really a life and sense and desire to what is truly good, but are not yet come to that growth but that they are to suck from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. If they that pretend to nurse them up impart poison in stead of the sincere milk of the Word, there is no question but they are in very great danger of losing that life they are newly begotten into, and of falling from this New Covenant. That there were of old such <hi>Nurses</hi> or rather <hi>Witches</hi> that, in stead of feeding these Infants, suck'd the very bloud and life of Religion out of them, several passages in the Epistles of the Apostles do intimate,<note place="margin">Book 8. ch. 5.</note> as I have already taken notice, namely, That they were little Children whom those Impostours would make believe that they might be righteous, though they were not righteous as Christ was righteous. Which is to squeeze cold poison into their mouths, not to suckle them with the saving milk of the Word. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a more faithfull Nurse, and taught <hi>Titus</hi> to be so too, Chap. 3. where after the mention of the entrance into this new Covenant by the <hi>washing of Regeneration</hi> and the <hi>renewing of the holy Ghost,</hi> he presently addes, <hi>This is a faithfull saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they which have believed in God should be careful to maintain good works.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. X. <hi>1.</hi> The First Principle the new-Covenanter is closely to keep to. <hi>2.</hi> The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Principle to be kept to. <hi>3.</hi> The Third and last Principle.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WHerefore that there be no Recidivation nor standing still, but that there may be a due advance and growth in the Christian life, the First Principle that the new-Covenanter is to adhere to stedfast and unshaken, is this, That there is an indispensable obligation in this new Covenant of living up so near as we possibly can to those Precepts of the Gospel that are delivered either by the mouth of our Saviour himself or the holy Apostles; and that we are not to allow our selves in any thing that our own consciences tell us is a Sin; nor be discouraged as men out of hope, if we finde our selves, against our own meaning and purpose, at any time mistaken; but with chearfulness and confidence in the mediation of our Saviour to adde more resolute endeavours and the greater circumspection for the future, making even an advantage of our lapses, that sudden surprisal or any errour or frailty brought us into, for an higher and more speedy advance in the Divine life. These two considerations of our <hi>indispensable obligation to duty,</hi> and <hi>Christs Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession and propitiation for us,</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> has prudently bound up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1. Epist. 2. <hi>My little children, these things I write unto you, that you sin not. But if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Iesus Christ the righteous; and he is a propitiation for our sinnes, and not for ours onely, but for the sinnes of the whole world. Hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his Commandements. He that saith I know him, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his Commandements, is a liar and the truth is not in him. But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected.</hi> As this point is exceeding clear,<note place="margin">Book 8. ch. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11.</note> as I have more largely proved elswhere: so is is most necessary to be believed and to be remembred perpetually, that we may keep our selves safe from tasting, touching, or coming any thing near the sight or sent of that lushious poison of <hi>Libertinisme</hi> (let it be coloured, sugared over or perfumed with the most gracious termes or glorious expressions that the deceivable Eloquence of man can put upon it;) and that we may shun the breath of such a Seducer, as of one that is infected with the pestilence, and whose converse is death and the eternal ruin of our very Souls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second Principle that he is closely to keep to is, <hi>That</hi> (I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most said) <hi>Omnipotent Faith in God through Christ:</hi> I mean <hi>the belief of the assistance of his holy Spirit to overcome all manner of sin in us.</hi> For if we keep up duely to this, nothing will be able to withstand us, but by patience and perseverance we shall be able to beat out Satan out of his strongest holds. <hi>According to thy faith so be it unto thee,</hi> is true as well in Christs healing our Souls as in his curing the bodies of the sick when he was upon earth. This is a prime branch of <hi>that saving Faith,</hi> and the greatest strength and sustentation we have to keep us from sinking
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:55305:256"/>
back into sin, and from being drown'd and carried away with the flouds of ungodliness. If we let this hold go, all is gone: For they that doe not believe that they have power to resist sin, must of necessity give up themselves captives to it. And this is that which makes S. <hi>Paul</hi> so affectionately devout in the behalf of the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> that God would be pleased to give them this special gift of <hi>Faith</hi> for their strength and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboration of the inward man; chap. 3. <hi>For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, That he would grant you according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; That Christ may dwell in your hearts by Faith; that ye being rooted and grounded in love,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Book 8. c. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according as I have elswhere rehearsed. And in the <hi>Doxologie</hi> immediately following this prayer, of what uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable efficacy the operations of the Spirit are in us, the Apostle again does intimate in a very high strain, <hi>Now unto him that is able to doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding abundantly above what we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory in the Church by Christ Iesus throughout all ages world without end.</hi> Which words plainly imply that such is the inexhaustible richness of Grace and Assistance from the Spirit of God, that the effect of its inward workings in us is for the present not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, much less expressible. Wherefore our <hi>Faith</hi> cannot be too great in this supernatural Principle; and the greater it is, the greater courage and the more speedy and more absolute victory.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And yet there is still another Principle that will further actuate our <hi>Faith,</hi> and make us still more lively, resolute and invincible; and that is <hi>The Love of Christ</hi> which every young Christian is to warme himself with, and inflame his courage more and more: which he will best do by <hi>frequent Meditations upon Christs Passion,</hi> what shame, what sorrow and pain he underwent to gain the love of Souls, and so to try them to himself in those sweet and inviolable bands of sincere love and friendship, that by this golden chain he may pull them up after him from Earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Let therefore our new-Covenanter as often as he reflects upon the exceeding great love of his Saviour, and finds his heart begin to grow hot, being touch'd with a ray from that celestial Flame, that bright Sun of righteousness that now shines at the right hand of God, let him be sure to remember what compensation he requires for all that dear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection he has shewn to us. The lesson is but short, and therefore must not be forgotten, <hi>If you love me, keep my Commandements.</hi>

               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="484" facs="tcp:55305:257"/>1. THE young Christian being thus armed with <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> and an <hi>unwavering sense of his duty in becoming holy even as he that called him is holy,</hi> he will be then both willing and ready to look his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the face, and to seek them out if he cannot at first sight finde them, and to pull them out of every hiding-place of Hypocrisy, and bring them into the open light and slay them. And if after diligent search he can finde none, yet he will be so modest as to distrust the measure of his skill, and will be earnest in Prayer to God to discover what inward hidden wickedness there may lurk yet in him, to the end that the <hi>old Leven</hi> may be utterly cast out, and that there may be nothing left that is contrary to the Scepter of Christ and the Kingdome of God in his heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For indeed it is impossible that one is truely regenerate and has the seed of God and the life of his Spirit actually in him, should be quiet till all that which is unholy and corrupt be wrought out. But the case is much-what as in the <hi>natural body</hi> that is sick, either <hi>death</hi> or <hi>health</hi> will in a competent time possess the body. If the morbifick matter be not carried away by sweating, purging or some evacuation or other, Life it self will be carried away: but if that which is contrary to life be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, Health must certainly take place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And so it is in the <hi>Divine life</hi> it self, when it has taken root and growth, whatever is contrary to it, is burdensome to it, like that <note n="*" place="margin">Book 8. ch. 5. sect. 8.</note> ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannick project of tying the living and the dead together. Wherefore the true Christian can never be at ease and rest till he has cast off that heavy load, the body of sin, the old man that stinks earthily and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savourly, if he be perceived at all, and indeed so unsufferably, that the divine life and sense in a man cannot endure it. Nor can endure to be in a condition so sensless that there should be any of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>our Leven left, and yet there be no perception of it. And therefore the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate address to the throne of Grace in a living Christian is, that God would be pleased to discover whatever ugliness or deformity there is in him in either practise or principle. Which God of his mercy does by degrees, not all at once, that there may not arise overmuch distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and confusion. But if we be not wanting to our selves, the work will be accomplish'd in due time, and the Kingdom of heaven, as well within as without,<note place="margin">Matt. 13.31.</note> will be as a grain of Mustard-seed. The <hi>Crisis</hi> of the disease will be in a competent time, as I said before, and our whole man re-enlivened with the Spirit of God, and restored to the state of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For verily to be quiet upon any other terms but these, is not to be <hi>a Son of the Second Covenant,</hi> but a <hi>careless Slave under the First,</hi> that acts not out of a principle of Love and inward Life and liking, but out of some external respect, and cares not how little he does or what is the frame of his mind, so he may but scape being well cudgelled for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and receive at last the promised wages of his Master. But under <hi>the Second Covenant</hi> the case is quite otherwise. For the true Christian there is <hi>impatient of Sin,</hi> merely <hi>because it is Sin,</hi> and bears the same
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:55305:257"/>
analogie to the sense of his Soul that a wearisome or torturous disease does to the sense of his Body; and therefore it is intolerable till he be freed from it; and that the more, by how much the more assured he is that it is contrary to the will and minde of Christ,<note place="margin">Book 8. c. 6, 7.</note> who came into the world to heal us of our iniquities and to free us from all sin.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And therefore lastly, we are never to rest contended till we find our selves through the power of God arrived to this state and frame of spirit, (and that in such an height as is competible to humane nature,) that there may be nothing undestroied that is contrary and opposite to the Life of God in us. That that may be fulfilled which is prophesied in Isaiah,<note place="margin">Isai. 41.11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>That they that fight against Israel shall be as nothing; and they that strive with him shall perish. Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not finde them, even them that contended with thee; they that war against thee shall be as nothing and as a thing of nought.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. AND this may serve for a more <hi>general</hi> direction and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but we shall annex also what is of more <hi>particular</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For we have express'd our selves hitherto, as if so soon as a man were under the Second Covenant, there needed nothing but the finding out of his Sins: for then armed with <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> he could suddenly destroy them. But that I may be rightly understood, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without <hi>some time of conflict.</hi> But the stronger he is in these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vertues, the Victory will be the easier and the speedier. But in the mean time the Flesh will be working against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the Flesh; and <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness</hi> is required on our side that we doe what God already has put into our power. And assuredly
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:55305:258"/>
it is in the power of the new-Covenanter to mortifie all manner of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and immoderate desires in due time by this short and infallible method, viz. <hi>By a constant denial of their cravings.</hi> Give a Begger no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at thy door, and he will never visit thee. Desire is starved by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unfulfilled. A man you know often loses his appetite by staying over-long for his dinner.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Inordinate Desire</hi> will haunt a man like an Ague, if we pamper and satisfie it. The Devil and the Sop will both down into our bellies at once. But thou maiest pine out both <hi>Desire</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi> that lurks in it by a pertinacious <hi>Temperance</hi> or stopping thy self in thy outward Actions. Affect not <hi>Vain-glory</hi> and <hi>applause</hi> in thy outward actions or speeches, but modestly decline it, and <hi>Pride</hi> will fall in thy Soul. In good time thou shall finde <hi>Humility</hi> rise in thy heart, and sweetly shine in thee with her milde light. Give not thine <hi>Anger</hi> vent, and it will be extinct like smothered fire. Answer not thy <hi>Lust</hi> or <hi>Lasciviousness,</hi> and it will cease to call unto thee, but die as a weed trod down into the ground. Dare to doe good, though thy base heart gainsay it; and pleasure thy very enemies, those that hate thee or envy thee. For <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> being thus oft crossed, will out of discontent at last quite leave thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But if thou be false to God and thine own Soul in those things which he hath put in thy power, <hi>(and he hath put the outward man plainly in thy power,)</hi> and neglectest the performance of them, and yet dost complain of want of strength; thou art in plain English an <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,</hi> and dealest treacherously with Christ in the Covenant, and the Devil and thine own false heart have deceived thee. Thou colloguest and flatterest with thy lips, and tellest fair stories of the Loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and free Grace of God in Christ; but thy heart is far from him: For <hi>whosoever names the name of Christ, is to depart from iniquity,</hi> as has been already noted out of the Apostle.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But now in the second place, as we are faithfully to persist in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant abstinence from outward evil actions, and in a perpetual exercise of such as are good; so we must by all means have a special care that we <hi>take not up our rest in these,</hi> and so make this <hi>new Covenant</hi> a mere <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works,</hi> as if by these external performances we did so <hi>oblige</hi> Christ as that he were <hi>bound</hi> to give us Heaven by way of gratitude or of bargain and purchase: we dealing craftily herein, as poor men doe sometimes with great Persons, presenting them with something of small value, to get from them a reward of far greater worth; they having in the mean time no cordial affection to those they present with their gifts, but only baiting the hook to catch a fish. Nay, I adde further, That <hi>personal</hi> Love and Affection merely upon this account of being exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally beneficial to us in dying for us and delivering us from eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, even this does not fill up the End and purpose of the Second Covenant. For this were little better then a kind of mercenary Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and such as is competible to the mere Natural man: for he can love him that does him such a good as his very Animal frame or temper is sensible of. But our <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Friendship with Christ</hi> must be still
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:55305:258"/>
more inward and more intimate, we being tied to him not only by the <hi>sense of external Benefits,</hi> but by <hi>Unity of Spirit</hi>; there being the same <hi>Life and Spirit</hi> in us that was in him here on Earth. And therefore there will be in our very Souls an high <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>ineffable pleasure</hi> and <hi>liking</hi> of that <hi>Nature and Spirit</hi> that breaths in all the actions and speeches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of our Saviour, and a <hi>transporting delight</hi> in all the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the Gospel, whether delivered by himself or his holy Apostles; they will be sweeter then the honey and the honey-combe, and more desirable then thousands of gold and silver, as the Prophet David speaks.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Wherefore we are never to be quiet till we find our selves fully enamoured on the very <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Genius,</hi> as I may so speak, <hi>of our blessed Saviour,</hi> and find our selves <hi>so affected as he was affected in the world.</hi> And therefore we are to adde to our external profession <hi>fervent Prayer</hi> to God, not only to resist temptations, or to doe outward good works; but that he would also wholly renew our nature in us, that our Regeneration may be perfected, and that we may be entirely transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into the lively Image of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. And this not only at set times, but continually as we have opportunity and vacancy from the throng and urgency of worldly affairs. For then should we commune with our hearts, and meditate on that divine Image and Character, <hi>The Life of Christ,</hi> and observe wherein we are most wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and to what part thereof our affections are the most cool; and so with serious and earnest ejaculations to God implore the help and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Spirit to compleat the good work that he has begun in us: and so we shall fulfill that Precept of the Apostle,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5.27.</note> 
                  <hi>Pray continually,</hi> that is, whether upon the emergency of some temptation, or upon self-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations and devout Meditations.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And as we are to <hi>pray continually,</hi> so we are to <hi>watch continually,</hi> that is, to pass from one transaction to another with circumspection; making our very converse with men and affairs in the world an advantage to our main design of improvement in the <hi>Divine Life.</hi> For coming thus out into company and emploiment, we have thereby a present exercise of that Grace that is in us, and can find thereby the better our own inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and defects, as also what strength we are of, and what proficiency we have made in the way we have chosen. And so what we have, will be thereby corroborated; and what we want, being discovered to our selves, we know the better to ask it at the hands of God.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Thus will the work assuredly go on by <hi>perpetual Meditations, Prayer and Watchfulness.</hi> And while thou art thus taken up with thy self, take heed how thou meddlest with other men. And particularly <hi>beware of despising the publick Ordinances of thy Church.</hi> For thou mayst hear the same advice given thee in the open congregations that thou hast assented to as true in thine own Conscience, from a faithful and knowing Ministry. Which, if thou beest what thou pretendest to, will delight thy heart, both in that it is a Testimony of the Truth, and that it may take effect in others by God's blessing as well as in thee. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no sign of a <hi>New-Covenanter,</hi> but of a <hi>proud and carnal mind</hi> and of a <hi>wicked designer,</hi> to vilifie these things.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="488" facs="tcp:55305:259"/>8. Moreover thou art to take this Advertisement along with thee <hi>concerning thy converse with men,</hi> That first thou censure not any man for external matters of an indifferent Interpretation, in <hi>Diet, Apparel,</hi> or <hi>Civil behaviour,</hi> whether he be more courtly or plain in carriage, whether more chearfull or more sad, whether he drink wine or refrain from drinking, whether he wear good clothes or goe in a meaner dress; and so of other things of like nature. Thou oughtest I say to passe no censure, no not so much as in thy tacit thoughts, about these things, but esteem every man from what is truly Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an or Unchristian in him. And then secondly, Thou art carefully to take heed that the just liberty of another lead thee not into any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, by tempting thee to imitate him. But thou art strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to keep to what thou knowest in thine own Conscience to be most for thine own safety; that the good work may goe on in thee, and that Righteousness may have its firm rooting and full growth. But in the mean time thou art to look after thy self as a tender child or sick person, who are rightly forbidden such things as grown men and in health take their liberty to make use of. These two Cautions will prevent all <hi>Scandal</hi> whereby thou maiest either harm thy self or be injurious to others.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Lastly, I shall more particularly and expresly recommend to thee the frequent Meditation of these three branches of the <hi>Divine Life, Humility, Charity</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> together with their deepest Root <hi>Faith in God through Iesus Christ.</hi> For if this be not taken in, thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in the Second Covenant may degenerate into a mere accustoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or complexional frame of <hi>Morality,</hi> and have nothing in it that is <hi>really Divine.</hi> I am sure it will not be of that nature as to fit thee for that Eternal salvation that is promised to those that are true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. And as concerning those Three branches of the <hi>Divine Root,</hi> I would have thee to place them ever in thine eye, and examine all the motions and excursions of thy Spirit into outward actions, how sutable they are to these, and closely observe when thou thinkest thy self so zealously carried out by the moving of one of these Principles, if thou dost not run counter to another. Nay, it may be thy <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastick</hi> Heat may carry thee so far as to sin against that very Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that thou thinkest thy self to be moved by.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Thus whilst thou affectest too extravagant expressions of thy <hi>Humility,</hi> the discreet and knowing in Religion will thereby find out thy <hi>Pride.</hi> As if thou shouldest not be content to entertain the poor at thy table, but thou wilt also wait upon them with a trencher in thy hand, bare-headed, and doe all the offices of a Servitour to them; as if thou wert celebrating the old <hi>Saturnalia.</hi> Look to thy self that there be no touch of <hi>Vain-glory</hi> in it, and that thou dost not desire to be talked of. Consider also if it be not an offence against <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and a scandalizing those that are without; who, if they can fansie thee sincere, will be forcibly invited to deem thee very fanatical and melancholick, and that all Religion is nothing else. But true <hi>Charity doth nothing unseemly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="489" facs="tcp:55305:259"/>11. When the desire of <hi>Purity</hi> also puts thee upon the chastisement of thy body, doe it so hiddenly that thou maiest not offend against <hi>Humility</hi> by thy <hi>Pharisaical</hi> ostentation. Wherefore if thou dost give thy mind to the mortification of the flesh, shew it not to men in thy sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did clothes, nor in thy sour face and hard looks; but keep it to thy self as secret as thou canst, <hi>that he that seeth in secret may reward thee openly.</hi>

                     </gap> us.</hi> Which is not to be expressed, as usually is done, by vilifying and reproaching all other Religions, in damning the very best and most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciencious <hi>Turks, Iews</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> to the pit of Hell, and then to double lock the door upon them, or to stand there to watch with long poles to beat them down again, if any of them should offer to emerge and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to crawl out. This Fervour is but a false zeal and of no service to the Gospel, To make it impossible to all men to scape Hell, that are not born under or visibly converted to Christianity, when they never had the opportunity to hear the true sound thereof. For if Providence be represented so severe and arbitrarious, it will rather beget a misbelief of all Religions then advance our own, especially with all free and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Spirits.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And what need they tell such sad stories to them that hear the Gospel concerning them that hear it not, nor ever were in a capacity of hearing it? it touches not them, but disturbs these that hear it, and makes Divine Providence more unintelligible then before. Were it not sufficient for their Auditors to understand, That they that doe hear the Gospel and yet refuse it, that they are indeed in a damnable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the belief thereof being the very <hi>Touchstone</hi> of Salvation to them that it is offered to? But if they will be curious, (which is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable quality,) they can onely adde, That none shall be saved but by virtue of that Truth which is comprehended in the Gospel, that is, before they come under that one Head of the Church, which is Christ
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:55305:260"/>
Jesus; <hi>there being no other Name under the Heavens whereby we can be saved,</hi> as the Apostle has declared. But how the consciencious <hi>Iews, Pagans</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> that seemed not to <hi>die</hi> Christians, may be gathered to this Head, it will be a becoming piece of Modesty in us to profess our Ignorance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Certainly it were far better and more becoming the Spirit of the Gospel, to admit and commend what is laudable and praise-worthy in either <hi>Iudaisme, Turcisme</hi> or <hi>Paganisme,</hi> and with kindness and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion to tell them wherein they are mistaken, and wherein they fall short; then to fly in their faces and to exprobrate to them the most consummate wickedness that humane nature is lapsable into in matters of Religion, and thus from an immoderate depression of all other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions to magnifie a mans own. Which is as ridiculous a Scheme of Rhetorick, in my apprehension, as if one should compare <hi>Solomon</hi> with all the natural fools in the world, and then vaunt how exceeding much he out-stripped them all in Wisdom; or <hi>Helena</hi> with all the ugly deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Females that ever were, and so argue the excellency of her Beauty, because she so far surpassed these mishapen wretches: which in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a very small commendation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But such demonstrations of our affections as these are very sorry and injudicious. He that professes he believes the Truth of the Gospel, and has entred into this New Covenant, if he will give a solid testimony of his sincere affection to it indeed, <hi>he must doe it by his life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</hi> For if he <hi>like</hi> it and <hi>believe</hi> it, he must needs follow the counsel conteined in it; which if he do closely and faithfully, he will finde it of that unspeakable excellency and important concernment, that he cannot rest quiet in reaping the fruit thereof himself, but will be truly desirous that the same good may be communicated, if it were possible, to all the world.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And truly for my own part, when I seriously consider with my self and undeniable clearness and evidence of Truth in the Gospel of Christ above all the Religions in the world, and the mighty and almost irresistible power and efficacy that lies in it for the making of men holy and vertuous; I cannot but with much fervencie of desire wish it were further spred in the World, and am much amazed that it has made no further progress then it has. For as <hi>Brerewood</hi> has probably collected in his <hi>Enquiries, Pagan Idolatry</hi> still possesses <hi>two thirds</hi> of the known world, <hi>Mahometisme</hi> one <hi>fifth part,</hi> and <hi>Christianisme</hi> but a <hi>sixth.</hi> And (what is a thing more deplorable) a very great part of the Christian Church has been overrun with the <hi>Turk,</hi> and does lie at this very day in miserable bondage under him. And that there may be nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to encrease wonderment, even those parts of the world that are purely Christian, as to <hi>Title,</hi> so great share of them, whether they go under the name of <hi>Reform'd</hi> or <hi>Catholicks,</hi> are tainted with so gross <hi>Hypocrisy,</hi> such open <hi>Prophaneness</hi> and professed <hi>Atheisme</hi> amongst their own Crews and loose Conventicles, that it is something hard to finde <hi>a cordial Christian</hi> in the most pretending Churches of Christendome, that does <hi>not deny his profession</hi> either in <hi>heart</hi> or <hi>practice</hi> or in <hi>both.</hi>

               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="492" facs="tcp:55305:261"/>6. Which sad Scene of things cannot but move any thoughtful Christian, that does in good earnest wish well to his Religion, to sift out, if it be possible, the true Causes of his lamentable condition of Christendome, and what are the <hi>Impediments</hi> that hinder the Gospel (which of it self is so powerful an Instrument as it is of Salvation) from taking effect with out selves, or from having freer passage into other Countries that are yet Pagan. That it is our Sinnes, every well-meaning man will be ready to reply. But the question still remains, there being amongst us the most effectual Engine that the Wisdome of God could contrive for the destroying of Sin out of the world, why there is no more execution done thereby against the power of Sin and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Darkness then there is. The enquiry therefore must be what tampering there has been with this Engine, what adding or taking from it, to spoil its efficacy, what mistakes of the use thereof; and the like. For that there is something most wretchedly amiss in the use of the Gospel throughout all Christendome, is very plain, in that the <hi>Purpose</hi> of it is almost <hi>totally frustrated</hi> every where; and <hi>Prophaneness, Infidelity</hi> and <hi>Atheisme</hi> have in a manner seized the hearts of all. Which most men are ready to confess, some with a true Christian sorrow or hearty indignation, others with a tacit joy or exteriour flearing, as being glad their corrupt thoughts and practices have the countenance of so many suffrages.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To omit therefore such Principles as are unintelligible and are for ever seal'd up out of our sight; let us look upon what is intelligible and visible. Let us produce such <hi>Causes</hi> into view, which no man can deny but that they are as general as these horrid diseases, and are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely inclining, if not absolutely effectual and necessitating the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world into this abominable condition it is found in at this day, and many Ages before.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>1.</hi> The most fundamental Mistake and Root of all the Corruptions in the Church of Christ. <hi>2.</hi> That there maybe a Superstition also in opposing of Ceremonies, and in long Prayers and Preachments. <hi>3.</hi> That self-chosen Religion extinguishes true Godliness every where. <hi>4.</hi> The unwholsome and windy food of affected Orthodoxality; with the mischievous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences thereof. <hi>5.</hi> That Hypocrisy of Professours fills the World with Atheists. <hi>6.</hi> That the Authoritative Obtrusion of gross falsities upon men begets a misbelief of the whole Mystery of Piety. <hi>7.</hi> That all the Churches of Christendome stand guilty of this mischievous miscarriage <hi>8.</hi> The infinite inconvenience of the <hi>Superlapsarian</hi> doctrine.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WHerefore freely to profess what I think in my own conscience to be true; <hi>The most universal and most fundamental Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in Christendome,</hi> and that from whence all the Corruption of the
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:55305:261"/>
Church began and is still continued and increased, is that <hi>conceited esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Orthodox opinions and external Ceremony, before the indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble practice of the Precepts of Christ, and a faithful endeavour to attain to the due degrees of the real Renovation of our inward man into true and living Holiness and Righteousness:</hi> in stead whereof there is generally substituted <hi>Curiosity of Opinion</hi> in points imperscrutable and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Obtrusion of Ceremonies,</hi> numerous, cumbersome, and not onely need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, but much unbeseeming the unsuspected modesty of the Spouse of Christ, who should take heed of symbolizing any way with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which is <hi>spiritual Adultery</hi> or <hi>Fornication.</hi> For while the Heart goes a whoring after those outward shows, and an over-value be put upon them, the inward life of Godliness will easily be extinguished, and Love to the indispensable Law of Christ grow cold and dead. Nay they that have the greatest zeal and fierceness, as I may so speak, towards Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is invented such an heap and cumbersome load of external performances, that such a <hi>Zelot</hi> as this may spend all his strength up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mere Outworks of Piety, before he can come near to take the <hi>Fort Royal,</hi> or enter the <hi>Law of perfect Liberty,</hi> the <hi>Divine Life,</hi> which consists in true <hi>Humility,</hi> perfect <hi>Purity</hi> and sincere <hi>Charity.</hi> For all such <hi>Ceremonies</hi> make but a show in the flesh, nor can reach to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation of our Mindes into the unfeigned Love of our brethren. Whence the <hi>most seemingly religious this way</hi> may be the <hi>most</hi> accursedly <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>unjust,</hi> the most <hi>implacable</hi> and <hi>uncharitable</hi> that can be. And yet according to that false model of Religion that humane invention has set out to the world, he may both take himself, and others also may take him to be Seraphically pious; though in the judgment of Christ and of his true Church he lie in the gall of Bitterness and bond of Iniquity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And in other parts of Christendome where the pomp of <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> and <hi>exteriour Superstition</hi> is not so much urged, though a man at first sight might hope that things would be much better, yet experience will teach him that there is little amendment, and that the Causes of Degeneracy, of gross Hypocrisy and Wickedness, are even as operative and as well appointed to work their effect there as in other places. For this also is <hi>Superstition,</hi> to place our Religion in opposing external Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and to think every man the more pious by how much the more zealous he is against them. Wherefore our affections being drawn out in this hot Antipathy, our hearts grow cold to the indispensable duties of the Gospel; which are <hi>Love, Patience, Meekness</hi> and <hi>brotherly-Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> with the rest of those fruits that demonstrate that the Tree of life, that the Life of Christ is planted in us, and that the Spirit of God abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in us. Besides that we are to remember that we may idolize <hi>long Prayers</hi> and <hi>frequent Preachments,</hi> and that they may make up an <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Religion to us in stead of <hi>that Godliness</hi> that is <hi>indispensable</hi> and <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> and an ever-flowing fountain of all comely and profitable Actions and deportments towards God and towards men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I say therefore that this <hi>Self-chosen Religion</hi> in all the parts of Christendome (though it be but such as a wicked man may perform
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:55305:262"/>
as dexterously and plausibly as the most truly righteous and regenerate) being so highly extolled and recommended to the people, is almost an irresistible temptation to make them really and morally wicked. For that natural inclination and appetite in mankinde to Religion being sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied or eluded by this unwholsome food, they can have no desire to that which is true Religion indeed; and will be very glad to be excus'd from it, it being more hard at first to embrace or practice, whence it is in a manner necessary for them to let it alone.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And they will the more easily abstain from it, there being ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poisonous V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>and that swells them so that they are ready to burst again, which is that highly-esteemed Knowledge called <hi>Orthodoxness</hi> or <hi>Rightness of Opinion.</hi>

                  </gap> God by <hi>opinionative Knowledge,</hi> how do they betray their gross Ignorance! For how can that which is more pleasing to the <hi>natural man,</hi> nay, I may say, to the <hi>Devil</hi> himself, then to a <hi>regenerate</hi> Soul, how can that render any one acceptable to God? And yet in all the Divisions of the Churches they lay the greatest stress upon this, bear the greatest zeal to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it, recommend it the most vehemently to the people, who following the example of their Pastours, if they be but busie &amp; hot in these rending points, they think themselves fully possest of the life of Christ, and that they are very choicely religious, though in the mean time Charity to their neighbour be cold, &amp; they have attain'd to no measure of true Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Holiness. Herein chiefly lies the mystery of <hi>Hypocrisy</hi> in all the Churches of Christendome, counting all pious that are but zealous for the waies and opinions of their Sect; and those that are not for it, be they never so unblameable and cordial Christians, they are either hated as <hi>Hereticks,</hi> or at best pitied for poor <hi>Moralists,</hi> mere <hi>Natural Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. These are the most general and very potent Impediments for the hindring the Gospel of taking that effect which it would otherwise have in the Christian World, and for making most of the professours of Christianity <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> that is, such as make a great show of Godliness, but deny the power thereof, which should mainly appear in our duty to our Neighbour and in a sober and just conversation, doing all things as in the sight of God. Now this <hi>Hypocrisy</hi> in Professours begets <hi>Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Atheisme,</hi> and <hi>Unbelief</hi> in such persons as naturally have not so strong propension to matters of Religion, that is to say, that have not so superstitious a Complexion as to be tied to Religion upon any termes in any dress and from any kinde of Recommenders of it. For their natural Nasuteness suggests, that if there be any <hi>Religion</hi> at all, most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is not to be divided from sound <hi>Morality,</hi> to which truly both the Prophets, Apostles, and Precepts of Christ do plentifully witness. But they observing that they that make the greatest noise about Religion,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:55305:262"/>
and are the most zealous therein, do neglect the Laws of <hi>Honesty</hi> and <hi>common Humanity,</hi> that they can easily invade other mens rights, that they can juggle, dissemble and lie for advantage, that they are proud and conceited and love the applause of the People, that they are envious, fierce and implacable, that they are unclean and sensual, that they are merciless and cruel, and care not to have Kingdomes to flow in bloud for the maintaining of their Tyranny over the consciences of poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded Souls; (when yet the contest is nothing but about hay and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the combustible superstructures of <hi>Humane Invention</hi>: of which every vainglorious <hi>Superstitionist,</hi> that would make a show in the flesh, has cast on his handfull, if not his arm-full, for the hiding and smother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the indispensable Truths of the Gospel, and to put men into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities and labours for that which is not bread, to rack their heads with Nonsense, Contradictions and Impossibilities, to weary out their bodies with the thankless toyle of endless and needless Ceremonies, and to carry out their heart to toyes and trifles, and so make them neglect the holy and weighty commands of our Saviour, which are intelligible to all men, and in some measure approved by all; such as are, <hi>To deal as we would be dealt with, To love our neighbours as our selves,</hi> and the like) I say, those that are not of so religious a Complexion naturally, but have wit and sagacity enough to smell out the Corruptions and discern the Incoherences of the Actions of Professors, making observation of these things, are by this Scandal exceedingly tempted (and very hardly escape the being quite overcome by so perverse a Scene of pretended Piety) to think that the whole Business of Religion is nothing but Humour and Madness, or, at the best, but a Plot to enrich the Priest and keep the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in awe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This is one great Scandal and effectual counterplot against the power of the Gospel, <hi>the Vilifying and despising of Moral honesty</hi> by those that are great Zelots and high Pretenders to Religion. This does advance <hi>Atheisme</hi> and <hi>Prophaneness</hi> very much. But there is another Miscarriage which I have hinted at already as Epidemical and Universal, and at least as effectual to this evil purpose as the former. There is scarce any Church in Christendome at this day that does not obtrude not only <hi>Falshoods,</hi> but such Falshoods that will appear to any free spirit <hi>pure Contradictions</hi> and <hi>Impossibilities,</hi> and that with the same Gravity, Authority and Importunity that they doe the holy Oracles of God. Now the consequence of this must needs be fad. For what knowing and consciencious man but will be driven off, if he cannot profess the truth without open asserting of a gross lie? If he sees good wine pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of one bottle, but rank poison out of another into the same cup, who can perswade him to drink thereof? This is a heavy sight to the truly-Religious, but the joy and triumph of the Prophane, who willingly take this advantage against the whole Mystery of Piety, as if there were no truth at all in it, because that so gross Falshoods are urg'd upon them with the same Indispensableness, with the same Solemness &amp; Devoutness, as those things that (were it not for the serious Impudence of the Priest in other open falsities) might pass with them for true. But
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:55305:263" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they being not at leisure to perpend things to the bottom, but it may be not altogether indisposed to believe a faithfull report from an honest man, they finding the Relater foully tripping in some things that he so earnestly urges, discredit the whole Narration, and so become perfect <hi>Atheists</hi> and <hi>Unbelievers</hi>; though, for their own security, they juggle with the Juglers, that is, comply and doe outward reverence and devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though they cannot but laugh in their sleeves at either the Ignorance or cunning Deceitfulness of their Ghostly Leaders.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And that I may not seem to slander the state of Christendome, I mean of the whole visible Church in what Nation soever under Heaven; if we may believe Historians, there is none, neither <hi>Greek</hi> nor <hi>Roman,</hi> neither <hi>Lutheran</hi> nor <hi>Calvinist,</hi> but will be found guilty of this fault. I shall particularize in some one thing in all. The <hi>Greek</hi> as well as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> hold <hi>Transsubstantiation,</hi> the <hi>Lutheran Consubstantiation</hi>; things that have no ground in Scripture, and are a palpable contradiction to Reason. And yet not more contradictious then <hi>Absolute Reprobation</hi> according as our rigid <hi>Reprobationers</hi> have defined it: namely, <hi>That God has irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly decreed from all Eternity to bring into Being innumerable Myriads of Souls of men exceeding far the number of them that shall be saved; who as without their own consent they were thus thrust into the World, so let them doe what they will, are certainly determined to unspeakable torment so soon as they go out of it, and at the last day shall be adjudged to an higher degree of misery, so great and so exceeding, that all the racks and tortures that the Wit or Cruelty of the most enraged Tyrants could ever invent or execute, would be ease and pleasure in Comparison of it, and that these Pangs and Torments shall remain fresh upon them for ever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. This is the Representation of that sour <hi>Dogma.</hi> Which to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is as contradictious as if one should name a <hi>square Circle</hi> or <hi>black Light</hi>; and as harsh and horrid to the eares of the truly-Regenerate into the nature of God, who is <hi>Love</hi> it self, as the highest blasphemie that can be uttered. Nor is the nature of those that are irreligious enough so much estranged from the Knowledge of God, but that they think, if there be any at all, he cannot be such a one that laid such dark plots from all eternity for the everlasting misery of his poor impotent and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting Creature, that never did any thing but what the Divine Decrees determined he should doe, and therefore was alwaies the Almighties obedient servant: For which at last he must be condemned to eternall punishment by him whom he did ever obey. The serious and imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obtrusion of such a dismal Conceit as this for one of the greatest <hi>Arcanums</hi> of Religion, will make the free Spirit and over-inclinable to Prophaneness confidently to conclude, That the whole frame of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is nothing but a mere Scar-crow to affright Fools, and that there is no Hell at all, since such Innocent Persons and constant Obeyers of the <hi>Divine Decrees</hi> must be the Inhabiters ot it.</p>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the World to condemn the World, but that the World through him should be saved.</hi> And Titus 3. <hi>For we our selves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. But after that the Kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, Not by works of Righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us abundantly through Iesus Christ our Saviour.</hi> To which sense also the Apostle speaks, Ephes. chap. 2. <hi>And you who were dead in trespasses and sins, Wherein in times past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the Prince of the power of the Aire, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom also we all had our conversation in times past, in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of our fleshly minde, and were by nature the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath even as others. But God who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved) and hath raised us up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Iesus; That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness towards us, through Iesus Christ.</hi> To which lastly you may adde Tit. 2.11. <hi>For the grace of God that bringeth salvation, hath appeared to all men; Teaching us, that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world,</hi> &amp;c. These
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:55305:264"/>
Scriptures give plain testimony of this more general designe of the Gospel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next designe is <hi>an external exaltation of the Divine Life that did so mightily and conspicuously appear in the Person of our Saviour Christ</hi>; as I have already abundantly declared, How the mystery of Christianity comprehends in it chiefly this designe of exalting into Triumph the <hi>Divine Life</hi> above the <hi>Animal</hi> and <hi>Natural:</hi> and that either <hi>externally,</hi> in the religious worship we do our Saviour, and is done even by Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and wicked Persons; or else <hi>internally,</hi> in the advancing of true Faith and Holiness in his living members and sincere followers of his doctrine. Philip. 2. <hi>Let the same minde be in you which was in Christ Iesus, Who being in the forme of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God; But emptied himself and took upon him the forme of a servant, and was made in likeness of men; And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to the death, even the death of the Cross. Wherefore hath God also exalted him, and given him a name above every name; That at the name of Iesus every knee should bow, of things in Heaven and things in Earth and things under the Earth, and that every tongue should confess that Iesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</hi> And Hebr. 1. <hi>Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; the Scepter of righteousness is the Scepter of thy Kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God even thy God hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed thee with the oile of gladness above thy fellows,</hi> that is to say, hath exalted thee to this due honour and rule, having put all things under his feet, Angels themselves not excepted, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, 1 Epist. 3.22. <hi>Who is g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne into Heaven, and is on the right hand of God, Angels and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities and Powers being made subject unto him.</hi> There is a further enumeration of the <hi>Angelical classes,</hi> Colos. 1. where the Apostle speaking of this high exaltation of the Person of Christ, he intimates not only the Subjection of the Orders of Angels to him, but their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to God by him, and, as some would have it, a fuller Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of them in his favour, vers. 15. <hi>Who is the Image of the invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God, the First-born of every Creature. For by him were all things created that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, visible and invisible; whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers: all things were created by him and for him; and he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the Head of the body the Church. He is the Beginning, the First-born from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell: And making peace through the bloud of his Crosse, to reconcile all things by him unto himself, whether they be things in Earth or things in Heaven.</hi> So mighty and wonderfull was the result of the Humiliation of our Saviour; and so clear and warrantable an Object is he of Divine Adoration.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thus is the <hi>Divine Life</hi> Triumphant in the Person of Christ the Head of his Church. But another main design of the Gospel is, <hi>That the Divine Life may be advanced in us,</hi> that is, that <hi>Faith</hi> in God through Christ, that <hi>Humility, Love</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> may have their due growth in
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:55305:264"/>
us here; that thereby we may be fitted to receive that immortal Crown of Glory which he will bestow upon all true believers at the last day, when he shall carry his whole Church with songs of Joy and Triumph into his celestial Kingdome. That this is the main purpose of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell I have already sufficiently proved, and therefore need adde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this place.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth and last Rule or Measure of Opinions is, <hi>The Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendableness of our Religion to those which are without</hi>; that is to say, We must have a special care of affixing thereto any of our own Inventions or Interpretations of Scripture for Christian Truths, which may seem uncouth and irrational to strangers and such as are as yet disengaged. For though those that by reason of their education have had full acquaintance with Christianity will adhere to their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though it may be corrupted with many false glosses and fond opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men as indispensably obtruded as the undoubted Scripture it self: yet strangers that are free and unaccustomed to them, will not fail to boggle at them; and being offered to them also with equal Authority with the very Word of God, they will be necessitated to fly back, and to relinquish the Holy Truth by reason of the indissoluble intertexture of the gross falshoods they find interwoven with it. A thing that is seriously to be considered by all those that bear any love to the Gospel, and desire that it may be propagated and promoted in the World. For certainly it was intended for a more general good and larger diffusion then has been hitherto by reason of its having fallen into faithless and treacherous hands, who make it only an instrument of gaining wealth and power to themselves and of riding the people, and not of gaining souls to God.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THese are the <hi>four main Rules</hi> which I conceive very usefull to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine either other mens Opinions or our own. And if the heat of our spirits or the confidence of others would urge upon us pretended Truths (for to admit of open falsities or forgeries for what advantage soever is intolerable,) that are not subservient to these designs above named, we may well look upon them as idle curiosities; and if they pretend also to Revelation or Inspiration, that it is nothing but Madness and fanatick Delusion. But if they do not only not promote but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine those designs above mentioned, they are to be looked upon
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:55305:265"/>
then not as frivolous, but dangerous and impious, and so to be declined by all means possible. And lastly, though they appear such as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute something to those designs if followed and embraced, yet I must adde also this caution, that they are not to be forc'd so as that unless a man will profess them, he must be accounted no good Christian. For they coming from a fallible and doubtfull hand, they ought not in reason to infringe that undoubted right of Christian liberty; the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture alone being full enough to perfect a Christian both in life and doctrine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is also a further use to be made of these Rules in favour of one anothers persons though of different Opinions, that is, by taking notice what good they drive at, as well as what evil they tend to: which makes much for peace and brotherly kindness, and may blunt the edge of eager and bitter zeal, that makes the over-fervid Zelot think that he that is of a contrary opinion to him intends nothing but mischief by his opposite doctrine. In examining therefore every Opinion, we are to observe what design of the Gospel it agrees with, as well as what it cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. And that the Use of our Rules may the better appear, I shall now shew the practice of them by trying some few Opinions of no small note by this Touchstone: For it were an endless business to examine all, and needless, because by these examples he that lists may examine the rest, indeed any that either has been or ever will offer it self to the World in matters of Religion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The first that occurrs is <hi>such an Election and Reprobation that wholly excludes Free will.</hi> The Controversie is so well known that I need not state it. Applying this doctrine to the <hi>four Rules</hi> I have set down, I find in the Third that it has some compliance with that choice branch of the <hi>Divine Life,</hi> namely <hi>Humility,</hi> and a submission of a mans self and all the World to the will of God.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3.18.</note> 
                  <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe what he pleases.</hi> And that therefore a serious and humble Soul being much taken up and transported with this consideration, may think of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but take this Doctrine to be very Truth, nay live and die in it, and go to heaven when he has done. Whence it were a piece of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical</hi> Fury to persecute any such <hi>Opinionist</hi>; and want of Charity, these living as well as other Christians, not to bear as good affection to them as to others; nay to advance our affection with the superaddition of pity, they living in something a more dark mansion then others; which will plainly appear if we applie their Opinion to the rest of the Rules and the Particulars of them, which we have set down.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For if we make application to the First, that tells us that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the Gospel is the Manifestation of the exceeding superabundant Loving-kindness of God to the World,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.9.</note> 
                  <hi>who would not any should perish, but that all should come to repentance,</hi> as S. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks. This sad Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Predestinatours</hi> does confront this design at the very first sight, making the Goodness of God such an half-faced thing, nay I may say of a more thin and sparing aspect then the sharpest new Moon, nay an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely less proportion, if their dolefull stories be true. For to speak summarily of the business; Some very exceeding small number shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily,
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:55305:265"/>
by the free grace of God, be eternally saved, but the rest ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily damned to ineffable, eternal and unsupportable torture. This is that glorious redundant Grace of the Gospel according to them. Which free Spirits will think the worst news and most mischievous that ever was communicated to the World. <hi>The worst,</hi> because so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme few shall be saved. <hi>The most mischievous,</hi> because it will hazzard all men to be damned according to the ordinary course of Reason. For, whenas things are determined already, who need stir a foot unless to please himself and reap the present joies of this life?</p>
               <p n="5">5. For it is very irrational for us to be sollicitous and trouble our selves to bring that to pass which will every jot as soon come to pass without our trouble. So that unless a man be, beyond all conceit, fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish and sottish, and cannot reason concerning things, he will be necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated almost, I am sure, very strongly invited, to be as loose and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as his own heart or the temptations of the World can suggest to him. Whence it is plain that this doctrin in it self, though it may impose upon some by the shew of <hi>Humility,</hi> is a Supplanter and Destroier of the whole <hi>Divine Life</hi> Root and Branch, that is, It weakens mens Faith also in the Gospel, if this be peremptorily obtruded upon them to be all the Design of it; it slakes all endeavour of good practice, takes them off from the aspiring to that blessed Regeneration and Renovation of their minds into <hi>Purity, Love,</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> it self, which they most pretend to. And therefore most generally, though they seem to crouch to God, yet are they very prone to be too-too rigid, sour, and even cruel to men, full of Pride, Dissension and Confusion. So that the Unworthiness of this Opinion is discernible also by the Third Rule.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And does entrench something also upon the Second. For whereas, according to their own concession, the value of the bloud of the Son of God was such that it might have been a Ransome for ten thousand Worlds; what a check would this be to a mans more affectionate Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of him upon the Cross, when he thinks he has restrained the purpose of his suffering to so exceeding few? Nothing but Self-Love and Self-Flattery can well bear up a mans devotion. What an ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thing have they made the tender Compassion of God in Jesus Christ, whenas he is represented to us, according to their explication of the Mystery, at the same time to have found out a full satisfaction to his Justice for the sins of the whole World, and yet at that very moment to have decreed in a manner all the World to eternal damnation; and this forsooth to make manifest his Justice, which is sufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested by the death of his Son? Is not that <hi>freer grace</hi> that is intended for all, and they put in a capacity of receiving it, if they be not wanting to themselves, then that which is only necessitated on some very few, and for want of which the rest must necessarily perish? Wherefore upon these terms a man cannot conciliate that venerable affection which is due to our Saviour, nor indeed beget a belief of the Narration in more nasute and sagacious men. Which is an entrenchment against the Fourth Rule also, which should awe us from peremptorily affixing any thing to our Religion that will make it less recommendable to them that are
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:55305:266"/>
without, as certainly this Opinion does to all indifferent men. Which makes me amaz'd at the sedulous obtrusion of it by some men, whom I can charitably conclude to be, as well as hey are accounted, in their way religious and godly. For it is a piece of unsufferable Pride and Conceitedness to think themselves infallible in a point where free men, at least as pious and religious, if not more, have seriously and industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously concluded the contrary; especially when such gross inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are discernible therein.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>1.</hi> That <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation</hi> conferrs something to <hi>Humility. 2.</hi> That some men are saved irresistibly by virtue of <hi>Discriminative Grace. 3.</hi> That the rest of Mankind have Grace sufficient, and that several of them are saved. <hi>4.</hi> The excellent use of this middle way betwixt <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme</hi> and <hi>Arminianisme. 5, 6.</hi> The exceeding great danger and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of the former Extremes.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THere is nothing makes this Opinion pardonable, but that shew, as I said, that it bears of <hi>Humility</hi>; and haply it is in some regard really serviceable thereto. And I should take it to be very instrumental to take away all <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Arrogance,</hi> or attributing any thing to our selves, or contemning our neighbours, if the Professours of it were generally of so meek, so humble and so lowly a Spirit; whenas they are too often over-harsh, fierce, and contemptuous of others. But this may not be the fault of the Opinion, but of the <hi>Opinionist,</hi> though that sad severity of God tied up in this same pretended Mystery is no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing example of Kindness and Humanity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But to the end that choice and lovely vertue of Christian <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> may want no motives nor encouragement, and that that pleasure that some Souls may justly take in the free acknowledgment of God's irresistible Grace and over-powering Operations upon their Spirits may not be suffocated nor extinguished; we shall make such an accomodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt both parties, that unless Envy and Repining at the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God toward mankinde make them still dissatisfied, I question not but that they will rest contented. I profess therefore and do verily think, That there is such a thing as <hi>Discriminative Grace,</hi> as they call it, in the World, and that to such a difference for good, that some few of Mankinde by virtue thereof will be <hi>irresistibly</hi> saved, but that the rest of the world are <hi>Probationers,</hi> that is, have free will and are in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of being saved, some greater, some less; and that whosoever is damn'd,<note place="margin">Eccles. 15.12.</note> it is long of himself. For (as <hi>Siracides</hi> saith) <hi>God has no need of the wicked man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And that this may not seem to be a mere Subterfuge, like that of some others, I further add, touching all this rest of Mankind which I speak
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:55305:266"/>
of, That there is <hi>Grace sufficient</hi> offered to them some way or other, some time or other, and that several of them, according to their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness to that light and power which God has given them, shall be actually saved. At which sentence neither the <hi>Arminian</hi> ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine nor the <hi>Calvinist.</hi> For whatever good <hi>Arminianism</hi> pretends con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all mankind, is exhibited to this part not absolutely elected, and to the other part the Goodness of God is greater then is allotted by <hi>Arminius.</hi> And whatever good there is pretended in <hi>Calvinism</hi> to that part that is absolutely elected, the same Goodness is here exhibited, and besides that direfull vizard pull'd off that Ignorance and Melancholy had put upon Divine Providence and on the lovely Face of the Gospel.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I may adde to this, That he that finds himself in an extraordinary powerfull manner carried to that which is good, may as fully ascribe it to God's free grace, as in the <hi>Calvinistical</hi> Hypothesis; and he that has no mind to Goodness cannot lay the fault on God but himself. Nor can Satan tempt by that forcible stratagem to either <hi>despair</hi> or <hi>disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteness,</hi> suggesting that if a man shall be saved, he shall be saved, or if damned, he shall be damned, and that he can neither help on the one nor hinder the other. For unless a man be very deeply radicated in Faith and sincere Obedience, I should hold it a piece of fond Self-Flattery to take himself for one of the Elect, whenas he may hold of a more seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tenure, and act accordingly as a <hi>Probationer:</hi> and when he has got to that irrelapsable condition of those whose Souls are after a manner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in Faith and Holiness, it will better become him then to entitle God alone to all those Transactions wrought in him, and to take up that saying of Jacob,<note place="margin">Gen. 28.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Verily God was in this place, and I knew it not,</hi> and name the place he slept in <hi>Bethel,</hi> The Temple of God: For such is the body of every Regenerate Christian, and especially of the Elect.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This Concession of ours thus far, as it is most true, and certainly not unserviceable for the promoting that <hi>thankfull</hi> and <hi>humble</hi> frame of Spirit that would attribute all to the Irresistibleness of free Grace and to the force of their particular and irrevocable Predestination and Election; so is it also a mighty safeguard from those dangerous miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages that too often happen the other way. Wherein there being no mean, but one must be <hi>either Elect or Reprobate,</hi> how prone is it out of Self-love to take up a stout and peremptory conceit that a man is the Childe of God destinated thereto before the foundation of the World, and that he can no more miss to be saved then he did to be born? But as for others, poor <hi>Offalls</hi> and <hi>Out-casts</hi> of the Creation, that they can never find out the way to Heaven and Salvation, do what they can, let them importune God and vex and weary Nature never so much; but are like <hi>Sampson,</hi> with his eyes put out, brought upon the stage of this World only to make the <hi>Philistims</hi> merry, or at best to be mere foils and blacks to set off the beauty and lustre of the secure Saints: who being unavoidably caught as it were in a nooze or fast snare of Salvation laid for them from all eternity, so soon as they once phansy themselves taken by the leg, do so bounce and dance in the string with that enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and violence, as if they tried by their wild tugs and jerks,
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:55305:267"/>
whether the force of their Corruption or the <hi>Decretall thread</hi> be the stronger.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Nay do grow up to such a pitch of Fool-hardiness, as to think themselves not possibly able to run themselves out of breath by the most wild and dissolute courses imaginable, nor remove themselves one hairs breadth out of God's favour for all this. In fine, do proceed so far as to acknowledge no <hi>Law</hi> but their own <hi>Lust</hi> and the fulfilling their own masterless will, and consequently do conclude that they cannot sin. Thus imitating a false Pattern, and making themselves compendious Puppets or Pocket-medals of that great Idol of theirs (for it is no God) <hi>that wills,</hi> as they say, <hi>merely because he wills.</hi> And so they dance and sport about the imagination of their own heart, as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel, in the Law-givers absence did about the molten Calf. Thus has this dark Conceit, which some rash spirits have endeavoured to make essential to Christianity, led many one into secure <hi>Libertinism</hi> first, and after into most desperate <hi>Atheism.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. THE next Opinions that occur are those concerning <hi>the Divinity of Christ</hi> and the holy <hi>Trinity.</hi> And first, those of the Schools, of which I shall only say in general, That though their industry and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their design may be commendable, which was to unite the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Christ of <hi>Hypostatically</hi> to the Divinity, that there should be no suspicion of Idolatry in doing the highest divine Honour to Him we call the Son of God, and that therefore what they drive at is very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the second Rule we have set down; yet for my own part I think they have made so little proficiency to the main End, that that one plain expression in <hi>Athanasius, As the Body and Soul is one man, so God and Man is one Christ,</hi> is better then all their curious definitions of things, which reach to no greater <hi>Hypostatical</hi> union then that of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi>; whenas I dare say, if it were searched to the bottom, the Union betwixt the <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Humanity</hi> in Christ is more one and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act then that of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> which they call <hi>Hypostatical.</hi> But they have defined things so unskilfully and perplexedly, that though their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign be agreeable to our second Rule, yet their performance does clash much with the third and fourth: Such contradictions or unintelligible spinofities weakening Faith, and hindring the passage of the Gospel to them that are without.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="505" facs="tcp:55305:267"/>2. Which may be rightly said also concerning their subtil and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent disquisitions and conclusions touching the <hi>Trinity.</hi> Wherein though their design be in the same respect commendable as before, yet they have made the mystery so intricate and contradictious, that they weaken the Christian Faith to those that are within, and make it less passable and recommendable to strangers; and have given occasion thereby to some bold Spirits, it being so disadvantageously represented to them, to deny the whole Mystery, whereby they have purchas'd to themselves the Title of <hi>Antitrinitarians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Whose Opinion I look upon as fundamentally repugnant to Christianity it self, if the New Testament be the foundation of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. For I know nothing more express then that in those Writings. And therefore the denying of the <hi>Trinity</hi> is the denying of the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the New Testament. Or if they will pretend they can interpret things there so as to evade this doctrine, by the same reason I think they may evade any, and so still the sacred Writ shall stand for a cypher, and signifie nothing; which tends mainly to the enervating of our Faith, and is a gross entrenchment upon the third Rule.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And truly I think it may be made to appear that it is also particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly against the second. For the <hi>Divinity of Christ</hi> does not fall in so handsomly and kindly without the supposition of a <hi>Trinity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Book 1. c. 4, 5.</note> as I have els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where intimated; and therefore I look upon it as a special piece of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that so explicite a knowledge of the Godhead in the <hi>Triunity</hi> thereof was so generally made known to the world together with Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, that the Eternal Son of God might be worshipped through Christ, and the whole Deity, as I may so say, distinctly honour'd and adored.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But they will reply, that though they deny the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of Christ, namely that the Eternal Word was made Flesh, yet they assert that <hi>Divine Honour</hi> is due unto him, and therefore do not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress against the second Rule. For they acknowledge that though Christ be <hi>but man,</hi> yet God has given him all power in Heaven and in Earth, and that he shall return visibly to judge the quick and the dead, and that <hi>as the Father has life in himself,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 5.26.</note> 
                  <hi>so has he given him to have life in himself,</hi> that is, the power of enlivening us and quickening us at the last, and of changing these vile bodies of ours into the similitude of his glorious body. And therefore that their Opinion serves the End of Christianity as well as the other in reference to <hi>Divine Worship</hi> due to Christ, and is more sutable to the fourth Rule; these perplexities of <hi>Christs Divinity</hi> and the <hi>Triunity</hi> of the Godhead making our Religion less passable and recommendable to those that are without.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But to this I answer, First, as before, That to take away the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Divinity of Christ</hi> is to take away the Authority of the New Testament, or to take such a liberty of forcing and distorting the sense of things, as will make it contemptible and useless; then which what can be of more dangerous consequence? It will be a Trespass not only against one, but against all the Rules I have set down, and make the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel pass very ill not only with strangers, but our selves too, and turn <hi>Christendome</hi> back to <hi>Infidelity</hi> and <hi>Paganisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="506" facs="tcp:55305:268" rendition="simple:additions"/>But Secondly, I deny that the Scripture declares any thing concerning the <hi>Divinity of Christ,</hi> or the holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> that is impossible, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictious, or more unintelligible then things that men do ordinarily assent to, that are free Philosophers, and admit nothing upon force or Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, but upon Reason; and That the Union of the Eternal Word with the humane Nature of Christ is as conceivable for the <hi>Modus</hi> as the Union of the Soul and Body: That the Intricacies of the Schools are fooleries, and not to be taken into our Religion: That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture only sets forth a <hi>Triunity</hi> in the Godhead in general, not obscured by any terme that can entangle any one of a tolerable wit and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, unless he will be so blockish as to think, because the second Hypostasis in this <hi>Trinity</hi> is called <hi>Son,</hi> that the <hi>Father</hi> was married and had a wife, as the <hi>Turks</hi> fondly object; whenas nothing else is signified but that the <hi>Son</hi> is from the <hi>Father,</hi> and the Holy Ghost from both.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That the first Author &amp; Beginner, or at least the most eminent Renewer of this Sect that so boldly and stoutly denies the <hi>Trinity,</hi> was one, though of a leguleious Wit, yet so inept and averse from Divine matters, that he flatly denies that <hi>the Existence of God</hi> is discoverable by the light of Nature and Reason. And after he has found him by help of Scripture, as he thinks, yet he has missed him. For that which is not Infinite in Essence, cannot be God. And therefore it is no wonder if he hangs off so heavily from the admission of that more distinct and full knowledge of him manifested in the holy Oracles, &amp; that those that sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolize so much with his Genius in other things follow him also in this.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The noblest Spirits &amp; best Philosophers that ever appear'd in the world for the Knowledge of Nature and of God, and that some Ages before Christ, of their own choice without force or obtrusion held the <hi>Triunity of the Godhead</hi>; which though I will not avouch to be perfectly right in all things, (they being even over-accurate in the describing of it, &amp; therefore well may trip) yet for the main is such that there is reason for it, but none at all against it, &amp; it is very sutable in the general to those gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral intimations in the Scripture. Nor do I believe any Christian bound to hold the Theory in the set formes of humane Invention, though he may peruse them &amp; believe as much as he thinks good, and do think it a decent thing, that his Reason cannot perfectly reach nor exhaust so profound a Mystery, &amp; that therefore he is to make up the rest in humble Adoration.</p>
               <p>Fifthly and lastly, By denying the <hi>Triunity of the Godhead</hi> and <hi>Divinity of Christ,</hi> other Articles of our Faith are made incredible, and that <hi>Divine Adoration</hi> we give to Christ suspected of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> For it will not seem credible to strangers, especially that abhor such superstitions, that God ever exalted any mere man to such a pitch as the <hi>Socinians</hi> themselves acknowledge Christ is exalted; but that it is some cunning plot to lapse the World or retain it in <hi>Idolatrous Worship.</hi> It will also seem to them incredible, if Christ be mere man, that he should <note n="*" place="margin">John 5.26.</note> by a power in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as he professes, be able to perform his promise at the last day, that is, to raise us all to a glorious and immortall life, changing these bodies of flesh into a pure celestial substance; which is an act for none but the Deity to doe. And therefore if it be done by any thing in himself, it is
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:55305:268"/>
by the Deity residing in him, by the Eternal Word by whom all things were created: Who was said to be the Son of God before the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and after the Incarnation both he that was born in time and this Eternal Word is look'd upon as one Son of God by real and Physical union. From whence that is easily understood which we alluded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>As the Father has life in himself, so has he given to the Son to have life in himself.</hi> But our Adversaries way is very unconceivable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible, and therefore doth plainly transgress against the Rule he pretends it most agrees with, the making Christian Religion recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to them that are without.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As also he does herein against the third Rule in no small measure. For by spoiling Christ of his Divinity and of being acknowledged in very truth the Son of God, all those condescensions of his which he stooped to for our good, the esteem of them is much slackned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed, and will not stick the mark so strongly as upon this ancient and universal Hypothesis of the Church of Christ, who did acknowledge that he was really the Son of God; which must needs enhance the esteem of his Sufferings exceedingly, and therefore more effectually melt our affections into the greater remorse for Sin, and stouter resolutions to mortifie and kill all inordinate motions and desires, all perverse and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt suggestions of our Natures, be it never so harsh to us, and bring them under the scepter of the crucified Jesus. Which this Sect so little considers, that they very hardly are drawn to acknowledge Christs death a Sacrifice for sin; and so by their dry, harsh and rash reasonings expunge one of the chiefest Powers and choicest Artifices of the Gospel for the making men good.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

<pb n="508" facs="tcp:55305:269" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men sensible of their great need of him; and seeming to promise ease and security to careless sinners, may also make the Gospel more passable to those that are without, that have a minde to enjoy this world as well as that which is to come, and is as plausible to such kinde of people as <hi>Roman</hi> Indulgences and Pardons, Absolution upon slight Penances, and the like. To which kinde of errours and miscarriages I cannot but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute a great part of the degeneracy of Christendome at this day. Nor can I imagine how the more perfectly Reform'd Churches could have failed of proving generally excellent Christians indeed, if these Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Imaginary Righteousnesse, Empty Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Invinciblenesse of Sin,</hi> had not stept into the room of those Follies and Errours they had fled from. Whence it is apparent how highly they transgress a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the third Rule, and consequently how cautious men should be of either receiving them or communicating them to others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For as for <hi>Imputative Righteousness</hi> it is very suspicious, seeing the Scripture is silent therein, that it is the suggestion of Hypocrisie and Deceit to undermine that due measure of Sanctification whereunto we are called. For otherwise this invention is utterly needless, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christs Passion being sufficient to expiate whatever sins we fall into from any pardonable Principle. Which Sacrifice were utterly needless, if the perfect Righteousness of Christ were so imputed to us as that we might reckon it our own. For then were we as righteous as Christ, for he has no greater Righteousnesse then his own whereby he is righteous. And <hi>this Righteousness</hi> consisting as well of <hi>abstaining from sins</hi> as <hi>doing acts of Righteousnesse,</hi> it is plain that all this is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, and that therefore hereby we are to be accounted of God as never to have sinned, and therefore there wanted no Expiation for sin; and so Christ died in vain. For the imputation of his Righteousness will serve for all. Wherefore an opinion so absurd one cannot imagine why any should be so well pleased with, unless they intended it a shelter for sin, and to excuse themselves from real Holinesse and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither do I know to what end but this men should so zealously press the Opinion <hi>of being saved by Faith alone,</hi> in such a perverse sense as some do, not meaning thereby <hi>a living Faith working by Love,</hi> but we must be justified by Faith prescinding from Charity, Obedience, and whatever is accounted Holy and Just. But it is plain, that unless a man will say he is justified by a <hi>dead Faith,</hi> which is no more <hi>true Faith</hi> then a <hi>dead corps</hi> is a man, that <hi>real Sanctity</hi> will as surely accompany <hi>Faith</hi> as <hi>Light</hi> does the <hi>Sun</hi>; and that the controversie is as ridiculously rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of <hi>Faith,</hi> whether it <hi>alone justifie,</hi> as if one should move a question whether the Sun alone makes it day. For if they mean the Sun without the raies, it is evidently false; but if they mean the Sun alone without the Moon or Stars, it is as evidently true. But by prescinding life from Faith, and contending that it justifies, is as incongruous as to assert that the Sun without Light makes day, and as mischievous as to insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate that inward Sanctity is not necessary to Salvation. And therefore when they talk of <hi>Faith alone,</hi> they ought to explain themselves so as
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:55305:269"/>
that they may not be understood to exclude <hi>Christian</hi> Holiness, but <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daicall,</hi> and what other needless, imperfect and superstitious Principles of Justification men have stood upon in the world, and withall to urge an <hi>operative Christian Love,</hi> which is the fulfilling of the Law.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To this <hi>Imputative Righteousnesse</hi> and <hi>Iustifying Faith,</hi> from which they would fain disjoyn real Sanctity, they adde <hi>Christian Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> whereby they would insinuate the <hi>Invinciblenesse of Sin.</hi> So that two of these Opinions suggesting That that due degree of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness we have spoken of (nay indeed any degree thereof) is <hi>needlesse,</hi> and this other, That it is <hi>impossible,</hi> what can this tend to but an utter neglect of all Holiness in Christian Conversation? The profession of which frame of Religion, though some take it to be a great piece of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, yet that Apostle whose expressions they too often abuse, declares that it is a <hi>mere mocking</hi> of him, as if they did <hi>naso suspendere adunco</hi>;<note place="margin">Gal. 6.7.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked; as a man sows, so shall he also reap.</hi> For this abuse and perverse application of the Mystery of Christianity to lewdness and secure wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness is a mere deluding and <hi>mocking</hi> of the benigne counsel of God in Christ.

               <p n="5">5. Is not this a <hi>mere mocking</hi> and confronting of the Divine Majesty, whenas he has sent Christ into the World on purpose <hi>to redeem the world from their vain Conversation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.18.</note> and to abolish or destroy the works of the flesh and the devil, to tell God in our devotions a long story of our own <hi>Fleshliness</hi> and <hi>Devilishness,</hi> and to intimate to him to his face, that however his Free-Graciousness is content it should be so, and that in the application of Christs Righteousness God cannot nor will not see any Unrighteousness of ours; and therefore, which is worst of all, after many long and tedious narrations, of which the greatest part is a very foul and black Catalogue of our faults, to depart out of his presence without either Hope, Resolution or Endeavour of being any thing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then we are: Is not this, I say, to pervert and make ridiculous the good counsel of God even in his own hearing, and to jeer him to his face? But however he may connive for a while at these follies or affronts, yet he will not alwaies keep silence and hold his hands:

He will not alwaies be put off with solemn whimperings, Hypocritical Confessions, ruful faces, sore arms and legs tied up and set on wooden stumps, with dolefull acknowledgements of but wilful Misery and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, of feigned and counterfeited Maimedness and Inability.

               <p n="1">1. ANd thus much of that <hi>creeping Hypocrisie</hi> that walks with a still and demure pace in these Opinions of <hi>Imputative Righteousnesse, Empty Faith and Invincible Infirmity:</hi> Contrary to which is that <hi>flaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hypocrisie</hi> of the high-flown <hi>Perfectionists,</hi> whose Constitutions yet are ordinarily as unsound as the former, and far more opposite and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the very frame and spirit of the Gospel; nay, I dare adde that it is an Opinion cunningly urg'd by the envy of the Devil himself upon hot, fierce, eager and melancholy Spirits, that fly high and are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding subject to Self-Pride and Arrogance, to obliterate in them the remembrance of the Passion of Christ, and to elude the use of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sacrifice, to slake the affections of men to him, and to draw them off from dependence any way on his Person. Which we may be the better assured of, if we consider what <hi>easie Laws</hi> they measure their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> by and their Freedom from Sin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For any ill Motions, though never so strong, if not assented to, they have no shame nor conscience of; and if they be carried by the strength of Temptation to commit the act, then they lay the blame on the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuosity of the assault, conceit themselves to be only as ravished Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins (according to the softness of their phansie and favourable opinion of their own sincerity) deflowred against their own will, and still stand upon Self-Justification. And what is yet more execrable, when they are come to the height of their <hi>begodded Condition,</hi> and arrived to the state of full Perfection, then like the <hi>Indian Abduti</hi> or <hi>Spanish Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> they <hi>cannot sin,</hi> do what they will; let them commit what Foulness they will, what Injustice or Cruelty soever is suggested to them, these unclean and proud <hi>Fanaticks</hi> take it all to be <hi>Inspiration</hi>; or else are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened at last (by the upshot of their <hi>Luciferian</hi> Apostasie from the simplicity of the Truth of the Gospel) to hold that there is no Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Good and Evil, and that Sin is but a Conceit, no real Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, but to those that know not their own Liberty. Which final Result of things does plainly indigitate, who moved at the bottom of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness in their first alienation from the Person of our Saviour. And the Justice of God is very observable in such Apostates, how they are strucken with Blindeness, how silly and weak they are in their Reason and Imagination, and their Lives and Actions odious and abominable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But that the Religion of these <hi>Perfectionists</hi> is not merely a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisal by the sleights of Satan, but a studied and premeditated Revolt
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:55305:270"/>
from their allegiance to our blessed Saviour, though first suggested by the envy of <hi>Lucifer</hi> against the Son of God, is too-too plain in this; That when they seem most tolerable and to have some conscience of their waies, yet what Christians are troubled at and asham'd of, they will not acknowledge to be Sin, lest they should seem to want the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christ or be beholden to him for his Sufferings. Which is a sign, as I have already said, that <hi>Familisme</hi> was invented by the malice of the <hi>Devil</hi> to lay aside the Office and Person of Christ: let them talk as highly and gloriously of their <hi>begodded</hi> Estate as they will; which their Infernal Teacher has taught them to boast of so much, that Christ may seem <hi>lesse God</hi> then he is. But I dare pronounce, that thousands of poor modest Christians that abhorre the name of <hi>Perfection,</hi> and speak much of <hi>Iustification by Faith alone,</hi> of the <hi>Imputation of Christs Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and complain of their own <hi>Infirmity</hi> very sadly and seriously, have yet arriv'd to a far greater degree of Perfection then these <hi>Self-Magnifiers</hi> and <hi>rude Insulters</hi> over these humble and contrite Spirits: who having no ill meaning by those frames of speech that are taught them, are affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Adherers to their Saviour, and out of their due reverence to God, and hearty abhorrence from all shew of or least approach toward sin and wickedness, take Sanctuary in Christ, and ease their Souls by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance on his Atonement and Intercession for such Infirmities as these bold and fanatical Boasters would bear men in hand and perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves not to be at all sinful.</p>
               <p>And now whether these <hi>rampant Enthusiasts</hi> or the <hi>humble and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Christian</hi> be of the sounder complexion, let any man that is not wilfully blinde give sentence, and how allowable the Doctrine of these <hi>Perfectionists</hi> is, whenas it traiterously strikes at the <hi>Person</hi> of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and at the antiquating the office of his <hi>Royal Priesthood,</hi> and is cross to that lovely and decorous frame of spirit which is required of all men, and most of all of Christians, that they be humble and lowly of minde, which the Death of Christ, and our reliance upon his Intercession and Sufferings for favour at the hands of God, does naturally nourish, and keep off that swollen unwholsome distemper of Arrogance and Self-weening.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In which, that no man may mistake me to his own prejudice, I say that the sound and comely frame of a Christian spirit is this; Unfeignedly to endeavour the perfecting of all Holiness both in Heart and Actions, and not to allow a mans self in any thing that he thinks is a sin; and when he is arriv'd at that height of Sanctity, that he is not conscious to himself that he does any thing that is unlawful, to give the whole praise to God, and to His Merits and Intercession that has procured him the assistance of his holy Spirit, and by virtue of his Death has so powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged him to warre against his lusts and to mortifie all his immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Passions;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.4</note> and withall to remember, <hi>that though he know nothing by himself, yet he is not thereby justified,</hi> and that a man cannot be sure but that he may mistake himself in some thing or other, though he never sin against his own light; and to impute it rather to the mercy of God, that he has not led him into such violent Temptations as some have been,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:55305:271"/>
that he finds himself not to have submitted to evil motions, then to ostentate his own strength, and contemn the Protection of so kind a Saviour, who being acquainted with humane infirmity, may justly be thought to have kept off those tempestuous Assaults that otherwise might have invaded us. Besides that, let us be never so <hi>perfect now,</hi> yet it cannot pay the old score, because we ought to have been alwaies without sin; and therefore our recourse to so compassionate a Saviour is never out of date. Which is a Truth indispensable both for the maintaining of the honour of Christ, and keeping our selves in a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss and humble frame of Spirit towards God and towards men. So that the Opinion of these <hi>Enthusiastick Perfectionists</hi> does plainly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress against both the second and third Rule we have set down.</p>

<pb n="513" facs="tcp:55305:271"/>
bloud, are now much more ready to rescue the innocent. Those <hi>Hands</hi> that before were onely exercised in griping and pulling from others, are now ever open for Alms-deeds and bountiful distribution to the needy. That <hi>Tongue</hi> that in secret would not spare to strike his Friend, will now in a just cause defend his Enemy.</p>
               <p>In brief, there is no <hi>external</hi> Action of true Sanctity and Righteousness but the sincere Christian both believes and findes he has a power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, and therefore does constantly the good and refuses the evil, that his conscience tells him is so indeed, and is in his power to do and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain: that is to say, He will be sure to refrain from whatsoever is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just,</hi> he will never deal with another otherwise then himself would be dealt with, he will most certainly abstein from <hi>Extortion, Adultery, Fornication,</hi> he will never doe any <hi>envious</hi> or <hi>revengeful</hi> Actions. And not onely so, but he does believe that through the grace of God he may be quite devoid of all <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Malice,</hi> and not so much as bear any ill will against any man, no not against his Enemies; and the same of all other <hi>inordinate affections,</hi> which though they move strongly and rebelliously, yet he never assents so far to them as to be willing to doe them, though he had a secure opportunity thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And yet he does not think himself <hi>perfect,</hi> though he thus assents to no Sin while he thinks it so; nor at all doubts of his Salvation, though he be imperfect. And if by the boisterousness and importunity of a Temptation or some unavoidable Inadvertency he falls into any evil action, the pleasure he finds from it will be like that which a child gets by falling with his forehead against sharp stones or with his hands into the fire. Wherefore his sincere Love to Righteousness and hearty abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from Sin will make him alwaies <hi>circumspect.</hi> For he holds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self bound not onely not to commit sin when it appears to be so, which he thinks then impossible for him to do; but charges himself with a <hi>perpetual watchfulness,</hi> that he may not commit it when it would insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it self under some more specious shape.</p>
               <p>And though by Divine Assistance and faithful Adhesion thereto, he finde himself arriv'd to that pitch that he has conquered all corruptions, so that he cannot charge himself with either <hi>Pride,</hi> or <hi>Lust,</hi> or <hi>Envy,</hi> or <hi>Covetousness,</hi> or any such like Vice, or that he does <hi>misbelieve the Promises</hi> of God, or does <hi>not depend upon his Providence,</hi> or is <hi>not willing to submit to his will in all things</hi> to whatever condition he shall call him: yet he knowing himself withall not infallible, nor unconquerable, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally without the assistance of Christ, as also actually beset with many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of humane Nature (such as are Straying of thoughts, Une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venness in Devotion, Indisposedness of minde by reason of this Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Earth we live in) and reflecting on the old reckoning of the Follies of our Life past, which nothing but ignorance can conceit to have been without Sin, and how all these things (though ordinary Philosophy pronounces them to be no Faults, but mere Infirmities of Nature) they having been contracted by our Lapse, may justly by Religion be set on our score; <hi>This Sincere Christian,</hi> whose Character I have given, will be so far from setting the Person of Christ at defiance, and vilifying his
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:55305:272" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Passion, Intercession</hi> and <hi>holy Priesthood,</hi> that he will with the greatest reverence of Devotion that can be imagined love him and adore him, and will not quit that sweet Repose of minde he findes in the recounting with himself what an inestimable Friend he has with God, for all the Pleasures and greatest Interests of this present life; nor presume to be justified by his own Life or Works, but by Faith in Christ, whom he rejoices to think that he shall see his Judge at the last Day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This is the true and sound complexion of a <hi>Sincere</hi> Christian; and he that does not faithfully endeavour to arrive at this state, discovers himself to be an halting <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> and one that is no Lover of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> Life, nor has tasted the sweetness of Sanctity, and of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, nor known the power of his operations. He that pretends to be above it, he is self-condemned, and betraies himself of what King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome he is, that he is inacted by the envy of <hi>Satan</hi> against the Kingdome of Christ, to antiquate his <hi>Offices</hi> and to lay aside his <hi>Person:</hi> which he perswades sundry fanatical Souls to do, puffing them up with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of <hi>Self-perfection,</hi> on purpose to exclude our Saviour. The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of which errour is no less then the utter forfeiture of their Eternal Salvation. For no man shall inherit eternal life but by the donation of the <hi>crucified Iesus,</hi> whom God has appointed Judge at the last day. Besides that the very life and moral temper in these Revolters from the Son of God, if we compare it with that of the <hi>Sincere</hi> Christian, there is as much difference, to them that can tast, as betwixt the wilde grape and the sweet. So hard a thing is it for either Nature or the Devil to imitate the true tincture of the Spirit of Christ. Their vine is the vine of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and their fruit as the clusters of <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and their Churches as a field whom the Lord hath blasted, there is the smell of the Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Lake and of the pit of Hell amongst them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The last thing I propounded was <hi>the Personal Reign of Christ upon Earth.</hi> Of which Opinion as the reasons are slender or none at all, so the Usefulness thereof to me invisible, not knowing that it promotes any End of the Gospel which I can take notice of.</p>
               <p>But that there may be a <hi>Millennium,</hi> as they usually call it, or a Long Period of time wherein a more excellent Reign of Christ then has mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested it self yet to the World may take place, truly it seems so reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it self, and there are such shrewd places of Scripture seem to speak that way, that it is hard for an indifferent man to gainsay it. But I conceive then that the Renovation of the state of things will be, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks, into new Heavens and new Earth wherein <hi>Righteousness shall dwell</hi>; wherein <hi>real Sanctity</hi> and <hi>universal Peacefulness</hi> shall bear sway; wherein the <hi>crucified Iesus</hi> shall not be onely complemented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loof off, and saluted in Statues and Pictures, both himself and his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and all his Apostles and most eminent Adherents (whenas in the mean time <hi>Mars, Venus</hi> and <hi>Pluto</hi> and other Idols of the Heathen are cordially lov'd and serv'd, all Christendome giving themselves enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously to War and Bloudshed, to Lust and Luxury, to Wealth and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness, worshipping these Deities in Spirit and in truth:) but as the <hi>Divine honour</hi> done to our Saviours person shall not then cease, so the
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:55305:272" rendition="simple:additions"/>
power of His spirit shall be more potently felt for the <hi>unpaganizing</hi> of the World, and for the destroying of this spiritual Idolatry, which is the Inordinate Affections and fierce endeavours of the <hi>Animal Life</hi>; and shall implant such a love and liking of the life of Christ, that Peace and Righteousness shall overflow all.</p>
               <p>Contentions about Opinions shall then cease, they being priz'd onely by the Pride and Curiosity of the Natural man, and all the goodly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of nice Theologers shall then cease, and all the foolish and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing Arguments of the disputacious Schools shall be laid aside, and the Gospel alone shall be exalted in that day. And truly the <hi>Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> being in such a sense as this stated, it is both probable and very desirable, and an opinion that agrees with, nay such as may very well further, all the designes of the Gospel; as any one may discern by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king application to the Rules I have set down.</p>
               <p>Of which Rules these few Examples may serve to shew the use, and to teach a man how to extricate himself from that mighty cumbersome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the numerosity of Opinions, whether they be suggested from his own thoughts or offer'd by other men. For if he applies them to these Rules, he will finde most of them either so little to the designes of the Gospel, or so much against them, that he will account some not worth the sifting, others not worthy the naming, much less the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining by a sober Christian.</p>
               <p>Which practises and considerations cannot but tend much to the advancement of the Gospel of Christ, if diligently observ'd though but by private Christians. I shall onely give some brief touch what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Magistrate to contribute for the Advancement of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and then we shall conclude.</p>

               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="516" facs="tcp:55305:273"/>1. BEfore we can well understand <hi>the Power of the Magistrate in matters of Religion,</hi> we must first consider <hi>the Common Right of Mankind in this point,</hi> provided they be not degenerated into <hi>Atheisme</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness.</hi> For he that believes there is <hi>no God, nor Reward, nor Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after this life,</hi> what plea can he have to <hi>Liberty of Conscience?</hi> or how unproper is it to talk of his <hi>Right</hi> in matters of Religion, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly has no Religion at all, nor any tie of Conscience upon him to make that wicked profession? For <hi>Atheisme</hi> as it is very coursely false in it self to any man that has the clear exercise of his Reason, so is it intolerably mischievous and destructive even to the present Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of States and Kingdomes, and therefore to be shunned and repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as the very plague and pest of humane Polities. But for those that seriously make profession of <hi>the Existence of God</hi> Creator of all things, and of <hi>his Providence,</hi> and acknowledge that there is <hi>a life to come</hi> wherein the <hi>wicked</hi> shall be <hi>punished</hi> and the <hi>vertuous rewarded</hi>; it seems to me that there does naturally accrew such a <hi>Right</hi> to these men <hi>of freedome in their Religion</hi> as is inviolable, and such as the power of the Magistrate ought not to invade, unless there be some perverse mixture in it that forfeits their Right.</p>
               <p>In the mean time supposing there be nothing but <hi>simple mistake,</hi> which they of the contrary Religion will call <hi>Superstition,</hi> yet the Conscience of the other party being bound up to this, it is his <hi>natural Right</hi> to have his <hi>Freedome</hi> therein; because his Conscience is necessarily subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted thereby to a greater power then any is on earth: and therefore not to give him the Liberty of his Religion is both a piece of <hi>Inhumanity</hi> and <hi>Injustice</hi> towards him, and a kind of <hi>Rebellion against God</hi> whose liege subject he is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor can any thing that I know weaken the solidity of this Truth, unless you will say that no False Religion is the command of God, or at least that it is countermanded by the <hi>Promulgation</hi> of the True. To which I answer, That there is so much Truth in those Religions I speak of, that they contain a belief of <hi>the Existence of God</hi> &amp; that there is <hi>a Life to come</hi>; which is a demonstration that the rest of their Religion, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and exercise whereof they <hi>seriously</hi> and <hi>sincerely</hi> seek the favour of God and Eternal happiness, does bind their Conscience most severely and indispensably to obedience. Which immediate Dictate of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in a soul that is <note n="*" place="margin">Which quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is all along supposed in this question, otherwise the falsities of a Religion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so rightly be conceived any commands of God, but a blindness and darkness the Religionist has brought upon or continues to himself through his own Hypocrisie and wickedness.</note> 
                  <hi>sincere,</hi> what is it but the Command of God? and before his voice be heard here, his will is not <hi>promulgated</hi> to that person. For nothing but <hi>Conviction of Conscience</hi> that this or that is the Will of God is properly the <hi>promulgation of his Will</hi> to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular soul: Otherwise it is but as a recital of the Law in a <note n="*" place="margin">So it is to them that are sincere, but in those that are not it is like the stopping of the ears against the reading of the Law in a Known Language.</note> language the People understand not, and therefore can take no hold upon them.</p>
               <p>Again, how can an <hi>Erroneous Conscience</hi> oblige to obedience, if its Dictate be but as from it self, and not the command of God? For it is
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:55305:273"/>
improper to say a man is obliged to obey himself, especially in matters of Religion. Wherefore it is plain that the Obligation is to God, and from God, who has proclaimed in the heart of every man that is <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enciously</hi> and <hi>sincerely</hi> religious how he will be served and worshipped, and by inevitable trains of Providence has for a time fixt him to this or that perswasion. Which being the most express, the most complete and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulate way that God can <hi>promulgate</hi> his Law by, namely, the <hi>Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mens Reason and Conscience</hi> (for I speak of such as are in their wits, not mad-men and Fanaticks, nor yet such as embrace for Religion Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts contrary to the <hi>Light and Law of Nature,</hi> which is the highest and most uncontrovertible Law of God, as being not Topical but Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, and therefore there can be no perswasion against that, but it is to be imputed to the villany of man, not to the command of God, who in all Nations by the <hi>inward Light of Nature</hi> commands to the contrary, be their Topical Religion what it will;) In these things, I say, whose false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is not easily discoverable by the Light of Nature (such as are sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry matters of fact done many Ages ago, and Religious Precepts and Ceremonies thereupon depending) if there be this Conviction of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science concerning them, there is necessarily implied the command of God to that people so convicted. For when can God be said to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> a person, if not then when he conveys a practical perswasion so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him (be it by the intervention of what Providence it will) that there is no place left to doubt but that it is his Command? For if he spoke to him <hi>face to face</hi> (which he does not doe to one of infinite thousands, nor it may be properly to any) there could be no greater as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of receiving a command from him. Wherefore a man being as fully assured that he has received a command from God as he can be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and this assurance being contrived into him by the Providence of God himself; it is evident that the command is truly from God. To which a man is still obliged till he does in as express a manner receive a Countermand from the same Soveraign Power.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Which Countermand, according to what I have already laid down, is not <hi>received</hi> nor <hi>promulgated</hi> till the <hi>Conscience</hi> be <hi>convinced,</hi> but is still as a Law repeated in a strange language; and therefore being not understood, is not obligatory. Nor does the great Law-giver of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse contradict himself in this variety, nay contrariety, if you will, of Religions. For he does not command them all to the same people at the same time; but every one according as his Conscience is convicted receives a new command, and where they are inconsistent, relinquishes the old. And truly there seems no harshnesse nor incongruity at all in admitting variety and contrariety of Religions in the world, and all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God, if this Diversity and Opposition were discoverable only in several degrees of Perfection, or in the manner of Worship and Ceremony: but they being contradictory one to another in the very Articles of their Creeds, this seems an insuperable difficulty, how God should command them to believe <hi>Contradictions,</hi> of which one part must of necessity be false. As for example, It is impossible, <hi>That Christ died on the Crosse,</hi> and, <hi>That he died not on the Crosse,</hi> or, <hi>That he rose again
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:55305:274"/>
from the dead,</hi> and, <hi>That he did not rise again from the dead,</hi> should both parts be true. In the former of which examples the <hi>Turks,</hi> in the latter the <hi>Iews</hi> Belief is opposite to ours.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This truly at first sight seems a very hard knot. But the difficulty will not prove so formidable, after we have considered wherein it lies and how it may be answered. And surely it lies mainly in this, Whether it be consistent with the Nature of God to conveigh a false Perswasion into the minde of man or no. This is the utmost of the intricacy. To which methinks the Answer is not difficult. I freely therefore do affirm, That it is not inconsistent with Gods nature so to do. For he is thereby neither the Authour of any sin committed by us, nor doth he commit any thing himself herein unworthy of his Divinity. He is not the Authour of Sin in us, in that <hi>invincible ignorance</hi> is no sin, nor any act that proceeds therefrom. There is indeed lesse perfection in these actions, but every imperfection is not sin; for they may be such imperfections as are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly involuntary and unavoidable, as we suppose this false persuasion is and all the effects of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Nor does God do any thing unworthy of himself in introducing such an <hi>invincible or unavoidable perswasion,</hi> though it be false. For to cause another to think that which is not true, is not simply evil in it self. Otherwise it were unlawful to fence, and to use ordinary stratagems of warre, wherein the Enemy endeavours to deceive each other; which is not done but by bringing them into a false belief. And we are the worst kinde of Enemies against God, being Rebels and Apostates from him: And therefore though he needs insinuate no mistakes into us by way of stratagem, yet he may fix upon us the belief of such things as are false <hi>by way of punishment</hi>; and though he command homage from us as his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, yet he may do it with several badges of disgrace, as some offended Prince might command a Rebel for a time to wear some sordid token of his Rebellion upon his outward garments whenever he went abroad, or an incensed High Priest for Penance adjudge some offender to do his devotions alwaies in some dark pit or dungeon, in stead of a convenient closet or well-adorned Church. Which things though they be but ugly in themselves, yet they being part of that duty they are tied up to by them that ought to command, they are free from the molestations of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are inferiour to that Power that commanded them; nor are these Offenders the one to be drag'd into the Church to do his devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there, nor is any one to pull off by violence from the other the badge of dishonour that he is commanded to wear.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>dishonourable badges of the Soul</hi> are those <hi>grosse Errours and Ignorances</hi> with which God may justly be deemed, <hi>by way of reproach and punishment,</hi> to command those to worship him that are convinced so to do, nor know yet any thing better. And <hi>the dark pit</hi> may be any blinde dispensation which Divine Providence has adjudged men to, till their conviction to the contrary. For <hi>Conviction</hi> is the <hi>immediate Command of God</hi> in the Conscience; as I have often repeated.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And as God <hi>by way of Punishment</hi> may introduce a false perswasion into the Minde of man, so also <hi>by way of Probation.</hi> For if to introduce
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:55305:274"/>
a false perswasion in it self be not simply evil, how can it be evil when used for a good End, and by an unerring Wisedom, and from an infinite Goodness? Which powers if we were invested with, none could make any controversie of it, but that we might also take the liberty to do so too. And people hold it ordinarily very pardonable, if not allowable, to impose upon children and sick persons by false stories for their health, and to save the spilling of innocent bloud by concealing the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued from the knowledge of him that would murther him. Nay, in smaller exigencies, as in the trial of a servants trust, no man would be much offended if one made his servant believe he trusted him further then he did, either to encourage his faithfulness or to detect his fraud: as if he should in his presence put up into a box some false Jewels that made a great show, but of small value, and should commit them unto his servants custody carefully sealed up as a most precious Treasure, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to try if he will run away with them; adding thereunto a sealed bag of Counters with an old inscription of so much in Gold. Such a <hi>Trial</hi> as this, which implies an introducing of a false opinion into the minde of the servant, few or none would hold culpable in his cautious Master. What injustice therefore can it be in God, if he try the Souls of men first in a false Religion, perswading them that it is true, and thereby commanding the practice thereof; since by this means their faithfulness is discovered, whether they will be sincere when that is committed to them which is wholly true indeed?</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is plain therefore that some falsehoods in a Religion which has so much Truth in it as to engage a man in the exercise thereof in hope of Eternal life, doe not hinder but that this whole Religion that obliges the Conscience is the command of God to them whose Conscience it does oblige; and therefore that they are free from the commands of any external power, if some other things of another nature do not make them forfeit their liberty. For the simple falsities in Religion are not enough, that is, are not sufficient to detect that such a Religion is not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to such and such persons by God himself; who thought good to try <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith by that false perswasion, that he was actually to sacrifice his son to him, whenas God intended no such matter. Which Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple does prove that God has not only a power, but has put also into act this right that he has of causing men to think otherwise then what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally true. But what is that to thee? they must stand or fall to their own Master, nor hast thou any power to countermand them till they have a countermand from God by clear conviction that the way they are in is false: For then onely ceases it to be the Command of God to them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But if thou wilt be so humour some for all this as to deny that such a Conviction of Conscience, so stated as I have stated it, is the real com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God in every particular, namely, in the apprehensions which are false; yet, though this were admitted, it will notwithstanding be evident that it is a piece of Rudeness and Barbarity to incommodate a person thus perswaded for the profession of his Religion. For first, his speaking and acting according to the <hi>unavoidable perswasions</hi> of his minde is not a sin, it arising according to our hypothesis out of <hi>invincible Ignorance</hi>; nor
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:55305:275" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is he supposed to act any thing against the known laws of Nature; and therefore no just right of any one is endamaged: but in the mean time the Soveraignty of the Godhead is fully acknowledged, and the Loyalty and Sincerity of the <hi>Religionist</hi> exercised therein.</p>
               <p>Wherefore what reason can there be that any one for so good an action, that is not exceptionable for any thing that is properly sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, should be rudely treated, punished, or any way disturbed or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred? For whosoever endeavours his forcible hindrance, does not only suppress an innocent and laudable action, but he does necessarily perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate a foul and sinful one. For such is the solicitation of others to the omission of that duty of Loyalty our own Conscience tels us we owe to God. Wherefore he that hinders the sincere Religionist from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of his Religion, tempts him to a sin against God: which no Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers in the World have a right to do, but are <hi>ipso facto</hi> guilty of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion against their Maker, by corrupting his liege Subjects, and urging them to faithlesness and neglect of their duty. How culpable are they then in forcing them and haling them to such actions as they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded God has severely forbid them? Verily if this be not unjustly to command him who is under the power of another, I cannot imagine what is; nor what can be deemed a sin against God, if urging others to sin against him be not. So that again, even upon our Adversaries own terms, it is plain that the Soveraign power of God sets the <hi>sincere</hi> Religionist free in matters of Religion from any external force or power whatsoever.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Now as this Position recommends it self sufficiently from its own native concinnity and solidity; so will it also appear still more solid and more consonous to Reason, if we consider the absurdity of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Position, namely, <hi>That liberty of Conscience is by no means to be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Religion.</hi> For from hence it follows that every Religion may, nay ought to keep out all other Religions with all care possible. For every mans Conscience tels him <hi>His is the best,</hi> or else he would not be of it; nay, that there is <hi>none true and saving but his own.</hi> For if they will say they may be saved in others, then is our former argument a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect demonstration against them, that they are not only injurious to men but absolute rebels against God indeed, in treating those ill that are his liege people, and whom he loves so well that he intends to save them, and in persecuting them even for those very actions wherein they do most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously express their obedience to him.</p>
               <p>But if there be but <hi>one true and saving Religion at once in the world,</hi> this is the greatest disinterest to it that can be imagined. For upon this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition it will be as <hi>carefully kept out</hi> and as <hi>forcibly</hi> as any of the rest; which in my apprehension is very foul play, and therefore this is another evidence of the truth of our Thesis, <hi>viz. That the contrary is the greatest injury and disinterest to the True Religion that can be supposed,</hi> which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but external force hinders from spreading over all. For <hi>Magna est veritas, &amp; praevalebit,</hi> I mean in the Mindes and Consciences of those men where she may have free audience, not in the noise and terrour of tyrannical impositions and obtrusions. Besides the frequent misery and
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:55305:275" rendition="simple:additions"/>
calamity this Position brings upon Nations and Kingdoms, <hi>viz.</hi> Wars, bloud-shed, subversion of Families, deposing, stabbing or poisoning of Princes, perpetual enmity and hatred, and all the works and actions of the kingdom of Darkness. Of so mischievous consequence is this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion we do oppose. Whenas if it were acknowledged universally, <hi>That Liberty of Religion is the natural right of mankinde,</hi> all these mischiefs would be prevented; The Prince could not pretend any quarrel against the People, nor the People against the Prince or against one another, but in Civil Rights that are more plain and intelligible.</p>

               <p n="1">1. IT is manifest therefore <hi>That Liberty of Religion is the common and natural Right of all Nations and Persons,</hi> that is to say, That they have a power, as they are Rational men, and believe that there is a God, and a Life to come, to examine what is the best way to serve him for their future advantage; and not to be tied up so to that Religion is first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to them, but that they have a Right to suspect, especially if they do not like it, that there is some better, and therefore that they may confer with those of other Religions, send for them out of one Nation into another, and entertain them when they are arrived, hear them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, and, if they be convinced, openly profess it. Or if they come of their own accord, they are to be entertained with the same security that an Agent of State is, and may freely converse with them of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that have a minde to hear them. For this is a piece of their Right of Liberty, to <hi>speak</hi> as well as the others to <hi>hear.</hi> Which Transactions would breed no disturbance at all, if this Right of Liberty of Religion was universally understood and acknowledged by all the Nations of the World: as certainly it is their Right.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="522" facs="tcp:55305:276"/>2. And it being so, it seems plainly to follow, That any Nation or People that do heartily ackowledge the Reasonableness of this Right, and their practice is accordingly, that there accrues to them this part of the Right also, that they may send of those of the Religion themselves are into their neighbouring Nations to communicate their Religion to them, and to try if they can convince them of that which they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded is true, and to shew them the errours of their own; but at sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable times, and without reproach or tumult, or any way confronting them in the exercise of their Religion; a thing very barbarous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable at home, much more abroad in Countreys where they are Strangers.</p>
               <p>For the avoiding of which wilde enormities it seems reasonable in it self, and a thing to be agreed upon, that there shall be no security to any stranger that takes upon him to gather the people together under pretence of instructing them in a more perfect Religion, unless he be an Agent from his own Nation for that purpose. Nor is he to begin with the rude people, but to act above-board, and to make his applications to the Governours of the places where he arrives; and not to pretend to the Juglings of Inspirations, and the irresistible blusters and impetuosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of an unaccountable Conscience: but first with a discreet candour to allow and commend what is good and praise-worthy in the Religion of the place; and then, after an unaffected profession of the love and kindeness of them that sent him, towards the Nation, with all prudent insinuations possible to lay before them the groundlesness or gross fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities which are in their Religion; and after that to shew the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrative Reasons he has for the recommending of his own, namely, such as are agreed upon by the mature deliberation and counsel of them that sent him upon this errand, to which it should be criminall to adde, upon their authority, any foolish inventions of his own.</p>
               <p>And if these <hi>Agents for Religion</hi> neither injuring nor defrauding any one of their Civil rights, shall be evilly entreated by those they offer to instruct, if they abuse them by imprisonment or any other hard dealing, or finally put them to death; that State or Kingdom to which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long may require their bloud at their hands, as having grosly and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously transgressed against the Law of Nations, and the common Right of all mankinde that have not forfeited it some way or other: As these have not, they allowing this Liberty among themselves, and to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that have a sense and conscience of the same Right, and being firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resolved, if it should come to a war, and they be Conquerours of their ill Neighbours, to use no other means to turn their new Subjects from their old Religion, but by peaceably and patiently shewing them the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity thereof, and the excellency and solidity of their own. Which cannot by any means be called <hi>the Propagation of Religion by the Sword,</hi> when there shall not be so much force put upon them to change their former Religion, if they be found conscientious, as to compell them to be present at the Solemnities of the New. Only they shall swear fealty to their Conquerours, and be well indoctrinated in that common Right of Mankinde, <hi>That no man is to be persecuted for Religion, if he have not
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:55305:276"/>
forfeited that Right by taking upon him the liberty of persecuting others.</hi> And therefore they may enjoy their Religion if they can still like it, upon equal termes with the conquerours, as to their private capacities. If the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had made himself master of the <hi>Indies</hi> upon these condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and had abstained from his execrable cruelties, he might have justified himself to all the World. For this had not been to propagate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by the sword, but to maintain a mans natural right.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Theory I think is very <hi>sound</hi> at the bottome, and that it is very <hi>clear</hi> what ought to be; but <hi>hugely unpracticable by reason of that general perverseness and corruption of men.</hi> Yet I thought it worth the while to expose it to view, the acknowledgement thereof being the greatest advantage to Chritian Religion that can possibly be conceived, there being nothing so effectual for the easie fall of <hi>Turcisme</hi> and <hi>Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme</hi> into the profession of Christ as this Prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iple we have explained; our Religion being not onely solid in it self, but incomparably more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable to all Rational spirits then any Religion ever extant in the World. Besides, though its use will not extend so farre at the first, yet it may be something serviceable to these parts of the world whose eyes are more open to Truth then others are. And verily in my judgement, this Principle I do thus recommend, as it seems to me to deserve the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of <hi>all men</hi> as true, so of <hi>all Christians especially,</hi> not onely upon point of Policy, but as more sutable to that spirit they are of, abhorring from force and cruelty; who are therefore to permit full Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to all those that do not forfeit it by mixing with their Religion such Principles as are contrary to good manners and civil Right, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to this very Principle of Liberty we speak of.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wherefore those that under pretence of Religion would corrupt the people with such doctrines as plainly countenance Vice and tend to the rooting out of the sense of true Honour and Vertue out of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>have lost this Common Right</hi> we contend for, as being infecters and poisoners of the people amongst whom they live; and therefore the
therefore the publick Magistrate of what Nation or Religion soever has a power to restrain them, their doctrine being so dangerous to the welfare of a State, and contrary to the light of Nature and suffrage of the wisest men in all places of the World and in all Ages. No Religion fraught with such rotten ware as this, is to be received in any coast where they would put in, but to be kept out by Strangers and suppressed at home.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Again, those also would <hi>forfeit this Right of Liberty,</hi> whose Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should contain any thing in it that would weaken the State which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it. As if there were some such absurd Superstition, as upon pretence of an high esteem fo Virginity and extreme abhorrence from warre should urge the emasculation of every third male-child, or the luxation or cutting off their fore-finger or thumb, whereby the Country would be depopulated, and the Inhabitants made unserviceable for the defence thereof: there is no question but the Magistrate might inhibit such a Religion as this.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As he might in the last place all such as have intermixed with them that wolvish and ferine humour of <hi>persecuting others for their Religion,</hi>
                  <pb n="524" facs="tcp:55305:277"/>
that would live quietly by them, and would not force any one to their own Faith, nor disturb the publick exercise of Religion in others. For these have no right to be suffered further then at the discretion of the Magistrate; nor can more reasonably plead for Liberty then the Wolfe and Fox crave leave to have their kennels or holes in the midst of a Sheepfold, or the Owle or Night-Raven to put in their note amidst a Quire of Nightingales.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But you'l say, all Religions and Sects are such Foxes and Wolves, and therefore there is no Liberty of Religion at all to be given. Those that are so, I confess, are at the mercy of the Magistrate, as having <hi>forfeited their Right.</hi> Which <hi>forfeiture</hi> he may exact more or less se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely accordingly as he has more or less security that these crafty and wild Creatures may do no mischief. But I do not believe that all men that do profess Religion are of this partial nature; nay on the contrary, I do verily believe <hi>That they that are the most truly religious, are the most abhorrent from persecution of conscience sake.</hi> Wherefore as many as are ready to profess, and that upon Oath, if it be required, That it is their judgement (and their Practice does not contradict it) that no man is to be incommodated in his Civil rights, in his Libety, Estate or Life, for the cause of such a Religion as whose principles teach not to incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate others, and do avow that theirs is such, and that they will be as faithful to the Prince or State in which they live as those of his own Religion; these having in no wise <hi>forfeited their Right of liberty,</hi> neither this way nor any other, by intermingling Practices or Principles against the light of Nature and laudable Morality; it were the highest piece of Injustice that can be committed to abridge them of the safe profession thereof.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. TO come to a Conclusion therefore, and to touch the Point we have aimed at all this time, <hi>What a Christian Prince or the Supreme Magistracy may contribute to the advancement of the Gospel of Christ:</hi> From these general Principles we may inferre, First, that he is to give <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> to all such as have not forfeited it, namely such as I have last of all described, especially if they be Natives of the place, were it possible for them to be of any Religion then Christian. But withall to require a publick and solemn account of their change of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; wherein it may appear whether it be Conscience or Design or humour that makes them Apostatize. Which either fraud or giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness shall make the party obnoxious to such rebuke and penalty as may probably deterre the people from the like causeless revolts. But if the person be of a serious life, and shall be found to have changed his opinion upon such grounds of Reason as, though false, yet may possibly mislead a wel-meaning man; yet for sureness he shall be put upon his <hi>Oath:</hi> Which test though it be abused to over-petty matters, yet certainly must not loose its due use in causes of so solemn impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>In which kind of cases if any refuse upon a pretended scrupulosity of swearing at all, and in an affectation of seeming more precisely holy then others, without question it is not Religion but some fathomless depth of knavery that lies at the bottom; and they may justly be suspected of some treasonable and treacherous design against the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Government under which they live. Wherefore before they should have liberty to profess themselves of another Religion, they should be required to take <hi>a solemn Oath,</hi> with a deep <hi>Imprecation</hi> of Divine vengeance upon Soul and Body, that nothing moves them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to but mere conviction of Conscience, and that they have no secular design at all in their change, nor desire any more liberty then what they think themselves bound in conscience to allow to others. Which publick <hi>Examination</hi> and <hi>Oath</hi> is very useful also and justifiable upon mens relinquishing of the publick worship of God in the Churches, though they do not professedly declare themselves to be no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. For not to joyn with them in publick worship, is the next door to that Apostasy.</p>
               <p>This practice would be of infinite advantage for the Truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. For hereby the Priesthood will be more cautious how they clogge the Gospel with unwarrantable trumperies; and those that would revolt, by this calling them to an account first, shall be forced to feel the strength and solidity of that Religion they would bid adieu to, and their secret designes prevented by the solemnity of an <hi>Oath.</hi> And lastly the Christian Magistrate by giving this liberty after these due circumstances (which assuredly he will have very seldome occasion for by reason of the Evidence of our Religion) will avoid the justifying
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:55305:278"/>
the iniquity of other Religions who not by power of Reason and Conscience, but by outward Force, hinder their Natives from turning Christians.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But Secondly, Though these serious people shall not be deprived of their Liberty, Lives or Estates, nor any way impaired in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate fortunes; yet they shall be disabled from bearing any Office of trust in the Commonwealth, especially if there be of the Christian Religion that will manage them with equal skil and fidelity. For it is plainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, if not impossible, that a man that is serious in his Religion should not prefer one of his own Faith before a Stranger, if in other things they be equal. Besides that the Lawes of Caution and Prudence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail to suggest so reasonable a choice; which are very much to be listned to in things of this nature. For present possession of power is better assurance then the Oath of well-meaning but withall of temptable and lapsable Mortals.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, The Christian Magistrate is to give no assistance of his power nor countenance any further then Christianity it self is concerned: that is to say, He is to give that assistance which is due from a Magistrate for the defending and promoting of our Religion, so far forth as it is plainly discoverable in the written Word of God in the <hi>Literal</hi> and <hi>Historical</hi> meaning thereof: For to <hi>cant</hi> onely in Allegories, is to deny the Faith of Christ. And as for <hi>Opinions,</hi> though some may be better then othersome, yet none should exclude from the fullest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of either private or publick Rights, suppose there be no venome of the <hi>Persecutive spirit</hi> mingled with them. But every one that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses the Faith of Christ and believeth the Scripture in the <hi>Historical</hi> sense thereof, let his Opinions be otherwise what they will, he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his life, worth and ability every where to be preferred in either Church or State. Which is absolutely the most advantageous way for the advancing of the Gospel and making the World good that the Wit of man can find out.</p>
               <p>And <hi>External Force</hi> being so unfitting in it self, and most of all unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the Christian Magistrate, in matters of Religion, what one might fancy lost in laying aside <hi>Persecution,</hi> would in as great a measure be regained by countenancing this free and naked Representation of the Beauty and Perfection of the Gospel quite rid of all pretended Traditions and whatever obfuscations and entanglements of humane Invention. For then the Truth of God would be like an unsheathed sword, bright and glittering, sharp and cutting, and irresistibly convincing the rational Spirit of a man. Whenas now our Religion is wrapt up in so many wreathes of hay and straw, that mo man can see nor feel the edge of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Being <hi>Compulsion</hi> is not to be used nor <hi>Prudence</hi> exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, (For it is the same fanatical madness to exile <hi>Prudence</hi> out of affairs of Church and State as to exclude <hi>Reason</hi> and Mathematicks out of Philosophy) it is very plain that the Christian Magistrate is engaged to adde to <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> the advantage of an <hi>honourable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable subsistence</hi> for those that <hi>labour in the word and doctrine</hi>; that is to say, he is obliged in all reason and conscience to continue it where it
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:55305:278"/>
is, and to raise it whereever it is wanting. And I am very confident it is either gross Fanatical ignorance, or the hidden malice of Satan against the kingdome of Christ, acting either in profane and Atheistical persons or such as are not cordially Christians, that suggests any thing to the contrary. For the less any Religion is underpropped by <hi>External force,</hi> the more able ought their Heads and Tongues to be that are only by their learning, eloquence and innocency of life to support it: And the present Ages having so much wit and so little sense of Piety, he that will undertake to give a good account of his Religion and to answer all Opposers, though the Scruples and Controversies be but concerning that which is plainly in the Scripture, he ought to have leisure and vacancy from the affairs of the World to prepare himself, and continue his dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity in this kinde.</p>
               <p>For that <hi>tedious buzz and noise of the Spirit</hi> has now, I think, made it self so ridiculous, that no prudent man will listen to such lazy Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures. Every one is <hi>to give a reason of his faith</hi>; but Priests or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters more punctually then any; their Province being to make good eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sentence of the Bible to a rational Enquirer into the Truth of those Oracles. Who therefore can sufficiently attend these things, and be to seek for bread for himself and his Family? How unjust and sordid a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per therefore are those persons of, that could be content to leave the Clergy to work for their living? Any inferiour fellow may talk and prate phrases and make faces, but when a sober man would be satisfied of the grounds from whence they speak, we shall hear no news of any thing but <hi>the Spirit,</hi> and railing against <hi>carnal Reason,</hi> though it be no soft flesh but hard and penetrant steel, and such as pierces them to the very heart, for all their contempt and slighting of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And verily while I consider the unreasonableness and ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this kinde of <hi>Enthusiasme,</hi> I cannot but think the Vigilancy of the Christian Magistrate should extend to this also amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, to suppress and keep under all Sects and Religions that hold of so Fanatick a tenour, that is to say, that profess they believe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Christian Faith from the illumination of such a Spirit as they can give no account of, <hi>viz.</hi> such as does not <hi>illuminate</hi> their Reason, whereby their doctrine may be <hi>accountable</hi> and <hi>intelligible</hi> to others, but only <hi>heat</hi> them and make them furious against the Christian Church. For besides the hazarding of making a whole Nation mad (for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously it is an infectious disease, if not the very possession of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil) there may some damnable plot lie under it against Christianity and the State. For it is a more easie thing to <hi>heat the Phansies</hi> of the vulgar, then to <hi>inform their Iudgements</hi>; though this tends to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber edification, that to confusion and destruction. In brief, there are these two very bad things in this resolving of matters into <hi>the immediate suggestion of the Spirit</hi> not acting upon our Understandings. First, it defaces and makes useless that part of the Image of God in us which we call <hi>Reason</hi>; and secondly, it takes away that special advantage that Christianity has above all other Religions, that she dare appeal to so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid a Faculty. And therefore he that takes away the use of <hi>Reason</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:55305:279"/>
undermines Christianity, and laies it as low as the basest Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition that ever appeared in the World.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now therefore to return, I say, To talk at the rate of these blinde <hi>Illuminati,</hi> that do not so much as pretend to any solid satisfaction in what they say, requires no study, nothing but heat and impudency, and a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less insensibility of what they said last, or whether one thing will hold with another: But he that so speaks as ready to give a reason of what he delivers, and indeed of all things that are already delivered in the Scriptures so plainly as that it appears what the meaning is, (for it is no prejudice that there be some depths beyond the present reach of men) this man certainly ought not to be tied up to the cares of the world by being put to labour for his bread; but ought to have a <hi>liberal, certain</hi> and <hi>honourable allowance.</hi> But to contemn the Christian Clergy, or to endeavour to make them contemptible by impoverishing them and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them to base terms of living, smels exceeding rank of <hi>Prophanenesse, Atheisme,</hi> and <hi>Infidelity:</hi> and the railing at them and calling them <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary</hi> because they have a <hi>just maintenance</hi> allowed them, is assuredly the voice of that envious Accuser of the brethren, who by those villai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous reproaches and calumnies would undermine and pull down the Kingdom of Christ in the world, by striking at the necessary props and supporters of it, the Ministry of the Gospel; whose subsistence ought to be independent of the People, that may reprove the more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that there may be no temptation to either unworthy connivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or to the sophisticating the doctrine of Christ by sweet poison, to inveigle the rich, and to untie their purse-strings; what they thus pay, being the price of their own Souls, betraied into the hands of such cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mountebanks.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Fifthly, The Christian Magistrate ought also to <hi>continue,</hi> and <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> where there wants, <hi>publick Schools of Learning.</hi> For the more knowing his Subjects are, the more certainly will they keep to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and the more easily will others come off to the same Faith. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing comparable to this for the preventing all delusions and impostures in Religion. <hi>Mahometisme</hi> could never have been set on foot but in a rude and illiterate Nation. But <hi>Christianity</hi> got its first foot-hold in the most civilized parts of the world, though persecuted and opposed. Besides that it is a piece of unspeakable madness to think that any man can be a fit Interpreter of Scripture without that which some in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt call <hi>Humane Learning,</hi> as <hi>Logick</hi> or the known Principles of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning</hi>; I will adde <hi>Mathematicks</hi> and <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and <hi>skill in Tongues</hi> and <hi>History:</hi> no man without the knowledge of these can make good the Truth of those holy Oracles to knowing and understanding men. And therefore they that decry these helps, are either very ignorant, or out of their wits, or have a treacherous plot against the flourishing of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi> and would bring in some <hi>Fanatick Religion,</hi> or else are enemies to all Religion whatsoever.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For tell me, O ye high-flown <hi>Perfectionists,</hi> and ye great boasters of the <hi>Light within you,</hi> could the highest Perfection of your inward Light ever shew to you the Histories of past Ages, the universal state of the
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:55305:279"/>

How then can you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Providence of God, the purpose of Prophecies and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of that Religion which God has peculiarly appointed us to walk in, without external assistances? How can you make a due judgement of the Truth of Christianity, without a rational explication of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that foretold the coming of Christ, without weighing what may be said concerning the authentickness and uncorruptedness of his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Gospels, and without considering the Reasonableness of all those Miraculous matters there recorded concerning him, and of what is behinde for him to perform at his visible return to judge the quick and the dead? No <hi>light within you,</hi> unassisted of <hi>helps without,</hi> and of the knowledge of History, Tongues and Sciences, and carefull exercise of Reason, that excellent gift of God to mankinde, can ever make you competent Judges of this matter.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And as you do thus forfeit the knowledge of the Truth by this sullen <hi>Self-sufficiency of yours within,</hi> so do you also endanger your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Salvation. For you cannot justly excuse your selves by the close following <hi>the light within you,</hi> if you do it in such a contemptuous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that you will listen to nothing offered you from <hi>without,</hi> though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so accommodate and agreeable to those rational Faculties God has given you. Wherefore it being no necessitated ignorance, but your own wilfulness, that has made you Apostates from the Law of Christ, your unbelief is no abrogation of that Law to you; but, stop your ears as hard against it as you can, yet you shall be judged by it at the last day; when, you having not served God as he would be served, he will assuredly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you as you would not be rewarded. For there is no other Name under Heaven whereby we must be saved but that of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 4.12.</note> whom the <hi>Iews</hi> crucified and God raised from the dead. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you who make it the chiefest point of your Religion to crucifie him again by celebrating that execrable <hi>Pascha</hi> or <hi>Phase,</hi> which is your dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable killing of Christ according to the <hi>flesh,</hi> that it to say, according to the <hi>Letter</hi> or <hi>History,</hi> which is to put Christ out of all his Offices as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to him by his Father, and to turn mere Pagans and Infidels, think as smoothly and favourably of your selves as you will, that doom must pass upon you at last (not according to your self-flattering Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but according to the truth of the Letter) which shall adjudge all the wicked to that everlasting fire which is prepared for the Devil and his Angles.</p>

               <p n="1">1. KNowing therefore the terrour of the Lord, we were earnestly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in minde to forewarn you and exhort you, I mean, as many of you are curable and reducible to the Truth. For some have cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated that accursed <hi>Pascha</hi> so fully and obdurately, that they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>past feeling,</hi> having not any sense nor hope left of the concerns of another life, God having justly given them up to a <hi>reprobate sense</hi> for the denying of the Lord that bought them. But for you whose defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is not compleated, nor your eyes sealed up to perfect infidelity, let me desire you to make a stand awhile, to lay your hands upon your own hearts, and impartially examine your selves, what you would have, where you would be, and what good thing you would seek, that is not plainly exposed to your view in the Gospel of Christ. You had begun well: Who has hindred you? What has tempted you out of the way? Do you now sincerely seek the kingdom of Heaven, or gape after a booty upon Earth? Examine your own Consciences, and answer to your selves. I desire not to broach your shame. But I hope you will not account me injurious, if I take notice of such things as you conceal from none.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Search therefore your own hearts, and try your selves, <hi>what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Spirit</hi> has taken hold upon you, since you have been so imbitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against the School of Christ. There is no Vertue you can pretend to that is not comprehended in his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> in the highest perfection and clearnesse. How can you then take a new guide, unless it be to be led into some pleasing errour? And truly it is no small plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to the proud to have something separate and peculiar of their own, to seem wiser and holier then other men. And I desire you to appeal to your own Conscience, how great a stroke this Vice has had in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering on your Apostasy; and beseech you to compute, if you be still serious in Religion, what you have gained by your revolt. Is your Reason any thing more improved? nay certainly, that ye have cut off
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:55305:280"/>
and cast from you as carnal and unholy. Are you more humble and more charitable? If you be, you do ill to conceal your Vertues, who would have the World believe so highly of you. You affect indeed to be very homely and sordid in your habits; but you do not perceive how sowr your affected sordidness smels of the leven of the Pharisees, who loved to be seen of men; and how you have but licked up what <hi>Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> that Pagan Sophist left in his Tub, and have chosen rather to be <hi>proud Cynicks</hi> then <hi>civil Christians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if your <hi>Humility</hi> have so strong a sent of <hi>Pride,</hi> how noisomely does your <hi>Pride</hi> it self stink in the nostrils of all men, your disrespect to your betters, your sawciness, your censoriousness, quite contrary to the precepts and practice of all holy men in all Ages? Your <hi>Humility</hi> therefore being so little, your <hi>Charity</hi> certainly cannot be great. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you count all besides your selves a rude unsanctified mass, the Weeds of the World, fit for nothing but the fire of your Fanatick wrath to burn up.</p>
               <p>I but you will say, though you have forgone your <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>good manners,</hi> yet you have <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> amongst you, which is worth all. If you have, shew me the fruit thereof. For <hi>Pharisaical</hi> sowrnesse, Contest with the Magistrate, affronting the Minister in his publick Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, these are no fruits of the Spirit of God; but these alone with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain clownish forms of calling <hi>Thou</hi> for <hi>You,</hi> and keeping on the Hat when others in civil respect put it off, are the main Effects of that Spirit that distinguisheth you from others of the Nation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is this therefore the great purchase you have obtained by turning your back on Christ and contemning of his Person, to grow rude and clownish to all the World beside? But methinks I hear you answer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, As for this man, we know not what is become of him; but behold the Spirit is sensibly present amongst us even at this day. But I demand by what Signs. <hi>O, we shiver and quake every joynt of us.</hi> But that is no certain signe of the Spirit of God. Was not the winde suddenly turned into the North, or had you not an <hi>Ephemera,</hi> or was not your over-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited <hi>Choler</hi> entangled or turned out of the way by <hi>Phlegme</hi> or <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly?</hi> What miraculous power is there in all this? <hi>O, but there are also amongst us that have fallen down into a trance, that have foamed and swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led till their buttons break off. Wherefore of a truth these men could not but be full of the Spirit, and this be a Miracle indeed.</hi> If your Religion ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not its growth to the tricks of Juglers and Tumblers, or to artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Epilepsies I do confesse, it is a Miracle from these Symptomes, if Satan himself drives not on the designe. For these are plainly the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of <hi>Pythonicks,</hi> such a kinde of possession as seized the Pagan-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Priests of old, who were no better then the worshippers of Devils, whose Oracles Christ has silenced long since. Wherefore examine your selves if you glory not in your shame: See how you tread: look behinde you, or rather search within you, who is the Prompter or first Mover in this new Scene of things.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For tell me (I beseech you) what did your <hi>foaming</hi> Prophets, when they vented themselves, discharge into your ears, whereby they may
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:55305:281"/>
be deemed more Divine then those Fanatick Pagans? Was not their continual song, so soon as they got upon their feet, the <hi>burning up of all Ordinances?</hi> From whence therefore could this voice come but out of the flames of hell? or what could swell the bodies of your <hi>Inspired,</hi> but the venome and poison of the Devil, which at last working up to their mouths he spit out enviously against the worship of Christs Person and all his holy Offices? Which is another evidence against you that your <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Inspirations</hi> are not <hi>divine</hi> but <hi>diabolical,</hi> and that the mystery of Satan worketh amongst you, who would fain pull down Him whom of a truth God hath set up to be a King and Priest to the Nations for ever.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But the sweetest satisfaction of all is, that you are so extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly illuminated, that you understand all the Mysteries of Christs king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom better then any one else, and can in a supercilious pity bemoan the ignorance of the World, or with an imperious bitterness fly in their faces and reproach them for it, especially the Teachers of the people, that they have not taken up your <hi>Allegorical</hi> knacks, nor know how to give a mystical meaning of the Gospel from the preaching of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist to the coming of Christ to Judgement.</p>
               <p>But you are indeed so <hi>unilluminated</hi> as not to understand that such devices as these are merely <hi>Allusions of humane Wit,</hi> and help very little to the enforcing of that they are made to signifie, namely, <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Mortification of every evil lust and concupiscence,</hi> and <hi>a renovation of our mindes into the perfect image of Christ,</hi> that his spirit may rule in us, and that the works of death and darknesse may be utterly destroied. For this Truth is plainly and literally contained in the Scripture; so that if your mindes were not more set upon fancies then savoury instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, you need not run a gadding after any new Guide for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this light. And, God be thanked, many honest plain-hearted Christians, that do not swagger and make such a noise with <hi>Mystical</hi> phrases as you, both hear and live according to these Gospel-Precepts, using a secret and silent severity upon themselves, not acting <hi>the rough and hairy Baptist</hi> upon others as you do, who love to o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tentate your <hi>self-chosen</hi> austerities to the eyes of the world, like the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who made sowr faces for fear the people should not take notice that they afflicted their bodies with fasting.</p>
               <p>What purchase therefore have you got by your <hi>Allegorical</hi> Mysteries? unlesse you have been emboldned thereby to let go the <hi>Historical truth of the Gospel,</hi> and have found your selves much at ease, that your belief is not charged with such miraculous things as are written of Christ, partly done already and partly to be done at the end of the World. For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you do proclaim your selves <hi>Infidels,</hi> and that for all your boasting, your spirits are so foul and impure, that they are no fit receptacles of the holy Christian Faith, but that you have levelled your selves as low as <hi>Epicures</hi> and <hi>Atheists,</hi> who are no more capable of the belief of these things then the Beasts of the Field.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If it be thus with you, I dare appeal unto you whether you keep so precisely to <hi>the light within you,</hi> but that you have consulted with
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:55305:281"/>
that blinde Guide <hi>H. Nicolas,</hi> and tasted of the treacherous sops of his abhorred Passover, whose Fanatick boldness has led the dance to this mad Apostasy. Have you not celebrated his detestable <hi>Phase,</hi> who has gone about to perswade the World that the greatest and truest <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canum</hi> of the Lords Supper is <hi>Iudas</hi>-like to betray their Master, to kill Christ according to <hi>the flesh,</hi> that is, to lay aside and misbelieve <hi>the Truth of his History?</hi> Ask your own hearts, if the warmth of this sop has not so encouraged you, nay inflamed you with insufferable bitternesse against the Ministers of Christ as teaching nothing but lies, because they have not ceased to believe the Truth. Has not this with him that entred in with it so intoxicated you with rage, that you have trampled the holy Bible under your feet? Is it not this that hath made you so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten roar against and revile the Preacher in the Pulpit, and disturb the publick Assemblies by your rude and frantick interpellations? Which Extravagancies demonstrate by what Spirit you are led, and that you are plainly Rebels against Christ, and are revolted to the Powers of the dark Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="7">7. These things I could not forbear to write, as being very much pressed in Spirit thereunto. For <hi>the Light within me,</hi> that is, <hi>my Reason and Conscience,</hi> does assure me that the ancient and Apostolick Faith according to the <hi>Historical</hi> meaning thereof is very solid and true; and that the Offices of Christ are never to be antiquated till his visible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Judgement according to the <hi>literal</hi> sense of the Creed; and that <hi>Familisme</hi> is a mere Flam of the Devil, a smooth tale to seduce the simple from their Allegeance to Christ.</p>
               <p>And therefore I beseech every man in these daies of Liberty to take heed how they turn in thither, especially those that are of an <hi>Enthusia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi> temper, such as are most of the honester and better-meaning <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</hi> For if in their bewildred wandrings they take up their Inne here, let them look to it that they be not robbed of all the Articles of the Christian Faith, and be stripped into naked Infidelity and Paganisme, and (which is worst of all) be so intoxicated with the cup of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantress, as to think this injury their gain, and to prefer false Liberty before their Christian Simplicity, and those gaudy and phantastick Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of being <hi>Deified</hi> and <hi>begodded</hi> before the real possession of Christian Truth and Godliness.</p>
               <p n="8">8. These things both here and elsewhere I have been forced to utter to the world; for it was as fire within me, and the discharging of my burden as it is mine own ease and satisfaction, so I do not despair but if there be that sincere Zeal to Truth and Holiness that is pretended, that it will redound to the safety of these melancholy Wanderers that look up and down for Truth with that candle of the Lord, the Spirit that he has lighted in them. But however where it shall not take effect, I shall neverthelesse be excused, and their bloud will be upon themselves and their accursed Seducers.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I know the haughty and covetous, that rellish nothing but the tearing to themselves undeserved respect from men, and clawing of money to them any way with their crooked talons, will hardly abstain
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:55305:282"/>
even from open derision of my zeal and solicitude for so contemned a people, and look upon me as a man of very mean designs, that would any way intermeddle with these poor despised Pilgrims. But these worldly Sophists consider not that the gaining of the meanest Soul to Eternal Salvation is really a greater prize then purchasing whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms upon Earth, and infinitely above all the pains of any mans applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereto.</p>
               <p>And besides, for mine own part, I have ever had so right a sense and touch upon my spirit of their condition, that I think none more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a mans best direction then they; the most imperious Sects having put such unhandsome vizards upon Christianity, that they have fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away these babes that seem to me very desirous of the sincere milk of the Word. Which having been every where so sophisticated by the humours and inventions of men, it has driven these anxious Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists to seek for <hi>a Teacher within,</hi> and to cast themselves upon him who they know will not deceive them, the voice of the Eternall Word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them; to which if they be faithfull, they assure themselves he will be faithfull to them again. Which is no groundless presumption of theirs, it supposing nothing but what is very closely consistent with the Nature of God and his Providence. And truly as many of them as do persist in that serious and impartial desire of such knowledge as tends to Life and Godliness, I do not question but that God will in his due time lead them into the Truth, and that they will be <hi>more confirmed Christians</hi> then ever.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Which success of theirs will be more speedy and sure, if (as they set themselves against other vices, so) they mainly bend their force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Spiritual <hi>Pride</hi> and affectation of peculiarity in Religion, and of finding themselves wiser in the mysteries thereof then the best of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians have pretended to. And above all things if they beware of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasme</hi> either in themselves or others, or of thinking that the gift of the Spirit can be any Revelation that is contrary to Reason or the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged History of Christ, the truth thereof being so rationally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible to all such as apply themselves without prejudice to examine it to the bottom. If in pursuance of their sincere intentions they keep off from these rocks, I doubt not but they will return safe again to <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> the great Pastor and Bishop of their Souls.</p>

               <p n="1">1. AFter this charitable Digression to meet with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> let us resume our business in hand, and make an end. <note n="*" place="margin">See Chap. 12. sect. 7.</note> The sixth and last thing that concerns the Care of the Christian Magistrate is <hi>Publick Worship.</hi> Which seems to me so natural and essential to Religion, that it cannot fail to appear, unless some force hinder it; in which case they will venture to meet in private Conventicles; that is, they will exercise their Acts of Religion as <hi>publickly</hi> as they dare, and will not be content to be confined to their Closets at home. <hi>Ioint-exercise</hi> therefore of Religion is confessed of all sides, which therefore must necessarily be <hi>external</hi> and <hi>visible.</hi> Now no visible actions can be done without <hi>visible Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and amongst these Circumstances some are more <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>decorous,</hi> some less; as is manifest at the first sight. Nor will it be hard to judge of the <hi>fitness</hi> or <hi>decorum</hi> of these <hi>Circumstances,</hi> if we can finde out <hi>a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> of them; which certainly is <hi>the End and meaning of them:</hi> Which is, <hi>the expression of our Honour and Reverence to God and to his Son Iesus Christ, and the Edification of our Neighbour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By which Rule we shall discover concerning the <hi>Meeting-House,</hi> as some had rather call it then <hi>the Church,</hi> that it ought to be of a <hi>comely</hi> stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, <hi>proportionably magnificent</hi> to the number of the People that are to have recourse to it in the common exercise of their Devotions. For though men of equal condition may make bold with themselves and meet in what place they please, yet it would be thought a piece of grosse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerliness to expect a Prince to give an inferiour Peasant the meeting in a Barn or Cow-stable. Would it not look then like a piece of irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious rudeness, which is truly a kinde of Prophaneness, to expect that Almighty God and his Son Jesus Christ should give us the meeting in squalid and sordid places, even then when we pretend most to shew our Reverence and Devotion to him? For though we may make bold one with another to meet where we please, yet we making our approaches to God in those places, and he thereby making his <hi>special</hi> approaches to us (for in a Philosophical sense he is every where alike) questionless it cannot but be an expression of our <hi>Reverence</hi> unto him to have the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the place proportionably capacious, well and fairly built, and
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:55305:283"/>
handsomely adorned, and as properly and significantly of our Religion and devotional homages we owe to our crucified Saviour, as can be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out suspicion of <hi>Idolatry</hi> or any scandalous Superstition. For it is true from the very light of Nature, which the knowledge of Christ does not extinguish, but direct and perfect, That Houses of Publick worship ought to have some <hi>Stateliness</hi> and <hi>Splendour</hi> in them expressive of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> we bear to the Godhead we do adore. And therefore the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Magistrate, for the honour of his Saviour who suffered so much shame for him, as also for making Christian Religion more recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them that are without, (for Religion will not seem Religion to any without Publick worship, nor a desirable Religion unless this Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worship be performed with inoffensive Splendour and Decency) ought to assist and abett such good practices as these.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is beyond the limits of my present Discourse to make any curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inquisition or determination concerning the particularities of this Publick Worship; though I cannot abstain from giving some general hints concerning the due managements of the chief matters thereof, such as are most obvious to think of and most useful to consider. And such are the Enquiries into the nature of the <hi>Place</hi> of this Publick worship, and the <hi>Holiness</hi> thereof, and our <hi>Demeanour</hi> therein, and especially of those chief performances of <hi>Preaching, Praying, Receiving the Sacrament,</hi> of <hi>Baptisme</hi> also and of <hi>Holy-days:</hi> To which we may adde those accessory helps of Devotion, as some account them, <hi>Musick</hi> and <hi>Pictures.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which I shall rather simply declare my sense of things, then so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitously endeavour to demonstrate my Conclusions by over-operose Reasonings; which will but raise a dust and provoke the Polemical Rabble.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Concerning therefore this <hi>House of Publick Worship</hi> the Christians meet in, I conceive there is no need to phansie it a <hi>Temple</hi>; nay rather it seems fit to look upon it as no Temple, the use of that Ceremony being antiquated by the excellency and supereminency of our Religion. For the famed <hi>Iehovah</hi> is not now a <hi>Topical</hi> Deity, nor Christ confined to this or that City or People, but is the declared Worship of the whole Earth, and is not contained within the wals of any Temple, but has his personal Residence in Heaven, whither our Devotions are to be directed, and our Mindes suspended and lifted up thitherward, not debased nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to the corners of any earthly Edifice, into which when a man looks he findes nothing worthy of adoration. To which Truth both <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> give their suffrage, the one declaring to the <hi>Iews,</hi> the other to the <hi>Areopagites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 7.48. Act. 17.24.</note> 
                  <hi>That the most High, who is Lord of Heaven and Earth, dwelleth not in Temples made with hands.</hi> And our Saviour himself to the <hi>Samaritan</hi> woman who was solicitous which of those Temples, that of <hi>Samaria</hi> or that of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was the right place of Worship, he tels her plainly that such <hi>Topical</hi> or <hi>Figurative</hi> worshipping of God was shortly to cease;<note place="margin">Joh. 4.23, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>That the hour was coming, and then was, when the true Worshippers shall worship the Father in Spirit and in truth. For the Father seeketh such to worship him.

                  <hi>Souls,</hi> and with the <hi>true service of Prayers</hi> and <hi>Praises</hi> and <hi>Alms-deeds,</hi> of which <hi>Incense</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were but the <hi>figures</hi> and <hi>shadows.</hi>

                  <hi>I saw,</hi> saith he, <hi>no Temple there, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the Temple of it:</hi> That is, their worship is directed immediatly towards God and Christ, not to any place, as the Jews ever worshipped toward the Temple of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. But though the nature and name of a <hi>Temple</hi> does not belong to this House of Publick worship according to the sense of Scripture (which made also the Primitive Christians carefully abstain from that nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) yet I do not see any ground at all why some of our phanciful Sects should take offence at the name of <hi>Church</hi> applied thereto. For the <hi>Church</hi> being an house wherein we meet to serve the <hi>Lord,</hi> whether God the Father or Christ his Son, both which are called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, this house is naturally there from denominated <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in Greek, whence is our English word <hi>Church,</hi> as every trivial Grammarian can tell them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But now it being thus plain, that it is <hi>an house for Divine worship,</hi> and therefore has a special relation to God, though it be not dedicated in such a solemn manner as <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, yet it does necessarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a kinde of <hi>Holiness</hi> hereby, and by this <hi>Holiness</hi> some measure of respect, namely, that it should be kept in handsome repair, and be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully defended from all foulness and nastiness both within and without. And because Custome has appropriated it to the service of God, unless very great necessity urge, it is not to be made use of to any other purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Those that are otherwise affected in this matter, may justly seem guilty of a kinde of Incivility against God, as I may so call it, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the being accounted Clowns in the sight of the Court of Heaven and all the holy Angels: As that also might be reputed a piece of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulness and obsolete Courtship, to complement any one part of this House, as if there were the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> there, and <hi>the Ark of the Covenant.</hi> For this would be to turn the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> into a <hi>Temple.</hi> Wherefore those that at their entrance into the Congregation either kneel down, or standing do their private devotion, and continue bare-headed before Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service begin, they mean not this Devotion to the Edifice, but te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie only with what fear and reverence they make their approaches to God; and their Hearts being in preparation to a nearer approach, shew their sense of his coming nearer to them by this reverential observance. For <hi>Veneration</hi> is done at the coming of great persons at great distances off; nor doth cease till a due distance after the congress.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Concerning <hi>Preaching,</hi> that which is most remarkable is this, That whereas there are three chief kindes thereof, namely, <hi>Catechizing, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding a Chapter,</hi> and <hi>Preaching</hi> usually so called, whereof the first is the best, and the last the least considerable of them all; this worst and last is the very Idol of some men, and the other rejected as things of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:55305:284"/>
worth, But assuredly they are of most virtue for the effectual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting the Gospel of Christ in the mindes of men, and of the two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as I said, <hi>Catechizing</hi> the better; because it enforces the catechized to take notice of what is taught him, and what is thus taught him is not so volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous but that he can carry it away and remember it for ever: and withall the <hi>most Useful,</hi> as being the very <hi>Fundamentals</hi> comprized in the Christian Creed, or the first and most natural results from them tending to indispensable duties of life; and therefore will alone, if sincerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and faithfully practised, carry a man to Heaven.</p>
               <p>But the next profitable way of <hi>Preaching</hi> is <hi>Expounding of a Chapter,</hi> provided that he that does so, makes it his only business (without any vain excursions to shew his reading) to render those places of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter that are obscure, easie and intelligible to the capacity of the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, with some brief, but earnest, urging of their duties from such passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as most necessarily tend thereto. This will make the private Reading of Scripture pleasant to his charge: And it will prove the more effectual for their good, if he contain himself within <hi>the New Testament,</hi> and fetch only so much out of <hi>the Old</hi> as will be subservient for the full understanding of the New. There is nothing so likely to convince the Conscience as this, when men are able to reade and understand the Text of Scripture it self, and are sensibly beat upon by the power of that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that is found in those Writings, far beyond all the fine Speeches and Phrases of humane Eloquence. Which yet is the greatest matter in this <hi>Third way of Preaching,</hi> and the truest use that can be made of it, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not to fill the peoples head with unprofitable or hurtful Opinions, but by the artifice of a more florid and flowing style, to raise the affections of the Auditors to the love and pursuit of such things as are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us by the Precepts of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>I confess therefore, <hi>This exercise</hi> may be of laudable use in such a Congregation where all the people are throughly grounded in the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of Christianity, and are well skilled in the knowledge of the Bible: otherwise if the other Two necessary wayes of <hi>Preaching</hi> be si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced by this more overly and plausible way, it is to the unspeakable detriment of the flock of Christ. Which will happen even then when it is performed after the very best manner. How great then is the evil, think you, when the exercise of their popular Eloquence is nothing but a Stage of ostentation and vain-glory to the Speaker, and begets nothing but an unsound blotedness and ventosity of Spirit in his hearers and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers, they being intoxicated with lushious and poisonous Opinions, which tend to nothing but the extinguishing of the love and endeavour after true Righteousness and Holiness, and the begetting in them a false security of minde and abhorred Libertinisme? Had it not been far better that they had rested in the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of their Faith comprised in the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> with an obligation on their Conscience to live according to the Laws of Christ and his holy Precepts, then to be led about and infatuated by the heat and noise of such false Guides?</p>
               <p n="8">8. Concerning <hi>Praying,</hi> it is an Epidemical mistake, <hi>That men think extemporary Prayers are by the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>that the Spirit is not in a Set
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:55305:284"/>
Form:</hi> Whenas in truth <hi>the Spirit</hi> may be absent in the highest <hi>extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary</hi> heats, and present in the use of set Forms, where there may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear greater calmness and coolness. For <hi>the Spirit of Praier does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the invention of words and phrases</hi> (which is rather a Gift of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the Faculty of <hi>extemporary</hi> speaking in other cases is, proceeding from heat and phansy and copiousness of the <note n="*" place="margin">See Book 2. Chap. 11. sect. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Animal</hi> Spirits) <hi>but in a firm belief in God through Christ, and in an hearty liking and sincere desire of having those holy things communicated to us that we pray for.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that <hi>reads,</hi> or <hi>hears</hi> a publick <hi>Liturgy</hi> read, in <hi>such a frame of minde</hi> as I have described, <hi>does as truly pray by the Spirit</hi> as he that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents words and phrases of his own. For there is nothing <hi>Divine</hi> but this <hi>holy Faith</hi> and <hi>Desire,</hi> the rest is mere Nature. And it is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration how ignorant these men are that talk so loud of <hi>the Spirit,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they cannot so much as discern what is truly <hi>Spiritual</hi> from what is but <hi>Animal</hi> and <hi>Natural.</hi> To which you may adde, That if none <hi>pray by the Spirit</hi> but those that invent their own words, the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are very <hi>Spiritless</hi> Prayers, they all hanging upon the lips of the Minister, who alone will be acknowledged to pray by <hi>the Spirit</hi>: Whose pretended assistance is not yet always so powerful as to protect him from the incurring of the danger of Non-sense, and of making the Publick Worship of God insipid or else distasteful and loathsome, or, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as ill, contemptible and ridiculous.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Wherefore it is far <hi>more safe,</hi> as it is undoubtedly <hi>more solemn,</hi> to use a <hi>publick Liturgy</hi> that bears the authority of the whole Church, then to venture so holy and devotional a performance upon the uncertainty of any mans private spirit, who will be but tempted to ostentate his own conceited Eloquence, or forced to discover his own weakness and folly. Whenas <hi>a set Form</hi> will prevent all <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>knackishness,</hi> and preserve the publick worship in its due reverence and honour, especially where it is contrived with that <hi>cautiousness,</hi> that nothing is expressed therein that engages the Minde in controverted Opinions, but speaks according to the known tenour of Scripture undepraved by humane glosses.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But you will say, if a Minister be cut so short in these performances of <hi>extemporary Praier</hi> and <hi>expatiating Preachments,</hi> how shall he be able to give any eximious Testimony of his abilities in his calling? how shall he have the opportunity of shewing his Gifts? To which I answer, That the end of the Ministry is not the Ostentation of any mans particular Gifts, but the Edification of the People; which are <hi>better edified</hi> by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent <hi>catechizing</hi> and faithful and judicious <hi>expounding of the Scripture,</hi> then by loose and ranging Discourses out of the Pulpit, where he that speaks having taken leave of his short Text, may fill the ears of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors with nothing but the noise of his own conceits and inventions: whenas in the Exposition of a whole Chapter (suppose) at a time, the peoples mindes will be kept closer to those infallible Oracles, and will more easily discern the prevarications of their Teacher. But for the greater assurance against any foul play of this kinde, his misinterpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of these Holy Writings to Loosnesse and Libertinism should be the forfeiture of the exercise of his Function.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="540" facs="tcp:55305:285"/>11. Besides, I do not speak so much to exclude <hi>Preaching,</hi> as to bring <hi>Catechizing</hi> and <hi>Expounding</hi> into more request, which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly more useful and edifying. Nay, I think that some well-tuned strains of unaffected Eloquence at the <hi>chief Festivals</hi> of the Year, and in occasional Exhortations to the people upon observation of what is most amiss amongst them, done with a great deal of seriousness and gravity, as also at <hi>publick Fasts</hi> and <hi>Thanksgivings,</hi> were a thing of excellent use, and of the more efficacy, it being the more seldom. But for other days, If our Saviour Christs <hi>Sermon on the Mount</hi> were read with much reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and emphatick distinctness; it being the advice of so sacred and infallible a person, in whose mouth there was neither Errour nor Guile, who was the Son of God clothed with the formalities of our flesh, on purpose to take the chair awhile amongst us, and to read us sound and warrantable Lectures of Divinity; in whose behalf God the Father condescended to do the Office of a <hi>Praeco,</hi> and commanded silence out of the Clouds, saying, <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear him</hi>; who was so faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and compassionate a Pastour to his Flock, that he laid down his life for his Sheep, and so beloved of his Father, that he was miraculously rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from the dead, and taken up into heaven; and lastly, who shall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly descend thence, and judge every man according to his works; If <hi>this Sermon,</hi> I say, of wholsome advice and holy Precepts, were read di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly and reverently to the people, how can it but be more edifying and work more upon their spirits for their good, then the sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticated and affected Rhetorick of a fallible Mortal? Besides the keeping out the danger of being either choaked with the crooked and spinose Controversies of <hi>Polemical</hi> Divinity, or of being poisoned or intoxicated with the unwholsome sugar-sops of <hi>Antinomianism</hi> and <hi>Libertinism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. And lastly, to answer still more home to the point, If thou hast a desire <hi>to magnifie thy Ministry</hi> in an eximious manner, in stead of ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thy <hi>Gifts,</hi> exercise and improve thy <hi>Graces</hi> to the highest thou canst. Endeavour to the utmost to be an unblemished Example to thy flock of <hi>Humility,</hi> of <hi>Brotherly kindeness,</hi> of <hi>Obedience to the Magistrate,</hi> of <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,</hi> of <hi>exact Iustness in thy dealing,</hi> of <hi>Compassion to the poor and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> Use thy best <hi>Prudence to keep Peace and Love</hi> amongst thy charge, as it becomes Christians, and to <hi>invite the more able to a charitable relief</hi> and help of those that are in want and necessity, that no unsupportable distresse may make the lives of our fellow-members comfortless: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so privately <hi>to reprove</hi> those that are guilty of any scandalous miscarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but with the wisest and discreetest applications that may be; that thy <hi>Reprehensions,</hi> as they ought, so they may appear to proceed from nothing but from love, and from care and conscience of thy duty. In which if thou wouldest not lose thine authority and confidence, thou must live exactly in the indispensable Laws of Christ thy self, nor make these solemn Reproofs but for the breach of such. But if thou be really vitious thy self in these, or, to make thy self seem more holy, rebuke for the neglect of some petty mock-vertues of thine own chusing, thou shalt not fail to be either odious or ridiculous.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="541" facs="tcp:55305:285"/>But here the great Hypocrisie is this, That to compensate their neglect in these indispensable and highly-concerning Duties of the Ministry, they abound in empty Lip-labour, and endeavour to conciliate authority to themselves by their pretended spiritual Gifts of <hi>extemporary Praying and Preaching,</hi> in stead of that <hi>unblemished Sanctity of life,</hi> of <hi>useful Prudence</hi> in behalf of their Charge, and of <hi>Christian Goodnesse</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> And that they may keep up their credit more certainly with the people, they lay their foundation wisely, namely, by giving them to understand that there is no hope of living as we should do, or any need thereof; and so making their whole flock as rotten as themselves both in Principles and Practice, there being none left to reprove the false Prophet by either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of life or contrariety of doctrine, he thus secures to himself his authority entire by his admired clack of the Tongue, which some call <hi>The knack of preaching and praying.</hi> Which yet, where better intended, is of as little efficacy as a Tar-bottle hung out on a Thorn-bush, if compared with personal application and private information and reproof. For that is like the Adfriction of the pastoral medicine to a diseased Sheep, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the formality of the Bottle on the Bush will do no cure, let the flock be gathered about it never so solemnly.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Touching the <hi>Communion</hi>; None are to be excluded therefrom that professe their belief of the Holy Scriptures &amp; of the Apostles Creed in the plain literal and Historical sense thereof; unless they stand guilty of some gross and scandalous sins (which are to be nominated in some known Law concerning this matter, and not to be left to the uncertainty of any private Ministers Judgement) and do persist therein impenitent and unreclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For it were the greatest treachery to the party that could be, by admitting him to this <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> to make him more secure in such sins as will be sure, while they are unrepented of, to exclude him from that <hi>Heavenly Communion of Saints</hi> for ever. Besides the <hi>Scandal</hi> and Offence to the rest of the serious and sincere-hearted Communicants, to whom the sight will appear as ugly as if one having fallen over head and ears into the dirt, should in that black miry hue, droppingly dirty, place himself at table amongst persons of quality, whom the Master of the Feast had invited upon some special entertainment.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>the Posture of the Communicant,</hi> as there are none that are so curious as to reduce it to that in which Christ and his Disciples celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his last Supper, so none ought to be so captious as to take offence if one receive the Communion <hi>kneeling,</hi> in devotion to God and humble thankfulnesse for that great Benefit that is signified thereby, namely, the <hi>Death of Christ</hi> with the Results thereof, and <hi>the participation of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud</hi> in that sense I have spoken of <note n="*" place="margin">Book 8. c. 9. sect. 2. also c. 10. sect. 2, 3.</note> elsewhere; nor if another take it <hi>sitting,</hi> as it is a celebration of a Supper, or that he may clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of the suspicion of Idolizing the outward Elements of Bread and Wine. For it is as well unjust as uncharitable to be at all scandalized at actions that have such innocent and allowable grounds, and the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable at the celebrating of such a Mystery as is wholly made up of <hi>love and affection to Christ and to one another.</hi> I confess an <hi>Uniformity</hi> would look better in outward shew, but is not worth the least stir or violence in
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:55305:286"/>
diversities of actions or rather circumstances interpretable to so good a meaning. And the reall exercise of our <hi>Charity</hi> in leaving every one free, is every whit as suitable to this solemn performance as the most exquisite <hi>Uniformity,</hi> if devoid of the spirit of Meekness and mutual For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Concerning <hi>Baptisme</hi>; The more seriously a man looks into it, the more certain he will find it, That the Scripture has defined nothing concerning <hi>the time of baptising</hi> those that are born of believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Some adventure further, and affirm there is no Precept for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them at all, and that they are Members already of the Church by being born of them that are. To the latter of which I answer, That if they be capable of <hi>Membership,</hi> how can they be uncapable of the <hi>Sign</hi> thereof? But to those that acknowledge that they must be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, it being plain that no time is set down in Scripture, I say, it is naturally left to the power of the Church to appoint that time which she thinks to be most convenient. For though it may seem more excusable to call the Churches authority into question, of appointing new Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies or such circumstances of the old as are not necessary; yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be judged an unsufferable piece of temerity to question it here concerning such a circumstance as the substance cannot be performed without it. For if any one be baptized, he must be baptized some time or other. And in my judgement, though the Arguments of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries make a bold shew, she has pitched upon the safest. For I am very inclinable to believe, though I think I am as little superstitious as another, that there does some reall good accrew to an Infant from thus early being dedicated to Christ by the sincere devotion of his Parents. Which dedication he himself is more fully to ratifie and complete pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly in the Church, when he comes to years of discretion, when he will be able to make distinct Answers to such Questions as it is over-obvious to imagine were unseasonably asked him when he could not speak.</p>
               <p>But for the <hi>Cross</hi> in Baptisme, it was so seasonable at the first Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution thereof, while professed Pagans were mingled among the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and so significant alwaies, that if the Church cannot make such an additional as this, she cannot make any at all. But <hi>Unity of hearts</hi> being better then <hi>Uniformity in actions indifferent,</hi> there ought to be no breach nor quarrel about these things. But if the Parents consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiously deferre the Childs Baptisme till years of discretion, or desire it should be baptized in its infancy, if they like the signing of it with <hi>the sign of the Cross</hi> or the omission of it, the Minister will conciliate more authority to himself by professing his indifferency in these things, and his high value of the <hi>Indispensables</hi> of Christianity and of his tender regard to the Consciences of men, (which is a thing more sacred then any Ceremony that is not of Gods own institution,) then if he drew too hard to an <hi>Uniforme</hi> compliance in things where Christ has left us free. For the visible exercise of professed <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>kind forbearance</hi> is a more comely ornament of the Church then <hi>constrained Uniformity.</hi> Nay I will adde, That a constant profession of an <hi>Indifferency</hi> may sooner
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:55305:286"/>
make the Church <hi>Uniforme,</hi> then the placing Religion in these things. For contestation ceaseth when the Object is judged of little value.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Touching <hi>Musick,</hi> it is evident that <hi>Hymns and Songs</hi> were the timeliest piece of Publick worship that was offered to Christ. And truly I think the Church having Authority to frame a publick Liturgy <hi>in prose,</hi> they should do well not to confine their singing to <hi>David's Psalms,</hi> but also to compose <hi>Songs</hi> of their own, in an easie and unaffected Style, but in <hi>warrantable</hi> both <hi>language</hi> and <hi>meeter</hi>; and get <hi>Tunes</hi> set to them, not over-operose and artificial, nor over-plain and languid; which need not be many in number, and might be taught children betimes, so that there might be no need of the unsanctified throats of mere Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries to fill up the Quire, but that all Musical devotions might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the whole congregation, every Christian making it <hi>a piece of the Education of his children to learn the Tunes of the Church,</hi> who therefore would be near-upon as soon fit to <hi>sing</hi> as to <hi>pray</hi> with the rest of the Assembly.</p>
               <p>These <hi>Hymns</hi> composed by the Church should be chiefly for the <hi>main Holy-days</hi> thereof, appointed for the celebrating (suppose) of <hi>the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> of <hi>the Passion,</hi> of <hi>the Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Ascension</hi> of our Saviour, and of <hi>the Mission of the Holy Ghost.</hi> For it seems to me a thing almost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond belief, That a Nation should <hi>believe the History of Christ,</hi> that he was <hi>God incarnate at such a time,</hi> and that <hi>the same incarnate Deity suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> &amp;c. and yet not be so much transported with the consideration, as to celebrate such <hi>stupendious passages</hi> by <hi>Anniversary Solemnities</hi>; since that to adorn the year with <hi>Festivals</hi> and <hi>Holy-days</hi> is according to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dictate of Nature and practice of all Nations. Wherefore those that pretend to so much <hi>Spirituality</hi> as to cast out <hi>all observation of dayes,</hi> I wish it be not a symptome of <hi>Infidelity</hi> in them, and of a secret quarrell they have to the truth of Christianity it self. For those that are most perfect in Divine accomplishments, cannot enjoy the actual enravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that may arise from this perfection without vacancy from secular emploiments, for which these <hi>Holy-dayes</hi> therefore are most fit: and those that are less perfect, by their vacation from worldly drudgery have the opportunity of searching more closely into the state and condition of their Souls, and of more serious Meditations and resolutions of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing their life to the most perfect patterns of Truth and Sanctity.</p>
               <p>And for this very purpose <hi>The observation</hi> of every <hi>Seventh day</hi> should be <hi>inviolable,</hi> not to be profaned by either secular imploiments or foolish pastimes; but spent in Religious exercises either publick or private; not as placing any Sanctity in dayes, but in laying hold of so good an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for the completing of the work of Godliness in us, and meditating upon the infinite Goodness of God in the Mystery of the <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Redemption</hi> of mankind.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The knowledge of the latter of which being so appropriate to us Christians, that we are acquainted with the main strokes of the process thereof, it is more worthy and becoming us not to huddle up all in one day, but distinctly to celebrate the main Particularities of so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Mystery, such as are, <hi>the Nativity</hi> of Christ, his <hi>Passion, Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi>

and the rest; amongst which <hi>the celebration of his Passion</hi> being most useful and edifying, the solemnity thereof ought to be at least as sacred and as frequented and as religiously celebrated with <hi>preaching, praying</hi> and <hi>singing,</hi> as any other day, and that in a way appropriate to that solemnity with <hi>Hymnes</hi> and <hi>Songs</hi> also proper for the <hi>Passion</hi> of Christ, and <hi>mournful</hi> and <hi>melting Tunes</hi> proper to these <hi>Songs</hi> composed by the Church.</p>
               <p>Which <hi>Passion-songs</hi> would be also usefull upon <hi>Communion-dayes,</hi> they containing in them Devotional desires and resolutions of crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our affections and lusts, and of faithful love to Christ and to one another; which are the Great things that the <hi>Passion</hi> of Christ points us to and would enforce upon us. Wherefore the Morning-singings on a <hi>Communion-day</hi> may very well be supplied by these <hi>Passion-songs.</hi> But <hi>at the Receiving of the Communion,</hi> while the Bread and the Cup pass about, some Psalmes of <hi>David</hi> that appear most proper, and that declare the great Goodness and Mercies of God, or some Songs of the Churche's composing appropriate to the purpose, full of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acknowledgments and holy resolutions, may be sung all the time in more chearful Tunes, such as the <hi>Ascension-songs</hi> and <hi>Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-songs</hi> are sung in. All which <hi>Songs</hi> of the Church are to urge duty upon men and press on holiness, upon considerations naturally flowing from the belief of the things we do solemnize.</p>
               <p>If to the singing of these skilfully-composed Songs and choice Psalmes, there were added also the help of an <hi>Organ,</hi> for the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain regulating of this singing part of Devotion and the more affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate performance thereof; it will not be easie to imagine what is wanting to a due and unexceptionable filling up of all comely circumstances of that Publick worship that is fit to be practised by professed Christians, unless you would bring in also <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Pictures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. But to speak my sense and judgment of things freely; The mere placing of <hi>Images</hi> or <hi>Statues</hi> in a Church is a very bold and daring Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle: but the bowing towards them, or praying with bended knees and eyes devoutly lift up to them, is intolerable, if Pagan Idolatry be so; nay in some regard worse, that is, more irrationall and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, forasmuch as these Statues are not supposed to be the Rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptacle of the Spirit of him they pray to: So that their way of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is utterly groundless, senseless and sottish, as well as impious and Idolatrous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pictures</hi> I must con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ess are <hi>a more modest Representation</hi>; and the consideration of the vile reproaches some foul mouths have heretofore, and do sometimes still cast upon <hi>the crucified Iesus,</hi> may tempt the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Lovers of his Person to a conceit that if there were a Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his <hi>Crucifixion</hi> in picture, and that they bowed to it at their coming into the Church, it were but an innocent satisfaction to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so publickly to do their homage to their Saviour in that Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that he is most scorned and reproached in, and but a just compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation to him for the reproaches that vile and wicked persons cast out against him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="545" facs="tcp:55305:287"/>But to this I answer, first, That the determining our Worship to any part of the Church would look like the turning of our Christian Meeting-Houses into <hi>Temples,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 21 22.</note> contrary to what is written, <hi>I saw no Temple there.</hi> And then in the second place, Though the fetches of mans Wit are very fine and subtile in these cases, yet it is expresly said that <hi>God is a jealous God,</hi> and there are many scrupulous and jealous men, as well in Christendome as out of Christendome; and therefore a practice that is not right in it self, and so exceeding scandalous to others, ought by no means to obtain in the publick Worship of Christians.</p>
               <p>If there be any permission of <hi>Pictures</hi> therefore in the Church, it must not be for <hi>worship</hi> but for <hi>ornament,</hi> which they will scarce be without considerable cost; nor that cost again well placed, unless there be some <hi>Edification</hi> by them. And therefore I doe not conceive how they will be tolerable at all without some proper <hi>Inscriptions</hi> also ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned: As upon the Picture of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Ascension</hi> of Christ some such Inscription as that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Coloss. 3.1.</note> 
                  <hi>If you be risen with Christ, seek those things that are above.</hi> Upon the Picture of the <hi>Passion</hi> of Christ some such as these,<note place="margin">John 12.32.</note> 
                  <hi>When I am lifted up, I shall draw all men unto me. Those that are of Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.24.</note> 
                  <hi>have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. Greater love hath no man then this,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 15.13.</note> 
                  <hi>that he lay down his life for his friends, This is my commandement,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 13.34.</note> 
                  <hi>that as I have loved you, so you would likewise love one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus every Piece, which are not to be many, should have their proper Inscriptions, without which they should not be permitted in the Church, as being fit for nothing but to amuze the sight. But now they are no sooner seen, but they set a mans Mind awork, and cause him to think of the most important meaning of the chief passages of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of Christ. Of which none are more effectuall then that of his <hi>Passion</hi>; which together with the <hi>Passion-songs</hi> and <hi>Tunes</hi> and <hi>Organs</hi> may wound the Heart of a man, and let out more corrupt bloud at one touch, then the faint hackings of a dry Discourse of an hour or two long. Which helps and ornaments of Publick worship will fill up all the numbers of all warrantable splendour and comeliness, and keep out, if precisely kept to, all shadow and suspicion of either Superstition or Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>
               <p>But if any should be so weak or scrupulous as to take offence at so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable use of <hi>Pictures</hi> in the Church, and particularly, if our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion should be the less recommendable thereby to either <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Turks,</hi> whose conversion we are not onely to desire, but with seriousness and faithfulness to apply our selves to, at least to remove all scandals and stumbling-blocks out of their way; rather then any such dispensable Punctilios should hinder the enlargement of Christs Kingdome in the essential Soveraignty thereof comprehended in the express Precepts of the written Word, a full Pencil of white directed by Charities own hand should wipe out all these well-meant delineations and Inscriptions, and to compensate the loss,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.16.</note> that one of S. <hi>Paul</hi> should succeed, <hi>If any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custome, neither the Churches of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">
                  <pb n="546" facs="tcp:55305:288"/>18. To conclude, Such is the Truth and Simplicity of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that if the authority of the Church think good to recommend any <hi>Additional</hi> circumstances of divine Worship, they must not be for inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Pomp and Show, but for real Use and Edification; affecting such a beauty and comeliness as Nature does in living Creatures, whose pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chritude is the result of such a Symmetry of Parts and tenour of Spirits as implies vigour and ability to all the functions of life. And truly there should be no more <hi>Ceremony</hi> in the Church, then the Use thereof may be obvious to understand, and the Life and Power of Holiness may throughly actuate; that our Minds may not be amused, lost, sunk in, or fixed upon any Outward things here, but be carried from all Visible pomps to the love and admiration of our Blessed Saviour in Heaven, and of that Heavenly and Divine Life that he came into the world to beget in the hearts of all true Believers.</p>
               <p>And what we have said of <hi>additional Ceremonies,</hi> there is the same reason of <hi>deductional Opinions,</hi> they are to have their recommendation from their Use and Efficacy in promoting Life and Godliness in the Souls of men. But their obtrusion is as unwarrantable as of the other, if not more. Forasmuch as <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are most-what indifferent, <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> never, but determinately true or false, or to be held so by them that either doubt or think the contrary: Which therefore is a greater vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to ingenuous Natures. As also the <hi>Usurpation</hi> greater to intrude into either the <hi>Prophetick</hi> or <hi>Legislative</hi> office of Christ, then to affect to be onely the master of the Ceremonies; and the <hi>Superstition</hi> alike, since <hi>Superstition</hi> is nothing else but a fear and scrupulosity about such things as bear no estimate in the eyes of God: as certainly neither of these do one way nor other, neither <hi>Opinions</hi> that concern not Life and Godliness, nor <hi>Ceremonies</hi> that are of an indifferent nature, and may of themselves be either practised or omitted. And therefore for men to be affected ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morously and meticulously in these things, it is a sign they understand not the royal Law of Christian Liberty, and commit that which is the main vice included in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Superstition,</hi> in that they phansy to themselves a pettish and captious Deity.</p>
               <p>Whence it is manifest that the over-careful using or scrupulously omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of indifferent <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as also over-much solicitude in the reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or embracing of useless and uncertain <hi>Opinions,</hi> is no commendable Worship or Service, but rather an implicite Reproach of the Holy God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head they profess to adore.</p>
