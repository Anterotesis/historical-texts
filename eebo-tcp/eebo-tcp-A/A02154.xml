         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Desire is the daughter of destinie, and the simpathie of

treason in effect, I cannot but wonder what she is that

craue it, tell me her name, that I may censure of her

her this answere: Madame as I dare not discourse my

this is not all, for in winning her loue, thou loosest a
friend: than which, there is nothing more pretious, as
there is nothing more rare: as <hi>Corruptio vnius est ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratio

an enemie and such a mortall foe as will apply all his

in dreaming of thy destruction. For if brute beasts
will reuenge such brutish wrongs as adultery, then ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
no man to be so patient, that will ouerpasse so grosse
an iniurie: assure thy selfe of this <hi>Lutesio,</hi> if her husband
heare of your loues, he will aime at your liues: he will
leaue no confection vntempered, no poyson vnsearcht, no
mynerall vntried, no Aconiton vnbrused, no hearbe, trée,
roote, stone, simple or secret vnsought, till reuenge hath
satisfied the burning thirst of his hate: so shalt thou feare
with whom to drincke, with whome to conuerse, when
to walke, how to performe thy affaires, onely for doubt
of her reuenging husband, and thy protested enemie. If
such vnlawull lust, such vnkinde desires, such vnchast
loue procure so great losse, and so many perils reuert it
<hi>Lutesio</hi> as a passion most pernitious, as a shine most odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

this he much <hi>Lutesio,</hi> yet this is not all: for many loue
that are neuer liked, and euerie one that woes is not a

are to small effect: suppose the Ladie whome thou louest
is honest: then is thy loue as vnlikely as <hi>Ixions</hi> was to

the more he thirsted, and the more he was perswaded to
trust in her honesty, the more he was suspitious, and
doubted of her vertue: for he replyed still in his ielous
humour that womens wordes were no warrantes of
their truth, that as the Onix is inwardly most cold, when
it is outwardly most hot: so womens wordes are like the
cries of Lapwings, farthest from their thoughts, as they
are from their nests: they proclaime silence with their
tongues, modestie with their eies, chastitie with their
actions, when in their heartes they are plotting how to
grant an amorous pleasure to their louers: Tush saies
<hi>Philippo,</hi> womens tongues are tipt with deceite: they
can sing with the Nightingale, though they haue a prick
at their brests: they can lend him a cherrie lippe whome
they heartily loathe, and fawne vpon her husbands neck
when she giues her louer a wincke: Though my wife

and whet on a friend to a fayned fancie which in

Is not he worthy to finde that seekes: and deserueth he

will buy the Buckes head, is he not worthy to haue

most hard inuectiues against him, yet at last that shée
might aggrauate hir husbands displeasure the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

hauing somewhat cooled her choler, shee resolued not to

tooke no knowledge of any thing but past it ouer

and went not in as his custome was boldly, but walking in
the hall asked one of the Earls Gentlemen if the Countesse
were stirring: he maruelling at <hi>Lutesios</hi> strangenesse, smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and said, sir what needes this question? my Ladie is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone

pray you quoth <hi>Lutesio</hi> go to the Countesse, and tell her I

               </gap>th wordes of <hi>Lutesio,</hi> yet hee went vp and tolde
his Ladie the message, who presently leauing her booke and
companie, all to auoyd out of the chamber, sent for him vp:
who no sooner came into her presence, but she saluted hym
with such a frowne, that he stood as mortified as if hee had
béene strocken with the eye of a Baselisk. <hi>Philomela</hi> seeing
him in this passionate agonie, began with him thus.</p>
            <p>I cannot tell <hi>Lutesio,</hi> howe to salute thee eyther with
lookes or speeches, seeing thou art not as thou séemedst once
my welwisher and my husbandes friend. The <hi>Lapidaries</hi>
value the stones no longer than they hold their vertues: nor
<hi>I</hi> prise a Gentleman no longer than he regardes his honor.
For as a Diamont with a clowd is cast into the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smithes

if to trie me, thou shalt finde the more fauour: If to
betray me, hope for nothing but reuenge: <hi>Lutesio</hi> hearing
<hi>Philomela</hi> so honourably peremptorie, with blushing chéeks
made him this answere.</p>
            <p>Madam as my face bewrayes my folly, and my ruddie

by the faith of a Gentleman then assure your selfe mine eye
hath euer loued you, but neuer vnlawfully: and what
humble dutie I haue showne you, hath béene to honour you,
not to dishonest you. This letter was but to make triall
howe you liked <hi>Philippo,</hi> to whome <hi>I</hi> owe such faith that
it would greeue me he should haue a wife false: I knowe
not Madam what humour drewe mee on to it. <hi>I</hi> am sure
neither your wanton lookes nor light demeanours, but a
kinde of passion destined to breed mine owne preiudice, if
your fauour exceede not my desertes: If therefore your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diship
shall forget and forgiue this folly, and conceale it
from the Earle, who perhaps may take it meant in earnest,
enioyne me any penance Madam, and I will performe it
with patience. <hi>Philomela</hi> hearing <hi>Lutesio</hi> thus penitent,
began to cleere vp hir countenance, and said to him thus: it
is folly to rub the skarre when the wound is almost whole,
or to renewe quarrelles when the matter is put in compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise:
therefore omitting all <hi>Lutesio I</hi> pardon thee, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
neither to remember thy folly my selfe, nor yet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale
it to my husband, but thou shalt be euery way as har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
welcome to me as thou wert woont: onely this shall be
thy penance, to sweare vppon this bible neuer héereafter to
motion me of anie dishonestie. To this <hi>Letusio</hi> willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
granted and tooke his oath: so were they reconciled, and
the Countesse called for a cup of wine, and drunke to him:
and after to passe away the after-noone they fell to chesse:
after a mate or two, the Countesse was called aside,

met the Duke whome he tooke by the arme: and let him
into one of the priuie walks, &amp; there recounted vnto him
what reconcilement was growen betweene him and the

without any more crosse humors they past a long time in

            <p>
               <hi>Philippo,</hi> who had not quite extinguished suspition,

to conceit a newe insight into his wiues actions, &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
generally he mistrusted her before, and onely thought
her a wanton as she was a woman. Nowe he suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that there was too much familiaritie betwéene her &amp;
<hi>Lutecio,</hi> and flatly that betwéene them both he wore the

            <p>
               <hi>Philippo</hi> thou wert too fond, to plot <hi>Lutesio</hi> a means

her satiable answere, was but a cloak for the rayne:
for euer since they haue bene more familiare and lesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder,
nor she is neuer merrye if <hi>Lutesio</hi> beginne not the

as when the Halcirines hatch, the sea is calme, and the

but when she is matcht in the companye of <hi>Lutesio,</hi> this
curtesie growes of some priuate kindnes, which if I can
finde out by iust proofe and circumstance, let me alone to
reuenge to the vttermost.</p>
            <p>In this iellouse passion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he passed away manye dayes

peeping in at the locke hole, saw them two standing at a
bay windowe, hand in hand, talking verye familiarlye:
which fight strooke suche a suspitious furye into his head,
that he was halfe frantick, yet did he smother what hee
thought in silence, and going downe into the garden, left
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two still togeather: being there alone by him selfe, he

him from his drowsy melancholy, with the pleasaunt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices
of <hi>Signior Lutesio. Philippo</hi> making at all no shew
of his suspition, but entertained his freend with all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
familiarity, so that they past awaye that days
with all contented pleasures, till night the infortunate
breeder of <hi>Philomelas</hi> misfortunes grew on: when she and

the Earle went to bed togeather, for as she laye talking,
she started, being new quickned with childe, &amp; feeling the

haue a young sonne: at this his hart waxed coulde, and
he questioned her if shee were with childe, shee taking his
hand laying it on her side, said: feele my Lord, you maye
perceiue it mooue, with that it leapt against his hande.

acquaintance iumps in an euen date, this fowre yeere I
haue beene thy husband, and could not raise vppe thy bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and <hi>Lutesio</hi> no soner grew familiar with thee, but hee
got thee with childe, and were it not base strumpet, that
I reserue thee to further infamy, I would presentlye but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
thee and the brat, both with one stab, and with that
he floung out of the chamber, leauing poore <hi>Philomela</hi> in
a great mase, to heere this vnlookt for discourse: in so much
that after she had lyen a while in a traunce, comming to
her selfe, she burst foorth into aboundaunce of teares, and
passed away the night in bitter complaints, whilest <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippo</hi>
mad with the frantick humour of Ielousie, sate in
his study hamring how he might bring both <hi>Lutesio,</hi> and
her to confusion, one while he resolued to prouide Gallies
ready for his passage, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to murther both his wife &amp; <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesio,</hi>
and so to flee away into some foraine countrey, then
he determined to accuse them before the Duke his néere
kinsman, and haue them openly punished with the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
of the law, but he wanted witnesses to confirme his
Ielouse allegations: being thus in a quandary, at last he
called vp two genowaies his seruants, slaues that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
regarded God, religion, nor conscience, and them hée
suborned with swéet perswasions and large promises, to
sweare that he and they did take <hi>Lutesio</hi> and <hi>Philomela,</hi>
in an adulterous action, although the base villaines, had
at all no sparkes of honesty in their mindes, yet the honor
of their lady, her courtes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vnwilling to blemishe her good name with their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries,
yet at last the County cloyde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so with the hope
of golde, that they gaue free consent to confirme by oath,
what so euer he should plot down to them. Whereupon
the next morning the Earle gat him early to the Duke of

Uenice who was hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

complaint of the dishonor offered him by his wife and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior
<hi>Lutesio:</hi> crauing iustice, that he might haue suche a
manifest iniurie redressed with the rigour of the Lawe.
The Duke whose name was <hi>Lorenso Medici,</hi> greeued
that his kinsman was vexed with such a crosse, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
that <hi>Philomela,</hi> that was so famous in Italye for
her beutye and vertue, should dishonour her selfe and her
husband by yelding her loue to lasciuious <hi>Lutesio,</hi> swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a present dispatch of reuenge, and thereupon graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out warrantes to bring them both presentlye before
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philippo</hi> glad of this, went his waye to the house of
<hi>Lutesio,</hi> wel armd, and euery way appointed, as if he had
gone to sacke the strongest houlde in all Italye, carrying
with him a crue of his freends &amp; familiars, furnished at al

they came to his house, they found one of his seruants fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

&amp; merueiled what the reason should be, hee was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaied
with such a multitude. <hi>Philippo</hi> demaunded
of him where his master was, walking may it please your
honour, (quoth he) in his garden. Then sayes the earle
if he be no more busie, I will be so bould as to goe speak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who preasing in after the Earle, encountered <hi>Lutesio,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from his gardine to go into his chamber, assone as
he spied <hi>Philippo,</hi> with a merrye looke, as if his harte had
commanded his eyes, to bid him welcome, he saluted the
Earle most gratiously, but highlye was astonished, to see
such a troope at his heeles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philippo</hi> (contrarie as <hi>Lutesio</hi> offered to imbrace him
with his best hand) tooke him fast by the bosome, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
forth his poineard, said: Traitour, were it not I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
mine honor, and were loath to be blemisht with the
bloud of so base a companion, I would rip out that false
<pb facs="tcp:6190:21"/>
hart that hath violated the faith once vnited betwixt vs,
but the extremitie of the lawe shall reuenge thy villanie:
and therefore Officers, take him into your custodie, and
carie him presentlie to the Duke, whether I will bring
straight the strumpet his Paramour, that they maye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

            <p>Poore <hi>Lutesio,</hi> who little lookt for such a gréeting of the
Earle, woondred whence this bitter spéech should growe,
so deeply amazed, that he stood as a man in a trance, til at
last gathering his wits together, hee began humblie and
fearefullie to haue replied, when the Earle commaunded
the officers to carrie him awaie, and would not heare him
vtter anie word. He speeding him home to his own house
to fetch his sorrowful and faultles wife to heare the bale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
verdict of hir appeached innocency: comming vp into
her bed chamber, hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ound her sitting by her bed side, on
her knees in most hartie and deuout praier, that it would
please God to cleer her husband from his iealosie, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
her from anie open reproach or slaunder, vttering her
Orisons with such heart breaking sighs, and aboundance
of teares, that the base catchpoles that came in with him
tooke pittie, and did compassionate the extremitie of her
passions: But <hi>Philippo,</hi> as if he had participated his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with the bloudthirstie Caniball, or eaten of the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin
root, that maketh a man to be as cruell in heart as it
is hard in the rynde, stept to her &amp; casting her backward,
bad her arise strumpet, and hastely make her ready, for
the Duke staied for her comming, and had sent his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
to fetch her.</p>
            <p>Perplexed <hi>Philomela,</hi> casting vp her eie, and séeing
such a crue of rake-hels, ready to attend vpon him, was so
surchardged with griefe, that she fell downe in a passion:
<hi>Philippo</hi> let her lie, but the Ministers stept vnto her and
receiued her againe assoone as shee was come to her selfe,
she desired <hi>Philippo,</hi> that for all the loue of their youth he
<pb facs="tcp:6190:21"/>
would grant her but onely this one fauour, that she might
not be carried before the Duke with that common atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
but that she and he might goe together without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
further open discredit, and then if she could not prooue
her selfe innocent, let her without fauour abide the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the Lawe: although shee craued this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oone with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of teares, yet <hi>Philippo</hi> would haue no remorse
but compelled her to attire herselfe, and then conuayed
her with this crue to the Dukes palace, where there was
gathered together all the Consigladiors and chiefe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
of the Cittie, her passing through the stréetes,
draue a great wonder to the Uenetians, what the cause
of hir trouble should be: so that infinite number of Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
followed her, and as manie as could, thrust into the
common Hall to heare what should bee obiected against
<hi>Philomela.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At last, when the Iudges were set, and <hi>Lutesio</hi> and
<hi>Philomela</hi> brought to the barre: the Duke commaunded
<hi>Philipo</hi> to discourse what article she had to obiect against
his wife and <hi>Lutesio. Phillippo</hi> with his eies full of Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie,
and heart armed with reuenge, looking on them
both, fetching a deepe sigh, began thus. It is not vnknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en

<pb facs="tcp:6190:23"/>
but God, who knoweth me guiltlesse, and to thine owne
conscience: whose worme for this wronge, will euer bee
restlesse. My banishment I brooke with patience, in that
I know time wil discouer any truth in my absence: smoak
cannot be hidden, nor the wrong of Innocents scape with
out reuenge. I onely greeue for <hi>Philomela,</hi> whose chas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tety
is no lesse then her vertues are many, &amp; her honours
as farre from lust, as thou and thy periured slaues from

a wife that hee will sorrow for. And so he went out of the

tearme of twentie one daies appointed for his departure.
<hi>Philomela</hi> poore soule, knowing what was in recorde,
could not be reuerst: that her credit was crackt, her honor
vtterly blemisht, and her name brought in contempt: for
all this abashed not outwardly, what soeuer she conceited

               </gap>, but seemed in her farre more full of fauour

               </gap>it in her

her by these periurde persones. With this assured and
constant countenaunce, first looking on the Duke, on the
Consiliadori, on the common people, and then on her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
she vsed these words.</p>
            <p>O <hi>Philippo Medici,</hi> once the louer of <hi>Philomela</hi>
thogh now the wracke of her honours, and the blemish of
her highe fortunes. Howe canst thou looke to heauen
and not tremble? howe canst thou behould me, and not
blush? how canst thou thinke there is a God without fear,
or a hell without horrour? canst thou blinde the deuine
Maistiesty? as thou hast led these Magistrats into a false
opinion of thine owne dishonour, and my dishonestly <hi>Mille
testes conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tia,</hi> if these slaues the ministers of thy iealous
enuye should grow domme, and all the world silent, yet
will thine owne conscience dayly crye out in thine eares,
<pb facs="tcp:6190:23"/>
that thou hast wrongd <hi>Philomela.</hi> I am the daughter of
a Duke, as thou art the sonne of an Earle: my vertues in
Uenice, haue béen as great as thine honors: my fortunes
and my fréends, more then thine: al these will search into
this cause, and if they finde out mine innocencie, thinke
<hi>Philippo</hi> worthie of great pennaunce. But in vaine, I
vse charmes to a deafe Adder, therfore <hi>Philippo,</hi> I leaue
thée to the choice of a new loue, and the fortune of a faire
wife, who if she proue as honestly amorous towards thee
as <hi>Philomela,</hi> then wrong her not with suspition, as thou
hast don me with ielousie: least she proue too liberall, and
pay my debts.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Philippo,</hi> haste thou lost more in loosing <hi>Lutesio,</hi>
then in forsaking me, for thou mayest haue manye honest
wiues, but neuer so faithfull a frend: therefore though I
be deuorced, be thou and he reconciled, least at last the hor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ror
of thy conscience, drawe thee into dispaire, and paine
thée with too late repentance. So <hi>Philippo</hi> euer wishing
thée well, I wil euer intreat that neither God maye laye
the wrong of myne innocency to thy charge, nor my fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
triumphe in thy infortunate reuenge, and so farewell.</p>
            <p>With this shee stept foorthe of the Hall, leauing
<hi>Philippo</hi> greatly tormented in his conscience, and the
Duke and all the rest wondring at her patience, saying:
it was pittie she was drawen on to wantonnesse by <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The rumours of this spread through al Uenice, of the
lasciuious life of <hi>Philomela,</hi> some said all was not gould
that glistered: that the fairest faces, haue oft times the
falsest harts: &amp; the smoothest looks, the most treacherous
thoughts: that as the Agate bee it neuer so white with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
yet it is full of black strokes within, &amp; that the most
shining sun, bréedeth the most sharpe showres: so women
the more chastety they professe openly, the les chary they
are in secrete of their honesty: others said, it might bee a

she thought to perswade <hi>Lutecio</hi> against him, and that he
might procure the slaues by torture to bewraye the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ornation

but her own selfe and a page did know, when or whether

certaine intelligence at what houre the ship would
warpe out of the Hauen, shee slipt awaie, and her Page
with her, and getting aboorde vnder saile, commit her
selfe to God, the mercie of the Seas, and to the husband
of manie hardfortunes. The Shippe had not gone a
Leage vpon the Seas, but <hi>Philomela</hi> began to be sicke:
wherevpon the Maister of the Shippe comming in to
comforte her, found her in his eie one of the fairest crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that euer he saw, and though her colour were som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
pale through her present sicknes, yet he could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
it to no worse shewe then the glister of the Moone in
a silent night and a cléere skie, so that the poore Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
conscience began to bee prickt, and loue beganne to
shake him by the sléeue, that he sat downe by her, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his blunt fashion, gaue her such swéet comfort as such
a swaine could affoord: <hi>Philomela</hi> thanked him and tould
him it was nothing but a passion that the roughnesse of
the Seas had wrought in her, who heretofore was vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with any other waters then the riuer <hi>Po,</hi> and
such small creekes as watered Italie. He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Maister departed, but with a Flea in his eare, and loue
in his eie: for he had almost forgot his Compasse, he was
so farre out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ompasse with thinking howe to compasse
<hi>Philomela:</hi> in this amorous humour, hee began to visite
often, the Cabin wherein <hi>Philomela</hi> laie, which was a

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>re of loue that began to heat him: For as hee that play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with a Bee may sooner feele her sting then taste of her
honie: so hee that acquainteth himselfe with loue, maie
more easilie repent him then content him, and sooner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrall
himselfe in a Laborinth, then get an houre of qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
libertie. So it fell out with <hi>Tebaldo,</hi> for so was the
Maister of the ship called: for he by conuersing priuatelie
<pb facs="tcp:6190:25"/>
and familiarlie with <hi>Philomela,</hi> became so farre in loue,
that he held no happinesse like the obtaining of this loue:
he noted the excellencie of her beautie, the exquisitnes of
her qualities, and measured euerie part with such precise
iudgement, that the smal heat of desire, grew to a glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fire of affection. But for all this, hee durst not reueale
his mind vnto her, least happily by his motion, she should
be mooued vnto displeasure: But as by time, smal sparks
grow into great flames: so at last he waxed so passionate,
that there was no way with him but death or dispair, if
he didnot manifest his thoughts vnto her: resoluing thus
damnably with himselfe, that howsoeuer loue or fortune
dealt with him, he would haue his mind satisfied: for if she
granted, then he would kéepe her in Palermo as his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramor:
if she denied, seeing he had her within the compas
of his barke, he would haue his purpose by force, and so
becom Lord of his content by conquest. Thus resolute he
went towards the cabin of <hi>Philomela</hi> to bewray his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
vnto her, when drawing néere the doore, he heard
her playing most cunningly vpon a lute, certaine lessons
of curious descant, slaying a while, least he might inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt

in great choller to vpbraid <hi>Lutesio,</hi> that no doubt

            <p>To this <hi>Lutesio</hi> made replye, that the Earle to proue
his surmised articles true, had suborned two slaues, that
were Genouaies to periure themselues. He shewed the

vntill he had further triall of the matter, swearing if hee
found him to haue played false with his daughter, neither
should his banishment excuse him, nor her deuorce: for he
would haue both their liues, for offering dishonour to the
house of Millaine.</p>
            <p>Upon this censure of the Duke, <hi>Lutesio</hi> was caried to

When thus the Duke was in a heauye suspition,
one of the Genouaies, whose conscience tormented him,
ran away from Uenice, and came to Millaine: where co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the Dukes pallace, he desired to speake with his

downe, trembling, and besought him of mercy. The duke
astonished at the straunge terror of the man, demaunded
of him what he was, and from whence he came. The
slaue tould him that he was borne at Geneua, and hadd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Philippo Medici,</hi> and one of those periured traitours that
<pb facs="tcp:6190:28"/>

At this the Duke started out of his seat, and taking th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for if he spake nothing but the trueth, he should not only
be fréely pardoned, but highly rewarded.</p>
            <p>Upon this the poore slaue discourst from point to point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
First the singular chastitie of his lady and Mistresse, and

to trye her, who finding her wise, vertuous, and constant,
fell out with the Earle, that he would wrong his wyfe
with such causeles suspition: after he rehearsed how the
County grew Ielouse, that <hi>Philomela</hi> fauored <hi>Lutesio,</hi>
and because he had no proofe to confirme his mistrust, but
his owne douting head, he suborned him, and a fellowe
of his to sweare, that they saw <hi>Lutesio</hi> and the Countes
euen in the very act of Adultery, which in them was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie,
and in him letcherye: for both the Gentleman, and
their Ladye was innocent, and with that falling down<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

on his knées, and melting into teares, hee craued pardon

            <p>The Duke whose eies were full of fire, as sparking
reuenge and hate, had him bee of good chéere, and pulling
his purse out of his pocket, and gaue it him for an earnest
penny of further freendship, and charged his Gentlemen
to giue the Geneuaye good entertainment. And w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that

was determining where to make a new choise for fauor,

all the forces of his frendes in Christendome, to reuenge
the abuse offered to his daughter <hi>Philomela.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This newes being come vnto the eares of <hi>Philiypo,</hi>
made him forget his woing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and begin to wonder how he
should shift of the misfortune ready to light vpon him, if

that if <hi>Lutesio</hi> wer gotten to <hi>Millaine,</hi> he would not only
lay the plot of all mischiefe against him, but also discouer
his treason, &amp; incense the Duke to reuenge, and vpon this
he thought grew the occasion of his men in armes: then
did he feare least the Genouaie that was run away from
him, should com to the Dukes court, &amp; there confirme by
autenticall proofe, what <hi>Lutecio</hi> vpon his honor did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme:
thus diuersly perplexed, he remained in great du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ps,
while the Duke and Consiliadiorie of Uenice gathering
into their senate house began to consult what reason the
Millonians had to inuade their territories. And therfore
to be fully satisfied in the cause, they sent Embassadours
to inquire the reason why he rose in armes against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?
whether it were for the sentence offered against <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mela</hi>
or no? and if it were, that he should herein rest satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
That as she was exiled by law, so she was iustly con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demned
for letcherie:</p>
            <p>The Ambassadours hauing their charge, came to the
Duke, lying then not farre of from Bergamo, and did
their message vnto him, which he reanswered thus: that
hee was not come as an enemy against them, but as a
priuate foe to <hi>Philippo,</hi> and therefore required to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue
his daughters innocencie: not by armes, but by

plague the Uenetians for the partiall iudgementes of
their Magistrates: and if they ment to haue him come

The Ambassadors returned with this aunswere to
the Duke and the Consiliadorie, who held hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> request
passing reasonable, and thought it would be dishonor to
them and their estate, if they should stand in deniall of so
equall a demaund: and therfore the Duke, not onely sent
him his onely Sonne, but sixe young sonnes more, al the
Sonnes of men of honour for hostage. Upon whose ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual,
the Duke of Millaine onely accompanied with <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesio,</hi>
the Genouaies, and ten other noble men went to
the Cittie, and was magnificently intertained by the
Duke and the Cittizens: where feasting that day, the
next morning they resolued to mé<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t in the Senate house,
to hear what could be alleadged against <hi>Philippo,</hi> whom
they cited peremptorilie to appeare, to aunswere to such
obiections as shuld be laid against him. The guiltie Earl
now began to feele remorse of conscience, and to doubt
of the issue of his treacherie: and therefore getting into
his closet, he called the Genouaie to him, and there began
to perswade him, that although both Signior <hi>Lutesio</hi>
and his fellowe did bewray the subornation of periurie,
yet he should denie it vnto the death, and for his reward
he had him take halfe his treasure and his fréedome. The
Genouay made solemn protestation that he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme
no lesse then he commanded him: and therevpon
as an assumsit, tooke the signet of the Earle, for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of all couenants. Thus armed as he thought, in
that he rested safly in the secrecy of his slaue: the next day
he appeared in the Senate house, whether the Dukes of
Millaine and of Uenice came with all the Consiliadorie
<pb facs="tcp:6190:29"/>
and chiefe Citizens of the town, to heare how this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
should be debated. At last the Duke of Milaine arose
amongst them al and began thus to discourse: I come not

to giue false euidence to affirme as much as I auerre:
therefore I onely craue they may bee examined with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,

amazed at this briefe and sharpe spéeche of the

all the treacherie: they hearing this, demanded of <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippo</hi>
how he could answere the confession of his Slaue:
he smilingly made this scornefull replie. I hope worthie

honour: but as such slaues minds are to be wrought like

beliefe shall bee giuen to suche a base and seruile person,
that commeth to depose against his own conscience: this

Now doo I prooue that true by experience, which

processe of time the worme of conscience wil bewray: oh
Senators, this may be applyed to my selfe, whose ielouse

            <p>It booteth little by circumstaunce to discouer the

Therefore in penalty of my periurie towards <hi>Philomela</hi>
I craue my selfe iustice against my selfe, that you would

            <p>At these wordes of <hi>Philippo,</hi> the people murmured,

of <hi>Philippo,</hi> pronounst that the Earle should abyde that

that <hi>Lutesio</hi> should haue his iudgment reuerst, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored

            <p>At this censure of the Duke, they all gaue a generall
applause, and <hi>Philippo</hi> there with teares in his eyes, took
leaue, protesting to spend his exile contentedly in séeking
out of <hi>Philomela,</hi> and when he had found her, then in her
presence to sacrifice his bloode as a satisfaction for his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie.
<hi>Lutesio</hi> likewise swore to make a queast for her,
and so did the Genouayes, and the Duke her father was

in <hi>Palermo,</hi> was not onely courteously intertained of
the M. of the Shippe, but also of his wife: who noting
her modesty, vertue, silence, and other good properties, &amp;
rare qualities, was so far in loue with her, that she would
not by any meanes let her departe out of her house, but
with a simpathie of sweete affectiones, did loue like two
sisters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in somuch that <hi>Philomela</hi> was brought ot bedde,
and had a yong Sonne, called Infortunatus, because he
was borne in the extremitie of his mothers miserie: The
M. of the shippe and his wife being pledges of his Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endome:
liuing thus obscure, and yet famous in <hi>Palermo</hi>
for her vertues, she found that of all musicke the meane
was the merriest, that quiet rested in lowe thoughts, and
the safest tontent in the poorest cottages: that the highest
trées abide the sharpest stormes, and the greatest perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages
the sorest frownes of Fortune: therefore with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
she brookt her homely course of lyfe, and had more
quiet sleepes now in the ship-masters house in <hi>Palermo,</hi>
then she had in her pallace in Uennice, onelye her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
was when she thought on <hi>Philippo,</hi> that he had
<pb facs="tcp:6190:31"/>
proued so vnkinde: and on <hi>Lutesio,</hi> that for her sake hee
was so déeply iniuried, yet aswel as she might, she salued
these sores, and couered her hard fortunes with the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of her innocencye. While thus she liued honorablie
in <hi>Palermo,</hi> not for her excellent behauiour and good
qualitie: It fortuned that the Duke of Milaine and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesio</hi>
both disguised like two palmers, had passed throgh
many places to séeke <hi>Philomela,</hi> and to reduce her from
banishment, and at last aryued in <hi>Palermo,</hi> intending to
soiourne there for a while, and then ot passe vp to <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gossa,</hi>
and so through all <hi>Sicilia,</hi> to haue intelligence of
the destressed Countesse. While thus they stayed inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
diligently of her, and not hearing anye newes, sith
she was seldome séene abroad, and beside that her name
changed and called <hi>Abstemia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It chaunced that either by Fortune or destanie, there
arryued at the same time in <hi>Palermo,</hi> the County <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po
Medici,</hi> who hauing trauailed through diuers coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes,
to finde out his innocent Countesse, wearied at
last not so much with trauaile, as with the gnawing
worme of a guiltye conscience that still tormented him:
he beganne more and more to enter into dispaire, and to
thinke his lyfe loathsome vnto him, wishing daylye for
death, so it might not come through the guilt of his own
hand, &amp; yet resoluing rather to bée the murtherer of him
selfe, then thus to linger out his daies in dispaire. In this
perplexed passion, hee gat him into a thicke groue, there

in loue with a young gentlewoman, whose lodging was
distaunt some three leagues from the Citie, pricked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

her, although he was not onely forbidden by his father,
<pb facs="tcp:6190:32"/>
but watched, least priuilye he might steale vnto her: yet
as loue can finde starting hoales, he deuised this pollicie:
hee carried a slaue that remained in his Fathers hous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
abroad to the groue with him, where <hi>Philippo</hi> lay lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and there chaunging apparell with him, he got him
to his desired Mistres, and bad the slaue returne couert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into the Cittie, and meet him the next day at the same
place: parting thus, as he was going homewarde, hee
was met by a young Sicilian gentleman, named <hi>Petro
Salino:</hi> who bearing a mortal grudge to the Dukes son,
in that he affected the Gentlewoman whome hee so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
loued: seeing him alone, and thinking him to bee
<hi>Arnoldo Strozzo</hi> by his apparell, and déeming hee came
now from his beloued Mistres, set vpon him, and slewe
him: and with his rapeir so mangled his face, that by no
meanes he could be discerned, and thereupon fled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arnaldos</hi> page missing his M. seeking abroad for him
in the fieldes, for that he desired oft times to be solitarie,
light vpon the dead body of the slaue, and iudgeing it to
be his M. because he was in his apparell, cried out, &amp; ran
home and carried newes therof to the Duke his Father:
who as a man distraught of his wits, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded straight
search to be made, to finde out the actor of the Tragedye,
causing the dead corps to be conueyed with muche gréefe
and many teares.</p>
            <p>All the Courtiers, gentlemen and others, sought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
to séeke out the author of this murther: and not far
of where the slaue was slain, found <hi>Philippo</hi> walking vp
&amp; downe vntrust, his hat lying by him, and his rapier in
his hand: the courtiers séeing a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus suspitious, made
inquirie what he was: why quoth the Countie, I am the
man you looke for: Art thou then said the Cousin of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo,</hi>
that bloudy traitour, that haste slaine the Dukes
sonne? The Countie glad he had so swéete an occasion to
be rid of his lyfe, resolute, and bréefely said, I Marry am
I, and I will kill his father too, if euer I reache him:
<pb facs="tcp:6190:32"/>
with that they laide hould vppon him and carried him to
prison, and as he went by the way, they examinde what
hee was, but that by no meanes hee would reueale vnto
them: onely he said he was an Italian, purposelye come
from Uenice to act it. Newes straight was carried to
the Duke, that the murtherer was taken, who was
highly glad thereof, and resolued the next daye with the
states of the countrey, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it in iudgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as fame and
reporte cannot be silent, so it was straight noysed abroad
through <hi>Palermo,</hi> that the Dukes sonne was slaine by
a Uenetian, and how he was taken, and should the next
day be arraigned and executed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philomela</hi> hearing that hee was a Uenetian that had
doone the déede: desirous to sée him, tooke the Maister of
the ships wife with her, and went to the prison, and there
by fauour of the Gayler, sawe him through a windowe,
assone as <hi>Philomela</hi> had a viewe of him, she sawe it was
<hi>Philippo Medici</hi> her husband disguised, &amp; hauing in his
face the very signes of dispair. This sight of her husband
droue her into a maze, yet to conceale the matter to her
felf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, she said she knewe not the man. As thus she was
standing talking with the Gayler, there came a Uenetia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that was resident in <hi>Palermo,</hi> and desired that he might
see the Gentleman that had done the murther, but the
Gayler would not suffer him, but inquired what country
man he was? he answered a Uenetian, and that is the
reason quoth hee, that I am desirous to haue a sight of
him. <hi>Philomela</hi> hearing that he was a Uenetian, asked
him what newes from Uenice: The Sayler, for so hee
was, discoursed vnto her what late had chaunced, and
amongst the rest, he discouered the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ortunes of <hi>Philomela</hi>
and how she was wrongfully accused by her husband the
Earle, how her Father came to Uenice, and hauing her
accusers two slaues examined, they confest the Earle
suborned them to the periurie: wherupon <hi>Philippo</hi> was
banished, and now as a man in dispaire, sought about to
<pb facs="tcp:6190:33"/>
finde out his wife.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philomela</hi> hearing these newes, thanking him, tooke
her leaue of the Sailer and went home, where getting
alone into her chamber, she began thus to meditate with
her selfe: now <hi>Philomela</hi> thou maist see heauens are iust,
and God impartiall, that though he defers, he doeth not
acquit: that thogh he suffer the innocent to be wronged,
yet at last hee persecuteth the malicious with reuenge:
that time hatcheth trueth, and that true honor maye be
blemisht with enuye, but neuer vtterly defaced with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie:
now is thy lyfe laid open in Uenice, and thy
fame reuiued in spight of Fortune: now maiest thou tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe
in the fall of thy Ieliouse husband, and write thy
chastitie in the characters of his bloode, so shall he die dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced,
and thou returne to Uenice as a wonder: Now,
shal thine eie see his end, that hath sought to ruinate thee,
and thou liue content and satisfied in the iust reuenge
of a periured husband.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>Philomela,</hi> that worde husband is a high tearme
easily pronounced in the mouth, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>euer to be banished
from the hart, knowest thou not that the loue of a wife
must not end, but by death: that the tearme of marriage
is dated in the graue, that wyues should so long loue and
obey, as they liue and drawe breath: that they should
preferre their husbands honor before their owne life, and
choose rather to die, then sée him wronged. Why else did
<hi>Alcest</hi> die for <hi>Admetus?</hi> Why did <hi>Portia</hi> eate coales for
the loue of <hi>Brutus,</hi> if it were not that wiues ought to end
their liues with their loues?</p>
            <p>Truth (<hi>Philomela</hi>) but <hi>Philippo</hi> is a traytour, hée
hath imblemisht thy fame, sought to ruine thine honour,
aimde at thy life, condemnd thée both to diuorce and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
and lastly hath stainde the high honors of thy
Fathers house.</p>
            <p>And what of all this <hi>Philomela?</hi> hath not euerie man
his fault? Is there any offence so great, that may not bee
<pb facs="tcp:6190:33"/>
forgiuen? <hi>Philippo</hi> did not woorke thée this wrong be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he loued some other, but because he ouerloued thee:
t'was Ielousie, not lasciutousnes that forst him to that
follie: and suspition is incident onely to such as are kind
hearted louers. Hath not God reuengde thy iniurie, and
thy Father punisht him with the like penaltie that thy
selfe doest suffer? and wilt thou now glorie in his miserie?
No (<hi>Philomela</hi>) shew thy selfe vertuous, as ere thou hast
béene honorable, and heape coales on his head, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him fauour in extremitie. If he hath slain the Dukes
sonne, it is through despaire: and if hee had not come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to séeke thée, hee had not fallen into this misfortune.
The Palme trée the moreit is prest downe, the more it
sprowteth vp: the Camomill the more it is troden, the
swéeter smell it yéeldeth: euen so ought a good wife to be
kind to her husband midst his greatest discourtesies, and
rather to venture her life, then suffer him incur any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice,
and so will I doe by <hi>Philippo:</hi> for rather then hée
shall die, in the sight of <hi>Philomela</hi> I wil iustifie him with
mine owne death, so shall my ende bee honorable, as my
life hath béene wonderfull.</p>
            <p>With this shee ceased and went to her rest, till the
next day morning, that the Dukes, and the states gathe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red
togither to sit in iudgement: whether came <hi>Lutesio,</hi>
and the Duke of Millaine disguised, to see what he was,
that being a Uenetian committed the murther, &amp; there
also was <hi>Philomela,</hi> and the saylers wife. At last the
County <hi>Philippo</hi> was brought foorth, whome when the
Duke of Millaine sawe, iogging <hi>Lutesio</hi> with his hand,
he whispered and said, see <hi>Lutesio,</hi> where man fauours,
yet God doth in extremitie reuenge: now shal we see the
fall of our enemie, yet not touched with his bloode<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
thus amongest themselues:</p>
            <p>At last the Duke of <hi>Palermo</hi> began to examine him,
if he were he that slew his sonne, he answered that hee
was the man, &amp; would with his blood answer it: what
<pb facs="tcp:6190:34"/>
moued you saies the Duke, to do the murther? an oulde
grudge quoth he, that hath béene betweene him and me
euer since he was in Uenice, and for that cause reuenge
was so restles in my minde, that I came from thence,
purposly to act the tragedy, and am not sory that I haue
contented my thoughts with his bloode: at this his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
confession, the Duke full of wrath arose and said,
it was booteles further to impannell any Iurye, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his words he would pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce sentence against
him. Then <hi>Philomela</hi> calling to the Duke, and desiring
she might be heard, began thus to plead.</p>
            <p>O mighty Duke staye the censure, least thy verdict
wrong the innocent, &amp; thou condemne and earle through
his owne disparing euidence: I see, and with trembling
I feele, that a guiltye conscience is a thousand wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.
That as it is vnpossible to couer the light of the
Sunne with a Curtaine: so the remorse of murther ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
not be concealed in the closet of the most secrete conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator.</p>
            <p>For standing by, and hearing thée ready to pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
sentence against the Innocent, I euen I that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the déede, though to the exigent of mine owne death:
could not but burst foorth into these exclamations to
saue the sacklesse: Knowe therefore that he which stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
héere before the Iudgement seate, is an Earle,
though banished: his name is Countie <hi>Philippo Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci,</hi>
my husband, and once famous in Italie, though héere
he be blemisht by Fortune: At this, all the companye
lookt vpon her. <hi>Philippo</hi> as a man amazed, stood staring
on her face, the teares trickling downe his chéeks to see
the kindenes of his wife, whome so deepely he had iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
and the Duke of <hi>Millaine</hi> her Father with <hi>Lutesio</hi>
were in as great a wonder. Last she prosecuted her pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
thus: It were too long worthye <hi>Scicilians</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse

time that is the reuealer of truth, hath made the slaues
bewraye the effect of the matter, so that this present
Earle is found guiltye, mine honour saued, he banished,
and now extreamly distressed.</p>
            <p>Consider the Sicilians, if this County my husband

death: but séeing that would not preuaile, I sought to
méet him alone, which I did yesterday by the groue, and
there offring him a humble supplication, and he stouping
to take it courteously: I stabd him, and after mangled
him in that sort you found him.</p>
            <p>This is trueth, this is my conscience, and this I am

the innocent Earle, and pronounce sentence against me

            <p>Héere she ended, and all they stoode amased: and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippo</hi>
beganne againe to reply against her, that she did
it to saue him: but in vaine were his wordes, for she al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged

            <p>Seeing therefore two pleading thus for death, hée
himselfe being alyue, and his father ready to condemne

            <p>At this the Duke start vppe, and all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
