            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ON the 26th of <hi>July</hi> laſt, one <hi>Thomas Davis</hi> and <hi>Andrew Simpſon</hi> being at Four a Clock in the Morning about their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt

vocation of Fiſhing, in which they laboured an hour to no purpoſe; but at length they perceived afar off ſomewhat move in the water, of an unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual ſhape and bigneſs; upon which they made unto it, but as ſoon as it ſaw them it dived down into the water: ſo that after a tedious and vain ſearch, they returned back to the Town and informed one Mr. <hi>Rocke,</hi> a reſponſible Inhabitant there, of what they had ſeen; who with Three of his Servants came forth with Muskets char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, one ſtanding on the ſhore, and the other two in the Boat with the Fiſher-men, with whom alſo was Mr. <hi>Rocke.</hi> They
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152429:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had not long rowed about the River, but they again perceived its head popping up and down, at which they diſcharged their Pieces, but to little effect: For it dived again out of their view, and did not appear in an hours time after; but upon its riſing again they ſhot it into the back; whereupon it made with all poſsible ſpeed towards land, where (though with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty) it was taken.</p>
            <p>The deſcription of its parts is as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:152429:5"/>
On the head of this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creature (which can be no nearer reſembled to any thing, than the head of a man) was long black Hair: its Face had the exact ſhape of a Lion; ſo terrible and grim, that it ſtruck terrour on all that beheld it. It had two fore-feet like thoſe of a Bull, cloven; its hinder feet being like unto an Eagles Talons, with very long and ſharp Nails; ſo that where Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture commonly orders Fins, there were perfect Feet of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures of a clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Element. His mouth was guarded with three long ſharp Horns, with which when he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152429:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was on Land he ſo dangerouſly wounded one of the foreſaid Mr. <hi>Rock</hi>'s ſervants in the thigh, that he remains very ill of the ſame, inſomuch that his Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is much doubted by all, notwithſtanding the Advice and Aſsiſtance of the moſt skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chirurgeons in thoſe parts. On its Back was the perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of an Hour-glaſs, and the appearance (as ſome fancied) of a Spade and Deaths head, to the amazement of all its Spectators.</p>
            <p>It is in length Twelve Foot, and Five in bredth.</p>
            <p>On each ſide its Breſt are two Paps, like unto thoſe of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>

            <p>When this Letter came away it was not quite dead, though it had been much wounded; but is with much ado brought into the aforeſaid Town of <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale,</hi> where it now remains the Wonderment of all its nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous beholders.</p>
