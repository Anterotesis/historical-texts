            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

should) to think any of my Labours to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of Publick, especially your Awfull and
and Judicious view. This plain Sermon was
preach'd in my own Parish Church, without
the least thought of ever exposing it to the critical censure of
the world; onely the importunity of some that heard it, and
the approbation of some Judicious Friends, that have since
perused it, and a willingnesse (I confesse) to take occasion to
present my dutifull respects unto you, have prevailed with me
for the publishing this (otherwise) worthlesse Piece; Such as
it is (with some addition that passed memory or meditation
in the first delivery) I humbly send unto you, rather for
your Pardon than your Patronage. The true reason why ti
<pb facs="tcp:34929:3"/>
staid so long from the Presse, is this: I disputed with my self,
whether I should Print my sins (as they were reputed) with
my Sermon or not: After much deliberation, I concluded
for the affirmative. Whether I be the first that herein have
lead the way, or no, I know not: yet I do with all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of judgment leave it to the Grave consideration of my
Reverend Brethren, who have drunk of the same Cup, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a modest and seasonable vindication of their innocent
and spotlesse Conversation, from the black-mouth'd slanders
and unjust accusations of a reviling people, would not conduce
to the Honour of God, the Glory of the Church, the promoting
of the Gospell, the winning of Souls, the great content of the
Kings Majesty, the healing of our breaches, the setling of
our peace, and their own comfort in the day of their account.

mistakes: The rest is faithfully offered to your favourable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,

Philips B. D. and Vicar of Aylesham in
Norff. 1644.</head>
            <p>1 THat he read himself (to our best remembrance) the
Kings Proclamation, whereby the <hi>Scots</hi> were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamed
Rebels.</p>
            <p>2. That he useth in his Sermons to vent things that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of Malignity against the Parliament, and are opposite
to the blessed work of Reformation they have in hand; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
he preached on a Fast day to this effect; That <hi>Luther</hi>
was a hot man in reforming Religion: but there came ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that was hotter than he, and would have Images pull'd
down; <hi>No,</hi> saith <hi>Luther, Authority hath commanded
them, and for decency let them stand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And on the same, or another Fast day, he had this passage
folowing in his Sermon, which he thrice vehemently repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>viz.</hi> That times might come, that we would be ashamed
to hear of those things which we have done and spoken, and
our being so eager and violent now, would so inrage the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
party, that if times change, we must look for Fire and
Faggot.</p>
            <p>3. That in his preaching he spake thus: There was a
King of <hi>France,</hi> named <hi>Phillip the Long,</hi> and he was sure
our King might be called <hi>Charls the Long,</hi> for he had
born long with his Subjects that were opposite against him.</p>
            <p>And he delivered other matters, towards the making of
great division between the King and Parliament; and said,
the King ought not to be resisted, for he was the highest
Power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:34929:4"/>
4 That expounding on the the third Commandement, he
said it was no Oath to swear by Faith and Troth, and that
he many times used it himself.</p>
            <p>5 That he refuseth to take the Covenant tendred him by
the Commissioners; which hath made great distraction in the
Parish many neglecting or refusing it by his example.</p>
            <p>6 That he hath required divers of his Parishioners to
come to receive the Lords Supper at the Rayls, neer the East
end of the Chancel: who being desired by them again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to forbear that Superstitious Ceremony: he answered, If
they did demand it, and would not come, he would come to
them, but threatned to have them into the highest Court there
was.</p>
            <p>7 That whereas there was raised a dangerous Insurrection
and Rebellion the last Summer, he did justifie his Father in
Law, whom this Deponent by Letters sent forth by him,
doth apprehend to have been the chief agent in that foul bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness;
and said, he was as clear in the action of Conspiracy,
as any in the Town; and he had delivered so by a Letter to
the Committee, and would maintain it.</p>
            <p>8. That he refused to Church this Deponent, unlesse she
would come to the Rayls, as she was told by her servant, and
she this Deponent being in her seat, he came to her, and took
her by the hand, and led her up to the Rails.</p>
            <p>9. That he hath been a diligent practicer of the Bishops in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novated
Injunctions; as going to the Communion Table to read
second Service, and frequently bows before the Communion
Table, railed in at the East end of the Chancell.</p>
            <p>10 That he hath preached against the Protestation, by
which means some did forbear to take it, lest they might suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for it after, as was intimated by him in that Sermon; with
divers other passages to that purpose.</p>
            <p>11 That when he had order to give thanks for a Victory
<pb facs="tcp:34929:4"/>
obtained; instead of Thanksgiving, he delivered in his Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
without any expression at all in the way of Thanksgiving,
how that some thought fit to give Thanks, and some thought
otherwise; they are divided in their opinions, and some in
their estates, and some are imprisoned, and some otherwayes
suffer. But for his part, he thought the meaning of the Book
was, That every County should give thanks for it self, and
we should give thanks that our Country was not the seat of
warr.</p>
            <p>12 That when the Protestation was to be taken, he did
use these or the like words in a Sermon: That as <hi>Johns</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
said, <hi>art thou the Messiah, or shall we look for
another?</hi> so we may say, Is this the Parliament, or shall we
look for another? by reason of which words, as they have cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly
heard, divers were discouraged from taking the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation.</p>
            <p>13. That in a Sermon he preached, that all his Parish
might better take the Covenant than he; and that he had time
given him to consider of it by the Committee.</p>
            <p>14. That he had a Book to read on a Lords day, to give
thanks for a Victorie obtained: but this Deponent did not
hear him give thanks, otherwise than by reading the Book,
to his remembrance.</p>

Monk, as Historians affirm, yet some say by one

<hi>Arimathea,</hi> who is supposed to lie buried at <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenbury;</hi>
most likely I conceive it is, that an
Apostle, or <hi>Joseph</hi> first planted it amongst us,

            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:34929:6"/>
We are assembled this day (the most glorious day that did
ever since shine in our Horizon) to Commemorate, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate
his Majesties happy Restauration, and in it the blessed
resuscitation, if not resurrection of the Gospel in this Church;
and in them both, so many blessings powred down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
upon these sinfull Kingdomes, that all the dayes of our
lives, will not be sufficient, to discharge our Duties to God for
the same.</p>
            <p>And all this visibly by a Monk, not by Profession but Name,
an Honourable and ever to be renowned person, whom God
raised up, and into whose heart he put it, and whose Counsels
and Heroick Archievements he blessed to make him the great
active instrument, of our enjoyment of these mercies. And
that beyond all our, and the Christian Worlds expectation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a blow. But indeed first by the unsearchable goodnesse of
him whose name is <hi>Zelotes,</hi> Exod. 24. 14. And for the bloody
coat sake of <hi>Joseph,</hi> I mean the merits, and mediations of our
<hi>Jesus, in whose strength only the King shall rejoyce, and in whose
Salvation alone, he shall be exceeding glad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little then to rub up our memories, that our affections of
joy and thankfulness may more easily, be kindled, and more
fervently inflamed.</p>
            <p>1. First, this day is <hi>Natalitium regis,</hi> His Majesties birth-day.
The celebration of the birth-dayes of Kings, and Princes, was of
antient custome, and venerable antiquity, among the <hi>Medes,
Persians,</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> And it is lawfull to commemorate the
birth-dayes of Christian Kings, so they be not abused to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanesse,
but only thereby to take occasion to give thanks for
such worthy instruments which God in mercy raiseth up to the
Church, and Common-wealth, In the judgment of <hi>Calvin:</hi>
for though <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>Jeremy,</hi> cursed the day wherein they were
born, and only <hi>Pharaoh, Jeroboam,</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> are remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
in Scripture, to have made great feasts on their birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,
as some have observed, yet that is not recorded of them
as their sin, but their cruelty, and voluptuousness, they exercised
in them; and as for the passages of those two holy men, they
are either to be interpreted expressions of their impatience, or a
sad lamentation of our natural condition: for othervise we are
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34929:6"/>
taught both by Gods Command, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 3. And also the
Churches practice, <hi>Est.</hi> 9. 26. To remember the dayes of
signal mercies and to revive them that they be not eaten out by
time: for if Children be a great blessing as the Psalmist assures
us, <hi>Psal. 128. 2, 3. And if a Woman in travel, so soon as she
is delivered of a child, remembreth no more her anguish for
joy that a man is born into the World,</hi> as our Saviour affirms,
<hi>John</hi> 16. 21. Then certainly there is, and ought to be much
more joy for the birth of godly Kings, and the increase of their
Royal Posterity, It being a part of the accomplishment of that
promise made unto them, Psal. 45. 16, 17. <hi>Instead of thy
Fathers, thou shalt have Children, whom thou maiest make
Princes in all the earth, and I will make thy name to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
in all generations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Authors inform me, that there were two radiant, and
resplendent starrs appeared, the one at the birth of his sacred
Majestie, the other at the birth of the most Illustrious Duke of
<hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am no Astrologer, neither do I give credit to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.
<hi>We have a more sure word of Prophecy whereunto we
shall do well to take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark
place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in our hearts,</hi> 2.
Pet. 1. 19. Yet we must religiously confesse, there was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation
of blessings fell upon <hi>England,</hi> upon the restoring to us
our native, and hereditary Soveraign, And we have just cause
to sing that Heavenly Antheme, Luke 2. 14. <hi>Glory be to God
on high, on earth peace, good will towards men:</hi> for till then there
was neither glory in the Church, nor peace in the Kingdome,
nor good will toward men in either.</p>
            <p>And concerning the most Illustrious Duke, the envious eye of
the World, must see whether it will or no, and her tongue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that scarce ever Prince, so early in the morning of
his youth, and so often endeavoured to be nipt in his Royal
budding and blossoming, bath archeived more Heroick acts than
he hath done. Whilest therefore Divines, Philosophers, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians
dispute of the several forms of Goverment, and the
preheminence of one above another, as best suits with their
particular interests, Let us being guided by the unerring rule of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34929:7"/>
the word of God, the right use of sanctified reason, a good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of the sad experiences we have so dearly paid for,
and a present sense of the wonderful blessings of this day,
Now conclude, that of all Governments Monarchy is the most
Divine, Honourable, and Safe. And of all kinds of Monarchy,
that by succession and inheritance: for though God brought his
people to it, and under it by degrees, governing them, first, by
the Book, then by the Bar, then by the Sword, and after by
Election, yet he rested not till he had fixed his people under
a perpetual succession of Kings, but when their sins made a
breach, establishing the highest powers upon earth, in the
nearest condition, and capacity of strength, dignity, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
unto himself who is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and <hi>Changeth not,</hi> Mal. 3.
6. And if there be an occasion (as we have had for many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,
and God grant it may be so till <hi>Shiloh</hi> come) of
Piety, Mercy, and Justice, and all other Princely graces, I
know not what more can be added, (the continuance of the
Gospel in its power and purity alwayes supposed) to make a
people as happy as they can be upon the earth.</p>
            <p>2. But secondly this day is not only, <hi>Natalis Regis,</hi> but
<hi>Regni</hi> also, yea and <hi>Dies salutis,</hi> the day of the King, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
Salvation, as the dayes of the Martyrs sufferings were
called of old: for how truely might the King take up the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of the Prophet? Psal. 31. 12, 13. <hi>I was forgotten, as
a dead man out of mind, I was become as a broken Vessel, I have
heard the blasphemy of the multitude, and fear was on every side,
whilest they conspired together against me to take away my
life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the name of a King was no lesse than treason: so did
men call Loyalty after their own names, as it was sometimes
(if I remember right) in the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi> And
though his Majesty had three Kingdoms, yet he had not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(like <hi>Noah's</hi> Dove) to rest the soles of his tender feet,
nor whereon to lay his precious head, and the head of us all;
but might well bemoan his condition to his Heavenly Father
in the words of our blessed Saviour, Math. 8. 20. <hi>The Foxes
indeed,</hi> those <hi>Herods</hi> and usurping Tyrants, <hi>have holes, and the
birds of the air</hi> (those kites, and vultures) <hi>have nests, but the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34929:7"/>
Son of a King, and a King had not whereon to rest his head:</hi> And
therefore he leaves the earth, and being desirous to get as
neer Heaven as he could, with <hi>Zacheus</hi> he climbs up into a
tree, and from thence God shewes him a way of escape, and
speaks unto him in a language of miraculous providence, <hi>This
day Salvation is come into thy house;</hi> only he must passe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
a Wildernesse to his <hi>Canaan,</hi> and a Sea of troubles, to the
Haven where he would be. And blessed be God, that the
Oak of Royal preservation, was not to the rebellious Sons of
<hi>Adam,</hi> the tree of knowledge, for then it had not been to the
breath of our Nostrils the tree of life; his Sacred Majesty had
often heard of it, no doubt at <hi>Ephrata;</hi> but now he found
it in the field of the Wood, that <hi>God was his Strength, and his
Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Thirdly the manner of his Restauration may further
fasten the memory of this day in our hearts, as a nail in a sure
place: for he came not to his Land of promise, and the lot of
his inheritance, thorow the red Sea of the blood of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
Yet if it had been so, such a field with the Pearl in it,
had not been too dear, though it had been the price of blood:
for whatsoever <hi>Judas,</hi> or others have done, we must confesse,
and that with a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the people of <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 18.
3. <hi>Our King was worth ten thousand of us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet he came to us, with a mighty indeed, but a merry
noise, with ringing of Bells, not with roaring of Cannons, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it were for lowder Musick. There were no Widdows to
make lamentation (though many had cause enough) no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
in the Streets as he passed thorow in triumph, no
outcries, but <hi>Hosannah,</hi> and <hi>Allelujah, Blessed is he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the name of the Lord.</hi> He came not with fire, and sword,
he <hi>brake no bruised reed,</hi> in his shaken and tottering King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
he <hi>quenched no smoaking Flax,</hi> in the Church, the light
whereof was wel nigh extinguished, there was no striving, but
whether his Majesty should be more gracious, or his people
more gratefull.</p>
            <p>4. There is one more argument from the day; It is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that this very day the Common-Prayer book, purged
from the drosse wherewith it was mixed, was settled as the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34929:8"/>
publick Liturgy of our Church, which was after sealed with the
blood of many of the Compilers of it; which observation if it
be true, then methinks there should not be such divisions, nor
such sad thoughts of heart amongst us as there is concerning
it: So as to black and cloud our joy in this day of our peace.
What have been done in this place about it, first and last, is
too well known. Yet I can positively affirm, that in this
numerous and populous Congregation there are but few that
absent themselves from the publick service of God upon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
taken at the reading of it, though too many upon other
sinfull and unwarrantable accounts.</p>
            <p>I do therefore earnestly beseech, as all my Reverend bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
the Ministers of the Gospel, so all other Godly and
peaceably disposed Christians, that whilst it is our duty to <hi>pray
for the peace of</hi> Jerusalem, we do not suffer our prayers to be
an occasion of the bteach of that her peace.</p>
            <p>And I do adjure all in the words of the Apostle, Phil. 2.
1, 2, 3. <hi>If there be any consolation in Christ, if any fellowship of
the spirit, if any bowels, and mercy, fullfil you</hi> the Kings, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and one anothers <hi>joy, that ye be like minded, having the
same love, being of one accord and of one minde: O let nothing be
done</hi> in this matter, <hi>through strife, or vain-glory; But let in
lowlinesse of mind each esteem others better than themselves.</hi>
And O let us all in our several stations, according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
precept, Ephes. 4. 3. <hi>Endeavour to keep the unity of
the spirit in the bond of peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the rather ought we to take heed hereunto, because
we have formerly received mercies, somewhat like unto
these of this day, but soon forfeited them by our sins; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</p>
            <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, that blessed Martyr, was born the
19. day of <hi>November,</hi> and on the same day, if my intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
fail me not, began his return to us from his Northern
Kingdom, after that gracious Pacification made in his Royal
Camp near <hi>Barwick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And made without the shedding of one
drop of blood: for even when his two Kingdoms with their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issant
armies were daring one another in a warlike posture,
he came as <hi>Neptune,</hi> with his Trident, and calmed those raging
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34929:8"/>
billows, and rebuked those winds that were risen so high, and
said unto the Sea that was become so boysterous, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<hi>Be stil.</hi> Of which pacification, I will not say it had been
better for <hi>England</hi> if it had not been made, for <hi>Blessed are the
peace makers,</hi> Matth. 5. 9. But sure it had been happy for both
Kingdoms it had never been broken: for then we had not <hi>sat &amp;
wept,</hi> so many years, by these <hi>Waters of Babylon,</hi> nor <hi>hung up our
harps,</hi> with little hopes, and lesse joy to use them; but long
since taken them down, and putting them in their right place,
and tune, sung this song of joy and gladnesse, <hi>The King shall
rejoice in thy Strength, O Lord, and in thy Salvation he shall be
exceeding glad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Coherence and scope of which words, it is this,
The Church in the last verse of the former Psalm prayes for
the Kings Salvation, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> so the
septuagint renders the words, and so St. <hi>Jerom, Domine
salvum fac regem,</hi> and so our Church word for word, in her
daily petition for him morning and evening. <hi>O Lord save the
King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I hope none will be offended at that Scripture Prayer,
unless there should be found yet some of those, who could find
no great fault with the Common Prayer Book, but that it
taught them so often to pray for the King; to which Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they had not Loyaltie enough to say <hi>Amen:</hi> as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of ever blessed Memory among the Righteous, hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in his sacred Portracture, never to be parallel'd; and
God grant it never may.</p>
            <p>Now the Church in the words of the Text begins her praises
for the Kings Salvation.</p>
            <p>In which you have these two parts.</p>
            <list>
               <head>The Division.</head>
               <item>First, God's Mercy for his Strength in the
Kings Salvation.</item>
               <item>Secondly, The Kings (or the Church's) for
that Salvation.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:34929:9"/>
In the former you have these three particulars.</p>
            <p>First, The Blessings for which the King, or the Church for
him, praiseth God, and they are two; 1. <hi>Strength, 2. Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The Author from whom these blessings are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to be received; and that is the Lord; therefore
here called <hi>his Strength,</hi> and <hi>his Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Person for whom this Strength is put forth,
and this Salvation wrought; and that is the King; <hi>He shall
rejoyce, he shall be glad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the latter you have these two particulars?</p>
            <p>First, The manner, or quality of the Church her Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
and that is,
<list>
                  <item>1. Inward, He shall rejoyce.</item>
                  <item>2. Outward, He shall be glad.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For so Expositors interpret the words, <hi>laetabitur &amp; exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi>
the one of inward, the other of outward joy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The measure of this Joy, in the word <hi>Exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
or <hi>how greatly?</hi> as the other Translation reads it; that
is, so greatly the King shall rejoyce, as it cannot well in words
be exprest.</p>
            <p>Let the first part of the Text be the Doctrine, the second
the Application.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine then is this?</p>
            <p>The Lord is the Strength, and Salvation of Kings, of all
Kings, for <hi>there is no power, but is ordained of God,</hi> Rom. 13. 1.
But of good Kings, such as <hi>David</hi> was, and such as (blessed
be God) ours is, after his own heart, as well as by his own
designment, he is not only the Author of their Strength and
Salvation, but their Preserver and Blesser: They are both
the saved of the Lord, and to the Lord, of his Mercy, and to
his Glory.</p>
            <p>Hear <hi>David</hi> himself speak this Truth; <hi>Ps. 18. 2. Ps.</hi> 62. 1.
2. <hi>vers. Ps.</hi> 27. 1. and to name no more, <hi>Ps. 140. vers.</hi> 7.
<hi>O God the Lord, the Strength of my Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we consider these Blessings severally, it will more
clearly appear they are from the Lord.</p>
            <p>First, The King's Strength is from the Lord, and this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34929:9"/>
               <hi>David</hi> acknowledges, as in the former places, so 2. Sam. 22.
1. <hi>That, in the day of his deliverance from the hand of all his
enemies, and from the hand of</hi> Saul, <hi>The Lord was his strength,
and his power;</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> who was also <hi>King in Jesurun,</hi> Deut.
33. 5. sings to the same tune, Exod. 15. 2. <hi>The Lord is
my Strength, and is become my Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Strength is either <list>
                  <item>1 Inward.</item>
                  <item>2 Outward.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Inward Strength that also is double, first the strength of
Grace, and secondly (as I may have leave to expresse my self)
the Grace of Strength, and these are both from the Lord.</p>
            <p>First strength of Grace, and in this sense it is taken, 1. Pet.
5. 10. <hi>The God of all grace strengthen you,</hi> and we are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>be strong in the Lord,</hi> Eph. 6. 10. So <hi>David</hi> in his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
is said to <hi>Encourage himself in the Lord his God.</hi> And
certainly our <hi>David,</hi> under all his trials, was upheld by this
Strength of the Lord. He was never without Gods Armour on,
though it may be sometime without his own. The Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
girded him with <hi>Truth,</hi> breasted him with <hi>Righteousness,</hi>
shod his feet with the <hi>preparation of the Gospel of peace,</hi>
shielded him with <hi>Faith,</hi> covered his anointed (before it was
anointed) head with the <hi>Helmet of Salvation,</hi> and his Royal
hand and heart was never without the <hi>Sword of the Spirit,</hi>
which is the word of God; witnesse those fiery darts he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,
those menaces and threats he set at nought, those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
and profers he refused, those sollicitations and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he withstood, those disputes and conferences he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
alwayes with the advantage to truth, of which the
World may take notice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that through the strength of the Grace of God his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
may be justly numbred among those worthies, Hebr.</hi> 11.
33, 34. Who by faith subdued Kingdoms, wrought righteousnesse,
obtained promises, stopped the mouths of Lions, quenched the
violence of fire, out of weaknesse were made strong, waxed vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
in fight, turned to flight the armies of the Aliens.</p>
            <p>Appearing herein heir apparent of his Royal Fathers gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34929:10"/>
as well as Kingdoms, of whom for piety, wisdom, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
justice, constancy in the truth, and all other Princely grace,
when he was barbarously murdered, we might sadly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<hi>Ichabod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who was <hi>delicium humani generis,</hi> as it was said of <hi>Titus,</hi>
the best of Kings, as <hi>Augustus</hi> was stiled of Emperors, the
meekest of men as <hi>Moses,</hi> after Gods own heart as <hi>David,</hi> yet
he that did good to all was hated to death, he that never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
just liberty to any, could not have liberty to live; But
I have no warrant to search into the inscrutable dispensation
of the Almighty, I say my hand therefore upon my mouth
with that of the Apostle, Hebr. 11. 38. <hi>Of whom the World
was not worthy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And also manifesting himself to be of his Royal Grand-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
King <hi>James</hi> his spirit, who said, That the best title of a
King was to be the servant of God, and that all the Crowns,
and Kingdoms in the World, should not induce him to
change on jot of his profession. And this his strength is from
above, for <hi>the Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord.</hi> Prov.
21. 1.</p>
            <p>Secondly the Grace of Strength in Kings is from the Lord;
by which I do not mean power, and ability of body and mind
only, that may be in another; but a supernatural, and celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
spirit of rule and government proper to Kings. It is said of
<hi>Saul,</hi> though a bad King, that <hi>God gave him another heart,</hi> 1.
Sam. 10. 9. And as soon as <hi>Samuel</hi> had anointed <hi>David, the
spirit of the Lord came upon him from that day forward,</hi> 1. Sam.
16. 13. Which was not the spirit of sanctification, for that
he had before, and therefore must be the spirit of wisdom, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
justice, mercy, and other Princely graces, which
God had induced him withall as a King for the right manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of so great a trust.</p>
            <p>For this his majesties Strength, it is a subject for a History,
not a Sermon, for others tongues and pens, not mine. Yet I
account it my duty to speak, what I believe, he was never so
low, as to be less than a King. The Lion abates nothing of
his Majestick deportment, whatsoever his condition be; the
King of fears never affrighted the hight of his spirit, nor did
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34929:10"/>
any desponding thoughts ever break thorow his Sacred lips.
The Lord so tempered his Royal heart, with a supernatural
magnanimous resolution, that both <hi>feriendo,</hi> and <hi>ferendo,</hi> in
adventuring, and bearing, he cut thorow all difficulties with
an edge of undaunted courage, and with a back of invincible
patience: for <hi>God was the Strength of his heart,</hi> Ps. 73. 26.
His Inward Strength.</p>
            <p>2 And also (which was the second kind of Strength) the
Lord is the Outward Strength of Kings, and so the word is
taken in Scripture two wayes, first for Right and Authority,
secondly for Power and Ability to act according to that Right
and Authority; and both these Strengths Kings have from the
Lord.</p>
            <p>1 Strength, that is the Right and Authority of Kings is from
the Lord, and though the word be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia</hi>
not <hi>potestas,</hi> and most commonly is taken for ability,
yet sometimes I conceive it may be taken in that sense we
now speak of, as in Ps. 99. 4. <hi>The Kings Strength loveth
Judgment. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Kings honour, and dignity,</hi> so
the Septuagint. <hi>Imperium regis,</hi> so St. <hi>Jerome, the Kings Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
and government.</hi> But not to litigate about words, this
truth is most clear, that the Strength of the right of Kings is
from the Lord, <hi>by me Kings reign,</hi> Prov. 8. 15. By me im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
not mediately, at the first, not second hand, not by
nor of man, but by the will and ordinance of God, and <hi>Tosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
(I think it is that) gives this to be the reason why they
are anointed on the head, because they hold of none but God,
and we are commanded to submit unto the King <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>as to the supreme,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 13. For though the Apostle
calls Kings <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> an <hi>ordinance of man,</hi> which
some interpret a humane creature, whether for better transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or worse intention, let others judge, yet that is only to
be understood, in respect of the forms, modes, and qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of power, which may be various, according to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
laws of Kingdoms. For though Kings be humane creatures,
and therefore must <hi>dy like</hi> other <hi>men,</hi> Ps. 82. 7. Yet no
Scripture warrants they may die by men. Their power is of
God alone, &amp; they are only accountable to him for the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34929:11"/>
of it, which if it should be male, yet it is an unheard
of way of curing the body by cutting off the head: I will
judg none, but my fears are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the frequent rendring of those
words of the Apostle, in the sense I have spoken of, in the
ears of the people, though otherwise it may be proper enough,
hath been only to lessen the power of Kings in the estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Subjects, and so by degrees to steal away their
hearts (like <hi>Absolon</hi>) from their obedience to their lawfull
Soveraign.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi> said, Every man had a Pope in his belly, he might
have said a King too: for how many, through Traiterous
ambition, vain-glory, covetous desires, and other filthy lusts,
have had Kings Crowns, and Dignities, both in their bellies,
their greedy appetites, and in their heads, their hellish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
and intentions? The uncomlinesse, and prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
deformity whereof, would easily have been discovered,
had they looked in <hi>Solomons</hi> glasse, Prov. 30. 31. <hi>And a
King against whom there is no rising up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What this Strength of Kings is, is a depth my shallow
vessel dares not launch into, which while some have too
venturously done, they have easily made <hi>Shipwrack,</hi> both of
<hi>Faith</hi> and a <hi>good Conscience,</hi> of Religion and Allegiance toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Gods word is the rule of our Prayers, and had we Prayed
more, or with more understanding, and spiritual affections,
and Disputed lesse, we had been better Subjects, and never
the worse Scholars.</p>
            <p>Now in our prayers we acknowledge the King to be over
all persons, and in all causes, as well Ecclesiastical as Civil,
supreme head, and Governour, and so he is by Divine insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
and immediate power from God.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>First over all Persons, Let every Soul</hi> (Soul is taken there
for the whole person) <hi>be subject to the higher power,</hi> Rom. 13.
1. And that <hi>for conscience sake,</hi> v. 5. Which subjection who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
denies, they may possibly prove the immortality of
their Souls, to their own damnation; but will never evince
the integrity, and regularity of their consciences for so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

               <hi>Samuel</hi> tells <hi>Saul, God had made him head over all the tribes

devests <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Priest of his office, for his demerits, 1,
<hi>Kings</hi> 2. 27. Neither was this power of Kings a rite and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
of the old law to be abolished, for when Christ nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
those to the Cross, yet he fastned obedience to supreme
authority, both by his precept, Matth. 22. 21. <hi>Give unto Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar
the things that are Caesars;</hi> And also by his practice, First
before he was born, paying taxes in the loins of his parents,
<hi>Luke</hi> 2. 5. Secondly in his life, working a miracle that he
might be obedient, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 27. Thirdly, at his death
acknowledging <hi>Pilates</hi> power, and submitting unto it, <hi>Joh.</hi>
19. 11. though he had 12 legions, and those of Angels, to
have rescued him; and Fourthly after his denth: for his body
must not be buried, till it was begged of <hi>Pilate, Matth.</hi> 27.
58.</p>
            <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> following his Masters steps, stands at <hi>Caesars</hi>

10. And acknowledged <hi>Neroes</hi> supremacy, when he was
delivered out of the mouth of the Lion, which is the King of
beasts, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
            <p>Secondly he is head, as <hi>over all persons,</hi> so <hi>in all causes,</hi> for
that must fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>low from that rational maxim of the Schools,
<hi>Qui habet potestatem super personam, habet potestatem super
omnia ad personam spectantia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now these causes are either Civil, or Ecclesiastical: for
the former, they being particularly unknown to me, and not
a subject so suitable to my Profession, and litle, or rather not
at all questioned before these late unhappy times by any that
would pretend to Loyalty, for any thing that I know, I will
therefore leav them to the vindication of those that are more
able, lest the cause should suffer through my weakness in
maintaining it.</p>
            <p>For Ecclesiastical causes, in which I should be more versed,
the Scripture places the supreme authority in the King:
for</p>
            <p>1 First, did not the Priests and Levites <hi>Clense the house of
the Lord according to the command of the King?</hi> 2 Chro. 29. 15.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34929:12"/>
And the text saith it was <hi>by the word of the Lord,</hi> for that good
King (<hi>Hezekiah</hi>) would do nothing without it; and the
successe his endeavour had, shewed as much, for the house of
the Lord was sanctified in <hi>eight dayes,</hi> v. 17. Our pretended
purifiers were above eight years about the work of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as it was called: but the long time they were about it, and
the little good they did in it, (or rather the great hurt) is to
me an argument that God never imployed them; for those
Foxes did instead of sweeping the house, only raise a dust
with their tayls, that so blinding the eyes of the people, they
might the more cunningly steal away the goods that belong
to it.</p>
            <p>2 Secondly, did not good King <hi>Josiah</hi> impose an oath, or
covenant on all his people, great and small, and caused
them <hi>to stand to it?</hi> 2 Chro 34. 31. But that any such should
be imposed upon the subject without the sanction of the King,
(however for the matter of it, something may be both law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and necessary) is a work on which so much hay, and
stuble is built, that it cannot endure the trial of the great day,
but it must be burnt, and the workers must suffer losse; But
O let them <hi>be saved, but as by fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 Thirdly, did not King <hi>David,</hi> 1 Chro. 13. 3. King <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hosophat,</hi>
2 Chro. 19. and others, assemble the Priests
and Levites to consult, and order the affairs that concern the
house of God? But that any of never so eminent parts and
piety should convene without the authority of the supreme
Magistrate being Christian, and disanul the settled liturgy and
Canons of the Church, and compose, and impose forms or
directions for worship and government, It gives but too
just an occasion to our adversaries to reproach our Church,
as they unjustly did that celebrious convention of the Synod of
<hi>Dort,</hi> Calling it in derision a conventicle, and somewhat
that is worse.</p>
            <p>4 Fourthly, did not King <hi>Jehosophat</hi> send out (I do not
say ordain) Priests and Levites <hi>to teach the book of the law?</hi>
2 Chro. 17. 9. The power indeed (I mean of Ordination)
belongs to the Right Reverend the Bishops of the Church,
and to them alone, or at least to none without them, except
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34929:12"/>
in case of necessity: But the outward commission, warrant,
command, and authority for the execution of that their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
function, is (I humbly conceive) from the King, who
is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as <hi>Constantine</hi> said of himself.</p>
            <p>And because I have named Bishops, let me have leave to
say thus much without offence, <hi>Smectymnuus</hi> was foretold
plain enough to my understanding, by our late pious and
learned Diocaesan their Antagonist, That if those skilfull pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
did not remain in the ship of the Church, it could not be
saved, and the <hi>Euroclidon</hi> that hath since tossed her, hath
shewed that, That R. R. Father in God, was not less than
a Prophet; And that <hi>Paul,</hi> and his successors counsel should
have been hearkened unto, that they might not so unadvised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have loosened from <hi>Crete</hi> (to allude to the Apostle, Acts
27. 11.) That so the Church might have gained that harm,
and loss, which since she hath sustained.</p>
            <p>5 Fiftly and lastly (to instance in no more) did not Kings
punish false Prophets, Blasphemers, Idolaters, break down
Idols, groves, high places, and take order to reform all things
amisse in the Church? he may exercise his ingenuity in <hi>Tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra
Torti,</hi> or open his Eares to <hi>Ephata,</hi> take a larger walk in
the field of our Church, and (I suppose) he will receive sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
who desires more.</p>
            <p>And indeed for this cause, the King is stiled <hi>custos utriusque
tabuli,</hi> keeper of the whole Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 18. Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of Zeal, and Duty, but Right, and Authority; he is as
<hi>Charles</hi> the great was called, <hi>Rector Religionis,</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Religion, the Nursing Father of the Church, <hi>Is:</hi> 49.
and <hi>Pastor</hi> also, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27. 17. yea, and head also of the
Church, which is not a Title given to Kings in King <hi>Henry</hi>
the 8. daies, as some have imagined: but in the statute
Law of God, as antient as the first King (ordinarily so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
that ever was in the Church of God; for God made
<hi>Saul head over all the Tribes, 1 Sam.</hi> 15. 17.</p>
            <p>Neither let any object, that he is a member of the Church,
and so cannot be the head; for <hi>Theodosius</hi> was both <hi>Caput Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perii
&amp; membrum Ecclesiae,</hi> for he may be a member of the
Catholick Church, and head also of the National Church,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34929:13"/>
in his own Dominions; As then he is King over all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
of what profession soever, so he is an Absolute head; as
he is a King over a people professing Christianity, so is a
Christian head; and as he is a pious King over all that are
godly in the Kingdom (I know no incongruity, I shall be
willing to be better informed) he is <hi>Sano sensu,</hi> Spiritual head,
I do not say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor mean, as Christ is head of his Church, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
direction of his Spirit, and powerfull influence of his
Grace, let such blasphemous mouths be for ever stop'd; nor
yet an Universal visible head, let them defend it whom it
concerns; nor a Ministerial head, or tongue, or hand, to Preach
the word, administer the seals and censures of the Church;

annointed by his special appointment Cannot, but be so deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated;
and experience proves, that many times the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Souls is more helped forward by the execution of
the wholsome Laws of godly Princes, than by the tongue of
the Minister in his powerfull Exhortations; the heart of man
being more apt to be moved for fear of Punishment, than al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured
for the love of Virtue.</p>
            <p>However, the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath many strong Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
upon her, besides the tye of Conscience, in obedience
to the immediate command of God, in gratitude to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and so to obey his Majesty, as head over all spiritual
persons, and in all spiritual causes, from whom she hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
received so many unhoped for, and unexpected spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
as well as temporal blessings: And so much for that
particular, that the Kings Strength, as it is taken for Right
and Authority, is from the Lord.</p>
            <p>Lastly, take Strength for Power, Abilities, Force, Honour,
Dignities, Glory, Treasure, or what ever else lyes in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
sense of the word Strength, or is annexed with it in
Scripture, for the neerness and sim litude (if not identity)
unto it, as all, or most of those expressions are: And also,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34929:13"/>
whatsoever is comprehended under the name and notion of
Prerogative Royal, belongs unto the King from the same
Original his right to the Crown doth; for it will sound
strange to any mans understanding, that is not darkened with
prejudice, that a King should have his Commission to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
immediately from God, and should not have right by
the same Tenure, to whatsoever is necessary for the putting
of that power into action and exercise for the obtaining of its
Ends.</p>
            <p>Therefore Customs, Tributes, Fear, Reverence, Revenues,
Militia by Sea and Land, Forts, Holds, Castles, Magazins,
Ammunitions, Power to pardon, or punish offenders against
his Laws, to make War or Peace, to confer Honours, raise
Forces, appoint Commanders, to settle Counsellors, Judges,
and all other Officers of State, or what ever Diamonds and
Jewels besides (for as it is beyond my model to know, so it
is beyond my modesty and subjection curiously to inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to)
do adorn his Regal Dignity, they are fixed originally
upon divine Institution; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> saith the Apostle, <hi>because
he is the Minister of God for our good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so he is indeed, the Preserver of our sacred Truth, our
Defence in War, our Security in Peace; and therefore hath
right to whatsoever is necessary to the safety of his sacred
person, the support of his Regal Dignity, the preservation
and enlargement of his Kingdoms and Dominions, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
of his people under him, in case of disloyalty; to the
rendring of him feared and respected abroad, honoured, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and obeyed at home.</p>
            <p>And whosoever shall deny their Soveraign these, or any
thing else, <hi>quoad potestatem utendi pro bono Communi,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
any of them out of his hand, I must send them for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

            </p>
            <p>And if his Majesty shall see cause to imploy any of the
Parts, Gifts, and Abilities of any of his Subjects, though Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
person, in the Administration of Civil affairs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the Honour and Dignity of their spiritual Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I know not why he should be deprived of that just Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative;
<hi>Moses</hi> made Judges out of all the Tribes, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34929:14"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. both intimates and argues, that those that are
most esteemed in the Church, should not therefore be in the
less capacity to judge of things pertaining to this life: Upon
which ground, holy St. <hi>Augustine</hi> spent part of the day, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the whole, as <hi>Possidonius</hi> relates in his life, in the decision
of civil Causes; and received Letters, and returned Resolution
about them.</p>
            <p>For though no man that warreth this spiritual warfare, ought
<hi>to entangle himself with the things of this life,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 4. and
<hi>Christs Kingdom be not of this World,</hi> Joh. 18. 36. and Christ
rejects with indignation the covetous wretch his motion, <hi>Luke</hi>
12. 49. with, <hi>man, who made me a Judge over you;</hi> which places,
(among others) are alleged by those that leave no stone unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
nor Scripture unwrested, to wring that power out of their
hand, that are far better able to manage it themselves, and I am
sure to a better end; for this is one way whereby the spiritual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the Church may better find out the temper and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the people; and so judge whether they grow in Faith
and Obedience, or not.</p>
            <p>For it is one good sign given by our Practical Divines, and
<hi>Possidonius</hi> hints as much, to know a true Christian from a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,
by his behaviour about the things of this World; when
Christ touched the young mans free-hold, he soon appeared
dross.</p>
            <p>Though therefore the spiritual Souldier must not intangle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
yet he must submit himself to his Princes Command, and
though Christs Kingdom be nor of, yet it is in this World; And it
seems to me to be supposed, that Christ might have been a
Judge, but he must not make himself one; which Rule, had it
been followed, we had not had so many, nor such Judges as we
have had.</p>
            <p>Let not us therefore deny the Kings power in temporals, as
the Papists do in spirituals; but put we in practice our Saviours
Precept, Mat. 22. <hi>Give unto Caesar the things that are Caesars,</hi>
or rather <hi>render</hi> unto him what is his; for though it may be
called giving for the willingness and readiness that should be in
the Giver, and it may be for some other reasons yet it is a
gift, not of Courtesie, but Duty; for the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:34929:14"/>
and the next words [<hi>which are Caesars</hi>] shews <hi>Caesar</hi> hath
a Right before the giving, for I cannot be said to give that which
is anothers, but that which is my own.</p>
            <p>I conclude this with the improvement of the Apostles Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ment,
who goeth to warfare at any time at his own charges?
who planteth a Vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof?
who feedeth a Flock, and eateth not of the milk thereof? who
ruleth a Kingdom, (and indeed who can) without the Strength
thereof? And thus much for the first blessing of Kings, the Lord
is Author of their Strength.</p>
            <p>The second blessing of the King, of which the Lord is the
Author, is, his Salvation of which, now but a few words.</p>
            <p>Salvation is taken three waies in Scripture especially.</p>
            <p>First, for spiritual deliverance from sin, and the direfull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of it, Death, Hell and Damnation: Christ tells <hi>Zacheus,
Luke,</hi> 19. 9. that <hi>Salvation was come into his house.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, for eternal Glory, of which he is the <hi>Author to all
those</hi> that believe, and <hi>obey him, Heb.</hi> 5. 9.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for temporal deliverance from our Enemies, and
all outward evils, so Exod. 14. 13. <hi>stand still, and see the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Lord,</hi> and in this sense (though I exclude not the
other) <hi>David</hi> calls God frequently, <hi>the God of his Salvation,</hi>
Ps. 18. 46. Ps. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. Ps. 85. 7, 9.</p>
            <p>Now though God was, and is, and will be, we believe, hope,
and pray, to the King, the Author of all those Salvations; Yet
his temporal Salvation seems more especially intended in the
Text, and is the peculiar Subject of our present discourse.</p>
            <p>Salvation supposes danger, and were I able to give you a just
Catalogue of his Majesties manifold and great dangers, I fear
I should cast a black cloud over the solemnity of this day; was
he not (with St. <hi>Paul 2. Cor.</hi> 11. 26.) <hi>in perils of waters,</hi> that were
even like to have run over his Soul? <hi>in perils of Robers;</hi> that lay in
wait for him by troops; <hi>in perils amongst his own Country-men,</hi>
who use to deal more kindly one with another; <hi>in perils by the
Heathens,</hi> or those that were worse than Heathens; <hi>in perils
in the Wilderness,</hi> whither he was driven as a Pellican, <hi>in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils
in the Sea?</hi> and sure that faithfull Pilot that wafted his
Royal person over it in his small Vessel, could not but fear;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34929:15"/>
but it may be his Majesty encouraged him, as <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> did
his Pilot when he was afraid of a Storm; <hi>Caesarem vehis,</hi> thou
carriest <hi>Caesar;</hi> O how can we forget, to make us more cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
thankfull, his tribulations, distresses, persecutions, being
for Christs sake and his Kingdoms killed all the day and year,
(yea, many years) long? O remember how our Shepheard
was counted as a sheep for the Slaughter.</p>
            <p>What mutinies were raised continually against this our
<hi>Moses?</hi> what preparations for destruction against this our <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah?</hi>
what Combinations, Plots and Conspiracies against
this our <hi>Jehoshaphat?</hi> what Stratagems against this our <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua?</hi>
Yet in all these he was <hi>more than Conquerour through
him that loved him.</hi> The Lord delivered him, and was his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
from the <hi>Bear and Lion, and from that uncircumcised
Philistine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was not the Oake, though it be the Strongest of Trees,
<hi>Amos</hi> 2. 9. that could have secured him, nor the thick leaves
thereof that could have hid him till the Calamities were
over-past; nor was it the eye of any faithfull Centinel, to
give notice of approaching danger that could have preserved
him, though they were all happy means thereof.</p>
            <p>But it was the Arm of the Lord that was his Strength, and
his Fortress; The shadow of his wings, that was his Refuge;
and the wonderfull eye of Providence, that neither slumbers
nor sleeps, that watched over him; that eye that saw <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nael
under the Fig-tree,</hi> that Angel (supposed to be Christ the
Angel of the Covenant) that <hi>appeared to</hi> Abraham <hi>under the
Oak of</hi> Mamre, that was his <hi>Angelus Custos,</hi> his Keeper and
Preserver.</p>
            <p>And though I know the idolatry of worshiping Green

be built, to the service of God, in the place of that Royal
Oak of Preservation, if it be cut down; and let him that laid his
axe to the root of that tree, be condemned for ever to be a hewer
of wood. Let the Oak, for the pretious fruit it once bore, be
reckoned among the fruitfullest trees of the Forrest; like the
<hi>tree of life, that bore 12 manner of fruits,</hi> Rev. 22. 6. and let
the leaves thereof, be hence forward good for <hi>the healing of the
Nations;</hi> let no ominous bird ever build her neast in the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
thereof. And he that hath not this day brought a bough of
the Oak in his hand, to strew in the way, and to testifie his
thankfulness, let that punishment at least, be inflicted on him,
which the Jews (they say) did on every one that brought not
a bough of the Palm in his hand, when Christ rid in triumph
to <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> let him fast all that day.</p>
            <p>Whilst we (giving instruments their due acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
magnifie the name of <hi>Jehovah</hi> only, his Majesties
mighty, ready, seasonable, wise, holy, faithfull, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Strength, the sole Author of his so great Salvation;
and so I am fallen upon the second part of the Text, the Kings
and Churches praise for Gods Strength, and his Salvation;
which I told you should be our Application.</p>
            <p>First then, <hi>let the King rejoyce,</hi> and that both with inward
joy, and outward gladness, and that <hi>exceedingly</hi> too; as having
the greatest cause, the beams of divine favour shining most
strongly upon him, God having set him again in his own
Throne, for <hi>solium Regis, est solium Dei,</hi> invested him with his
own robes of Power and Majesty, given him his own name,
set him often in his own book, as neer himself, as one sentence
can joyn them, made him his immediate Deputy, and Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt
upon Earth, foster'd him in his bosome, made him a
Chosen Vessel to bear his name, and to do his great work, and
what greater work can there be than that he is doing, to take
care of Gods Church, to settle his Kingdoms in Truth, Peace
and Holyness, and to cement and glue a broken and heart-divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34929:16"/>
people, to unite both the Roses and the Kingdoms again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?</p>
            <p>And, O let his sacred Majesty offer unto the God of his
Salvation, out of this his Garden of Paradise (as <hi>England</hi> hath
been called) the red Rose of the praises of his lips, and the
white Rose of Innocency and Purity of life, a sweet smelling
Sacrifice, acceptable to the Lord his Strength, and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
            <p>Indeed his gracious Majesty hath prevented this our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
having already, (as <hi>Noah</hi> builded an Altar, <hi>Jacob</hi> a
House, <hi>Solomon</hi> a Temple, <hi>Constantine</hi> a Church) erected an
everlasting Monument of praise and thanksgiving, by setting
apart this day by a perpetual decree for the service and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God, the God of his Salvation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let us therefore following his pious Example,
(for otherwise to speak of the duty of Kings in the ears of their
Subjects is secretly to raise jealousies of his Government
in their minds, and no better than Pulpit-treason, of which
some have been too full) bless God for restoring to us our
King, our Hereditary King, and such a King, at such a time,
in such a manner, and to such end, When all stood amazed,
as at their wits end, when there was none to deliver us, to
settle our Confusions in Church and State; none to glue our
divided hearts, none to heal our desperate breaches, none to
cure our deadly wound, if his sacred hand had not touched
them.</p>
            <p>O, <hi>let our souls praise the Lord, and all that is within us
bless his holy Name,</hi> and let us express our joy outwardly, and
that exceedingly, let the <hi>voice of joy and gladness be heard in
our dwellings;</hi> let us not refrain our lips, let it appear we
have our <hi>portion</hi> in this our <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>our inheritance in the
Son of</hi> Jesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Motives.</hi> And let me give you a few motives to stir us
up to this duty of joy and gladness, and some directions how
to perform it, and I conclude. God hath this day restored to
us our mercifull King; invested indeed he is with all other
Princely Graces, but his Mercy is in him (as in God) over
all his other works; his gracious pardon reaches not only to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34929:16"/>
thousands, but millions, even to those that are yet unborn.</p>
            <p>For had he been extreme, how few could have indured;
when all must have confessed (except some few despised Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allists,
whose knees did never bow to <hi>Baal</hi>) that they were in
the same, though not equal condemnation; yea, he offered
pardon to those that asked it not, and their own consciences
can tell them, whether they thank him for it, or no, now they
have it.</p>
            <p>So gracious a Prince he is, that he would not enter his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
in the blood of any of his Subjects, except those immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Regicides who committed that barbarous murder upon the
perion of his Royal Father; a fact never to be named without
the depth of detestation. And alas, how is it possible but the
wrath of God must lye upon their heads, who would crucifie
the Lamb Jesus, to chuse a Fox, <hi>Herod?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So mercifull he is, that with <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperor, he
would scarce have a Traytor dye, and with <hi>Theodosius,</hi> he seems
to wish he could call them again to life, might it be with the
justice of his Throne. And, O let the stupendious Act of his
gracious Pardon, never hurt himself, nor his Posterity; incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
his Enemies to commit the same sins again, for which they
have found easier forgiveness on Earth, than ever they shall
find in Heaven, without repentance and restitution; nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
or dishearten his Faithfull and Loyal Subjects; but
that they may be willing again to venture their Lives and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
for the service of their Soveraigns, if they be called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it; (as some in this place have done) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>for
the Lords sake only.</p>
            <p>2. God hath restored unto us our Religious King; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us be <hi>exceeding glad:</hi> A King constant in the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Truth, in which he is the deeper rooted, the more
he hath been shaken, <hi>Coelum non animum,</hi> he often changed his
air (the greater is their sin that would neither give him, nor sell
him a liberty to breath in their Climate) but never his heart;
he was not <hi>e salice,</hi> (as that Politician said he was, being ask'd
why he changed his Religion so oft) but <hi>quercu ortus,</hi> not made
of willowes that will bend every way, but of heart of Oak, that
will not bow to the boysterous winds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:34929:17"/>
And his Majesties Love and Pains for the settling of the
true Religion, shews him to be Defender of the Faith, as well
by Truth as Title, and as much by desert as by descent.</p>
            <p>And when he lost all, he lost nothing of the Truth, nor
wheresover he went did he leave his God behind him, but
brought them with him into his Kingdom, who had well nigh
lost both.</p>
            <p>3 The Lord hath restored unto us our Peace-making King,
so meek, as if with <hi>Moses</hi> he had known only the name of
Passion, not the thing; <hi>beati pacifici</hi> is not only his Motto,
but Blessing; while other Kings make, or should make Peace,
he is made of Peace; How wonderfully under God hath he
preserved the Ark of this Church ready to sink? What Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
hath he appeased? What stormes hath he calmed among
the spirits of men? What gracious and sweet Concessions
flow from his native Goodnesse? How doth he burn in love
towards those, whose affections (it is to be feared) are but
cold towards him? He first passed an act of pious and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Devotion in Heaven for his enemies, with <hi>Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
them,</hi> before he passed and confirmed his Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
on earth; and remembred the awful Counsel, if not
Charge of his Royal Father, which was much like that of
<hi>Phocion</hi> to his Sonn: <hi>mando ut hujus pot us obliviscaris,</hi> I
charge you never to revenge my death. And, O let all his
Subjects make a better use of all his gracious Favours than
(which formerly have been done) to be more unreasonable
in their demands, and spend all their lives in thankfulnesse
to God for the salvation of so merciful, pious, and peaceable
a Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Direct.</hi> And for our Direction, especially these two ways:</p>
            <p>1 First, by a true fear of God, that so we may better ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
our King; God hath often joyned them together in his
Word: let us never put them asunder. It hath been the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
of Satan and his instruments to scandalize Religion to
be the occasion of Rebellion, but the Fathers well discovered
that fallacy, by retorting and demanding what was the cause
of sedition in <hi>Rome</hi> before Christianity was in it.</p>
            <p>But the Disciple is not above his Master: Christ himself
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34929:17"/>
was accused for a pestilent fellow, and a denyer of Tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi>
though indeed none was so forward in it as he, profering it when
he might have been free, without enquiring whether <hi>Caesar</hi> stood
need of it or no, being then at peace with all the world, not yet ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pecting
the assembling of <hi>Judea</hi> together.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denyed, and the story is too sad to remember, but
that Religion hath been made a Cloke, and that a long one, for
Rebellion: but this hath been through the pride, ambition, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse,
envy, malice and other lusts of men, for otherwise Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Loyalty, not only may consist together, but do best esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
one another.</p>
            <p>Let Philosophers and Statists dispute as long as they will, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a bad man may not be a good subject; to be sure, a good man
cannot be a bad one: upon which ground, King <hi>James</hi> told the
King of <hi>France,</hi> that the Protestants were as good Subjects as any
he had. Spiritual liberty agrees best with Civil subjection; for
though we cannot serve God and Mammon, yet we may very well
serve God and man together; nay, how can we serve or Love God
whom we have not seen, if we do not serve and obey our King
whom we have seen? <hi>John</hi> 1. 4, 20. who is a Brother, and more.
It is better indeed to obey God than man, but best to obey both,
which we may do either by Active or Passive obedience.</p>
            <p>Hearken then ye prophane scoffers at Religion; You foul-mouth
swearers, you beastly drunkards, you debauched miscreants, and all
the black-guard of ungodlinesse and impiety: can you that are evil
speak well of Dignities? Do men gather grapes of Thornes, or
figs of Thistles? How can you fight cordially for your King that
carry Traytors in your bosomes? Whatsoever you are, I am sure
your sins are enemies to his Crown and Dignity.</p>
            <p>Let us then in a holy rejoycing raise up our Bells, but not with
the cords of iniquity, lest we pull down the Judgements of God
upon us: Kindle we our Bone-fires, but take we heed we incense
not the Wrath of God against us who is a consuming fire; Be we
merry in the Lord, but feast we not the Devil, <hi>Daemonum cibus,
ebrietas;</hi> Let our Cups be the Cups of salvation.</p>
            <p>And let it be our prayers to God, That as his Majesty hath zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
declamed and proclamed against all vitiousness, debauched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and prophaueness; so the High and Honourable Houses of
Parliament would vote against them; that the R. Reverend and
awful Convocation, would let their sacred Decrees, Canons and
Censures fly out against them; that it may appear Christs Keys
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34929:18"/>
are not lost, though they have layn rusty too long a time. That the
pious and resolute Magistrates of the Land, would remember that
they are sent of the King for the punishment of evil doers, and for
the praise of them that do well, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14. That all the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxal,
painful and faithfull Ministers of the Gospel, may be Sons
of Thunder, and rattle out the Judgements of God against all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness:
that they would out-pray, out-live, out-preach, out-countenance
all impiety.</p>
            <p>And you of this Congregation, whose faces have cause to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
your congratulation of the happinesse of this Day; whose cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
it is (yet boast not of it, it was no more than your duty) that you
were the first in your County, I mean some of you, and I believe
the only Town (not incorporate) that ever appeared in Armes
for your King, and stood too against an Army, and were so reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
that it was evident you valued not your Lives for the service
of your Soveraign; and have suffered in your Liberties and Estates:
O be you as forward for Piety and Religion, as ever you were to
Loyalty and Obedience.</p>
            <p>And though you have lyen (and yet do) among the pots in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity
and darkness, yet in due time ye shall be as the wings of a
Dove covered with silver, and her Feathers with yellow Gold,
<hi>Ps. 68. 14. post tenebras spero lucem,</hi> as <hi>Jobs</hi> comfort, let it be yours,
after darkness look for light.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Shew your joy and gladness, as in walking in the fear
of God, so in honouring the King, and that</p>
            <p>1 In a high and supereminent Esteem of His sacred Person
and Authority; <hi>Curse not the King, no not in thy thought,</hi> saith <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
Eccl. 10. 21. For thought, to God is both word and action:
and he that admits any low esteem into his heart of Soveragn Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
wants that appreciative Love, which consists in a singular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the Object beloved. God hath placed him next to himself
in Office and Honour, and let us set him there in our judgement
and estimation.</p>
            <p>If he be our Father (as he is <hi>Pater Patriae</hi>) let him have
our Fear; and if he be our Master upon Earth, let him have our
Honour: Whence comes uncomely Expressions, causeless Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
needless Fears, groundless Suspicions, seditious Slanders,
treasonable Censures, and rebellious Practices, but from the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of a wicked heart, that have entertained low thoughts of
supreme Authority? Kings are more than other men, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 6.
and so let us esteem of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:34929:18"/>
2. In giving unto him his due praises, and speaking well of his
name. I know it is a sin to flatter Kings, and let it be Treason, if
you will; and therefore <hi>Constantine</hi> reproved a Preacher for highly
commending him in his presence: But 'tis a sin only for the fowl
mouth of a cursing <hi>Shimei,</hi> or a reviling <hi>Rabsekah,</hi> to slander the
foot-steps of the annointed of the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Is it fit to say to a King, thou art wicked, and to Princes, ye are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly?</hi>
Job 34. 18. If <hi>Theodosius</hi> erre in his Government; let St.
<hi>Ambrose</hi> put him in mind of it; but otherwise we must not speak
evill of Dignities, therefore we must speak well of them; It was
the lot of <hi>Moses</hi> (and is so too often of good Kings) that when they
fared well, they would sacrifize to their own nets, and thank them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
but if it went ill with them, they laid the blame on <hi>Moses,
Exod. 14. 11. Exod.</hi> 32. 1. See there how shamefully they abuse
him, when he was in the Mount with God, both pleading for them
and receiving directions how to govern them: First, they gathe
themselves together to <hi>Aaron;</hi> a rebellious Assembly without <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>
Secondly, they force <hi>Aaron</hi> to make them Gods, to go befor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
them; and it proves but a golden Calf at last. Thirdly, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
and slight <hi>Moses,</hi> this Fellovv, this <hi>Moses,</hi> the man, as if not
vvorth the naming; and Fourthly, they slander him vvith vile asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
as if they knevv not vvhat vvas become of him, vvhen they
could not be ignorant he vvas in the Mount vvith God, Receiving
the tvvo tables vvhich they had no mind to hear of.</p>
            <p>But, O let not us pay our Tribute with evil words, we cannot
mean well, if we speak evil, <hi>a woman that feareth the Lord, must be
praised,</hi> Prov. 31. 30. much more a King ought <hi>daily to be praised,</hi>
Ps. 72. 15.</p>
            <p>3 In a hearty obedience, 1. Active to all his lawful Commands, as
to our Lord and Master, our servile obedience as to our Husband
(as Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> said she was married to her kingdom) our loving o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience;
&amp; as to our Father our filial obedience. Nature will teach
(much more should Grace) an obediential subjection in all Inferiors
to their Superiors, as in Children to their Parents, Servants to their
Masters, Souldiers to their Commanders, and Subjects to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign;
the meanest whereof is under his Care; and the greatest
must be under his Command. 2. In our Passive obedience, if the
case require, and in no case must we touch so much as a lap of his
garment, much less the pretious life of the Lords Annointed, nor
suffer any other to touch it so as to hurt it if it lye in our power to
prevent it; and herein God be merciful to <hi>England,</hi> and lay not this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34929:19"/>
to our charge: He is the high Steward, as well in Office as Name,
and must not be displaced but by God, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that the Heathen Emperors ought not to be resisted, and it is a
strange Religion that makes Christian Kings in a worse condition.
Prayers and Tears, with holines of life, were the Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
Weapons; &amp; should be ours; <hi>Oramus, non pugnamus Casar,</hi> was
their Apology, We pray unto thee, O <hi>Caesar,</hi> we fight not against
thee; and that not because they wanted strength, if we believe
S. <hi>Cyprian, Nemo nostrum reluctatur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quamvis cop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

            </p>
            <p>4. In supporting His Royal Dignity by our Estates and Lives;
also if need require, the King must be served by the field, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 9.
not only as a just reward of his care for us (which none knows but
himself, though we find the comfort of it) but also as a sign of our
subjection to him; but of this before.</p>
            <p>5 Lastly, By and in our daily fervent prayers, for his preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and long and prosperous Reign over us, that we may live a quiet
and a peaceable life in all godliness and honesty, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. Or
we may do it in <hi>Tertullians</hi> form, that God would give him, <hi>vitam
prolixam, imperium securum, domum tutam, exercitus fortes, senatum
fidelem, populum probum, orbem quietum;</hi> A long Life, a safe House,
victorious. Armies, a faithful Counsel, a loyal People, and a quiet
World. And that we may omit nothing in our prayers; let us take
in <hi>Tertullians</hi> next words, <hi>quaecun<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> hominis, &amp; Caesaris vota sunt;</hi>
That God would give him his hearts desire, and not withold the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of his Lips, as it is in the 2 <hi>ver.</hi> of this Psalm. The Heathen
Emperors were pray'd for twice a day: let us pray &amp; praise seven
times a day for his sacred Majesty, in the form of the antient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
<hi>Carolo secundo regi, a deo Coronato, a deo Custodito, vitam longam
&amp; annos multos;</hi> That the Lord would give to <hi>Charles</hi> the second
our King Crowned, and preserved of God, a long life and yeares to
many generations; or in the words of Saint <hi>Ambrose, ut injustitia
&amp; virtute gubernet,</hi> that he may govern us in righteousnes &amp; virtue.</p>
            <p>Let us then (to conclude all) take up the acclamation of joy,
which the people of <hi>Rome</hi> did at the Coronation of <hi>Charles</hi> the
Great; <hi>Carolo secundo a deo Coronato Magno &amp; pacifico Britannorum
imperatori vita &amp; vistoria,</hi> To <hi>Charles</hi> the second, Crowned of
God, the Great and peaceable Emperour of <hi>Britain,</hi> be Life and
Victory; and let all that fear God and honour the King, say, <hi>Amen,
Amen.</hi>
