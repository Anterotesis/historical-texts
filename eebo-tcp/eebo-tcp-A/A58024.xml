            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>These I perus'd with some atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and some reflections I made; in which, how far I mistake your sense, that is, how far I am mistaken, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be inform'd.</p>
            <p>I had heard that the <hi>Theater</hi> was wont to be call'd the <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;</hi> and <hi>Tragedy</hi> a <hi>Poem</hi> for <hi>Kings:</hi> That they who first brought Tragedy to perfection, were made <hi>Vice-Roys</hi> and Governors of <hi>Islands;</hi> were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured every-where with Statues of Marble, and Statues of Brass; were stil'd the <hi>Wise Sophocles,</hi> the <hi>Wise Euripides</hi> by God and Man, by Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Philosophers. That for teaching Morality, <hi>Crantor</hi> and <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippus</hi> were no-body to 'em. This latter transcrib'd the whole <hi>Medea</hi> of <hi>Euripides</hi> into his works. That so refin'd a People, and so frugal a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth</hi> as <hi>Athens</hi> did tax and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess themselves, and laid out more of their publick Exchequer upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of these Plays, than all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65825:10"/>
their Wars stood them in, though sometimes both Seas and Land were cover'd with Pagan Enemies that <unclear>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded</unclear> them. And not <hi>Athens</hi> only, but (who hated <hi>Athens)</hi> so austere and glum a generation as those of <hi>Sparta,</hi> by the care of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed the same honour to these <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Poets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things coming into my mind, surely (thought I) mens brains lye not in the same place as formerly; or else Poetry is not now the same thing it was in those days of yore.</p>
            <p>I therefore made enquiry what <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> might be in our <hi>Philosophy</hi> and <hi>Manners;</hi> I found that our <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers</hi> agreed well enough with theirs, in the <hi>main;</hi> however, that our Poets have forc'd another way to the <hi>wood;</hi> a <hi>by-road,</hi> that runs directly cross to that of <hi>Nature, Manners</hi> and <hi>Philosophy</hi> which gain'd the <hi>Ancients</hi> so great veneration.</p>
            <p>I would not examin the <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> the <hi>unities</hi> and <hi>outward</hi> regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities, the <hi>mechanical part</hi> of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies: there is no talking of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65825:11"/>
when there wants Essentials; 'tis not necessary for a man to have a nose on his face, nor to have two legs: he may be a <hi>true</hi> man, though aukward and unsightly, as the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> in the <hi>Tempest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor have I much troubl'd their phrase and expression, I have not vex'd their language with the <hi>doubts,</hi> the <hi>remarks</hi> and eternal triflings of the <hi>French Grammaticasters:</hi> much less have I cast about for Jests, and gone a quibble-catching.</p>
            <p>I have chiefly consider'd the <hi>Fable</hi> or <hi>Plot,</hi> which all conclude to be the <hi>Soul</hi> of a <hi>Tragedy;</hi> which, with the <hi>Ancients,</hi> is always found to be a <hi>reasonable Soul;</hi> but <hi>with us,</hi> for the most part, a <hi>brutish,</hi> and often worse than <hi>brutish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And certainly there is not requir'd much Learning, or that a man must be some <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>Doctor</hi> of <hi>Subtilties,</hi> to form a right judgment in this particular; common sense suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; and rarely have I known the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men-judges</hi> mistake in these points, when they have the patience to think,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65825:11"/>
and (left to their own heads) they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide with their own sense. But if people are prepossest, if they will judg of <hi>Rollo</hi> by <hi>Othello,</hi> and one <hi>crooked line</hi> by another, we can never have a certainty.</p>
            <p>Amongst those who will be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against the doctrin I lay down, may peradventure appear a sort of men who have remember'd <hi>so</hi> and <hi>so;</hi> and value themselves upon their <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</hi> I may write by the <hi>Book</hi> (say they) what I have a mind, but they <hi>know</hi> what will <hi>please.</hi> These are a kind of <hi>Stage-quacks</hi> and <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pericks</hi> in Poetry, who have got a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit</hi> to <hi>please:</hi> And no <hi>Collegiate</hi> like 'em for <hi>purging</hi> the Passions.</p>
            <p>These say (for instance) a <hi>King</hi> and no <hi>King, pleases.</hi> I say the <hi>Comical</hi> part <hi>pleases.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I say that Mr. <hi>Hart pleases;</hi> most of the business falls to his share, and what he <hi>delivers,</hi> every one takes upon <hi>content;</hi> their <hi>eyes</hi> are prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest and charm'd by his <hi>action,</hi> before ought of the <hi>Poets</hi> can approach their <hi>ears;</hi> and to the most wretched
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65825:12"/>
of <hi>Characters,</hi> he gives a lustre and <hi>brillant</hi> which dazles the <hi>sight,</hi> that the <hi>deformities</hi> in the Poetry cannot be perceiv'd.</p>
            <p>Therefore a distinction is to be made between what <hi>pleases naturally</hi> in it self, and what <hi>pleases</hi> upon the account of <hi>Machines, Actors, Dances</hi> and circumstances which are meerly <hi>accidental</hi> to the <hi>Tragedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> observes, that in his time, some who (wanting the talent to <hi>write</hi> what might <hi>please)</hi> made it their care that the <hi>Actors</hi> should help out, where the <hi>Muses</hi> faild.</p>
            <p>These objectors urge, that there is also another great <hi>accident,</hi> which is, that <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>London</hi> have not the same <hi>Meridian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certain it is, that <hi>Nature</hi> is the same, and <hi>Man</hi> is the same, he <hi>loves, grieves, hates, envies,</hi> has the same <hi>affections</hi> and <hi>passions</hi> in both places, and the same <hi>springs</hi> that give them <hi>motion.</hi> What mov'd <hi>pity</hi> there, will <hi>here</hi> also produce the same effect.</p>
            <p>This must be confest, unless they will, in effect say, that we have not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65825:12"/>
that <hi>delicate tast</hi> of things; we are not so <hi>refin'd,</hi> nor so <hi>vertuous;</hi> that <hi>Athens</hi> was more <hi>civiliz'd</hi> by their <hi>Philosophers,</hi> than we with both our <hi>Philosophers</hi> and <hi>twelve Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But were it to be suppos'd that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> with us is a <hi>corrupt</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd <hi>Nature,</hi> that we are <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and <hi>humanity</hi> dwells not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us; shall our <hi>Poet</hi> therefore pamper this <hi>corrupt</hi> nature, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge our barbarity? Shall he not rather <hi>purge</hi> away the corruption, and reform our <hi>manners?</hi> Shall he not with <hi>Orpheus</hi> rather choose to draw the <hi>Brutes</hi> after him, than be himself a <hi>follower</hi> of the <hi>Herd?</hi> Was it thus that the <hi>ancient</hi> Poets (by the best Philosophers) became stil'd the <hi>Fathers</hi> of Knowledg, and <hi>Interpreters</hi> of the Gods?</p>
            <p>Lastly, (though <hi>Tragedy</hi> is a Poem chiefly for <hi>men</hi> of <hi>sense,)</hi> yet I cannot be perswaded that the people are so very mad of <hi>Acorns,</hi> but that they could be well content to eat the <hi>Bread</hi> of civil persons.</p>

Poetry is the <hi>Child</hi> of <hi>Fancy,</hi> and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be school'd and <hi>disciplin'd</hi> by <hi>Reason;</hi> Poetry, say they, is <hi>blind</hi> inspiration, is pure <hi>enthusiasm,</hi> is <hi>rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>rage</hi> all over.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Fancy,</hi> I think, in Poetry, is like <hi>Faith</hi> in Religion; it makes far discoveries, and soars above reason, but never clashes, or runs against it. <hi>Fancy</hi> leaps, and frisks, and away she's gone; whilst <hi>reason</hi> rattles the chains, and follows after. <hi>Reason</hi> must consent and ratify what-ever by <hi>fancy</hi> is attempted in its absence; or else 'tis all <hi>null</hi> and void in law. However, in the contrivance and <hi>oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi> of a Play, <hi>reason</hi> is always prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to be consulted. Those who object against reason, are the <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> in Poetry, and are never to be sav'd by their good works.</p>
            <p>Others imagin that these rules and restraints on the <hi>Plot</hi> and <hi>Argument</hi> of Tragedy, wou'd hinder much good <hi>intrigue,</hi> wou'd clog invention, and make all <hi>Plays</hi> alike and <hi>uniform.</hi>

But certainly <hi>Nature</hi> affords plenty and variety enough of <hi>Beauties,</hi> that no man need complain if the <hi>deform'd</hi> are cloyster'd up, and shut from him. Such a Painter has been, who could draw nothing but a <hi>Rose;</hi> yet other Painters can design one and the same good face in a thousand several fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures: it may be remember'd that there are but five vowels; or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd, from <hi>seven</hi> Planets, and their several positions, how <hi>many faces</hi> and fortunes the <hi>Astrologer</hi> distributes to the people. And has not a Poet more <hi>vertues</hi> and <hi>vices</hi> within his <hi>circle,</hi> cannot he observe them and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences in their several <hi>situations,</hi> in their <hi>oppositions</hi> and <hi>conjunctions,</hi> in their <hi>altitudes</hi> and <hi>depressions:</hi> and he shall sooner find his <hi>ink,</hi> than the <hi>stores</hi> of Nature exhausted.</p>
            <p>Other objections may be answer'd as they fall in the way. I would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have you before hand advertiz'd, that you will find me ty'd to no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>stile,</hi> nor laying my reasons to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in <hi>form</hi> and <hi>method.</hi> You will find me sometimes reasoning, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

declaiming, sometimes citing authority for common sense; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>uttering,</hi> as my <hi>own,</hi> what may be had at any <hi>Bookshop</hi> in the Nation: sometimes doubting when I might be positive, and sometimes confident out of season; sometimes turning <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy</hi> into what is <hi>light</hi> and comical, and sporting when I should be serious. This variety made the travel more easy. And you know I am not cut out for writing a <hi>Treatise,</hi> nor have a <hi>genius</hi> to <hi>pen</hi> any thing <hi>exactly;</hi> so long as I am <hi>true</hi> to the <hi>main sense</hi> before me, you will pardon me in the rest.</p>
            <p>Nor will it, I hope, give offence that I handle these <hi>Tragedies</hi> with the same liberty thar I formerly had taken in examining the <hi>Epick Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems</hi> of <hi>Spencer, Cowley,</hi> and such names as will ever be <hi>sacred</hi> to me. <hi>Rapin</hi> tells us, for his own <hi>Countrey-men,</hi> that none of them had writ a good <hi>Tragedy,</hi> nor was ever like to write one.

            <p>ACcording to the best account I can gather from old Authors.</p>
            <p>Tragedy was originally, with the Ancients, a piece of <hi>Religious</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, a part of their <hi>Liturgy.</hi> The Priests sung an Anthem to their god

            <p>Which <hi>Episods</hi> the Priests at first mutim'd against as an <hi>Innovation,</hi> they listen'd a long while, thought it ran off from the Text, and wonder'd how it wou'd be appli'd, till at last their patience could hold no longer, and they roar'd out, <note n="c" place="bottom">

            </p>
            <p>After much new-modelling, many changes and alterations, <hi>AEschylus</hi> came with a <hi>second</hi> Actor on the Stage, and lessen'd the business of the <hi>Chorus</hi> proportionably.

            <p>And now it was that (the <hi>men</hi> of <hi>sense</hi> grown weary with discoursing of <hi>Atoms</hi> and <hi>empty Space,</hi> and the <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> of <hi>Mechanical</hi> Philosophy near spent.) <hi>Socrates</hi> set up for <hi>Morality,</hi> and all the buz in <hi>Athens</hi> was now about vertue and good life.</p>

            </p>

For, said they, if the World can scarce be satisfi'd with God Almighty, whose holy will and purposes are not to be <hi>comprehended;</hi> a <hi>Poet</hi> (in these matters) shall never be pardon'd, who (they are sure) is not <hi>incomprehensible;</hi> whose <hi>ways</hi> and <hi>walks</hi> may, without <hi>impiety,</hi> be penetrated and examin'd.

            <p>We have pictures that yield ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort of pleasure, as the <hi>last Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> of <hi>Mich. Angelo,</hi> the <hi>Massacre</hi> of the <hi>Innocents,</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi>'s head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>The Fable is this:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ROllo</hi> and <hi>Otto</hi> Brothers, and both equally (let me call them) Kings of one and the same Kingdom, cannot agree about the matter. <hi>Rollo</hi> (by the means of his favourite <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torch)</hi> attempts to poison his Brother; which failing, he kills <hi>Otto</hi> in the arms of their Mother <hi>Sophia,</hi> with Sword drawn offers to kill his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Sister <hi>Mat.</hi> but is disarm'd by <hi>Aubrey,</hi> yet sends out Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor <hi>Gisbert</hi> to be chopt in two, and thrown to the dogs; and his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Baldwin</hi> also to be beheaded. <hi>Hamond,</hi> Captain of the Guards, saw all this executed. <hi>Allan,</hi> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's Brother gives (his <hi>quondam-</hi>Master) the Chancellor, Christian Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial: for which, he is sent to por. <hi>Edith, Baldwin</hi>'s Daughter, beseeches the King to spare her Father; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, but too late. <hi>Rollo</hi> is in love with her; she resolves his death. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> in revenge of his Brother <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> stabs, and is stab'd by <hi>Rollo,</hi> whose
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65825:18"/>
Sister <hi>Matilda, Aubrey</hi> takes to Wife, and Reigns in his stead.</p>
               <p>Now, if you call this a Fable; give me one of old <hi>AEsop</hi>'s; where, for all the coarse out-side, there dwells a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>reasonable Soul</hi> within, a little <hi>good Sense</hi> at the bottom, which carries it through all Nations, and will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to the end of the World.</p>
               <p>For nothing certainly is design'd in this of <hi>Rollo,</hi> either to move <hi>pitty</hi> or <hi>terror,</hi> either to <hi>delight</hi> or <hi>instruct:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is indeed a History, and it may well be a History; for never man of common <hi>sense</hi> could set himself to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any thing so gross.</p>
               <p>Poetry requires the <hi>ben trovato,</hi> something <hi>handsomely invented,</hi> and leaves the <hi>truth</hi> to History; but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were the Muses profan'd with a more foul, unpleasant, and unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some <hi>truth,</hi> than this which makes the Argument of <hi>Rollo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the <hi>end</hi> of this <hi>Tragedy</hi> is the Marriage and Coronation of <hi>Aubrey,</hi> had one of the ancient Poets been to cultivate this History; They would have laid the right of the Crown in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65825:19"/>
                  <hi>Aubrey.</hi> They would have given us to understand, that <hi>Aubrey</hi>'s Father, a good King, rais'd <hi>Rollo</hi>'s Father from a mean condition to be his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, and have the places of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est trust and confidence with him. This ungrateful Villain most trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherously murders the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, settles himself on his Throne, dies in Peace, leaves the Kingdom equally to his two Sons. These Sons enter upon the Government, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple swear Allegiance to 'em, Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them with Addresses from all Countreys; the Air rings with <hi>Vive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le-Roy's</hi> and Acclamations. The Sun shines as it was wont, the Grass grows, Cows give white Milk, and no <hi>AEgyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Plague troubles the Land. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven has forgot, and human means appear none, for either revenging the murder'd King, or restoring his Son <hi>Aubrey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now is the time for a Poet to shew his cunning. Now he must bring a sudden and terrible judgment to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the <hi>Rollian-</hi>Race, and set young <hi>Aubrey</hi> on the Throne of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65825:19"/>
To effect this, the two Brothers must be made to kill each other; and, as a consequence of this disaster, their Mother is to kill her self for sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
               <p>These Brothers, in their character, would have been harmless men, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest enough, and loving each other tenderly: for had they been wicked, the judgment upon them might be apply'd as due to their own crimes. Or however their Fathers crime in it self would have appear'd less, as not enough alone to deserve that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; and if the occasion was not clear, the punishment would be less regarded; but their innocence makes the punishment more signal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and more discovers the work of Heaven. And thus also they are capable of moving pitty, when only their Father's crime pursues them; and it seems likely that, other wise, they might have liv'd happily together.</p>
               <p>Their Sister <hi>Matilda</hi> must have been a vertuous sweet Lady, every way of singular merit, sensible of her
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65825:20"/>
Father's crime, and of the wrong that <hi>Aubrey</hi> suffers. By this character, all those who had <hi>pittied</hi> her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, would have been extremely sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd to see their Sister so well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd in the Marriage with <hi>Aubrey;</hi> for Heaven, by this, would seem, in her, to make some amends for the hard measure to the unfortunate Bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aubrey</hi> should in all his words and actions appear great, promising, and Kingly, to deserve that care which Heaven manifests so wonderfully in his Restoration.</p>
               <p>And because this, of the two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers killing each other, is an action <hi>morally</hi> unnatural; therefore, by way of <hi>preparation,</hi> the <hi>Tragedy</hi> would have begun with Heaven and Earth in disorder, <hi>nature</hi> troubl'd, unheard of <hi>prodigies;</hi> something (if I may so say) <hi>physically</hi> unnatural, and against the ordinary course of nature. Perhaps the first <hi>Scene</hi> would have shew'd the Usurper's <hi>Ghost</hi> from Hell, full of horror for his crime, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his Sons, and sending some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal <hi>fury</hi> amongst them.</p>
               <p>

And, by the way, he might relate all things fit to be known, which past out of the <hi>Drama.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The nicety in writing upon this <hi>Fable,</hi> would have chiefly been in the <hi>characters</hi> of the two Brothers, These are the persons kill'd, and, of all things, a Poet must be tender of a mans life, and never <hi>sacrifice</hi> it to his <hi>Maggot</hi> and <hi>Capriccio.</hi> Therefore, as (I said) the Brothers were not to be <hi>wicked,</hi> so likewise they ought not to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely innocent. For if they had refused to succeed their Father, and when they might have sat on the Throne, have humbled themselves at <hi>Aubrey</hi>'s feet; then no <hi>Poetical Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> could have touch'd them: guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they were to be, in enjoying their Father's crime; but not of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any new. And this guilt of theirs was also either to be palliated, or else to be past over in silence, lest, laid too open, the compassion of the Audience might be abated. Neither would it suffice that these Brothers kill each other by some chance; but it should appear, that agitated by their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65825:21"/>

               <p>If the <hi>English Theatre</hi> requires more <hi>intrigue,</hi> an Author may mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply the <hi>Incidents,</hi> may add <hi>Episods,</hi> and <hi>thicken</hi> the <hi>Plot,</hi> as he sees oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion; provided that all the <hi>lines</hi> tend to the same <hi>center:</hi> more of a main <hi>Plot, Virgil</hi> requir'd not for his <hi>Epic</hi> Poem.</p>
               <p>And peradventure, if the Poet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign any certain <hi>sense</hi> by his <hi>Fable,</hi> that sense will bind him to the <hi>unity</hi> of <hi>action;</hi> and the <hi>unity</hi> of <hi>action</hi> cannot well exceed the rule for <hi>time.</hi> And these two <hi>unities</hi> will not permit that the Poet can far transgress in the <hi>third.</hi> So that all the <hi>regularities</hi> seem in a manner to be link'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but begin with an absurdity, and nothing reasonable can ever fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.

               <p>To return to this <hi>Tragedy</hi> of <hi>Rollo,</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:65825:21"/>
if the stress of the design rests not on <hi>Aubrey;</hi> but the sense of all <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates</hi> in <hi>Rollo.</hi> The sense must be this; <hi>He that sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed.</hi> And if this be all, where's the Wonder? Have we not every day cried in the Streets, instances of God's <hi>revenge</hi> against <hi>murder,</hi> more extraordinary, and more poetical than all this comes to? If this be Poetry, <hi>Tyburn</hi> is a better and more ingenious <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Vertue,</hi> than the <hi>Theatre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In former times <hi>Poetry</hi> was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing than <hi>History,</hi> or than the <hi>Law</hi> of the Land. <hi>Poetry</hi> disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd crimes, the <hi>Law</hi> could never find out; and punish'd those the <hi>Law</hi> had acquitted. The <hi>Areopagus</hi> clear'd <hi>Orestes,</hi> but with what <hi>Furies</hi> did the <hi>Poets</hi> haunt and torment him? and what a wretch made they of <hi>Oedipus,</hi> when the <hi>Casuist</hi> excus'd his <hi>invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible</hi> ignorance?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Poets</hi> consider'd, that natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men were affected with <hi>pitty,</hi> when they saw others suffer more than their fault deserv'd; and <hi>vice,</hi> they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65825:22"/>
thought, could never be painted too ugly and frightful; therefore, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would move <hi>pitty,</hi> or make <hi>vice</hi> detested, it concern'd them to be somewhat of the severest in the punishments they inflicted. Now, because their hands were tied, that they could not punish beyond such a degree; they were oblig'd to have a strict eye on their Malefactor, that he transgrest not too far, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not <hi>two</hi> crimes, when but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsible for <hi>one:</hi> nor, indeed, be so far guilty, as by the Law to deserve death. For though <hi>historical Iustice</hi> might rest there; yet <hi>poetical Iustice</hi> could not be so content. It would require that the satisfaction be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and full, e're the <hi>Malefactor</hi> goes off the <hi>Stage,</hi> and nothing left to God Almighty, and another World. Nor will it suffer that the Spectators trust the <hi>Poet</hi> for a <hi>Hell</hi> behind the <hi>Scenes;</hi> the fire must roar in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the <hi>Criminal,</hi> the <hi>fiends</hi> and <hi>furies</hi> be conjur'd up to their faces, with a world of <hi>machine</hi> and horrid spectacles; and yet the <hi>Criminal</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:65825:22"/>
could never move <hi>pitty.</hi> Therefore amongst the <hi>Ancients</hi> we find no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors of this kind; a wilful Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer is with them as strange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, as a <hi>Paricide</hi> to the old <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> Yet need we not fancy that they were squeamish, or unacquainted with any of these great <hi>lumping</hi> crimes in that age; when we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their <hi>Oedipus, Orestes,</hi> or <hi>Medea.</hi> But they took care to wash the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to cleanse away the venom, and with such art to prepare the morsel: they made it all Junket to the tast, and all Physick in the operation.</p>
               <p>They so qualifi'd, so allaid, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the <hi>crime</hi> with circumstances, that little could appear on the <hi>Stage,</hi> but either the causes and provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before it, or the remorse and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence, the despairs and horrors of conscience which follow'd, to make the <hi>Criminal</hi> every way a fit object for <hi>pitty.</hi> Nor can we imagin their Stage so rarely endur'd any blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and that the sight was displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, because the Spectators were some sort of effeminate, unfighting
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65825:23"/>
fellows. When we remember the Battels of <hi>Marathon</hi> and <hi>Salamin;</hi> and with what small number these very Spectators had routed <hi>Xerxes</hi> and the greatest Armies in the World. For now it was that the <hi>arms</hi> of the <hi>Athenians</hi> (as well as their <hi>arts)</hi> shin'd in their greatest glory.</p>
               <p>The truth is, the <hi>Poets</hi> were to move pitty; and this pitty was to be mov'd for the living, who remain'd; and not for the dead. And they found in nature, that men could not so easily pardon a crime committed before their faces; and consequently could not be so easily dispos'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow that pitty on the <hi>Criminal</hi> which the Poets labour'd for. The Poets, I say, found that the sight of the fact made so strong an impression, as no art of theirs could afterwards ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conquer.</p>
               <p>But leave reasoning, and return to <hi>Rollo;</hi> it seems very odd to see the first four <hi>Scenes</hi> pass as if nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary were towards, without any preparation; and immediately, without more ado, the two Brothers,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65825:23"/>
two Kings, are a fighting. The <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients</hi> would have made the Earth tremble, and the Sun start out of the Firmament at a sight so unnatural. Yet we make no more of them, but turn them out, like two Cocks of the Game, for the diversion of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Some have remark'd, that <hi>Athens</hi> being a <hi>Democracy,</hi> the Poets, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their Government, expos'd Kings, and made them unfortunate. But certainly, examin the Kings of their <hi>Tragedies,</hi> they appear all <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes,</hi> and ours but <hi>Dogs,</hi> in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of them. So respectful they seem to Kings in their <hi>Democracy,</hi> and so unthinking and unpolitick are our <hi>Poets</hi> under a <hi>Monarchy. Thebes</hi> was always enemy to <hi>Athens,</hi> yet would not any <hi>National</hi> pique, nor other, provoke the Poets to treat those Kings unhandsomly; because by their rules to have lessen'd the Kings, would have made their <hi>Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> of no effect, in moving the pitty intended by them. They made the Kings <hi>unfortunate,</hi> we make them
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65825:24"/>
                  <hi>wicked:</hi> they made them to be <hi>pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied,</hi> we make them to be <hi>curst</hi> and <hi>abhorr'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That I may, in all hitherto laid down, be the better understood, let it be observ'd what measures <hi>Euripides</hi> took in the Tragedy of <hi>Etheocles</hi> and <hi>Polynices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This instance I choose, the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those <hi>Theban</hi> Kings being the neerest to this of <hi>Rollo</hi> and <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:</hi> for they also were equally Kings, could not agree, kill'd each other. That we might not suspect that the dissention between them rose from any malice of their own, we are let to know, that the Gods owe a vengeance to <hi>Thebes,</hi> which is now ripe, and ready to fall upon them, for a crime of their Founder <hi>Cadmus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That their Grandfather <hi>Laius</hi> warn'd by the <hi>Oracle</hi> not to marry, his Marriage had so incens'd the Gods, that now they were punishing his disobedience on the third genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>That their Father <hi>Oedipus</hi> had curst them, and praid they might dye by each others hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:65825:24"/>
These Brothers, to avoid their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's <hi>curse,</hi> agree, not to live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but to Reign by the year alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, and each to be King in his turn. According to this agreement, the younger Brother goes into banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where he marries, makes Allies of some <hi>hot-headed</hi> Princes, as <hi>Tydeus, Capaneus,</hi> and five more, and brings a Consederate Army before <hi>Thebes.</hi> The Brothers have an enterview; <hi>Polynices</hi> demands his <hi>turn; Etheo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> answers to this effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now, whilst I may continne a King, I cannot willingly yield to become a Servant. Neither take you a right course, coming with force of Arms, and laying the Countrey wast.</hi> Thebes <hi>would blush, should I resign my Scepter for fear of the</hi> Mycenaean <hi>spears.

               <p>This haughty speech of <hi>Etheocles</hi> turns all the current of pitty to his Brother's side. Now the Confederates
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65825:25"/>
fall on to storm the Town, are repuls'd, with great slaughter on both sides. <hi>Etheocles,</hi> notwithstanding he was the King in possession, notwithstanding he knew (by <hi>Tyresias</hi> the Prophet) that the <hi>Thebans</hi> would be <hi>victorious,</hi> and notwithstanding the danger of his Father's <hi>curse;</hi> yet out of his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity and humanity to save the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of innocent blood; offers the single Combat with his Brother; which accepted, both are kill'd, and dye friends. <hi>Etheocles</hi> could not speak, indeed, but his sighs were all tenderness.

               <p>By what I have noted one might think the Poet would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that all the Furies in Hell were broke loose and at work to make these two Brothers miserable, and consequently would have us take
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65825:26"/>
their part, would engage our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and carry our heart along with a sense of their sufferings: Heaven and Earth conspire their ruine.
<q>Quid meus <hi>AEneas</hi> in te committere tantum?</q>
               </p>
               <p>What had they done to deserve this persecution? the curse of their Father lay nearest them, and is most insisted on by the Poet, how had they vexed their Father? their Father transported with the sense of his own horrible misfortunes, tore out his own Eyes, and in that condition would have run about the streets, but these two Sons of his kept him within doors by force, this enrag'd him the more, and he threw his curses about him, which some evil spirits (who haunted the house for some old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts) gladly lay hold on, and never rested till those curses had their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>By what has been observ'd any one may judge whether these <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters</hi> of <hi>Etheocles</hi> and <hi>Polynices,</hi> or those of <hi>Rollo</hi> and <hi>Otto</hi> be the better contrived for moving that pity which
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65825:27"/>
                  <hi>Tragedy</hi> requires. And I have been the more particular, because not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Rollo,</hi> but most of the <hi>Characters</hi> in our Tragedies of the last Age, may be examin'd by the same reason. And yet <hi>Eurypides</hi> has been blam'd for making his Characters more <hi>wicked</hi> then they ought to be in <hi>Tragedy:</hi> he was not taxed by <hi>Aristophanes</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> only, but by <hi>Sophocles,</hi> and the general sense of <hi>Athens</hi> was against him. They said, in those days, that Comedy (whose Province was humor and ridiculous matter on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) was to represent things worse then the truth. History to describe the truth, but Tragedy was to invent things better then the truth. Like good Painters they must design their Images like the Life, but yet better and more beautiful then the Life. The Malefactor of Tragedy must be a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort of Malefactor then those that live in the present Age. For an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate impudent and impenitent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor can neither move compassion nor terror; nor be of any imaginable use in <hi>Tragedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:65825:27"/>
See we then <hi>Rollo,</hi> fighting with his own Brother and King, equal to himself, and attempting to poyson him, without any remorse; killing him in their mothers arms, without any provocation; calling the Queen their Mother <hi>Belldam,</hi> and with drawn sword threatning to kill both her and his Sister, without any sense of honour or piety; and must we not imagine a Legion of Devils in his belly. When <hi>Rollo</hi> has murder'd his Brother, he stands condemn'd by the Laws of Poetry; and nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but that the Poet see him exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and the Poet is to answer for all the mischief committed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. But <hi>Rollo</hi> we find has made his escape, and wo be to the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, to the Schoolmaster, and the Chancellors Man; for those are to be men of this world no longer. Here is like to be <hi>Poetical Iustice,</hi> so many lives taken away, and but the life of one guilty person to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for all, and is not this a strange method of killing? If the <hi>Planets</hi> had contriv'd him for a <hi>Cock</hi> of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, his first Victory should not have
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65825:28"/>
been the most important, he should first have praictis'd on his subjects, and have risen by degrees to the height of iniquity. His Brother So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign was his top-murder; nothing remain'd after that, unless it were his Lady-Mother.</p>
               <p>Neither is <hi>Otto</hi> here a much more taking Gentleman, nothing appears in his <hi>Cue</hi> to move pity, or any way make the Audience of his party.</p>
               <p>But of all the world who would ever have expected that <hi>Aubrey</hi> is to succeed in the Kingship? 'Tis a good man, but the dullest good man that ever Poor advanc'd to a Throne by such extraordinary means. Some Dreams or old Prophesie should have begun an expectation in us; or some <hi>Lambent-fires</hi> incircling his head, have drawn the peoples eyes upon him. <hi>Rollo</hi> and <hi>Otto</hi> must both make untimely ends, to make way for <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brey.</hi> So strange a Revolution never happens in Poetry, but either Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Earth gives some sorenotice of it.</p>

However, something shining and extraordinary ought to have appear'd in his <hi>Character.</hi> Indeed he parts <hi>Rollo</hi> and <hi>Otto</hi> fighting, and <hi>Rollo</hi> was once disarm'd by him. But then for decencies sake and <hi>Rollo's</hi> credit, he should have been lookt on as something more then a meer Subject. In all the rest he appears an humble endeavourer, speaks honestly to no purpose, is brav'd and abus'd by Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals. Whereas each step of his should have been attended with such awe and Majesty, that the spectators, if not guess, might at least wish to see him their Soveraign; and have the pleasure to see their wishes suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful.</p>

                  <hi>Gisbert</hi> and <hi>Baldwin,</hi> Chancellor and Tutor are <hi>Devota Capita,</hi> only come on the <hi>Stage</hi> to make <hi>Rollo</hi> the greater sinner by their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Further to shew his rage against the Chancellor, says <hi>Rollo,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Captain, besides remember this in chief,</l>
                     <l>That being executed, you deny,</l>

To all his Friends the rites of Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</l>
                     <l>And cast his Carkass out to Dogs and Fowls.</l>

               </p>
               <p>No reason here is given for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity.</p>
               <p>On the like occasion <hi>Sophocles</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd a Tragedy, the <hi>Plot</hi> is this. By the death of <hi>Etheocles</hi> and <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nices, Creon</hi> King of <hi>Thebes</hi> made an Edict, that none, upon pain of being buried alive, should presume to give burial to <hi>Polynices,</hi> the reasons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended are, That <hi>Polynices</hi> had brought Forreigners to invade his Country, and <hi>Etheocles</hi> had dyed in his Countreys defence, and therefore it would be unjust to give to both the same honour of Funeral. He further alledges a charge left by <hi>Etheocles</hi> to the same effect. Now the piety of <hi>Antigone</hi> could not digest so hard a Law, but in the night she goes and covers her Brother with earth, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Watch, and <hi>(Creon</hi> being deaf to all intercession) is sent to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. When the Bishop <hi>Tyresias</hi> reproving <hi>Creon</hi> strikes him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65825:29"/>
who thereupon runs himself to reprieve her, hears from her Tomb the last groans of his only Son <hi>Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> who he finds had stabb'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and lay a dying at the feet of <hi>Antigone,</hi> his dead Mistress. This disaster brought the same violent Fate on the Queen <hi>Eurydice,</hi> and with her depriv'd <hi>Creon</hi> of all that could be dear to him in the world.</p>
               <p>In this we have every thing <hi>just,</hi> every thing <hi>surprizing,</hi> every thing <hi>passionate</hi> to extremity.</p>
               <p>Whereas in <hi>Rollo</hi> we meet with so much stuff lumberd together, that not the least spring can work, nor the least passion stir, that is pleasant or generous; nor the least proportion or beauty of Tragedy appear. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> says that an Image drawn with Chalk in the exact shape and symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, will please more then a whole potful of the best Colours thrown upon a wall without any figure or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</p>
               <p>But to proceed with the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cterrs. <hi>Sophia</hi> at the first appears a woman of spirit, in opposing so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently the division of the Dukedom.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65825:30"/>
But she ill maintains this Character; when <hi>Rollo</hi> in her presence murders his Brother, threatens both her and her Daughter, she very tamely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts the Daughter to a vile com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, says she

                     <l>Least what he may not, he enforce the rather.</l>
                     <l>Is this all you command us?</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>She ought surely in another sort of tone to have resented this outrage, or before to have manifested a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality for <hi>Rollo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At his death History informs us she died of grief. 'Tis a wonder this Tragedy spares her; hers would have been a more decent and Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal death then any of the rest. In this the History is the better Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy.</p>
               <p>The Princess <hi>Matilda</hi> for the small part she bears, acquits her self brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough. Yet, methinks, <hi>Aubrey</hi> and she should have exchang'd some words; some glances have been cast, or otherways some approaches have
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65825:30"/>
been begun. For here there scarce go three words to the bargain. In the last lines of the Play he comes to this Lady as abruptly as to the <hi>Dukedom,</hi> both drop into his mouth.</p>
               <p>In Edith these waylings, clingings, and beseechings; these showers of tears and words.
<q>

                     <l>Be as a god then full of saving pity,</l>
                     <l>Mercy, O Mercy Sir, for his sake Mercy,</l>
                     <l>That when your stout heart weeps, shall give you pity.</l>

               </p>
               <p>This sort of importunity is nothing so proper in this place, it might much better become <hi>Comedy,</hi> where Miss <hi>La Fool</hi> intercedes for little Dog or Moncky, in peril for some misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; something more of stomach and courage had suited her better. Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy requires not what is only Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, but what is great in Nature, and such thoughts as quality and Court-education might inspire. She might indeed be surpriz'd, and at the first let the meer Natural woman es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape

a little, but one or two so harsh and barbarous repulses should have rouz'd that Tragical spirit so vilely prostituted, and made her reflect on the other bloody scenes, so lately acted before her eyes, and caus'd her to despair before she had troubl'd us with her endless impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               <p>Nor indeed comes short of her for tongue and wind, the old <hi>Dutchess,</hi> when in all reason one might expect that so violent grief and passions would choak them; they run chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, as if the concern were no more then a <hi>gossiping:</hi> theirs are not of the old cut, <hi>Curae leves loquuntur ingentes stupent.</hi>

When that scene presents her full of dire design and bloody purpose, we then indeed have her concise in word, and <hi>Laco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> in the <hi>repartee.</hi> To the first Complement she answers.

               <p>Is it likely that a Lady in her cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances could be sensible what a pretty lisping way he had with him; or could listen to the soft things he spoke, or answer him so lightly? is not this more like some <hi>Minx</hi> in an Alley, then any Character for Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy? There are in Women comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal frailties, and heroick frailties: and several considerations might have made her resolution stagger; but this of the <hi>tempting tongue</hi> is <hi>Comedy</hi> out of season.</p>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65825:32"/>
the Sun; and no body knows who 'tis does manage him.</p>
               <p>'Tis possible that a Prince may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon himself to be rul'd by some busie creature of no consideration. The <hi>Annals</hi> of <hi>Normandy</hi> may men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion such <hi>Dukes.</hi>

               <p>In the third <hi>Act</hi> enters <hi>Hamond,</hi> Captain of the Guard, and is a nimble Executioner; and who would guess this the Man ordain'd to kill the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon. But whether in Poetry this job more properly belong'd to <hi>Edith,</hi> or to this <hi>Hamond,</hi> may be a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
               <p>In the first place 'tis resolv'd that to neither of them did it belong, but that (of the two) <hi>Edith</hi> might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have kill'd <hi>Rollo,</hi> the following reasons may prove, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To <hi>Edith</hi> the provocation was greater; a Father engaging our Piety more strongly then a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:65825:33"/>
2. <hi>Hamond</hi> holding a place of trust, had a stricter tye upon him: and <hi>Edith</hi> lying under no such obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the fact in her would not have been subject to so many aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. She, as a woman, might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd not so well to understand Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, and to distinguish how far her Piety was to be restrain'd by it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As in her sex reason is said to be more feeble, so the Passions are suppos'd to be the more violent and precipitate.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The punishment had been more signal and more grievous to the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, dying by the hand of a woman, and a woman to whom he was making love.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By a woman the fact would have been more surprising and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary; and greater would have been the wonder, which a Poet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways endeavours for, when it clashes not with probability.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Baldwin</hi> was of better quality then <hi>Allan.</hi> For though the Maid might be content enough to be rob'd of her revenge; yet what would her

               <p>But what a pother makes the old <hi>Dutchess?</hi> never <hi>French</hi> Author hash'd and kickshaw'd a little sense into so many words that signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65825:35"/>
She manages as if she were to hold forth by the glass: Had her passion after the first three words burst out at her eyes, had she wept and torn her hair, her <hi>Rhetorick</hi> had been more moving, and better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, and she had acquitted her self Heroickly: But she falls off immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, as if she had bolted out some rash thing at first, and was afraid of being ta'ne at her word; her tongue runs over her passion, and steals into matters that lean another way, and she talks as if she would talk the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of her first words quite out of the hearers heads again. After the three first words she flies from the only thought that was proper, high enough, and proportionable to her passion: she is for being split in as many pieces as there are <hi>Villages</hi> in <hi>Normandy;</hi> which expression scatters the thought, breaks the resemblance and carries all remote from the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and must in effect move but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry indifferently. From thence she plunges into such impertinent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent wild <hi>jargon</hi> as is obvious to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65825:36"/>
any man. That of the Diamond is a good thought in it self; but in this place comes very cold from her mouth, 'tis no more than if she had said, <hi>Divide the Dukedom, divide me first, nay divide a Diamond,</hi> &amp;c. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in a great passion none have leisure to ramble for comparisons, much less to compute the value of Diamonds whole or broken.</p>
               <p>I question not the <hi>Grammar,</hi> nor how Poetical the stile is, I rest in the sense, nor had yet been so particular, but that I take all this Tragedy to be of the same <hi>piece</hi> for the writing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less that scene of the <hi>Astrologers;</hi> and the Comical part, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more diverting.</p>

Our Authors we see, never make use of the advantage which that <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>median</hi> envy'd so much in Tragedy. This Title gives no more light into the design, then had they call'd it <hi>Hocus Pocus;</hi> and indeed the name seems rather to promise a <hi>Comedy,</hi> and one might expect some sort of <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamouchy</hi> King, or Cozen of <hi>Duke Trinckelo's</hi> for the Heroe of the Play.</p>
               <p>The Plot is this:</p>
               <p>The Queen of <hi>Iberia, Arane,</hi> had feign'd her self with child, and made use of <hi>Gobrias</hi>'s Son to carry out the cheat. She afterwards proves truly with child, which came to be <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,</hi> durst not discover the first cheat, so that <hi>Arbaces (Gobria's</hi> Son) became actually King, is made really so by marrying <hi>Panthea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The rest is all <hi>Episode.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Fable appears some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, shape, and (at the first sight) an <hi>outside</hi> fair enough, yet at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom we hardly find what is more choice, or more <hi>exquisite</hi> and more
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65825:38"/>
                  <hi>perfect</hi> than History. By the <hi>turn</hi> of the <hi>Plot,</hi> if we look on <hi>Arane,</hi> this Play might have been call'd <hi>The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver Deceiv'd,</hi> if we look on <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baces,</hi> the title might have been <hi>The Fortunate Impostor, The lucky Sham,</hi> or something of that kind; which shows a want of that <hi>good sense</hi> in it which Tragedy requires.</p>
               <p>There might have been feigned some right to the Crown long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested between the two Families; (as ours of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster)</hi> and bloody civil war ready to break out; when unexpectedly all grew husht and ended in a marriage; which (by a train long laid by <hi>Gobrias)</hi> took ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. This marriage should not have seem'd so advantageous to the false King, and his Father who brought it about; but by manifest reasons of <hi>state</hi> appear'd absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the good of the Kingdom, and above all things, desired and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd for by the relations of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas on the contrary, we find the Queen Mother attempting to poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65825:38"/>
this usurper, and see no reason to blame her endeavours.</p>
               <p>What sets this <hi>Fable</hi> below Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, are many <hi>improbabilities,</hi> and those of the worst sort; because they contribute nothing to the wonder. What more improbable, than that the Mother whose business it was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive the death of the Impostor, should never caution or inform her only Daughter, who had the right to the Crown, that <hi>Arbaces</hi> was none of her Brother, but her vassal, and so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct her love for him?</p>
               <p>Nor is it likely that <hi>Gobrias</hi> should not have reserv'd some means to let his Son know the secret, that his Sons conduct and addresses to gain the Princess, might have been fashion'd accordingly.</p>
               <p>The Characters are all <hi>improbable</hi> and <hi>unproper</hi> in the highest degree, besides that both these, their actions and all the <hi>lines</hi> of the Play run so wide from the <hi>Plot,</hi> that scarce ought could be imagin'd more contrary.</p>
               <p>We blunder along without the least streak of light, till in the <hi>last act</hi> we
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65825:39"/>
stumble on the <hi>Plot,</hi> lying all in a lump together; neither any tolerable direction to guide us thither; nor ought ingenious, just, or reasonable, that carries us from thence.</p>
               <p>What find we in the Son of <hi>Gobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> that he must have the Princess and the Kingdom for her portion, save only that the Knave his Father will have it so?</p>
               <p>Take his picture sent before him, and drawn by a friend.<hi>—He is vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious, and humble, and angry, and patient, and merry, and dull, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and sorrowful, in extremity in an hour—</hi>Should we find underwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>This is a King,</hi> yet could not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son give way to our belief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Tragedy</hi> are all Kings by the Poets <hi>Election,</hi> and if such as these must be elected, certainly no <hi>Polish</hi> Diet would ever suffer Poet to have a voice in choosing a King for them. Nor will it serve that <hi>Arbaces</hi> is not truly a King, for he is actually such, and intended for a true and rightful King before the Poet has done with him, what wants in Birth
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65825:39"/>
the Poet should make up in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, every one is to consent and wish him King, because the Poet designs him for one, 'tis (besides) observ'd that Usurpers generally take care to deserve by their conduct what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd them by right.</p>
               <p>We are to presume the greatest ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, where we find the highest of rewards; and though it is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that all <hi>Heroes</hi> should be Kings, yet undoubtedly all crown'd heads by <hi>Poetical right</hi> are <hi>Heroes.</hi> This Character is a flower, a prerogative, so certain, so inseparably annex'd to the <hi>Crown,</hi> as by no Poet, no <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of Poets, ever to be invaded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arbaces</hi> indeed is of a different mould, he no sooner comes on the Stage, but lays about him with his tongue at so nauseous a rate, Captain <hi>Bessus</hi> is all Modesty to him, to mend the matter his friend shaking an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty skull, says <hi>'Tis pity that valour should be thus drunk.</hi> Had he been content to brag only amongst his own Vassals, the fault might be more sufferable, but the King of <hi>Armenia</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:65825:40"/>
is his prisoner, he must bear the load of all; he must be swagger'd at, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted over, and trampl'd on without any provocation. We have a <hi>Scene</hi> of his sufferings in each <hi>Act</hi> of the Play: <hi>Bajazet</hi> in the <hi>Cage</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so carried about, or felt half the barbarous indignities which are thrown on this unfortunate Prince by our monster of a King.</p>
               <p>If the Poet would teach that victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry makes a man insolent; he must at the same time make victory blush, and fly to the other side; as a just punishment for him that had abused her favours.</p>

               <p>These speeches, drawing his Sword at the Queen-Mother, and the other outrages, make the sum of our <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi> vertues, and neither worse nor better find we throughout his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. <hi>Arbaces</hi> should have been consider'd in a double capacity; he should have been endu'd with all the greatness of mind, and <hi>generosity</hi> of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65825:41"/>
a King, and also with the <hi>modesty</hi> of a Subject. The want of which, is a great aggravation of his fauls; for his carriage towards the Royal Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, towards the Queen-Mother, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Princess, as he was a King, were insupportable, as <hi>no King,</hi> it was all abominable. History sometimes takes notice of a certain <hi>instinct</hi> which has strangely hinder'd many unnatural actions. A Poet, I am sure, ought always to have that <hi>instinct,</hi> or some good <hi>genius</hi> ready to serve his <hi>Heroe</hi> upon occasion, to prevent these unpleasant <hi>shocking</hi> indecencies, which otherwise might happen. This <hi>instinct</hi> should in <hi>Arbaces</hi> have begot a respect to his Father <hi>Gobrias,</hi> and have humbl'd him in the presence of such as were truly of the <hi>Blood Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And far from <hi>decorum</hi> is it, that we find the King <hi>drolling</hi> and quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with <hi>Bessus</hi> and his Buffoons, and worse, that they should presume to break their little jests upon him.</p>
               <p>This too is <hi>natural,</hi> some will say. There are in nature many things
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65825:41"/>
which <hi>Historians</hi> are asham'd to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as below the dignity of an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story: Shall we then suffer a <hi>Tom Coriat</hi> in <hi>Poetry?</hi> Shall we on the most important day of a King's Reign, and at Court be content with such entertainment as is not above a Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's shop?

So that if <hi>instinct</hi> guided their love, as lawful and warrantable; it may be answer'd, that the same <hi>iustinct</hi> should have prevented that love, as insolent and presumptuous in <hi>Arbaces,</hi> base and unbecoming in <hi>Panthea.</hi> For whether a Lady may better marry her Brother, or her Groom, is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion more easily decided in Divinity, than in Poetry.</p>
               <p>We are let to know that the Queen-Mother was for removing the Usurper by poison, and for bringing all into the right channel agen. This we might expect to be a Woman <hi>coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,</hi> and truly <hi>Tragical:</hi> yet we find her the veriest <hi>patient Grissel</hi> that ever had lain by a Monarch's side. She comes but thrice on the Stage; the first time she is rebuk'd by <hi>Gobrias,</hi> with the same language that the <hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>Newgate</hi> might dispence to some <hi>sinner</hi> forlorn; then she is on
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65825:44"/>
her <hi>mary-bones</hi> to the Impostor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reluctancy. Lastly, when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd with a drawn Sword, and words more cutting, the proudest rant she could be rais'd to, was:<hi>—Fire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume me if ever I was a Whore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If nothing else in the character of <hi>Arbaces,</hi> the drawing his <hi>Sword</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a <hi>Woman,</hi> was enough in Poetry to damn him. After that <hi>outrage,</hi> he could make no pretensions to ought that is good or honourable.</p>
               <p>On this occasion memorable is that passage in <hi>Virgil,</hi> where <hi>AEneas</hi> after having related, how the Town on fire about his ears,—on the sudden awak'd from his sleep,—flung headlong by rage and despair,—forsaken by his reason,—his friends slaughter'd about him,—the King <hi>Priam</hi> murder'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his face:—when he spies the cause of all this, <hi>Hellen,</hi> skulking in a corner—at the sight of her.

All which, with what follows, comes to no more, than had he said;—In that nick of time I even made a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion within my self, whether I was not to take revenge on her; to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of madness had my troubles wrought me.
<q>Talia jactabam, &amp; furiata mente ferebar.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now here, this revenge goes no farther than his thoughts; these thoughts<hi>—AEneas</hi> himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns, and calls them madness; and is also sharply reprov'd for them by his <hi>Guardian Angel,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>No man but <hi>Virgil</hi> could ever pen any thing with that infinite care and caution as is this particular passage. One might think <hi>Virgil</hi> foresaw what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever could be objected; and provided against all scruples.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:65825:45"/>
Yet of such a nice tast were the <hi>Criticks</hi> in that <hi>age</hi> of <hi>good sense;</hi> that <hi>Varus</hi> and <hi>Tucca</hi> struck out all the 22 Verses which contain this passage. These were employ'd by <hi>Augustus</hi> to inspect what (by the untimely death of <hi>Virgil)</hi> might have been left im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and they durst not suffer these 22 lines to pass, though essential to the Poem; so tender they were, lest their <hi>Heroe</hi> might lye under a suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of transgressing in any <hi>punctilio</hi> of that nature.</p>
               <p>We need not make a controversy whether <hi>Virgil</hi> or his <hi>Criticks</hi> be in the right: But if <hi>Virgil</hi> will not in a man allow the <hi>thought</hi> of striking a Woman in any circumstances, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he condemns himself for that <hi>thought.</hi> And if his <hi>Criticks</hi> will not permit a <hi>thought</hi> of that kind with any <hi>qualifications</hi> whatsoever; then we may well conclude, that <hi>Poetry</hi> to be very <hi>gross,</hi> where the <hi>men</hi> both think, and speak, and act their <hi>cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> against <hi>Women,</hi> without any shame or restraint.</p>

But <hi>Arbaces,</hi> though mad, and flash'd upon by never so great a <hi>hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> of provacations, was not to be allow'd to think of striking; because the Womans <hi>quality</hi> was above his, and made her sacred. Neither in this point is there a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt an <hi>Epick</hi> Poem and a <hi>Tragedy;</hi> when the conclusion of both is <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As here, <hi>AEneas,</hi> a King, of great merit, by the assistance of Heaven, and his friends, after much labour, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <hi>Lavinia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Arbaces,</hi> no King, of no merit, without friends in Heaven, or on the Earth; without any trouble weds his King's only Daughter, and the Kingdom of <hi>Iberia</hi> is her portion.</p>
               <p>I know with the Ancients, <hi>Orestes</hi> kill'd his Mother, <hi>Hercules</hi> his Wife and Children, <hi>Agamemnon</hi> his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But the first was an act of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice;</hi> the second of <hi>Frenzy;</hi> the last of <hi>Religion.</hi> But these were all Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies unhappy in the <hi>catastrophe.</hi> And the business so well prepar'd; that every one might see, that these
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65825:46"/>
Worthies had rather have laid violent hands on themselves, had not their <hi>will</hi> and choice been over-rul'd. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry step they made, appear'd so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their inclinations, as all the while shew'd them unhappy, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd them the most <hi>deserving</hi> of pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the World.</p>
               <p>Another <hi>Canker</hi> in the heart of this <hi>Tragedy,</hi> is the incestuous love (for such it appears) between <hi>Arba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>Panthea,</hi> I mean, the <hi>conduct</hi> of it. When any <hi>design</hi> on the <hi>Stage</hi> is in agitation, the Poet must take care that he engage the affections, take along the heart, and secure the good will of the Audience. If the <hi>design</hi> be wicked, as here the making approaches towards an <hi>incestuous</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment; the <hi>Audience</hi> will <hi>naturally</hi> loath and detest it, rather than favour or accompany it with their good wishes. 'Tis the sad effects and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of an ill <hi>design</hi> which the <hi>Audience</hi> love to have represented: 'tis then that the <hi>penitence, remorse</hi> and <hi>despairs</hi> move us: 'tis then that we grieve with the sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65825:47"/>
and weep with those that weep.</p>
               <p>Therefore were the Ancients to make an <hi>incestuous</hi> love their subject; they would <hi>take</hi> it in the <hi>fall,</hi> as it rowls down headlong to desperation and misery.</p>
               <p>Many in the <hi>World</hi> for their interest may comply and help forward the <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances</hi> towards an ill action; but on the <hi>Stage</hi> there is no kindred nor fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy lucre to biass the <hi>Audience,</hi> or make them partial to the evil-doer. If the Poet observe not these mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, the <hi>working up of a Scene,</hi> is plainly the tormenting of nature, and holding our ears to the <hi>Grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For an incestuous love, famous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Ancients, was the <hi>tale</hi> of <hi>Macareus</hi> and <hi>Canace.</hi> In the list of those Tragedies wherein <hi>Nero</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to be an <hi>Actor, Suetonius</hi> reckons <hi>Canace parturiens.</hi> The ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle may satisfy us, that all the soft things, all the amours, the flowers and <hi>fleurets</hi> were over, e're the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders entred on the <hi>Stage.</hi>

               <p>By the rule of the Antients no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, no sophistry or ribaldry's, were us'd to lessen a crime before it was committed: for then their Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick could have no good effect, but must have <hi>grated</hi> on the hearers pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.

                  <hi>Phedra</hi> is in fear, makes scruples, asks questions; which the Nurse evades, and tells her, <hi>she wanted not to be instructed, but to be assisted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next <hi>Scene Phedra</hi> is on the Stage, and over-hears the Nurse within, exchanging some words with <hi>Hippolytus:</hi> whereupon she cries out,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65825:55"/>
says, she is betraid, curses the Nurse, and resolves to kill her self. And now the apprehensions that <hi>Hippoly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> would accuse her to his Father, made her write a Letter, laying all the blame on <hi>Hippolytus,</hi> as the best expedient (that amidit her distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, she could on the sudden devise) to <hi>secure</hi> her <hi>honour,</hi> and to prevent the <hi>disgrace</hi> of her <hi>Family,</hi> and of her <hi>Children:</hi> and with this Letter in her hand, she hangs her self.</p>
               <p>Had some Author of the last age given us the character of <hi>Phedra,</hi> they (to thicken the <hi>Plot)</hi> would have brought her in burning of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, poisoning her Parents, prostitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her self to the Grooms, solliciting her Son face to face, with all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and impudence they could imagin; and never have left dawbing so long as there might remain the least cranny for either <hi>pitty</hi> or <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi> They would never have left her, till she had swell'd to such a <hi>Toad,</hi> as nothing but an <hi>audience</hi> of <hi>brass</hi> could fit the sight of her.</p>
               <p>But (for our credit) <hi>Seneea,</hi> before
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65825:55"/>
us, in this <hi>blind</hi> way of <hi>designing</hi> made no inconsiderable progress. We find his <hi>Phedra</hi> at the first dash justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying her <hi>incestuous</hi> love: and her Nurse is the Woman of <hi>sentences;</hi> who labours with all the wholsome advise, the sense and nonsense she could scrape together, to <hi>maul</hi> this monstrous lust that rag'd in her Nurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Phedra.</hi> And whilst she goes on without any signs of success, <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi> surprises her, (on the sudden) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to <hi>dye</hi> with a good name. Whereupon the Nurse bids her be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and promises to try what she can do with the young man.</p>
               <p>Without more words, the next <hi>Scene</hi> presents us <hi>Phedra,</hi> (as if the late resolution had never been made) all upon the <hi>gallantry,</hi> she is tricking her self up in <hi>Masquerade;</hi> and thus she hopes to win the Salvage <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytus,</hi> and the Nurse and she make their supplications to the Goddess of <hi>Chastity</hi> to help on their design. And now it is that the Nurse attacks him: but how? she expounds to him at large, that a <hi>City-life</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> are
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65825:56"/>
a comfortable <hi>importance;</hi> he answers in another <hi>harangue,</hi> that nothing is like to the <hi>ranging</hi> in the Countrey: and truly (for <hi>Women)</hi> he hates them all mortally. During this conference, <hi>Phedra</hi> reels in amongst them, falls in a swoun; and well is it for her that she is taken up in the arms of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son: therefore she takes heart, and puts it to him couragiously. But words proving vain, she will needs <note n="a" place="bottom">Etiam in amplexus ruit? Stringatur ensis.</note> 
                  <hi>ravish</hi> the poor stripling. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, to cut her neck off, he draws out the brown Faulcheon, <note n="b" place="bottom">Contactus ensis deserat castum latus.</note> on which she laying her sweaty palms, he cries foh! flings it from him, and runs away. And now the Nurse puts in her word, and says, <hi>marry,</hi> 'tis the best way to be before-hand with him, and to cry Whore first. Accordingly they fly to <hi>Theseus, Phedra</hi> tells him that <hi>Hippolytus</hi> not only purposed, but had <note n="c" place="bottom">Vim tamen corpus tulit.</note> effected his filthy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65825:56"/>
upon her body, do she what she could: and <hi>ecce signum</hi> shews the Sword to witness for her truth. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Theseus</hi> dispatches his Son <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polytus</hi> into another World. And now (with a canker to her) comes <hi>Phedra,</hi> confesses the truth indeed, and kills her self.</p>
               <p>Now in this <hi>Phedra</hi> of <hi>Seneca,</hi> what one occasion of <hi>pitty</hi> have we? what ground for <hi>terror?</hi> and, above all, what <hi>manners</hi> have we? ask the generality of Women if they are mov'd and concern'd, if their hearts and good will go along and attend the thoughts and motions of this <hi>Phedra?</hi> will they not answer that they know no such Woman, that she is no way a kin to them, nor has any resemblance with their nature? She must be some brat of a <hi>Succubus,</hi> or an evil <hi>Spirit,</hi> (say they) that perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates a Woman; or some <hi>Devil</hi> in a <hi>Machine,</hi> that comes to render the Sex odious. Nor can they allow her more compassion than to a Bitch, or <hi>Polecat,</hi> and what has no relation to human shape.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:65825:57"/>
Nor can this be a cause of <hi>terror:</hi> for few Women would be apt to fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that they could (in any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances) be so wicked as this <hi>Phedra,</hi> Each will say, were it my fate, or should I be curst to love where I ought not, I would certainly conceal my love, and strive with it, my thoughts, words, and actions, and all, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition might be every way the same, or very like to that of <hi>Phedra</hi> in <hi>Euripides.</hi> But I could never speak or act at this impudent abominable rate, could never be transform'd to such a monster as this <hi>Phedra</hi> of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca.</hi> And since my conduct would not be the same, my case can never be the same; and consequently this <hi>example</hi> cannot move or concern, or have any operation to stir either <hi>pitty</hi> or <hi>terror</hi> in me.</p>
               <p>I have been the more large on this matter, because it may serve as a certain and general <hi>test,</hi> whereby may be discover'd what is <hi>naturally</hi> apt to move <hi>pitty</hi> or <hi>terror.</hi> And this is founded on a Philosophy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver contraverted, but alike current at <hi>Malmsbury</hi> as at <hi>Athens.</hi>

               <head>The business of the <hi>Maids Tragedy</hi> is this;</head>
               <p>AMintor <hi>contracted to</hi> Aspatia (Callianax'<hi>s Daughter) by the King's command, marries</hi> Evadne, <hi>Sister to</hi> Melanthius; <hi>and expects to lye with her; but the Bride (min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing nothing) flatly tells him that he is but taken for a Cloak; that She, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is a Bedfellow only for the King. The good man is perswaded to dissemble all, till his friend</hi> Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius <hi>extorts from him the secret: and thereupon hectors his Sister</hi> Evadne <hi>into repentance, and makes her promise to murder the King. Which she effects: in the mean time, by vexing</hi> Callianax, Melanthius <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails with him to deliver up the Fort, (wherein consisted the strength of the Kingdom,) and so provides for his own security.</hi> Lysimachus, <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:65825:61"/>
                  <hi>to the murder'd King, succeeds on the Throne, and pardons all.</hi> Evadne <hi>would now go to bed with her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, he refuses, she kills her self.</hi> Aspatia <hi>in mans habit kicks her Sweetheart</hi> Amintor, <hi>duels him, and is kill'd; and now</hi> Amintor <hi>kills him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to follow her: at which sight, his friend</hi> Melanthius <hi>would also take the same course, but is prevented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we find <hi>Amintor</hi> false to his Mistress; and this fault is the source of all the revolutions in this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amintor</hi> therefore should have named the Tragedy, and some addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional title should have hinted the Poet's design.</p>
               <p>But seeing the <hi>Maid</hi> comes in at the latter end, only, to be kill'd for company; and seeing the King is the person of greatest importance, is the greatest loser and concern'd in the action of the Play more than enough. And seeing that the new King <hi>Lysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi> in the close of the Tragedy makes this sober conclusion, says he;
<q>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:65825:62"/>
                     <l>May this a fair example be to me,</l>
                     <l>To rule with temper: for on lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Kings</l>
                     <l>Unlookt-for sudden deaths from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are sent.</l>
                     <l>But curst is he that is their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>From these considerations we might gather that the Poets intent was to show the dismal consequences of <hi>fornication.</hi> And if so, then the Title of the Tragedy should have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the King.</p>
               <p>Whil'st thus we are uncertain what ought to be the <hi>title,</hi> we may suspect that the <hi>Action</hi> of the Tragedy is <hi>double,</hi> where there seem two centers, neither can be right; and the lines leading towards them must all be false and confus'd; the <hi>preparation</hi> I mean, and conduct must be all at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, since not directed to any one certain end.</p>
               <p>But what ever the Poet design'd; nothing in <hi>History</hi> was ever so <hi>unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:65825:62"/>
nothing in <hi>Nature</hi> was ever so <hi>improbable,</hi> as we find the whole conduct of this Tragedy, so far are we from any thing accurate, and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical as Poetry requires.</p>
               <p>This will appear as we examin the particular actions and Characters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</p>
               <p>Our Poet here gives to the great Comical <hi>Booby Callianax,</hi> the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a long name with a King at th'end on't, yet lets the King himself go without. But since he must be nameless we may treat him with the greater freedom, and to tell my mind, certainly God never made a King with so little wit, nor the devil with so little grace, as is this King <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A King of History might marry his Concubine to another man for a Maid; might hinder that man from the enjoyment. But would not then turn them into the bed-chamber to be all night together; nor would come in the morning to interrogate and question him, and torture the soul of him, as we find in this Tragedy,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65825:63"/>
nor would impose it on a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band thus affronted, whom he calls <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>valiant,</hi> to be the pimp to his bride. To have taken <hi>Amintors</hi> head off had been clemency in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of these outrages without any cause or colour. And how wise the King was in all this, may be judg'd from his own mouth, finding the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band contented and all quiet, the King (jealous that <hi>Evadne</hi> had not observ'd covenants) thus taxes her.

                     <l>As this our age has known? what could he do,</l>

               <p>In framing a Character for Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, a Poet is not to leave his reason, and blindly abandon himself to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fancy; for then his fancy might be monstrous, might be singular and please no body's <hi>maggot</hi> but his own, but reason is to be his guide, reason is common to all people, and can never carry him from what is Natural.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65825:65"/>
behaviour and hers, uncircumstanc'd as we have them, are every way so harsh and against Nature, that every thing said by them strikes like a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the souls of any reasonable <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whatever persons enter upon the Stage the Poetry would be gross e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough if the audience could not by the <hi>manners</hi> distinguish in what Country the <hi>Scene</hi> lay; whether in <hi>England, Italy,</hi> or <hi>Turky:</hi> more gross would it be if the manners would not discover which were men and which the women.</p>
               <p>Now Nature knows nothing in the <hi>manners</hi> which so properly and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly distinguishes woman as doth her modesty, consonant therefore to our principles and Poetical, is what some writers of Natural History have reported; that women when drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed swim with their faces down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, though men on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>Tragedy cannot represent a woman without modesty as natural and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:65825:66"/>
If a woman has got any acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal historical impudence, if docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in the School of <hi>Nanna</hi> or <hi>Heloisa,</hi> she is furnish'd with some stock of acquired impudence, she is no longer to stalk in Tragedy on her high shoes; but must rub off and pack down with the Carriers into the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence</hi> of Comedy, there to be kickt about and expos'd to laughter.</p>
               <p>There are degrees of modesty. <hi>Evadne</hi> and every person feign'd ought to be represented with more modesty then <hi>Phedra</hi> or <hi>Semiramis,</hi> because the History makes it credible that these had less of modesty then Naturally is inherent to the Sex, yet ought these also to show more of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty then is ordinarily seen in men, that the Characters might still be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd.</p>
               <p>But (of all) the Kings murder is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with those circumstances, with such a knot of absurdity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice, that I don't well know where to begin to unravel it.</p>
               <p>This King indeed is born a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, a Monster of great hopes, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65825:66"/>
what might we not have expected from him? yet certainly the Poet cuts him off, e're ripe for punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And by such unproper means, that to remove one guilty person he makes an hundred; and commits the <hi>deadly</hi> sins to punish a <hi>venial</hi> one.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Amintors</hi> falshood and its fatal consequences are to be noted, what occasion have we for a King in this Tragedy? cannot <hi>Corydon</hi> deceive his <hi>Amarillis</hi> (for such is <hi>Aspatia)</hi> but the King must know of it, the King must be murder'd for't?</p>
               <p>To vex this false man, a Groom might have done the job, and have been the Poets Cuckold-maker to all intents and purposes every jot as well.</p>
               <p>If it be said that the King was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the falshood, I question whether in Poetry a King can be an accessary to a crime, if the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Amintor; Amintor</hi> should have begg'd the Kings pardon; should have suffer'd all the racks and tortures
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65825:67"/>
a Tyrant could inflict; and from <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus</hi>'s Bull should have still bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out that eternal truth, that his <hi>Promise was to be kept,</hi> that he is true to <hi>Apatia,</hi> that he dies for his Mistress, then would his memory have been precious and sweet to after-ages; and the Midsummer-Maydens would have <hi>offer'd</hi> their Garlands all at his grave.</p>
               <p>And thus the King might kill <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mintor,</hi> but <hi>Amintor</hi> could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that the King or Fortune had made him false.
<q>
                     <l>—nec nisi miserum fortuna Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonem</l>
                     <l>Finxit, vanum etiam mendacemque improba finget.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, I say, the King was not to blame; or however not so far, as in any wise to render his life obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>But if the Poet intended to make an example of this King, and that the King right or wrong must be kill'd. <hi>Amintor</hi> only felt the highest provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65825:67"/>
and he alone should have been drawn out for the wicked instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for <hi>Melantius</hi> had no reason to be angry at any but at his Sister <hi>Evadne;</hi> nor could she have any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to exercise her hands, unless it were against her self.</p>
               <p>If I mistake not, in Poetry no wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is to kill a man, except her qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity gives her the advantage above him, nor is a Servant to kill the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, nor a Private Man, much less a Subject to kill a King, nor on the contrary.</p>
               <p>Poetical decency will not suffer death to be dealt to each other by such persons, whom the Laws of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el allow not to enter the lifts toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>There may be circumstances that alter the case, as when there is a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground of partiality in an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> either upon the account of <hi>Religion</hi> (as <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> or <hi>Riccardo</hi> in <hi>Tisso</hi> might kill <hi>Soliman,</hi> or any other <hi>Turkish</hi> King or great <hi>Sultan)</hi> or else in favour of our <hi>Country</hi> for then a private <hi>English Heroe</hi> might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65825:68"/>
a King of some Rival Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But grant that <hi>Evadne</hi> lies under none of all these impediments; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose her duly qualifi'd, and let the King wave his priviledges. Is there in History any president of a <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> sinner, that meerly from a fit of repentance fell foul on her <hi>Gallant</hi> at this horrid rate.

               <p>But indeed most of our Murderers hitherto have been no better; they are the Poets Ban-dogs let loose to worry those the Poet had mark'd out for slaughter; and never shew more reason or consideration: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently can in no wise occasion either pitty or terror to cause that delight expected from Tragedy.</p>

Poetry will allow no provocation or injury, where it allows no revenge. And what pleasure can there be in seeing a King threaten and hector without cause; when none may be suffer'd to make a return? Poetry will not permit an affront, where there can be no reparation. But well was it for us all, that <hi>Amintor</hi> was by the Poet his <hi>maker,</hi> endu'd with a restraining grace, and had his hands ty'd.</p>
               <p>The King should first have kill'd his own Mother to have made him mad enough, and fitted him for such a monstrous provocation. And <hi>Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> too should have been guilty of some enormous crime, (as he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) that drew this curse upon him, and prepar'd him to receive so horrid an out-rage. Both should have been ripe for punishment, which this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion pulls down upon them, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them kill each other. Then <hi>Poetical Iustice</hi> might have had its course, though no way could pitty be due to either of them.</p>

                  <l>Is much to blame,</l>

               </sp>
               <p>This line at the full length, is sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough, his care is, so to mince that matter as not to offend the Brother. Some broken speeches, as <hi>your Sister, the King, her honour,</hi> or
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65825:76"/>
the like, with now and then a sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his tears, might have suffic'd, and the Brother should have been left to guess and paraphrase the broad meaning. But <hi>Amintor</hi> harps upon the same string out of time himself. What follows, is plainly to upbraid and affront his Friend by words, though he intended nothing less; for he goes on:</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Am.</speaker>
                  <l>And lives in whoredom with him.</l>
               </sp>
               <p>And what yet is more silly, in the next he adds.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Am.</speaker>
                  <l>She's wanton, I am loath to say a whore,</l>
                  <l>Though it be true.</l>
               </sp>
               <p>This provokes <hi>Melantius</hi> to draw his Sword, and he is for fighting <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mintor;</hi> yet I am apt to be of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mintors</hi> mind, which he thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses:</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Am.</speaker>
                  <l>—It was base in you,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:65825:76"/>
To urge a weighty secret from your Friend,</l>
                  <l>And then rage at it.</l>
               </sp>
               <p>Yet <hi>Melantius</hi> persists, till <hi>Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> is provoked to draw his Sword, and then <hi>Melantius</hi> puts up. <hi>Harle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi> and <hi>Scaramouttio</hi> might do these things. Tragedy suffers 'em not, here is no place for Cowards, nor for giddy fellows, and Bullies with their squabbles. When a Sword is once drawn in Tragedy, the Scabbard may be thrown away; there is no leaving what is once design'd, till it be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly effected. <hi>Iphigenia Taurica</hi> went to sacrifice <hi>Orestes,</hi> and she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted, why? she discover'd him to be her Brother. None here are such Fools as by words to begin a quarrel; nor of so little resolution, to be talkt agen from it, without some new emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent cause that diverts them. No <note n="a" place="bottom">Arist.</note> simple alteration of mind ought to produce or hinder any action in a Tragedy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:65825:77"/>
Yet far more faulty is what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; the <hi>counter-turn</hi> has no shadow of sense or sobriety. <hi>Melantius</hi> has swaggered away his fury, and now <hi>Amintor</hi> is all agog to be afighting; for what; but to get his secret back again.</p>

               <p>Thou art mad <hi>Amintor,</hi> Bedlam is the only place for thee; if thou comest here with thy madness, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy expects <note n="b" place="bottom">Terence:</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Hercules</hi> was mad, and kill'd his Wife and Children, yet there was reason in his madness; a mist was cast before his eyes, he mistook them for their enemies, and believ'd he was revenging their quarrel whilst he heat their brains out. That was a madness might move pity; but this of <hi>Amintor</hi> is meerly bruitish,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65825:77"/>
and can move nothing but our aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Here is a bluster begun without provocation, and ended without any thing of satisfaction.</p>
               <p>But that I may never find a fault without shewing something better. For a quarrel betwixt two friends, with the <hi>turn</hi> and <hi>counter-turn:</hi> let me commend that Scene in the <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genia</hi> in <hi>Aulide.</hi> Where <hi>Agamemnon</hi> having consented that his Daughter should be sacrific'd, and (that her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might let her come the more willingly) sent for her with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that she was to be marri'd to <hi>Achilles;</hi> yet in a fit of Fatherly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness he privately dispatches Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to hinder her coming. <hi>Menelaus</hi> meets the Messenger going from <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon,</hi> suspects the business, takes the Letters from him before <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>'s face, and read them; and now arose the contest: <hi>Menelaus</hi> was zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the publick good, the more, because it agreed so much with his own interest: and <hi>Agamemnon</hi> had cause enough to stand up for his Daughter; but yet, at length, with
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65825:78"/>
weeping eyes, and shame for his weakness and partiality, he yielded up the cause. But <hi>Menelaus</hi> now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conflict of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> the tears rowling down his cheeks, and his repentance, this sight melted the heart of him, and now he turns Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for <hi>Iphigenia:</hi> He will have <hi>Hellen</hi> and the concerns of <hi>Greece</hi> left to the mercy of Heaven, rather than that his Brother <hi>Agamemnon</hi> should do so much violence to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and that so vertuous a young Princess be trapan'd to lose her life.</p>
               <p>Here all the motions arise from oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions great and just; and this is matter for a <hi>Scene</hi> truly passionate and Tragical.</p>
               <p>We may remember (how-ever we find this Scene of <hi>Melanthius</hi> and <hi>Amintor</hi> written in the Book) that at the <hi>Theater</hi> we have a good Scene Acted, there is work cut out, and both our <hi>AEsopus</hi> and <hi>Roscius</hi> are on the Stage together: Whatever defect may be in <hi>Amintor</hi> and <hi>Melanthius;</hi> Mr. <hi>Hart</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mohun</hi> are wanting in nothing. To these we owe for
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65825:78"/>
what is pleasing in the Scene; and to this Scene we may impute the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of the <hi>Maids Tragedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Drolls</hi> in this <hi>Play</hi> make not so much noise as in the two former; but are less excusable here. In the former they keep some distance, and make a sort of <hi>interlude:</hi> but here they thrust into the principal places; when we should give our full attention to what is Tragedy. When we would listen to a <hi>Lute,</hi> our ears are rapt with the <hi>tintamar</hi> and twang of the <hi>Tongs</hi> and <hi>Iewstrumps.</hi> A man may be free to make a jest of his own mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes: but surely 'tis unnatural and barbarous to laugh when we see another on the Scaffold. Some would laugh to find me mentioning <hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Oracles,</hi> and <hi>Goddesses:</hi> old Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions, say they, not practicable, but more than ridiculous on our Stage. These have not observ'd with what Art <hi>Virgil</hi> has manag'd the Gods of <hi>Homer,</hi> nor with what judgment <hi>Tasso</hi> and <hi>Cowley</hi> employ the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly powers in a Christian Poem.

might also be improv'd by modern Tragedians; and something thence devis'd suitable to our Faith and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes. 'Tis the general reason I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for: Nor would I more have Oracles or Goddesses on the Stage, then hear the persons speak <hi>Greek,</hi> they are Apes and not men that imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate with so little discretion.</p>
               <p>Some would blame me for insisting and examining only what is apt to <hi>please,</hi> without a word of what might profit.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I believe the end of all Poetry is to <hi>please.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Some sorts of Poetry please without profiting.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I am confident whoever writes a Tragedy cannot please but must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so profit; 'tis the Physick of the mind that he makes palatable.</p>
               <p>And besides the <hi>purging</hi> of the <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;</hi> something must stick by obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that constant order, that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and beauty of Providence, that necessary relation and chain, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the causes and the effects, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and rewards, the vices and their
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65825:79"/>
punishments are proportion'd and link'd together; how deep and dark soever are laid the Springs, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever intricate and involv'd are their operations.</p>
               <p>But these enquiries I leave to men of more flegm and considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Othello</hi> comes next to hand, but lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Papers together without more scribling, I find a volumn, and a greater burthen then I dare well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude upon you.</p>
               <p>If I blindly wander in erroneous paths, 'tis more then time Mr. <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard</hi> that you set me right, and if I am not so much out of the way; then most of the main faults in these other Tragedies cannot be far from our view, if we tread not on their skirts already.</p>
               <p>I will wait your direction e're I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance farther, and be sure of your pardon for what is past. Many seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contradictions I rather chose to slip over, then to be ever casting in your way some <hi>parenthesis</hi> or some <hi>distinction.</hi>

Many other slips and mistakes too you meet withall, but <hi>the fortune of</hi> Greece <hi>depends not on them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor I know could you (that read Hebrew without the pricks) be at a loss for the sense, where you found not a period truly pointed.</p>
               <p>If the Characters I have examin'd are the same I take them for, I send you Monsters enough for one <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholmew-fair:</hi> but what would vex a Christian, these are shown us for our own likenesses, these are the <hi>Duch</hi> Pictures of humane kind.</p>
               <p>I have thought our Poetry of the last Age as rude as our Architecture, one cause thereof might be, that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>'s <hi>treatise of Poetry</hi> has been so little studied amongst us, it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Commented upon by all the great men in <hi>Italy,</hi> before we well know (on this side of the <hi>Alps)</hi> that there was such a Book in being. And though <hi>Horace</hi> comprizes all in that small Epistle of his; yet few will think long enough together to be Masters, and to understand the reason of what is deliver'd so in short.</p>

With the remaining <hi>Tragedies</hi> I shall also send you some reflections on that <hi>Paradise lost</hi> of <hi>Miltons,</hi> which some are pleas'd to call a Poem, and assert <hi>Rime</hi> against the slender Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry wherewith he attacques it: and also a Narrative of <hi>Petrarch's</hi> Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the <hi>Capitol,</hi> with all the <hi>Pontificalibus</hi> on that occasion, which seems wanting in <hi>Selden,</hi> where he treats on that subject. Let me only anticipate a little in behalf of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taline,</hi> and now tell my thoughts, that though the contrivance and oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy is faulty enough, yet we there find (besides what is borrow'd from others) more of Poetry and of good thought, more of Nature and of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, then peradventure can be scrap't together from all those other <hi>Plays.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor can I be displeas'd with honest <hi>Ben,</hi> when he rather chooses to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a <hi>Melon</hi> of his Neighbour, than to treat us with a <hi>Pumpion</hi> of his own growth.</p>
