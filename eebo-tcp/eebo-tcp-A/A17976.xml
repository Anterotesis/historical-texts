            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
<pb facs="tcp:7970:3"/>
and expected warfare from the beginning hath kept the Church in continuall exercise and watch against many and strong aduersaries: so to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of this warfare, that is toward the end of this world, the aduersaries growing more skilfull, more bòld and desperate then before, the warfare must of necessitie bee made more daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. The greatnesse of which daunger may draw the gouernours of the Church to a more sensible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of their duties, who according to the daunger of the Church, cannot but vnderstand that their care, industry, vigilancy, and courage must be increased for the preseruation of the peace, and good of the Church of God which they gouern: so that the malice, industrie and desperate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the aduersaries, are to them so many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations stirring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp more carefully to watch.</p>
            <p>Which care hath singularly appeared in your Grace, who as a Generall in this warfare haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen no rest to your selfe, but by preuenting the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of the enemies by espying their secrets, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering their present incounters, by incouraging inferiours, haue declared your carefull seruice in this warfare setting the battel in order and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging euery souldier in his proper standing, and place: vnder this conduct haue I vndertaken this peece of seruice for the opening the truth of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>urisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb facs="tcp:7970:3"/>
of late so much oppugned, defaced, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded by the aduersaries. Wherein as I can not promise any worth of my seruice, so I shall bee able with a good conscience to challenge the reward of faithfull and sincere dealing.</p>
            <p>The question I confesse, requireth a man as skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in distinguishing this confused masse of Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which they now haue cast vpon the Pope, as Archimedes was in examining the gouldsmithes fraude, who hauing receiued a certaine Weight of gould of <hi>Hiero</hi> King of Sicily to make a goulden<note place="margin">Uitruuius lib. 9. cap. 3.</note> crowne which he would offer to his Gods; stoale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way much of the gold, and put siluer in the place thereof, rendring to <hi>Hiero</hi> his true weight againe. To examine this fraud without melting of the crowne, was a worke to exercise the great wit of <hi>Archimedes</hi> himselfe: such is this masse of Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, wherin fraudulent workmen (as they who confound gold, siluer, coper, and brasse together) haue taken the Iurisdiction of the Church, and of kings; and mingling both together, adding much of their owne drosse thereto, haue made it as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptfull crowne to offer to their great God, to set it vpon his h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>se, &amp; to giue to each his own right, was a thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the greater difficulty, because none of late yeeres hath troden this path before me, whose foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steppes
<pb facs="tcp:7970:4"/>
might haue directed me. For the question of the Supremacy is handled learnedly &amp; worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily by others, who though they haue giuen some light to this question of Iurisdiction, yet they doe it but in some passages, not handling the question fully and purposely, but by occasion sometimes fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into some parts thereof. Wherefore I thought it would be a necessary seruice to the Church, if this thing might be truely brought to knowledge, and the fraudulent confusion of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>is crowne of Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction standing vpon the proud head of the Pope examined &amp; distinguished, the siluer seuered from the gold, and the drosse from both.</p>
            <p>As Iurisdiction lay thus confounded by those false workemen of Rome, so at the first triall of it, when it was examined by vnskilfull and deceitfull triars, who fet the rules of their triall not from the truth but from ambition and adulation, they ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon them to be triars of truth, made things as bad or farre worse by their handling then they were before: and so wrapped this question in newe difficulties. For when <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight tooke this title of supreme head of the Church of England, though the sounder and more iudicious part of the Church then vnderstood the words of that title so, as no offence might iustly rise by it: yet they that were suddenly brought from their olde opinion of
<pb facs="tcp:7970:4"/>
perie, not to the loue of the truth, but to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance of the Kings religion; retained a grosse and impure sense of those words, as most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly by such is retained to this day. For when <hi>Stephen Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> Bishop of Winchester was at Ratisbon in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie<note place="margin">Caluin in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos 7.</note> vpon the Kings affaires, he there taking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to declare the meaning of that title, supreme head of the Church giuen to king <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight taught that the King had such a power, that hee might appoint and prescribe new ordinances of the Church, euen matters concerning faith and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and abolish old: as namely that the King might forbid the marriage of Priests, and might take away the vse of the cup in the Sacrament of the Lords supper, and in such things might appoint what he list. This manner of declaring the Kings Iurisdiction, did so much offend the reformed<note place="margin">Caluin in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos 7. 13.</note> Churches, that <hi>Caluin</hi> &amp; the writers of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies<note place="margin">Praefat. in Centro. 7.</note> doe much complaine thereof, and worthily, For the Bishop of Winchester sought not like a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious triar of mettals to seuere the gold from the siluer and drosse from both: but as hee found this massie crown of Iurisdiction vpon the Popes head, so he tooke it with gold, siluer, coper, drosse and all: and set vpon the Kings head: So that the thing which procured so much offence, was not the title, but the Bishops false and erronious declaration of that title.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7970:5"/>If any obiect against me: what then? will you take vpon you to handle this thing, better then such a learned and prudent Prelate? I answer, the Bishop wanted neither wit nor learning for the opening of this point, but onely a loue to the truth: which loue when I shall bring to this question, I finde my selfe therby so supported, that neither the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of other men, nor mine owne imperfections can dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t me so much, as to cause me to giue ouer the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the truth. True it is, that a more skilfull <hi>Archimedes</hi> might haue beene set on this worke, to distinguish the things that haue lien so long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in this question; or the common helpe of many might haue beene combined, wherin our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries are now growen wiser in their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then the children of light. And though it seeme to be true, that an euill cause hath more need of helpes: yet there is no reason that they who haue the handling of a good cause, should in confidence of the cause neglect any helpe, that possibly they may attain vnto. Albeit we must confesse that the arme of God hath wonderfully declared it selfe by weak meanes against great.</p>
            <p>For if a man should looke vpon the meanes on both sides with an eye of flesh, he would thinke as <hi>Vzziah</hi> did, When the Arke was shaken, that the<note place="margin">2. Sam. 6. 7.</note> Church could not possibly stand vp by so weake
<pb facs="tcp:7970:5"/>
meanes: For on the one side the Pope sheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the riches of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> great and potent patrimony, with the helpe of so many great Princes, with the councell and policie of his Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, with the armies of his Canonists, Priests secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and regular, but especially in these later years, of his Iesuites, who glorying so much of their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and filling the world with their vaunts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing supported by wealth and policie, abounding with all worldly meanes that their hearts can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire incouraged by preferments, march like armed troupes entring a battell: On the other side a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of poore men, <hi>Luther, Bucer, Zuinglius, O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e vpholden by humane meanes, or if the seruants of the truth were drawne to speake in the Church, as Lawyers are for their fees at the barre: then what hope could wee haue to stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Iesuites the Popes Lawyers, who by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible clamours, facing and obstinacy, make not truth, but victory the end they aime at.</p>
            <p>But as there is great oddes in the meanes on the one side, so there appeareth no lesse difference in the
<pb facs="tcp:7970:6"/>
successe on the other side: For by these weake and contemned means the world is subdued vnto Christ, deliuered from the bondage of superstition, wisdome is iustified of her owne children, and the truth tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpheth in the sincerity and godlinesse of weake meanes, against the malice, policy and strength of her prepotent aduersaries.</p>
            <p>Which successe compared with the meanes on both sides, doth manifest the arme of God to be in the cause, that groweth so much against the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world and meanes. For what other po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer could make so weake meanes preuaile so much, against so great policy and strength, but the same power (though not in the sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> measure) which by a company of poore Fishermen (despised in the world) subdued the whole world vnto the obedience of Christ? As this successe and blessing by the presence of God, hath beene hitherto apparant in this cause: so the Iesuites take order that the same successe and blessing may continually hereafter follow our cause, vntill it hath rooted out all the aduersaries that make opposition against it: for what greater strength or aduantage can bee giuen to our cause, then the wickednesse of our aduersaries doth giue? How often doth <hi>Moses</hi> declare to the Church of Israell, that the fauour of God was so much decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red towards them, not for their owne righteousnes,
<pb facs="tcp:7970:6"/>
but for the wickednes of their aduersaries? So that if we should stand still and looke on, and holde our selues in patience, our aduersaries will worke the meanes, by their owne strange cruelties in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions, by their prophane and vncleane conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, by their grosse Idolatry, by their horrible treasons and conspiracies against the liues of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by their diuelish deuises for subuersion of whole States at one blow, by their hypocrisie, falshood and aequiuocations, and by that most admirable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit villany that euer was inuented, in deprauing, corrupting, altering and chaunging all auncient writers: by these, and the like practises of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, they themselues will worke the meanes of our successe, and of their owne destruction. And if the Prince of this world, and his first begotten had not blinded their eyes, and their hearts, they could not choose but see, and acknowledge the experience of Gods fauour and protection mightily declared from heauen vpon our cause our Prince and State; and of late much increased and made apparant to all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> world by their owne wicked practises.</p>
            <p>Then the difference being so great in the meanes and in the successe, so great also betweene our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation and theirs, must needes declare a great difference betweene our hopes and theirs, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and theirs: they haue raised the Princes and
<pb facs="tcp:7970:7"/>
armies of the world against vs, when they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed peace: wee neuer vsed deceit or wrong against them: they haue by barbarous deuises attempted to procure our vtter subuersion, we desire hartily their conuersion to God: they curse, reuile, and baspheme vs, wee pray for them: this difference may shew, where truth and Religion is; and might if they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the serious consideration of things, drawe them to cease from all wicked attempts, to follow and embrace one trueth, and to worshippe one God with vs.</p>
            <p>But if there be no remedy, but that Princes and States must be oppugned by a perpetuall league of Conspiracy from Rome: if nothing can satisfie them but the blood of Kings, then what remaineth but that the Princes of Christendome prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to that great battel, which <hi>S.

Vnto which ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice there is nothing so effectuall to animate the princes of Christendome, as is this new and strange claime of the popes Iurisdiction ouer princes: which thing because it is so much pursued by the Popes and their flatterers, and onely by them, as the great
<pb facs="tcp:7970:7"/>
marke whereunto they addresse all their attempts; and the very summe of all their Religion: therfore I haue endeuoured to open the whole, to distinguish the parts, and to set this question in such a light as I could, if not to satisfie all, yet at least to giue an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to the iudicious. I was desirous to leaue no part vntouched, that all might come to a triall, and am ready also withall, to bring my selfe to the triall, willing to learne and to amend any error, after that it shall be manifested by the truth to bee an errour: for which cause, I submit all to the iudicious and godly censure of the Church.</p>
            <p>My care was also after my seruice to God, to performe herein a true seruice to his Maiesty, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the Iurisdiction of Kings: which I haue done, not as they vse to doe who serue the Pope, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting no other rules of that seruice, then his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and their adulation, but I haue disputed the Kings right with a good conscience, from the rules of Gods word, knowing that the noble disposition of his Maiesty will admit of no seruice, whereby God or the truth is preiudiced.

All this mischiefe proceedeth from the Bishop of Rome, who vsurping powre, and taking to himselfe that honour whereunto God hath not called him, hath brought all autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie Ecclesiasticall and Ciuill into great confusion; by vsurping the right both of the Church and of States.

And againe, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, we say, we define, we pronounce; that it is necessarie to saluation to beleeue that euery humane creature is subiect to the Pope of Rome.] These be the lawes of the court of Rome<note place="margin">Answere to the fift part of Reports.</note> which some of late haue so much adored as to call them Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Diuinitie, and which for truth and certaintie, and for au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ouer their consciences, they hold comparable euen with the holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By all which wee collect the doctrine of the court of Rome or the Popes faction to be, that the Pope hath all power Spirituall and Temporall aboue all other whatsoeuer. This I call the opinion of the Court of Rome, or the Popes faction, because we finde the most learned of the Church of Rome to hold the contrary. For concerning spirituall power, the best learned of the Church of Rome, yea and whole councels main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Spiritual power of the Church, to be aboue the Pope; as hereafter we shall declare. And for this Temporall power aboue Kings and Emperours, claimed by the Popes in their Canon Lawe, maintained by their flatterers: it seemeth so straunge, so new and absurd, that they who maintaine it, are not as yet agreed vpon the state of the question. For some hold that the Pope hath this power directly ouer Princes, as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists, to whom some of the Shoole-men may be added as <hi>Triumphus,</hi> and some of late called <hi>Congregationis Oratorij,</hi> as Cardinall <hi>Baronius, Bozius,</hi> and such. Others denying this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect power, hold that the Pope hath the same power but indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, as depending vpon his Spirituall power; of this opinion is Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and others: these both hold the same conclusion, but differ in the manner of holding it. Others there
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7970:11"/>
be who are in some sort content to allowe the Popes Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in spirituall matters, in case lie would not prooue incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible, but vtterly denie this power ouer princes, both direct and indirect: of this opinion was <hi>Guil. Occham, Ma' silius Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauinus</hi> and other learned men of the Church of Rome. And of late <hi>Guil. Berclaius</hi> a French Lawyer, hath with great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning refuted both the former opinions, of the Popes power di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and indirect against <hi>Bozius</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and yet this man professeth himselfe to be resolued to liue and die a Papist: so that on the one side stand all the reformed Churches, and many of the best learned of the Church of Rome: I may say all the Church of old and of late. On the other side standeth the Pope with his faction, that is, his flatterers: and this I call (with some of former ages) the Court of Rome: this is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of our aduersaries.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Our positiue sentence against this standeth in two parts, as the Pope hath incroached on two sides, both vpon the right of Kings, and of the Church. Concerning the Kings right, we hold <hi>that in externall coactiue Iurisdiction the</hi> King hath su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame authoritie in all causes and ouer all persons Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call aswell as Ciuill. This is that which hath bene published by<note place="margin">Iniunctions An. 1559 and Anno 1562.</note> diuerse writings and ordinances, which by publike authoritie haue beene enacted and published; declaring that the King within hi Dominions hath this soueraigne authoritie, and that heerein there is no forraine power aboue the King. The autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church hath beene in like sort vsurped by the Pope, by drawing to himselfe a supposed title of the head of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Church: by deuising a straunge authority in the fulnesse of power, by claiming a newe and straunge priuiledge of his not erring iudgement, and making himselfe the onely iudge of controuersies of faith. This power in iudging and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of controuersies of faith and religion, being partly in the Church, partly in the Scriptures, the Pope hath wrested from both; first extolling the Church aboue the Scriptures, and then setting himselfe aboue the Church. Then, that the limits of each power may be truely knowne, we giue all spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power to the Church, all externall coactiue iurisdiction to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7970:11"/>
the King: when each of these shall haue taken vp his owne right, there will not be so much left to the Pope, as these great flatterers the Iesuits seeke to heape vpon him. Our purpose is first, to dispute the right which Kings haue in coactiue power ouer all persons and in all causes euen Ecclesiasticall within his dominions: by persons ecclesiasticall wee vnderstand Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Bishops, Deans, Rectors, and all other set in calling and place Ecclesiasticall: by causes Ecclesiasticall wee vnderstand causes Ecclesiasticall <hi>of externall coactiue Iurisdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. From this consideration of persons and causes, arise two great questions. First, concerning the exemption of all causes Ecclesiasticall, from the Kings Iurisdiction: secondly, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the exemption of Ecclesiasticall persons from temporall audience and iudicature. For the better vnderstanding here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we may proceede by some distinctions: for when our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries teach that the Pope is the head of the Church: and we, that the King is the supreame gouernor of the Church, though in some sound of wordes, these things seeme not much to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: yet in truth there is great difference betweene their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ours. For they calling the Pope the head, to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish him from Christ, whom the Apostle calleth the head of<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 22.</note> the Church, say that the Pope is the ministeriall head: which deuise was first brought in by the Schoolemen: for among the auncients it was not knowne, but all that speake of the head of the Church before, acknowledge none but Christ. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this deuise of the ministeriall head, we say with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers that the Catholike Church is but one, and hath one head, Christ Iesus: because to one bodie there can bee but one head, from whom grace is infused to the whole body. This Catholike Church is as that head is, both perfectly known to God, not to man: this then is but one in all times and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But the visible Churches or particular, are many at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, in many places: and therefore must haue heads or gouernours, aunswerable to themselues: for many Churches, many gouernours, These are either Spirituall gouernours or Temporall. The spirituall gouernment of the Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to spirituall gouernours, as first from Christ to his

Temporall gouernours are such, as haue the custody of externall coactiue Iurisdiction, both in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and Ecclesiasticall causes: for the power of the Church, with all her spirituall Iurisdiction, neuer reached to coaction. This was by God first giuen to Magistrates, and neuer reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, in all times practised, but when the Church and Kings were oppressed by the great power of Antichrist. When wee call the King the supreame gouernour of the Church, our meaning is, that hee is appointed by God to be a Father and preseruer of religion, a keeper of Ecclesiasticall discipline, and<note place="margin">Isai. 49. 32.</note> as the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> calleth him, a nourcing father of the Church; he is the soueraigne in all affaires of coactiue Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Likewise this word Church, is not taken in the same sense by them and vs; for our aduersaries saying, that the Pope is the head of the Church: vnderstand thereby the. Catholike Church spread ouer the whole world, but we vnderstand a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, yeelding the King to bee gouernour next and immediatly vnder God of his own dominions, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of persons and causes within his owne dominions: so that there is much difference betweene their meaning and ours. Then we must come to such an issue, wherein without equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the question betweene vs is set; for wee shall otherwise run into that fault which is so rife, with the Popes Clarks, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe confesseth it. <hi>Notandum est</hi> (saith he) <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos</hi>

Then his opinion is, that the Pope as Pope hath not any Temporall power, but yet the Pope and onely the Pope hath Temporall power aboue all Kings and Emperours. This is one of the greatest points wherein the Pope hath incroached vpon the right of Kings.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Besides this Temporall Iurisdiction, there is another part of Iurisdiction called spirituall: which the writers of the Church of Rome deuide into internall, and externall; internall they referre to the Sacraments onely, <hi>Gerson de potest. ecclesi. consid. 1. Bellar. de Rom. pont. lib. 4. cap. 22. Bellarmine</hi> in the place last cited, disputing of Iurisdiction, saith, [there is a triple power in the Bishop of Rome: first of order, secondly of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Iurisdiction, thirdly of externall Iurisdiction: the first is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Sacraments, the second to inward gouernment which is in the court of conscience; the third to that externall

gouernment which is practised in externall courts: and confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that of the first and second, there is no question betweene vs, but onely of the third: <hi>De primâ &amp; secundâ non est questio, sed solum de tertiâ;</hi> saith he. Then of this wee are agreed, that<note place="margin">Lib. 4. cap. 22. de Rom. Pont.</note> the question betweene vs and them, is onely of Iurisdiction in the third sense, and therein especially <hi>of Iurisdiction coactiue in externall courts:</hi> binding and compelling by force of law, and other externall mulcts and punishments, beside excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as for Spirituall Iurisdiction of the Church, standing in examinations of controuersies of faith, iudging of heresies, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of heretickes; excommunication of notorious and stubborne offenders, ordination of Priests and Deacons, insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and collation of benefices and spirituall cures, &amp;c. This we reserue intire to the Church, which Princes cannot giue or take from the Church. This power hath bene practised by the Church, without coactiue Iurisdiction: other then of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. But when the matters handled in the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call consistorie, are not matters of faith and religion, but of a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill nature, which yet are called Ecclesiasticall, as being giuen by Princes, and appointed to be within the cognisance of that consistorie; and when the censures are not spirituall, but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, compulsiue, coactiue: here appeareth the power of the ciuill magistrate.

               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Then this is the thing which wee are to prooue, that Ecclesiasticall coactiue power, by force of lawe and corporall punishments, by which Christian people are to be gouerned in externall and contentious courts, is a power which of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to Christian Princes. Concerning the power of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and institutions, of excommunication and deposition, and of internall Iurisdiction in the court of Conscience, &amp; in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Sacraments, &amp; absolution by power of the keyes; this we giue not to Princes: but Princes, as they are preseruers of Religion, and nurcing fathers of the Church, are to see that Bishops and all inferiour ministers performe their faithfull du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in their seuerall places, and if they be found faulty to punish them; because that belongeth to external Iurisdiction coactiue. Thus much may suffice for the state of the question. For the manner of handling, I purpose to search the right of Kinges; first in the law of nature, secondly in the written law giuen by <hi>Moses,</hi> continued vntill the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ: thirdly to declare the confirmation of the same right by Christ and his Apostles, and the Church succeeding, vntill that time that the Pope drew a newe estate and Iurisdiction to himselfe. After which time I purpose to obserue how the Pope hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached, first vpon the Bishops, then vpon the right of kings, and last vpon the right of the Church and generall Councels. By all which will appeare, how late, how new and strange that Iurisdiction is, which the flatterers of the court of Rome now yeeld to the Pope.</p>

The princedome and double portion are generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to belong to the birthright: but the priesthood is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7970:15"/>
not so much manifested, and would therefore somewhat more be opened. I will here briefly collect the reasons, which proue the priesthood to belong to the birthright, as wel as the prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and double portion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. First from reason it is deduced thus, It cannot by reason be imagined, but that God hauing a purpose to call a Church out of this world, did set vp the gouernment and meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Church might be instituted in the true knowledge and wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>hip of God: therefore this gouernment and those meanes were set vp in the law of nature, in those principalities which then stood. The fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t principalitie that was set vp to rule many families, was a kingdome; as the first simply was in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a family: for before there could be a common-wealth, there must be a citie, or the collection of many families into the lawfull right of one societie; and before there could be a citie, there must bee particular houses and families: so that the first gouernment that was in the world among men, was the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of a family: now in the gouerment of a family, it is absurd to thinke, and impossible to prooue, that the power of gouernment was in the multitude. This I obserue the rather, because some of the Popes flatterers of late, as others also to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a wide gappe to rebellions, haue written that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of gouernment by the law of nature is in the multitude: but euery man of reason carrieth thus much light and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding about him, as to iudge of this thing without errour. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no man can conceiue in the first beginning any other go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of a family, then by one whom God and nature made <hi>Patrem familias,</hi> the father of the familie. Now come from the gouerment of one familie, to the gouernment of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers; when many families were gathered together, the first go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment that was erected among them, was that with which they were first and best acquainted: for as in families, so in the collection of diuerse families, one was in gouerment, as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the family was in his famiile. And what is a King by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the father of a great family? and what is the father of a familie by nature, but a little King? and therefore the first gouernement of states by the lawe of nature, was by Kings.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7970:15"/>
These principalities were first erected for the good of Gods Church; to minister as nourcing fathers to the Church. Thus were Kings erected, not onely by their authoritie to see that Gods seruice were established, but by the law of nature to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that seruice in their owne persons. And therefore as <hi>Adam</hi> had this care first, so it is testified of <hi>Seth</hi> (to whom the birthright pertained after <hi>Cain</hi> was reiected) that in his time<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 26.</note> men began to call vpon the name of the Lord, which declareth that he established the true worship of God in his dayes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another reason may be drawen from this blessing which <hi>Noah</hi> gaue to <hi>Sem,</hi> [blessed be the Lord God of <hi>Sem,</hi> and let<note place="margin">Gen. 9. 26. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Canaan</hi> bee his seruant: God perswade <hi>Iaphet</hi> that hee may dwell in the tents of <hi>Sem,</hi> and let <hi>Canaan</hi> be his seruant.] In which words three priuiledges of <hi>Sem</hi> are manifested. First that God is called the Lord God of <hi>Sem,</hi> Secondly that <hi>Canaan</hi> shal be his seruant: Thirdly that <hi>Iaphet</hi> shall repaire to his tents. The first and last are confirmations of the priesthood, the second a proofe of the primogeniture: then the priesthood is annexed to the birthright. Another reason is from the example of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedeck,</hi> who was both King and Priest. In which example we consider that by the law of nature, before there was a positiue law to distinguish and separate these offices, both did naturally concurre in one person: for in this we vnderstand the ordinary course held in the law of nature. If wicked Kings neglected this godly order, it was because they were wicked, and had shaked off the feare of God, and as much as in them was, extinguished the light of nature.

By all which thus much appeareth; that by the law of nature, the first borne stood in the ministerie &amp; seruice of God, to preach the knowledge of God to others, and to execute his ordinances and sacrifices. And as the first borne in families were thus to instruct and informe the whole familie, so the first borne in a nationall principalitie or kingdome were bound not onely to cominaund as ciuill magistrates, but to execute the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordinances of God as the chiefe Priests of that nation, as is euident by these reasons, and by the example of <hi>Melchisedeck.</hi> The same light may appeare though much darkened, in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient<note place="margin">Plato in politic. Arist. 3. de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub. Cic. 1. de di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinat. Clem.

               <p n="5">5. But here a question may be moued, If Kings by the law of nature were Priests, and the lawe of nature stand alwayes in force, not abrogated: why then are not Kings now Priests? For aunswere, first we say, that it was altered by a positiue lawe of God, as hereafter we shall declare: and therefore the same au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie that instituted this thing, hath also altered it. But it may be replied, that the positiue law of God which hath alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this thing, was partly ceremoniall, partly iudiciall: for these two dignities of the princedome and priesthood, which vnder the law of nature were combined in one person, were diuided vnder the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and distinctly set in two persons. <hi>Moses</hi> keeping the ciuill gouernment, and <hi>Aaron</hi> the Priesthood. The gouernment of <hi>Moses</hi> and his successours being more ciuil, The Priesthood of <hi>Aaron</hi> &amp; his successors ceremoniall; it followeth that this ancient ordinance of the law of nature was altered by such positiue lawes of God, which were either ciuil or ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall: and consequently that this alteration taketh not away the auncient right.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If I might therefore in a matter of this nature declare my poore opinion, leauing the censure hereof to the learned that are able to iudge: I take it, that as it is not simply vnlawfull
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7970:16"/>
that a King may be a Priest, and neuerthelesse keepe his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: so I suppose this thing cannot be done without not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a lawfull, but also an ordinarie calling from God, and from<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 4.</note> the Church: [For no man taketh this honour to himselfe, but he that was called thereto, as was <hi>Aaron.</hi>] And this cannot bee done without an ordinary calling: for when Kings were Priests, and the first borne sacrificers, as in the law of nature; then they had an ordinary calling therto: for that was then the ordinance of God, &amp; ordinarie in the Church, which now is not. But if a man were first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> Priest, and afterward aduanced to a kingdome by some Temporal right: in this case it were assuredly vnlawfull for him to shake off his holy estate, and betake himselfe wholly and only to his Temporall gouerment, as some Cardinals haue done. Then by the law of nature the King had both the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of order and Iurisdiction: and howsoeuer this is altered by a positiue ordinance of God, yet all is not taken away: there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth still that part of Iurisdiction, so farre as it standeth in power coactiue, in respect wherof the common law of this land<note place="margin">10. H. 7. 18.</note> saith, the King is <hi>persona mixta,</hi> because he hath both Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall and Temporall Iurisdiction.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This example of <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> both King and Priest, hath much lifted vp the Pope and his flatterers: for of this they take especiall hold, and thinke hereby to prooue the Pope to be King of the Church, because <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> was both King and Priest. But to this we aunswere, <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> had both these honours by a lawfull and ordinarie calling, but so hath not the Pope: for his Priesthood, we graunt he had once there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a lawfull calling, both by locall and doctrinall succession: which doctrinall succession <hi>Irenaeus</hi> calleth <hi>successionem princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palem: Tertullian, doctrinae co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sanguinitate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cum Apostolica Ecclesia:</hi>

Then to the office of a Bishop, the Pope may shew some colour, though the colour be now worne thredbare: but to the princely office which he claimeth ouer the Church, he can shew neither calling nor colour: so that the example of <hi>Melchisedek,</hi> which the Popes parasites drawe with such violence to him,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7970:17"/>
doth helpe him nothing, but rather helpeth the cause of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Kings against him: for it is certaine that Kings were Priests by an ordinary calling before these two offices were distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; but it can neuer be prooued that Priests were Kings by such an ordinary calling, after that these two offices were set in distinct persons. If any man suppose that we haue stretched the example of <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> too farre, because he was a type of Christ: I aunswere, this is nothing against my purpose, that <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> was a type of Christ. For many men in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary standing and executing ordinary functions, did also beare some type extraordinarie: thus did <hi>Moses, Ioshua, Dauid, Solomon,</hi> and others. I speake of <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> as I finde him in his ordinary place, a King, and a Priest.</p>
               <p n="8">8. By all which we conclude, that vnder the law of Nature Kings were in the beginning inuested with all power Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall both of orders and Iurisdiction: and therefore these things are not incompatible by nature. All this time which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted about the space of two thousand and fiue hundred yeeres, Kings had Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction without question. And therefore this Iurisdiction of Princes, which we haue vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to examine, is found aunswerable to the first gouernment of the world, vntill the time of the law giuen by <hi>Moses.</hi>

Then we find by an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall commaundement of God: these two offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of King and Priest were distinguished, and set in two seuerall persons: the one in <hi>Moses,</hi> the other in <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:7970:17"/>
And the tribe of <hi>Leui</hi> was taken to the seruice of God,<note place="margin">Num. 3. 12. &amp; 8. 6.</note> in stead of the first borne by an expresse commaundement: and the first borne which in number exceeded the number of the <hi>Louites,</hi> were redeemed by fiue shekels a man: for the number<note place="margin">Num. 3.</note> of the first borne was taken 22273. the number of the Leuites 22000. so that the number of the first borne exceeded the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Leuites by 273. These were redeemed, and after that redemption, the first borne of other tribes were discharged from the attendance of the seruice of God, &amp; the Leuites tooke vp their place. Now the Kings office and the Priests being thus distinguished, we must consider what things did properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to each office.</p>
               <p n="2">2. First we find that <hi>Moses,</hi> who had the place of a King in gouernement, as he is also called a King; doth consecrate <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 36, 31.</note> the Priest. <hi>Moses</hi> is commaunded to consecrate him and<note place="margin">Deut. 33. 5.</note> his son s <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. and performeth it, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 8. therefore it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, <hi>Num.</hi> 3. These are the names of the sonnes of <hi>Aaron</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 3. 3.</note> the anointed Priests, whom <hi>Moses</hi> did consecrate to minister in the Priests office. Heere then appeareth some Iurisdiction of <hi>Moses</hi> ouer <hi>Aaron.</hi> But this I meane not to vrge, for it may bee thought extraordinailry to belong to <hi>Moses</hi> as Gods Apostle or Ambassadour and lawgiuer vnto <hi>Israel:</hi> for in such great chaunges, as was from the law of Nature to the written law, somewhat must bee admitted extraordinary: and this I could be well content to vnderstand so: though many doubts arise for the princes right, against the Priests. For first it may be obiected, seeing there was a Prince and a Priest set vp di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct one from the other, why should the Prince consecrate the Priest, and not the Priest the Prince? But here we finde that <hi>Aaron</hi> doth not consecrate <hi>Moses</hi> to be Prince, but <hi>Moses</hi> doth consecrate <hi>Aaron</hi> to be Priest. Another doubt may be moued, why <hi>Moses</hi> should consecrate not onely <hi>Aaron,</hi> but his sonnes also. For though we should admit the consecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> to be done by <hi>Moses</hi> of necessitie, as a thing extraordinary at the first beginning of this Priesthood: yet this necessitie appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not so much in <hi>Aarons</hi> sonnes: for they might haue beene consecrated by <hi>Aaron,</hi> after that himselfe had bene once conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7970:18"/>
by <hi>Moses.</hi> And yet we find that the consecration of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> and his sonnes, is done altogether by <hi>Moses.</hi> These things though they make faire shew for the Princes Iurisdiction Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall ouer Priests, yet wee purpose not to stand vpon them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But when the Priest was once consecrated and ordained, and all things fully perfected concerning his function, and two seuerall and distinct functions set vp: then will appeare without faile in <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; his successors the right of Princes, in <hi>Aaron</hi> &amp; his successors the right of Priests. After all things thus perfected, we finde that all the lawes which in truth proceeded original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God, were established by the authoritie of <hi>Moses:</hi> and this we finde true, not onely in Iudiciall and Ciuill Lawes, which were to rule that state; but euen in ceremoniall and Morall Lawes which were to rule the Church. There is not so much as one ceremoniall law established by the authoritie of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but in all the name and authoritie of <hi>Moses</hi> is expressed: only we finde concerning <hi>Aaron,</hi> that if any doubt in the lawes ceremoniall did arise, for the interpretation of those lawes and of such doubts, the high Priest must sit as iudge. For the people are charged in matters that are hard, to consult with the Priest and ciuill iudge, <hi>Deut. 17. 8. &amp;c.</hi> Which the learned interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vnderstand thus: that if the cause be mixt, partly Ciuill, partly Ceremoniall, or doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>full; that then both the Ciuill Magistrate and the Priest must iointly determine it: but if the people haue distinct causes, some Ciuill, other Ceremoniall, the Ciuill Magistrate must iudge the causes Ciuill, and the Priest must iudge the causes Ceremoniall: from the consideration of which place we may drawe certaine inferences.</p>
               <p n="4">4. First, all Lawes euen Ceremoniall, that is, Lawes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Spirituall or Canon Lawes are answerable, are established by the authoritie of the Ciuill Magistrate. This taketh away all authoritie of the Popes Canon law, in all Christian kingdomes, where it is not established by the authoritie of Kings in their kingdomes. For it is against all rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>on, and rules; whether we looke vpon the light of nature, or vpon the Scriptures, or the lawfull practife of authoritie since the Scriptures were written,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7970:18"/>
that any Lawes should be imposed vpon a Prince against or without his consent: as the Popes haue indeuoured to impose the Canon Lawes vpon Princes. And this appeareth in the practise of Christian Magistrates, so long as lawfull authoritie stood up without confusion in the world. But heere we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fountaine of that practise, which was from Gods Law: wherein we see all Lawes confirmed and established by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Ciuill Magistrate. And if it could bee prooued, that in some Lawes Ceremoniall the authoritie of <hi>Aaron</hi> was requisite, yet this helpeth them nothing that plead for the Popes Canons. For these men would impose these Canons vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Princes without their consent: but in all these Lawes of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> (wherein is a perfect patterne for all law-makers) they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not shew one Law, though neuer so nearely concerning the Church, which is established without the authoritie of <hi>Moses</hi> the Ciuill Magistrate. If they obiect, these things were all done by an especiall commaundement of God, I aunswere this doth more establish the authoritie of Princes, and confirme our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: for let them aunswere, why God would haue all these things established by the Ciuill Magistrate, and not by the Priest? This then maketh a greater and clearer confirmation of the Princes right. Then the Church may interpret Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, determine controuersies of faith, but cannot establish a Law: the reason is, because for the establishing of Lawes, coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue power is requisite, which is in the Ciuil Magistrate, &amp; not in the Church. And therefore the Canon Lawes can haue no force of lawes, but as they are receiued and established by Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their seuerall kingdomes. For neither can the law haue the force of a law without coactiue power, neither hath the Pope any coactiue power in the kingdomes of other Princes; but onely in such places where himselfe is a Temporall Prince.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Secondly we obserue that the high Priest is appointed by God a iudge for interpretation of those lawes that concerne the Church, in questions of conscience, in causes mixt, or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. This might moderate the humours of some, who in loue to innouation would leaue no place of iudicature to Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall persons: for these things are insert into <hi>Moses</hi> lawe, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7970:19"/>
from the law of Nature, and not as things Ceremoniall: which thing is apparant from the end, vse, and necessitie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for the things which had a necessary vse before the written law, and must haue a necessary vse after the abrogation of that law, must be acknowledged to be taken from a perpetuall law: because there must be a perpetuall rule for a perpetuall necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This then being perpetuall and necessary (matters of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and of Ecclesiasticall audience still arising) the hearing and iudging of such things, belong to such as are most skilfull in those affaires. And hence is the iudicature of fuch things as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to the Priest: which right of Ecclesiasticall iudgements and courts, standeth no lesse now due to them in the time of grace, then it was under the law: because this office in iugde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hearing, and determining, is not heere giuen to Priests as a thing Ceremoniall, but as I haue declared, deriued from the law of Nature, as a perpetuall seruice for a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall vse.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Thirdly we consider that the lawes Ecclesiastical are establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by the authoritie of the Ciuill Magistrate, but for interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them the Priest is appointed to iudge. Hence riseth the ground of Iurisdiction both Temporall and Spirituall: wee consider Iurisdiction here as our question importeth, authority coactiue in externall iudicature in the execution of lawes. The fountaine of this authoritie is in him principally, by whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie the law is established, and without whose authoritie it is not. The execution of this authoritie is in them that are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed iudges. And heerein there is no difference betweene Temporall and Ecclesiasticall authoritie, I speake not nowe of Spirituall gouernment by the lawes of God, executed within the court of Conscience, but of Ecclesiasticall gouernment in the execution of lawes Ecclesiasticall, wherin there is vse of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actiue power. These two things being in themselues, and in nature so distinct, if this one distinction might be remembred, it is ynough to aunswere all the confused collections of that Catholike Diuine, who wrote of late against the fift part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of the Lord <hi>Cooke.</hi> For all that hee writeth there, resting vpon no other ground, then vpon the confounding of Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7970:19"/>
and Ecclesiasticall power, is answered in one word, by this one poore distinction betweene these two powers. Now the distinction is apparant: because in Spirituall gouernment there is no coactiue power: but in Ecclesiasticall iudicature there is coactiue power: which maketh an euident and famous dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in Iurisdiction: because this is most certaine, that all that Iurisdiction wherin coactiue power is vsed, is from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Magistrate. Then if these two gouernments, I meane Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall and Temporal, be directed by coactiue power, there is no difference in the point of Iurisdiction betweene Temporall and Ecclesiasticall authoritie. For the King and only the King is to appoint iudges in matters Temporall and Ecclesiasticall, the King hath no more authoritie in reuersing the iudgement of the one, then of the other, being true, iust, and lawfull. So that the Kings Iurisdiction standeth not in a power to dissanull true and righteous iudgemens, but in a power supereminent, by which he is charged: First, to confirme lawes Ecclesiasticall and Temporall, Secondly, to place Iudges for both causes, Thirdly, to see that those iudges of both sortes iudge iustly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to right and equity, Fourthly, to punish them if they shall be found to giue vniust and corrupt sentences, Fiftly, and last of all, his Iurisdiction appeareth in appellations.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But heere a question will be moued, whether a man may appeale from an Ecclesiasticall iudge to the Prince. For that one may appeale from a Temporall iudge, I suppose it is not doubted, at least I see no reason why it should be doubted. But in a cause Ecclesiasticall and from a iudge Ecclesiasticall to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to the Temporall Magistrate, of this some Romish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors doubt. This doubt which the Canonists haue made, may be increased by that place, <hi>Deu.</hi> 17. 10. [Thou shalt not decline from that thing which they shall shew thee, neither to the right<note place="margin">Deut. 17. 12<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>.</note> hand nor to the left. And that man that will do presumptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not hearkning to the Priest that standeth before the Lord thy God to minister there, or vnto the iudge that man shall die.] It might seeme to be collected hence, that there is no appellation from the Priest, no though hee should iudge as some Rabbins expound the words. I will declare their exposition because it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7970:20"/>
sauoureth much like the expositions of some Papists, where the text saith, thou shalt not decline to the right hand, nor to the left, they expound it; that if the Priest shall say thy right hand is thy left, or thy left is thy right: this sentence thou must receiue<note place="margin">Verse 11.</note> and therein rest.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But this is a fond assertion, not only without reason, but against the expresse words of the Scripture: for it is said, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law which shall teach thee, and according to the iudgement which they shall tell thee, thou shalt doe. Where we finde two rules for these two kindes of Iudges, the Priest and the iudge: the sentence of the Priest, must be according to the written lawe: the sentence of the other according to the truth of iustice and iudgement. If a man be able to shew that he is wronged, he may vndoubtedly appeale to a Superiour: now a man may be able to shew that he is wronged, if hee can shew that the Priest declineth from the law of God, which is appointed his rule, or the Temporall iudge from iustice. And therefore if there be a Superiour in the land, he may appeale: but if there be no Superiour, he is without remedie; as when <hi>Hely</hi> was both Priest and iudge: from him at that time there could be no appellation. but where the forme of a kingdome is established, where one King is set vp in lawfull authoritie, by whose power iudges Spirituall and Temporall are placed in his dominions: heere appeareth a fountaine of Iurisdiction, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as it were into two inferiour riuers: and from these inferior powers appellation may be brought, if they shall not in their sentences, keepe their rules prescribed to them, the lawe and iustice: for the appellation being grounded vpon the lawe of Nature, to moderate the peruersitie and partialitie of iudges, it were an absurd thing to denie this in causes Ecclesiasticall, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse a man would suppose that persons Ecclesiasticall may not be corrupt in their iudgements. Now if we shall once graunt appellations, then assuredly wee confirme the Iurisdiction of Princes in all matters wherein appellation may bee made to them. And because Iurisdiction is assuredly proued by appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, we will for the farther manifestation of the truth, seeke to cleere this point: the rather bec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7970:20"/>
confidently, that in matters Ecclesiasticall, all appellation belongeth to the Pope. The Popes say so, and they beleeue them: we hold that appellation in causes Ecclesiasticall is to bee directed to the King, who is by God set ouer the persons appellant.</p>
               <p n="9">9. In the Old Testament we haue fewe examples, or none, that I remember; of any that appealed from any inferior iudge Ecclesiasticall to the Soueraigne: but in the New Testament there is one example sufficient to confirme the truth. S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 25. &amp; 23.</note> being accused for causes Ecclesiasticall, appealed from the high Priest to <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The consequence resteth vpon this, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> heerein did nothing but that which he might doe iustly and lawfully: which thing I suppose the greatest enemie of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, will not denie: for he came vp to Ierusalem with this profession and purpose. [I am ready not to bee bound onely,<note place="margin">Act. 21. 13.</note> but euen to die for the name of the Lord Iesus. Neither durst he for sauing of his life, giue a scandall to the Gospell.] The antecedent consisteth of these two parts, First that the matters for which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was accused, were matters Ecclesiasticall: Secondly, that therein he appealed from the high Priest: both are witnessed by the expresse words of the Scripture. For <hi>Festus</hi>

Ecclesiasticall, a man may appeale from iudges Ecclesiasticall to the Soueraigne Prince. Whereupon this vndoubtedly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that there resteth Soueraigne Iurisdiction in the Prince. And therefore the Popes &amp; their flatterers vnderstanding well, that Supreame Iurisdiction could neuer bee prooued to rest in the Popes, vnlesse first Appellation should be made to them, wrought by all subtilty, as hereafter we shall declare (by right or wrong they neither cared nor spared) to cause Appellations to be made to them: which thing when once they had obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that in all causes Ecclesiasticall Appellation might be made to the Popes: then and not before, this opinion was r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>olued, that Supreame Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction was in the Popes. And therefore we prouing that Supreame and last Appellation doth by the law of God, belong to none but to the Soueraigne Prince; conclude vndoubtedly that Supreame Iurisdiction belongeth to him onely.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Heere a question may be mooued, whether Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did well and orderly when he appealed to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and whether <hi>Caesar</hi> was made iudge of these questions, which were Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.

But whereas hee was perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the high Priests, who sought his life; in this matter of coactiue power Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giueth Iurisdiction to <hi>Caesar.</hi> There is also a difference betweene that power which heathen Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue, and that which Christian Princes haue: for heathen Princes haue all power coactiue whatsoeuer the cause be: and without this helpe the Church could neuer deale in matters of this nature.

But here let me remember a trifling obiection, which<note place="margin">Answere to the first part of reports, c. 9.</note> some of our aduersaries haue deuised of late, they would distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish betweene command and Iurisdiction: For they deny not but that all sortes of persons are vnder the Kings commaund and gouernment: whom he may command, each to doe their Office, and yet they vtterly deny the Kings Iurisdiction: and tell vs that command and Iurisdiction must not be hudled vp together. Now let vs consider what hudling is in this, when the Kings command and his Iurisdiction are set as things depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and cohaering one to the other. When we say the King may command, we meane plainely as we speake, that the King hath from God lawfull authoritie to command, and to punish them that breake his command: This is the common vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the Kings command, But these Romish sophisters when they say the King may command, do not vnderstand, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they acknowledge at any hand, that the King hath lawfull authoritie from God, to punish the breach of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: for they vtterly deny that the King hath any authoritie to punish a Clarke, though he should breake his commandement. And call you this a command? The King may command and goe without, as the saying is. This is the deuils sophistry, taken vp by men hardned against shame, content to stoupe downe to gather vp the meanest and basest shifts to dazell the simple. The Iesuites resolue of this, as of a truth most soundly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in their schooles: That the King may not punish Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall persons: that the Kings Court may not heare, examine and iudge them, though they should commit murders, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, robberies, or what other wickednesse soeuer. And yet they tell vs, that the King may command them. Now to say one thing, and yet to let the world see, that they are resolued in the contrary: this sauoreth strongly of the spirit of illusion, when reason, learning, honestie and all faileth, yet well fare a bold and hardned face, which neuer faileth this generation.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The truth is, if the King haue not lawfull authority to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7970:22"/>
punish, he hath not lawfull authoritie to command, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish he cannot vnlesse he hath authority to iudge, or cause iudgement to be done; so that they who take away from the King power to iudge persons Ecclesiasticall, take from him power to punish, and consequently power to command: but the Doctrine of the Papists this day, (as shall hereafter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in his due place) taketh from the king power to iudge per sons Ecclesiastical, therefore, they rob him of power to punish, and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund; for nothing can more strongly take away the Kings command, then to deny him power to punish and to iudge. And yet they are not ashamed to tell vs, that they deny not the kings co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, but his Iurisdiction. Then to leaue these men with their absurd and perplexed contradictions: where the King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ay command, he may iudge and punish the breach of that command, and therefore his Iurisdiction appeareth in his lawfull authority and command. Then by this charge and commaund of <hi>Iehosaph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> is declared his Iurisdiction in these causes, wherein he hath this authority to command: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Kings command is but as the word of a priuat man, or of a child, if he haue not power to iudge and punish.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Moreouer whereas <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> commandeth the Priests and Leuites to iudge betweene blood and blood, Law and precepts, statutes and iudgements: In things that concerned questions of blood, as when blood was shed by casualtie, in which case the party offending, had remedy by sanctuary, and the high Priest was the immediat iudge; as also in matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning lawes, precepts, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>tutes, iudgements, that is ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ceremoniall or morall: In these things stood the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall Iurisdiction which then was practised in the Church, for to take that distinction which we must often remember in this question, it is confessed that all Ecclesiasticall power is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of order or Iurisdiction. In both which the King hath a part, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t differently: In the power of orders, the Kings part and office, was to see that things of that nature were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly done, and the breach thereof punished, but himselfe was not to execute any thing, whereunto the Priests were apointed, by the power of their orders, as to offer incense, &amp;c. Wherefore
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7970:23"/>
                  <hi>Vzziah</hi> was smitten with leprosie for medling with that part of<note place="margin">2. Chron. 26.</note> the Priests office. Now Iurisdiction is diuided into power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, which as often wee haue said, belongeth not to the King; and power externall: which power externall when it is coactiue, is nothing but that which wee call the Kings Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, though it be in matters Ecclesiastical. And this Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is here testified to be in <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> and from him deriued to all, to all iudges vnder him, both Temporall and Ecclesiasticall. For as he commaunded the Temporall iudges, so in like sort he commaunded the Ecclesiasticall. And as the Ecclesiasticall iudges might replie (if they had bene such as now these are of the Romane Clergie) that Ecclesiasticall iudgements were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and the cause of God, and not of the King: so doth the King witnesse of Temporall iudgements, for speaking to Temporall iudges, he saith: you execute not the iudgements of man, but of the Lord. Then Temporall iudgements are the Lords cause aswell as Ecclesiasticall, and herein they differ not.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Now this Iurisdiction which is in coactiue power wee prooue to be in the King, and onely in the King. (I speake ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the forme of the state of Israel in those dayes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we now speake, aunswerable to which is the Soueraigne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate in any other state.) This right I say, we prooue to bee onely in the King, and from him deriued to other iudges both Temporall and Spirituall, by these reasons: first the King, and<note place="margin">1.</note> onely the King commaundeth both iudges to doe their duties in their seuerall places, and hath lawfull power to punish them if they doe otherwise: therfore the Kings Iurisdiction coactiue is ouer both sorts alike. The antecedent hath two parts, the first drawen from the expresse words of the Scripture in this text: the second followeth by a necessitie. For the commaund of a King is ridiculous, and no commaund vnlesse he haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to punish. The consequence followeth by the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Iurisdiction, which will prooue the second part of the antecedent. For this Iurisdiction for which we plead, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by the most learned of the Church of Rome, authority co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actiue. If it be authoritie, it may command; if coactiue it may punish: then it followeth, that where <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> had first au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7970:23"/>
to commaund and last to punish, that questionlesse hee had this Soueraigne Iurisdiction.</p>
               <p n="16">16. If against this any obiect, that the King may command in matters of orders, of preaching the Word, administring the Sacraments, &amp;c. In all these things the King may lawfully command the parties to doe their duties, and may punish them if they doe otherwise: and yet no man will put the Kings Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in these matters of orders, Preaching, Sacraments, &amp;c. For aunswere, let me intreat the reader with attention to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider these three things: First to commaund, secondly to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute; thirdly to punish. Iurisdiction standeth wholly in the first and last, and nothing at all in the second: that is, in authoritie and not in action. So that though the King should execute a thing which belongeth to his office, yet in the execution ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, his Iurisdiction should not appeare, howsoeuer his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, knowledge, and actiue vertues might appeare therein: for Iurisdiction is in the authoritie of commaunding, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of punishing, and supereminence that riseth from both. And therefore in the preaching of the Word, administration of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, the King hath no part; because therein Iurisdiction standeth not: these things being matters of execution not of commaund: but the authoritie to commaund these things, by making or vrging lawes for them: and to punish the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion by corporall punishments; this because it includeth coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue power, is in the Soueraigne Magistrate onely. If the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate should either neglect his dutie, as the heathen did; or commaund false doctrines to be preached, as the Arian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours did: in this case the Church hath warrant to maintaine the truth, but without tumults and rebellion, and rather in patience to loose their liues then to forgo any part of the truth.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Another reason to prooue this Soueraigne authoritie<note place="margin">2.</note> coactiue to be only in the King, and from him respectiuely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued to both sorts of iudges, may thus bee drawen. For the iudges Temporall, there is not so much question made: all the doubt is of iudges Ecclesiasticall, the chiefe of which iudges Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall in the Church of Israel, was the high Priest. Then this Iurisdiction whereof we speake must be confessed to haue
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7970:24"/>
been principally and originally, either in the king or in the high Priest: but in the high Priest it was not, Therefore in the King it must be. That it was not in the high Priest, we proue by these reasons. The high Priest is commaunded, corrected, punished and deposed by the King, and not the King by the Priest: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Soueraigne Iurisdiction is not in the high Priest, but in the King. Againe, the high Priests did neuer practise coactiue authoritie, vnlesse when they were Soueraigne Magistrates, as sometimes the high Priests in Israel were, but as high Priest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> they had no such power: for the causes betweene blood and blood; which were of their cognisance, are by the interpreters vnderdood such cases, wherein a man was killed by chaunce, without the purpose, or against the will of the offender: in which case the high Priest might graunt him the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>uiledge of sanctuary: and so deliuer him from the auenger of blood: but he had no power coactiue to inflict death, or such punishments at his pleasure: which trueth was so constantly receiued and preserued in the Church afterward, that euen in the greatest power &amp; highest ruffe of Poperie, the Church of Rome did not take this full <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>oactiue power, but onely proceeded to degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then to deliuer men vp to the secular powers: which was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ecret confession that they had no right to this power coactiue, though they had vsurped many parts thereof.</p>
               <p n="18">18. A third reason to prooue this authoritie to bee in the Ciuill Magistrate, is as I teached before, confirmed by the right<note place="margin">3.</note> of Appellations. For in matters of coactiue Iurisdiction, a man might appeale from the high Priest to the King, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did to <hi>Caesar:</hi> which was vtterly vnlawfull for him to doe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he might as lawfully haue appealed to a King, if that state of Israel had then beene ruled by a King, as at other times it was. For that right which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giueth to <hi>Nero,</hi> to heare Appellations, he would vndoubtedly yeeld to <hi>Dauid,</hi> or <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>as,</hi> or any other godly King in his owne Dominions. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it followeth, that either Saint <hi>Paul</hi> must be condemned for yeelding an vnlawful power to Emperors: or Kings must haue the same priuiledge: which thing being admitted in matters Ecclesiasticall, doth inuincibly prooue the Kings Iurisdiction
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7970:24"/>

                  </gap>ther, and by this comparison wee shall euidently know the truth: for we find the Prince called a God, not onely in respect of the people, but in respect of the Priest also. Where the Lord himselfe speaketh to <hi>Moses</hi> of <hi>Aaron</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:7970:25"/>
comparing their power and offices together, he saith thus: [He<note place="margin">Exod. 4. 16.</note> shall be thy spokesman vnto the people, and he shall be as thy mouth, and thou shalt be to him in stead of God.] In this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of these two great offices, <hi>Moses</hi> is the directour; <hi>Aaron</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Moses Legislator &amp; interpres Dei.</note> the interpretour and preacher. Where the Prince or Soueraign Magistrate is called a God, not onely in respect of the people, as in diuers other Scriptures: but in respect of the Priest, thou shalt be to him, euen to <hi>Aaron,</hi> as a God. We find then that the Prince is called a God in respect of the Priest, but we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer find that the Priest is called a God in respect of the Prince. This declareth a Soueraigne authoritie of the Prince in matters of God, and of Gods true Religion. For he who by his office is to establish true Religion in his dominions, doth heerein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present a liuely ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="20">20. And this our Sauiour Christ confirmeth, for whereas <hi>Psal.</hi> 82. They are called Gods, I haue said you are Gods; Our Lord expoundeth that place, declaring in what sense they are so called. For he saith: [If he called them Gods, vnto whom the<note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 35.</note> word of God was giuen, and the Scripture cannot be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, &amp;c.] Then the Magistrates who are here called Gods, are such to whom the word of God is giuen. For further declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truth, let this question be demaunded: to whom is the word of God principally giuen? to whose Soueraigne cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodie is the word of God committed? The words of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ containe an aunswere, to the Ciuill Magistrate. For it is certaine that all that Psalme whence Christ taketh those words, is wholly and intirely vnderstood of the Ciuill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and not of Priests or Ecclesiasticall gouernours. Why then? and is not the word of God giuen to Ecclesiasticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours aswell as to Kings? Yes verily, but diuersly: for to Ecclesiasticall gouernours the knowledge of the word is giuen to publish by preaching. [For the Priests lippes shall preserue<note place="margin">Malach. 2. 7.</note> knowledge, and they shall seeke the law at his mouth; for hee is the messenger of the Lord of hostes.] Then if the question be asked, to whom is the word giuen by the way of knowledge
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7970:25"/>
to preach and publish it? The answere is, to the Priest: but Christ speaketh not here of that manner of giuing the word, but he toucheth that Commission which is giuen to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates. For to Magistrates it is not giuen by way of especiall knowledge to preach it; but by way of an especiall commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to keepe it, to establih it by authoritie, to command obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto it, and to punish the violatours of it. This is the authority of a Christian Prince, for he hath called them Gods to whom the word was giuen: Whom hath hee called Gods? Ciuill Princes: for of such, onely of such, that Psalme speaketh. Why are they called Gods? Because they are Gods vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents by their authority to establish Gods word.

But that <hi>Moses</hi> was no Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>st, we prooue thus. If he were a Priest, it must be either before that <hi>Aaron</hi> and his successors were assumed to that Office, or after. Before the law assumed <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sonnes to be Priests <hi>Moses</hi> could not bee Priest, because the Priesthood was annexed to the birth-right. But <hi>Moses</hi> was not the first borne of <hi>Amram,</hi> but <hi>Aaron</hi> was the eldest, for we read <hi>Num.</hi> 33. <hi>Aaron</hi> was one hundred twentie<note place="margin">Num. 33. 39.</note> three yeares old when he died. But <hi>Moses</hi> out liuing <hi>Aaron</hi> was but one hundred twenty yeares old when he dyed. <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.<note place="margin">Deut. 34. 7.</note> Theresore <hi>Aaron</hi> was questionlesse the elder brother. If any obiect that the birth-right was sometimes taken from the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest by an especiall appointment of God, as appeareth in <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Iacob;</hi> I answere, this cannot help in this point, for <hi>Aaron</hi> was so farre from loosing this priuiledge of his birth-right, by any appointment of God, that he had the Priesthood famous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed to him and to his posterity. So that neither by the law of nature, nor by any precept of God, can <hi>Aaron</hi> be said to loofe any priuiledge that belonged to the Priesthood. Then before the institution of the Leuiticall Priesthood, <hi>Moses</hi> could not be Priest. After the institution thereof, the Priesthood was so appropriated to <hi>Aarons</hi> house, that none could be Priests but <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sonnes onely. Therefore it was not possible that <hi>Moses</hi> could be a Priest at all, either before the consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Aaron,</hi> or after.</p>
               <p n="22">22 Another reason may be drawn from those places, which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7970:26"/>
declare that <hi>Iosua</hi> was appointed by God to succeede <hi>Moses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 27. 17. 18.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 31. 14.</note> and to gouerne as he did. In all which places it appeareth, that<note place="margin">Ios. 1. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Iosua</hi> succeeded <hi>Moses</hi> in his place and function, and was that in Israel, in his time, which <hi>Moses</hi> was before him. But it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that <hi>Iosua</hi> was no Priest: therfore as certaine that <hi>Moses</hi> was no Priest. For <hi>Iosua</hi> was the full and entire successour of <hi>Moses.</hi> The same appeareth by the whole course of <hi>Moses</hi> his gouernment. Who commandeth as a Prince, is obeyed as a Prince, both by the Priests and people. By which command in matters temporall and ecclesiasticall: if they suppose that a Priesthood is proued: by the same reason all the Kings of Israel may as well be concluded to haue been Priests. For they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded in all such thinges as <hi>Moses</hi> did. Some obiect that <hi>Moses</hi> sacrificed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. But this obiection is friuolous. For the words of the Scripture are against it. It is expresly said, that<note place="margin">Exod. 24. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Moses</hi> sent young men to sacrifice: these were the first borne of the 12 Tribes. For this was before the institution of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticall Priesthood. If any obiect that <hi>Moses</hi> did something which might seeme to belong to the office of a Priest: I answer, so did the Kings of Israell some things which might seeme to belong to the office of a Priest. For <hi>Iosias,</hi> when all the people were gathered together, read in their eares all the words of<note place="margin">2. Reg. 23. 2.</note> the booke of the couenant. Which thing might seeme to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Priests office. So true is that principle of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, founded vpon the profound principles of diuinitie and good gouernment: <hi>Rex est persona mixta;</hi> because he hath both temporall and ecclesiasticall iurisdiction.</p>
               <p n="23">23 And thus haue wee declared the Kings right vnder the Law; from the precept of the Law, &amp; practise of godly Kings. Thus did <hi>Ezekiah,</hi> thus did <hi>Iosiah,</hi> and others: and in so doing, they vsurped no vnlawfull power, but stood faithfull in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that lawfull right, which GOD committed to them. From this commission they may not turne either to the right hand, or to the left. For as it was a great sinne in <hi>Vzziah</hi> on<note place="margin">2. Chron. 26.</note> the one side, to vsurpe the Priests office: so should it be a great sinne on the other side, for a King to neglect any part of a Kings office. From all which, wee collect the power of a Prince in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7970:27"/>
matters ecclesiasticall to stand in these things. He is to establish all ecclesiasticall Lawes, for which no power is sufficient with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his. Neither is it reason that they should establish Lawes, in whom there is no power to defend and maintaine the Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie of those Lawes so made. He is to punish all transgressours of those Lawes, hee is to appoint ecclesiasticall Ministers their places, to be Iudges in matters of ecclesiasticall Lawes: and if they offend, to punish them, hee may place and displace accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their merits: So <hi>Salomon</hi> displaced <hi>Abiathar,</hi> &amp; made <hi>Zadock</hi> high Priest in his roome. But because of late, suborned <hi>Mat. Tortus</hi> speaking of this example, saith, that <hi>Salomon</hi> did displace the high Priest as he was a Prophet, not as hee was a King: let vs by the way open the vanity of this shift. The fault that <hi>Abiathar</hi> had committed was worthy of death, as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith: [Thou art worthy of death.] But yet hee shewed him<note place="margin">1. Reg 2. 26.</note> mercy, because hee had borne the Arke of the Lord before his Father <hi>Dauid,</hi> and had suffered in all things wherein <hi>Dauid</hi> was afflicted. So that the thing which <hi>Salomon</hi> did to <hi>Abiathar,</hi> he did as iudge of life and death. To be a Iudge of life &amp; death, was not the osfice of a Prophet, but of the King: therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> did it not as a Prophet, but as a King. Againe, the Prophets office was extraordinary, but this thing is so far from an extraordinary example, that wee see rather that <hi>Salomon</hi> doth mitigate the ordinary punishment of that crime which <hi>Abiathar</hi> had committed. Moreouer, to punish or to release the punishment of treason, belongeth not to the office of a Prophet, but of the King: but <hi>Salomon</hi> in this action punishing the treason of <hi>Abiathar,</hi> releaseth some part of it. All which proue the distorted shift of <hi>Tortus,</hi> to be so vaine and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, that the blushing Hat of a Cardinall, is not broad enough to couer the shame. In these things, and in supreame appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, standeth Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, which by diuine right was placed in these Kings, and by them practised.</p>

But when the Church of Rome grew insolent by abusing this blessing, taking the right of Princes from them, and thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing the ancient bounds of the Ordinances which God had set of old, then it was not to bee marueiled, that such iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments followed of blindnesse and ignorance among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of confusion and contempt vpon Princes and Kings: which iudgements haue beene so famously apparant in the sight of the world. But let vs proceed to the examination of the Churches Iurisdiction, for if we consider what Iurisdiction Iesus Christ left to his Church, it will consequently appeare what Iurisdiction is in Ciuill Princes: for all that Christ gaue not to his Church, remaineth with Princes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The places from which they would prooue Iurisdiction,<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 18.</note> are these: <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. [Whatsoeuer you shall binde on earth,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7970:28"/>
shall be bound in heauen.] And, [whosoeuers sinnes you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,<note place="margin">Joh. 20. 23.</note> shall be retained.] Now these places make no proofe of this Iurisdiction which is in question. For all Popish writers that I could see vpon this question, acknowledg these Scripturs not to be meant of externall Iurisdiction coactiue, which is our question, but of the inward power of remitting of sinnes, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised within the court of conscience by the power of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and declared by the Priest, and ordinarily practised in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, or otherwise. The greater condemnation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth<note place="margin">Answere to the fift part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.</note> that Catholike Diuine, who to disprooue the Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Princes, and to proue the Popes pretended Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bringeth these places of Scripture which speake of neither. Other places they cite, as that: [Thou art <hi>Peter,</hi> and vpon this<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 18.</note> rocke will I build my Church: and I will giue to thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen.] And, [<hi>Simon</hi> louest thou mee?<note place="margin">Joh. 20. 15.</note> feede my Lambes, &amp;c.] These and such like places they bring to proue the Popes Iurisdiction. All of this sort are throughly handled with exact iudgement and learning, in that worthy conference written by Doctor <hi>Raynolds</hi> of blessed memory: which booke as a gantlet of one of the worthies of our Church hath lien long betweene vs, and the host of the Philistims: and none of our adue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>saries hath had the courage to take it vp and to aunswere it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is sufficient for vs to pleade, that none of the auncient Fathers did euer expound these Scriptures thus; or did euer dreame of such senses, as they haue found of late out of their owne decretall Epistles. It is sufficient that some of their owne best learned writers, yea some of their most learned Popes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were Popes; haue with such learning and iudgement refuted their new deuised expositions of these Scriptures, as that from themselues and out of their owne mouthes, God hath drawen testimonies to ouerthrow these carnall and absurd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of Scriptures. <hi>Iohn Gerson</hi> saith, that these texts thus by the Popes flatterers applied to prooue his Iurisdiction, are<note place="margin">Serm. pro viagio regis Rom. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rec. 1.</note> vnderstood by them: <hi>Grossé &amp; non secundum regulam Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam.</hi> And <hi>Aenaeas Siluius,</hi> hath with great life and learning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowen<note place="margin">Lib. de gestis Basil. consil.</note> these grosse and corrupt expositions: of whom we
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7970:28"/>
shall speake hereafter in due place, where it will fully appeare that these expositions of Scripture are by the learned, free, and iudicious men of that side, acknowledged to bee inuented by flatterers, as the same Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the second, witnesseth: to be new and straunge, and to be vrged by miserable and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched soules, which will not vnderstand that these challenges of their Iurisdiction, are nothing but either the words of the Popes themselues; that would inlarge their fringes without measure: or of their flatterers who being blinded by ambition, and caried with the winde of vaineglory, doe flatter the Popes in hope of reward. Though now those flatterers haue got<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> the vpper hand in the Councell of Trent; and haue vsurped the name of the Church, who before were alwayes esteemed a base company, standing for the Popes Iurisdiction against the graue and learned men of that Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then for the places of Scripture which they bring for this Iurisdiction, we say with their owne best learned men, that they are (in that sense wherein they vse them) new deuises drawen of late by strange and absurd contortions into this new flattering sense, by the Popes flatterers, against the auncient expositions of the Fathers and Doctors of the Church. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Iurisdiction which Christ left to his Church, let all the Scriptures be searched, and there will nothing be found of externall Iurisdiction consisting in power coactiue: but all that Christ left was partly, yea principally, inward and spirituall power, partly externall for establishing doctrines of faith and good order in the Church, by Councels, determinations, iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, spirituall censures, excommunication: deposing and dispatching of the disobedient, so farre as the Church could proceede without coactiue power. For by this spirituall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er without coaction, the Church was called, faith was planted, diuils were subdued, the nations were taken out of the power of darkenesse, the world was reduced to the obedience of Christ; by this power the Church was gouerned for three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres together without any coactiue Iurisdiction. But what coactiue power may worke in the Church without this, we haue a lamentable experience in the present court of Rome,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7970:29"/>
falling away from the truth, and from the comfort of the spirit, and therefore from the true vse of the power of the spirit of God: when the Popes being destitute of this power of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, tooke vpon them power aboue the Ciuill Magistrate, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising wholly coactiue power which they called Spirituall, when they had forsaken the power of the spirit and reiected it from them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Iurisdiction which the Apostles practised was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the commission of Christ, spirituall: partly from the law of Nature, and from the example of that gouernment which was established in the Church of the Iewes. The things which belonged to Apostolicall Iurisdiction, either concerned the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the ministery, or of the whole Church. Touching the gouernement of the ministery, these things belonged to the Apostles so long as they liued, and afterward to Bishops their successours. First a power to ordaine ministers, Thus did<note place="margin">1.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> when they called Churches through Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caonia, Pisidia, and Pamphylia: [They ordained Elders in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">Act. 14. 23.</note> Church.] Elders, that is, Pastors, Preachers to preserue the Doctrine continually which the Apostles had once planted. And this charge to ordaine Elders or Priests, did the Apostles leaue also to them that succeeded in the gouernement of the Church. This commission Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gaue to <hi>Titus.</hi> [For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldest continue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse<note place="margin">Titus 1. 5.</note> the things that remaine, and ordaine Elders in euery city, as I appointed thee:] which ordaining signifieth also institution in the place or cure they ministred in.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Apostles had also in themselues, and left to their successours, power and Iurisdiction to command those Pastors<note place="margin">2.</note> which thus they had ordained, to preach the truth without mixture of false doctrines. This power as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had in himselfe, so he left the same to <hi>Timothie,</hi> and consequently to others. [As I besought thee to abide still in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> when I<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 3.</note> departed to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> so doe, that thou maist command some that they teach no other doctrine.] These were the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall parts of Iurisdiction which the Apostles left to their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, to continue in the Church for euer. For the end and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7970:29"/>
vse of this gouernment is perpetuall, as to ordaine Preachers, and to see that they so ordained, should teach the truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heresie. It followeth certainely, that such gouernours as the Apostles themselues ordained in the Church for these perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vses, are to remaine perpetuall gouernours in the Church. Thus was the gouernement of Bishops placed by the Apostles, to stand and continue till the end of the world, because the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles placed such for the ordination of ministers, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of true Doctrines. For they who aunswere that these offices and places wherin the Apostles placed <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> were either extraordinarie, or to indure for a short time, do not consider the end and vse of these places: which end and vse is neither extraordinary nor temporary, but ordinary and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall. For ministers must be ordained, &amp; commanded to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the truth without heresie, as long as the Church standeth. Then the necessitie and vse of the ends, will prooue the like necessitie and vse of these gouernours, which by the Apostles were placed for these endes.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Another part of this Iurisdiction, and depending vpon the last, was that which the Apostle leaueth in commission to<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Titus,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to stoppe their mouthes. For which cause<note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 20.</note> the Angell of the Church of Thyatira is reprooued by Christ, because he suffered a false Prophetesse to teach, and to deceiue the people, and to make them commit fornication, and to eate meat sacrificed to idols. If <hi>Titus</hi> be commaunded to put some to silence, and the other reprooued for suffering a false teacher to teach; then the gouernours of the Church haue authoritie and Iurisdiction in these things: but how farre it is extended, we shall consider hereafter. But because it may be questioned whether <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> be to silence ministers, or to conuince them by argument. To this wee 'aunswere, that albe it wee denie not conuiction by reason to be also included in the word, yet there is a further meaning of iudiciall proceeding by authoritie heere vnderstood; which thing will appeare by conference of this and other places. For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hauing first declared that<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 5.</note> he left <hi>Titus</hi> at Crete to ordaine Elders, describeth what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men they must be that are so to be ordained. For a 'Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop<note place="margin">7.</note>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:7970:30"/>
must be vnreproueable, &amp;c. Then he declareth that many<note place="margin">10.</note> be otherwise: for there are many disobedient and vaine talkers, and deceiuers, &amp;c. If the question be demaunded, what shall be done to these deceiuers? the wordes immediatly following containe an aunswere: whose mouthes must be stopped. So<note place="margin">11.</note> that the sense of these words is the same with that which hee saith to <hi>Timothie,</hi> charging him; to command some that they<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 3.</note> teach no other Doctrine. Then the word containeth not only conuiction by argument, but Iurisdiction also. For conuicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by argument onely would not haue serued to suppresse the false Prophetesse of Thyatyra. And if a minister be accused of heresie, or such like, he was to be iudged by such as were set in chiefe authoritie in the Clergie. For that there was a consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and iudiciall proceedings set vp, it is euident; and no lesse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident that the Bishop was iudge. [Against an Elder (saith S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothie</hi>) receiue none accusation, but vnder two or<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 19.</note> three witnesses.] Now he that is appointed to heare accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to receiue the testimonies of witnesses, is placed in a place of iudgement with Iurisdiction: and therefore hath authoritie not onely to conuince by argument, but also to proceed iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially against false teachers, and to put them to silence.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Thus farre was Iurisdiction practised ouer ministers, the things which follow touched the whole Church. Another<note place="margin">4.</note> part of Iurisdiction practised by the Apostles, touching the Church in generall; was to call Councels for the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such controuersies, as were raised vp by them that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the doctrines of the truth, and peace of the Church. Such was the Councell gathered by the Apostles, <hi>Act,</hi> 15. Consisting<note place="margin">Acts 15. 6.</note> of Apostles and Elders, that is, of persons Ecclesiasticall, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in sentence proceeded after good deliberation and great dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.<note place="margin">7.</note> This is the greatest power or Iurisdiction of the Church: because the whole or many chiefe parts together, is greater then any one part.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Further concerning the extension of this Iurisdiction, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied but that there is a power in the Church, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly internall, but also of externall Iurisdiction: of internall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er there is no question made. Externall Iurisdiction being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7970:30"/>
all that is practised in externall Courts or consistories, is either definitiue, or mulctatiue. Authority definitiue in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith and religion, belongeth to the Church. Mulcta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue power may be vnderstood, either as it is referred to spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all censures, or as it is with coaction; as it standeth in spirituall censures, it is the right of the Church, and was practised by the Church, when the Church was without a Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and since. But coactiue Iurisdiction was neuer practised by the Church, when the Church was without Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates: but was alwayes vnderstoode to belong to the ciuill Magistrate, whether he were Christian or heathen. We denie not but that the Apostles did sometimes take vengeance vpon the disobedient, but that was not by the materiall sword (in the power whereof we place coaction) but by the spirituall sword, which alwayes shewed it selfe in their Ministery, sometimes in an extraordinary manner, as in the striking of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts. 5.</note> with present death: in the striking of <hi>Elimas</hi> the Sorcerer with blindnesse, and such like. These were signes of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary power, but wee seeke heere the ordinary Iurisdiction of the Apostles, which they left to their successours.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Vpon these grounds ioyned with the assured knowledge of the History of those times, the auncient Fathers deliuer it as a truth neuer questioned, nor doubted, that in the gouernment of the Church, the Bishops are the vndoubted successours of the<note place="margin">Lib. 5.</note> Apostles. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> speaking of heretikes, saith: <hi>Omnes hi poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Against so euident grounds of Scripture, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse testimonies of Fathers, to deuise a new gouernment of the Church. Leauing the auncient and knowne gouernment, which hath the testimonie of those that liued in the first age, and heard and sawe those that were endued with miraculous gifts: (as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> testifieth of himselfe, that hee heard those<note place="margin">Lib. 5.</note> which spake by the spirit in all languages, and sawe them who<note place="margin">Lib. 2. ca. 57.</note> often raised the dead to life againe.) Leauing, I say, the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of these, whose name and authority is so reuerend in the Church, and striuing for a gouernment which came but of late to the knowledge of men; seemeth to proceede from affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons too much blinded with the loue of innouation.</p>
               <p n="11">11 But though this be true, that Bishops in the gouernment of the Church succeede the Apostles, yet we are cautelously to distinguish betweene the things, wherein they succeede the Apostles: and those things which since the Apostles times haue beene added to their gouernment by godly Princes. For the preseruation of true doctrine in the Church, the Bishops are the great watch-men. Herein they are authorized by God. If Princes withstand them in these things, they haue warrant not to obey Princes, because with these things Christ hath put them in trust.

And yet if the Emperour would by force doe any thing, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth that there is any power in him, or in the Church to resist by force. The faith and right of the Church, was not, in his iudgement, to be maintained by force and armes, but by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and teares. Thus resolute is this godly man in the cause of faith against the Emperour: but in other causes he claimeth no priuiledge, no immunities, and therefore in the same place hee faith: <hi>Si tributum petit imperator non negamus, agri Ecclesiae tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butum soluunt.

Thus did the auncient Bishops gouerne the Church, not suffering

any King or Emperour, to meddle with the determinations of matters of faith: For of such matters are these testimonies to be vnderstood, and onely of such.

We say therefore that the Iurisdiction of the Church was neuer extended to coactiue power: because God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen all coactiue power to the Ciuill Magistrate, to whom hee hath committed the sword. And as coactiue power belongeth not to the Church, so neither dooth it belong to the power of the Church, to erect or establish, to dissanull or dissolue this coactiue power, as the Pope pretendeth to doe by excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, deposing Kings and freeing their subiects from their faith and allegeance. This dissolution of coactiue power
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7970:33"/>
cannot belong to the Church, because this is both Temporall and coactiue: the power of the Church being Spirituall, cannot bee called either Temporall or coactiue. Now that the power exercised by the Pope in excommunication is Temporall and coactiue, is the graunt of <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> for hee saith that the Church of old did not depose <hi>Nero, Diocletian, Iulian, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Quia deerant vires temporales:</hi> then he graunteth that in this present practise of the Popes, there are <hi>vires temporales:</hi> what is this, but temporall coaction? The Church in old time had all that power which Christ committed to his Church, but then, by the confession of <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> the Church had no coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue power: therefore this coactiue power which the Pope v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth by Temporall force in deposing of Kings, was not by Christ graunted to his Church, And if we should yeeld Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall coaction to the Church, what power is left to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate? Thus we see the auncient hedge is plucked vp, and the bounds are chaunged, which of old stood betweene these two powers Ciuill and Spirituall.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Against this disordering of the auncient bounds wee haue the words of our Sauiour Christ. [My kingdome is not<note place="margin">Iohn 18 36.</note> of this world, i f my kingdome were of this world, my seruaunts would surely fight, that I should not bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, &amp;c. But because when these wordes are vrged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our aduersaries, they looke ascant vpon them, as if they touched them not: Let vs consider how the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Pope, and his pretended Iurisdiction in deposing of Kings, is vtterly ouerthrowen by these words, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the power properly belonging to Christs kingdome, that is to his Church. Christ aunswereth heere to <hi>Pilats</hi> question, <hi>Verse</hi> 33. [Art thou the King of the Iewes?] By which questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it appeareth there was some suspition and feares, that Christ pretending for a kingdome, might conspire against the state, and worke the trouble and dissolution of the gouernment esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished. For as <hi>Herod</hi> when he heard that Iesus was borne the King of the Iewes, was troubled and all Ierusalem with him; and entred into such feares and suspition, that mooued him to<note place="margin">Mat. 2. 3.</note> kill all the young children from two yeeres old and vnder: so
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7970:33"/>
the high Priests suggested the same suspitions to <hi>Pilate.</hi> From this ground riseth this question of <hi>Pilate,</hi> Art thou the King of the Iewes? To this he aunswereth, my kingdome is not of this world. From which aunswere applied to such a question, these positions issue: It is against the nature of the kingdome of Christ to worke any trouble to the kingdomes of the world. And, that kingdome which worketh trouble to the kingdomes of this world, is not the kingdome of Christ. Christs king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which is not of this world, is his Church, which is in this world, but not of this world, as himselfe saith, [If you were of<note place="margin">Joh. 15. 19.</note> this world, the world would loue her owne, but because you are not of this world, but I haue taken you out of this world, therefore this world hateth you.] Then we reason thus: The gouernment of Christs Church breedeth no trouble, much lesse dissolution to the states of this world: but the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the court of Rome, (now commonly called, the Church of Rome) breedeth trouble and dissolution to the states of this world: therefore the gouernment of that court, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the gouernment of Christs Church: the assumption is a confessed truth too well knowen, that the gouernment of the Popes court or Church, breedeth trouble and dissolution to States by excommunications. The proposition is prooued by the aunswere of Christ to <hi>Pilats</hi> feares: my kingdome is not of this world: whereby hee satisfieth <hi>Pilate</hi> that he needed not feare any trouble, or dissolution of established authoritie by him, for this was <hi>Pilats</hi> feare. So that if wee admit that Christ did aunswere to the purpose, and that <hi>Pilats</hi> feares and suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were remooued by his aunswere, it must be confessed that by that aunswere the State was secured, that Christs gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would not raise any trouble to it, or procure the dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. And it must be well obserued, that Christ thus securing the present State, doth not speake of his owne person onely, but vndertaketh for all that belong to him, and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Therefore he saith not, I am not: or, my person is not of this world: but, my kingdome is not of this world. Then as hee secureth this State from any trouble that they might feare from his person, so he secureth all States of the world, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7970:34"/>
the time of this world, from all troubles that they might feare from his members, and from his kingdome which is his Church. Wherby it followeth by strong euidence of reason that they who put States in feare of troubles, or work the dissolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Ciuill gouernment (as the Pope doth by excommunication) are not the members of Christ, nor belonging to his kingdom.</p>
               <p n="15">15. This is further declared in the same place, by the words<note place="margin">Iohn. 18. 36.</note> following. [If my kingdome were of this world, then would my seruants surely fight that I should not be deliuered to thee.] In which words wee finde that Christes seruants may not fight, not stirre vp tumults, vproares and warres, for the maintaining of their kingdome. Therefore that Kingdome for which they raise so much warre, is not the kingdome of Christ, not Christs Church: nor they that raise vp such warres, Christs seruaunts. Christ forbiddeth his seruaunts to fight for him, and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: the Pope commandeth his seruants to fight for him and his kingdome. Can you haue two kingdomes more opposite? two Kings more contrary?</p>

                  </note> kindes of excommunication in vse in the Iewish Church: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that this censure of the Church can be no farther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the Church of Christians, then it was in the Church of Israel, where it was first instituted and established. But in the Church of Israel, it was neuer extended to deposing Kings, and destroying obedience of Subiects: therefore in the Church of Christians, it may not be extended to these practises. What can be denied heere? For neither can they denie, but that the censures of the Church should bee of greatest power there, where they were first instituted: neither can they denie, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication was first instituted in that Church of the Iewes: neither can they shew vs, that any King of that Nation was at any time deposed for pretended heresie, or for knowne and professed idolatry: though the Kings there were often great idolaters: though the Priests were bolde and couragious in Gods cause: yet we neuer finde that any Priest did by excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication depose the King, or destroy the bond of allegeance. This thing then being neither practised by the Iewes, where these censures were in first and chiefe force, nor by Christ and his Apostles, nor by the Fathers of the Primitiue Church, nor known in the Church for the space of almost a thousand yeares (as hereafter wee shall declare) wee haue great reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that excommunication, as it is an Ecclesiasticall censure, hath no power coactine to alter any temporall authority, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Kings, to destroy and dissolue allegeance, or to trouble any lawfull authority established in this world.</p>

And if the Bishops of Rome did sometimes breake out beyond their bounds: yet were they in those ancient times alwayes repressed by the authority of the Church. For, that we may take a short suruay of the Iurisdiction of the Church, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the first three hundred yeres: so long as the Apostles liued, no man doubteth but that they ruled all, and that the greatest Iurisdiction of the Church was in them, if we speake of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Iurisdiction. And if any one Apostle liued after the rest, there was more power acknowledged to be in him, then in any one that liued in the Church in his time. Now it is for an assured historicall truth recorded by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and before him by <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> (whom the full consent of the auncients follow heerein) that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> liued after all the other Apostles were dead, &amp; that he continued in the gouernment of the Church, vntill the times of Traian Emperour.

                     </gap>aristus, Alexander.</hi> If the Bishop of Rome had then been the head of the Church, the chiefe Pastor, the Monarch, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all Iurisdiction, as his flatterers now make him: it must be confessed that <hi>Alexander</hi> in his time, and <hi>Euaristus</hi> before him was S. <hi>Iohns</hi> head: and before him <hi>Clemens,</hi> and before him <hi>Anaclet,</hi> and before him <hi>Linus.</hi> Did these rule and gouerne S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> or S. <hi>Iohn</hi> them? shall we say that they had Iurisdiction ouer S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> or S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ouer them? If these Bishops each in his time had Iurisdiction ouer S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> then there was an authority in the Church aboue the authority of the Apostles. If they were gouerned by him, then the Bishop of Rome was not the head of the Church. There is no sober spirit that can doubt of these things: or can thinke that in those dayes any liued in the Church, who was not vnder the Iurisdiction of an Apostle.</p>
               <p n="19">19 After Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> death, who was liuing in the yeare of Christ 100. and after: in the Church of Rome, were <hi>Sixtus, Telesphorus, Hyginus, Pius, Anicetus, Soter, Eleutherius, Victor.</hi> These gouerned the Church of Rome in succession, by the space of one hundred yeares together. In which times they seemed
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7970:36"/>
willing to put to their helping hands, to aduance the Church of Rome. For Sathan hauing a purpose thence to raise Antichrist, began betime to worke, and to abuse those good men, as it was not hard for him to beguile better men then they were, though we admit them to be good men, and holy Martyres. Then were they drawne into a loue to aduance their seate and Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet so, as neither in them is proued pernicious, neither was it thought by the church to be very dangerous, seeing they yeelded and submitted themselues in the end to the graue and godly aduise of the Church.</p>
               <p n="20">20 The things wherein the Bishops of Rome sought first to aduance their power, was by <hi>imposing ceremonies</hi> vpon other Churches. Thus did <hi>Anicet</hi> contend for the celebration of Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: but was quieted by <hi>Polycarp;</hi> who for the peace of the<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 5. ca. 24.</note> Church, made a iourney to Rome, and pacified <hi>Anicetus.</hi> And was so much honoured of <hi>Anicetus,</hi> that there he practised the function of a Bishop, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> reporteth, taking the storie from <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> Thus was peace and loue then maintained on all sides, whilest the Bishops of Rome were content to be ruled by others.</p>
               <p n="21">21 A little after, <hi>Victor</hi> grewe more violent in the fame quarrell, and excommunicated the Easterne Churches, which did not obserue Easter after the maner of the Church of Rome. But <hi>Uictor</hi> was resisted, and sharply reproued by <hi>Polycrates</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop<note place="margin">Euseb. ibid.</note> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and the rost of the Easterne Bishops, as also by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> Bishop of Lions in Fraunce. These did freely reproue <hi>Victor,</hi> for that he regarded not the peace of the Church: they declare that in ceremonies there was great difference of olde, and yet the Bishops liued in loue and peace together: that the differences in ceremonies, did not breake the consent in faith: that these differences were before the time of <hi>Victor:</hi> and that hee was therein to followe the examples of his auncients, who preserued loue and peace, and the doctrines of faith sincere, with some diuersity in outward ceremonies. This was all that the Bishops of Rome attempted in those dayes: wherein there appeareth no Iurisdiction ouer others, but rather the contrary. For the godly Bishops of Asia reproued them, and made them
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7970:36"/>
see and acknowledge their owne rashnesse, and caused them to desist: therefore the Church did not then acknowledge the Popes Iurisdiction.</p>
               <p n="22">22 Betweene <hi>Victor</hi> and <hi>Syluester</hi> the first, succeeded 18. Bishops of Rome, in the space of 100 yeares next.

For the auncients knewe no other rule of fauouring men, but vertue: he was in the Church most honourable, and accounted chiefe in succeeding the Apostles, whose life and conuersation was most Apostolicall. Wherefore as the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients gaue this honour to the Bishops of Rome, for their god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liues, to call them the Apostles successours, so when they found other Bishops who in vertue excelled, they gaue these ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles<note place="margin">Titles of honour giuen to other Bishops as much as to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of Rome.</note> in as great honour to them, as euer was giuen to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Bishop.

the chiefest in Apostolicall succession, who came neerest the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall vertues: or that they were <gap reason="foreign">

And throughout all the Epistles of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil,</hi> wee obserue, that albeit hee wrote often to the Westerne Church, wee finde no such honourable mention of the Bishop of Rome: but somewhat sounding to the contrary. For in the tenth Epistle, he noteth the pride and ambition, which then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be espied in the Bishops of Rome: complaining to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi> Bishop of Samosata, that the Church could haue no help<note place="margin">

Then concerning this title, to be called the successour of the Apostles, it was somtimes giuen to the Bishops of Rome, onely in regard of their vertue, godlinesse, and faith which once appeared in those Bishops. And so it is giuen to <hi>Ambrose</hi> and to other Bishops. In this sense we vnderstand those titles giuen by <hi>Sidonius Appollinaris</hi> Bishop of Aruern, to diuers Bishops in France in his time.

To represse this wicked heresie, a Councell was gathered at Antioche. The Church was then without the helpe of a Christian Magistrate. In chiefe accompt among them that liued in the Church at that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7970:37"/>
time, was <hi>Dionysius</hi> Bishop of Alexandria, a man for his great learning and godlinesse much renowned in the Church then, and alwayes since: he was so aged and weake at that time that he could not be present in the Councell, but by writing confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the truth against <hi>Paulus</hi> the Hereticke. Among them that were assembled there, was <hi>Gregorius</hi> Bishop of Caesaria, who had the gift of working miracles: in which respect <hi>Basil</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth honourable mention of him in diuers places: <hi>Dionysius</hi> was then Bishop of Rome. The famous Bishops of the East had diuers meetings against <hi>Paulus;</hi> the last meeting was in the time of <hi>Aurelianus</hi> Emperour about the yeere of Christ, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred seuentie and fiue. At what time <hi>Paulus</hi> was fully refuted and repressed, especially by the labour, industry, and learning<note place="margin">Damnatur ab omnibus quae sub coelo sunt Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siis Christi. Euseb. ibid.</note> of <hi>Malchion:</hi> hee was condemned saith <hi>Eusebius</hi> of all the Churches of Christ which are vnder heauen. After the conui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this Heresie, the Councell wrote to <hi>Dionysius</hi> Bishop of Rome; and to <hi>Maximus</hi> Bishop of Alexandria, (for <hi>Dionysius</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Omni Ecclesiae Catholicae quae sub Coelo est. ibid.</note> died before this Councell ended, and <hi>Maximus</hi> succeeded him in Alexandria:) and to all the Church of Christ vnder heauen. The Epistle is extant in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and was directed to these Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, that by them other Churches might haue knowledge of this thing.</p>
               <p n="24">24. After all this <hi>Paulus Samosatenus</hi> held the Church of Antioche, and gaue no place to <hi>Domnus,</hi> (whom the Councell excommunicating and deposing <hi>Paulus,</hi> had decreed should take his place.) The Bishops in this case were driuen to seeke the aide of the heathen Emperour <hi>Aurelian;</hi> at the suit of the Councell, the Emperour commaunded that the Church of Antioche should be deliuered to him, to whom the Church of Italie and the Bishop of Rome would write. By this it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that the Church had no Iurisdiction coactiue: for when the Bishops of this Councell had proceeded as farre as they could, by Ecclesiasticall censures, (against all which censures <hi>Paulus</hi> held the Church by force) finding that without coactiue power <hi>Paulus</hi> could not be repressed, and finding no such pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in themselues, they were forced to seeke the Emperours helpe, acknowledging thereby that all coactiue power rested in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7970:38"/>
the Emperor. Moreouer by this we obserue the beginning of that practise, which afterward drew the opinion of Iurisdiction after it. For the Bishop of Rome had no authoritie then ouer other Bishops, neither did he challenge any. And when some fewe of that Sea, did seeme to pretend some authoritie in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of conformitie and ceremonies, as <hi>Anicetus, Victor,</hi> and some few other: they were quickly repressed by the Church, &amp; were content to be ruled by the Church. But because the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and persecuting Emperours were content for the glory of Italy, to giue this honour to the Church there, and especially to the Bishop of Rome, that other Bishops should find fauour for his sake (as appeareth euidently by this Story, wherein it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded that the Bishops of that Councell had no meanes to helpe themselues but by the Emperour, and the Emperour not regarding the cause, onely to honour the Bishop of Rome, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the matter to him), hence, as reason was, the Churches were compelled to make much of the Bishop of Rome, and to seeke his fauour, without which they sawe the heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours would not be drawen to doe them iustice.</p>
               <p n="25">25. About this time, <hi>Stephanus</hi> Bishop of Rome threatned<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 7. cap. 4. 5.</note> likewise to Excommunicate some Bishops for rebaptising of heretickes, but he was repressed by <hi>Dionysius</hi> Bishop of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria.

               <p n="7">7 By which it appeareth, that these courts with this Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction were vnderstood then, no other then the Emperours courts. The Emperour graunteth this Iurisdiction, saith <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephorus,</hi>

the Emperour ratifieth these iudgements, saith <hi>Sozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> the Emperour commaundeth that the sentence of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop should be euery where receiued, as if it proceeded out of his owne mouth. Which words are well to be obserued. For the Emperour commaundeth not, that the Bishops sentence should be receiued as a diuine sentence, but only as an humane: not as proceeding from the mouth of God, but as proceeding from the mouth of the Emperour. Now if these Courts were then so euidently proued to be the Emperours Courts, our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries may acknowledge their owne ignorance &amp; folly, who make declamations and many idle discourses, without solid proofe, against them that call Ecclesiasticall Courts the Kings Courts: as if this were a thing new, strange, and neuer heard of before these late yeares.

                  </gap>, compounding &amp; confounding those things<note place="margin">Arift. Elench.</note> which we distinguish, and which are distinct in nature. For in this word of Iurisdiction, they confound these two distinct things, both that which is spirituall Iurisdiction, yeelded by vs the right of the Church, and all that also which Princes haue giuen to Ecclesiasticall Courts: such as these priuiledges which <hi>Constantine</hi> gaue to Bishops Courts, and other Princes since haue continued and enlarged. If these things be not distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, the truth can neuer appeare in this question: by this the Reader may vnderstand, who they are that hide and deface the truth by new varnishing of olde rotten Sophismes.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Then all coactiue Iurisdiction came into the Church from the authority of Princes; for as the power of the Church is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and spirituall, so externall and coactiue power was the right of Princes.

And so religious were these auncient Bishops, in preseruing the Emperors Iurisdiction, and yet main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the truth without feare: that when they were oppressed by Arians, and by the power of an Arian Emperour, yet they would vse no other meanes, then these direct meanes. And<note place="margin">Socrat. lib. 4. cap. 2.</note> therefore the Bishops hauing a purpose to condemne the Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, craued a counsell of <hi>Valens,</hi> an Arian Emperor, who gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them a counsell at Lampsacum, wherein they condemned the Arian doctrine. So that without the Emperour they would not gather a counsell, though it were to conclude directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Emperours purposes. Thus doth <hi>Socrates</hi> report the calling of that councell: but <hi>Sozomen</hi> saith, it was not obtained of <hi>Valens,</hi> but of <hi>Valentinian.</hi>

How then commeth the Bishop of Rome to this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of Iurisdiction, which now he claimeth? Let vs here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider one Pageant of theirs, which will declare the first claime and beginning of Iurisdiction, which they haue so much increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed since. The first attempt was to winne Iurisdiction ouer Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, the second was to get the same power ouer Kings, and by that meanes ouer all. These we meane to open, with as much breuitie as we can, and the matter will beare. First then to bring Bishops of other Nations vnder their power, a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse deuise was plotted by the Bishop of Rome, discried and reiected by the auncient Fathers that then liued; but yet so closely followed afterward by the Popes, that in the end it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed.

I will declare the storie as it is deliuered by their owne writers, who haue collected the tomes of the Councels.</p>
               <p n="13">13.

In the time of this Councell, three Bishops of Rome succeeding one another, mooued great contention and quarell with the Fathers of this Councell for Iurisdiction, which the Popes then began to claime, affirming that they had Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ouer the Church of Affrica, which thing these Fathers of this Councell vtterly denied: the contention began vpon this occasion.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>Apiarius</hi> a Priest of the Church of Sicca, in Affrica,<note place="margin">Concil.

To effect this thing the better, he chargeth them to declare, that the Nicen Councell hath giuen this Iurisdiction to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of Rome: for proofe hereof he deliuereth vnto them in writing a counterfeited Canon of the Nicen Councell.</p>

               <p>Before I proceed in this narration, let some things of note bee obserued: First, the Bishops of Rome were now growen from the honest and godly conuersation of their Auncestours, to admirable impudency that durst suborne a Canon of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen Councell, and publish their owne shame, in the sight of the Church then, and leaue an eternall monument thereof to the world, for euer extant in publike Councels. Secondly, the ground of the Iurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome, is forgerie, famously attempted, and famously con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>icted at that present time. And yet this practise preuailed mightily afterward, this vnblessed deuise of forgerie, being attempted in a number of decretall Epistles, to drawe in this Iurisdiction, a practise wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no learned Papists can speake or thinke without blushing, and yet such is their miserable captiuitie, that they are willing to make vse of that falshood, whereof they cannot thinke without a secret confession of forgerie. Thirdly, the ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reader cannot but see, and vnderstand the vanitie of the Popes flatterers, who striuing now for this Iurisdiction, would blasphemously draw it from Scriptures, such as thou art <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. And feede my Sheepe, &amp;c. These Scriptures were first drawen by the forged decretall Epistles to proue the Popes Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, and are now commonly drawen to the same purpose: but when <hi>Zozimus, Bonifac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7970:45"/>
was not then found out, but they laid all the cause vpon a forged Canon of the Councell of Nice. So that this is but a late kna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>erie of the Popes flatterers, to countenance their newe found Iurisdiction by Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="16">16. When this Canon was recited by the notarie, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Councell were much offended and troubled at the absurditie thereof: there were then present some of the best learned Diuines then liuing in the world, they knew well there was no such Canon, they neuer read it in any copies of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen Councell, they neuer heard of this thing before: they resolued therefore not onely to denie the Canon, but to refute the falshood of the Pope so famously, that it might be knowen to all the world, and that the Church afterward might take warning of the Romane ambition: therefore they aunswered for the present, thus: that this Canon was not to bee found in their bookes. And for a more full and sufficient examination of this matter, they would send for the autentike copies of the Nicen Councell, before they could graunt the Popes request. To this purpose they writ a letter to <hi>Zozimus,</hi> which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented<note place="margin">Concil. Affrican. cap. 101.</note> to <hi>Boniface</hi> his successour, and is extant in the Tomes of the Councels.</p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>Boniface</hi> first receiuing these letters (for <hi>Zozimus</hi> was dead before they returned) pursueth the claime of Iurisdiction by corruption of the same Canon, and with obstinate and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute peruersitie maintaineth the falshood begun by his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour. In the meane time two copies autentike of the Nicen Canons were sent to the Fathers of the Councell of Carthage, one from <hi>Cyrillus</hi> Bishop of Alexandria: another from <hi>Atticus</hi> Bishop of Constantinople. These copies were read, but no such Canon could be found, as the Bishop of Rome had foisted in: the Fathers vnderstanding the fact, and hauing taken the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome in a flagrant crime, decreed that the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Nicen Councell should be obserued, reiecting this suborned and supposititious Canon. This decree they sent to Pope <hi>Boniface:</hi> but Gods iudgements hastily following these corruptors, <hi>Boniface</hi> was dead before it came to Rome, and <hi>Caelestinus</hi> next succeeding receiued it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:7970:45"/>18. <hi>Caelestinus</hi> as stiffe for this Iurisdiction as any of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours, maintained the cause by the same meanes, resolued with shame ynough to stand for the adulterated Canon: which pertinacy after open conuiction, declareth that the pollicie of the Church of Rome began then to forsake religious courses, and to rest vpon falshood and forgery to obtaine their willes. And therefore it is not to be marueiled, if the truth of Religion afterward for saked them. <hi>Apiarius</hi> gaue a new occasion to the Pope to worke vpon: for after that this man was receiued vnto the Communion by <hi>Zozimus</hi> and <hi>Boniface,</hi> he returned to the Trabacens, where for his foule and scandalous life he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated againe. To recouer this disgrace, he flieth to his onely refuge the Bishop of Rome then <hi>Caelestinus,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth him, admitting him to the Communion; and directeth his Legats <hi>Eaustinus, Philippus, Asellus,</hi> to Affrica, with a streight charge to draw the Councell to yeeld to the demaunds of his Predecessours: for want of other helpe, hee furnisheth them throughly with impudencie and inuict audacity: for what other vertues were left to maintaine such a cause? The Legats co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming with this Commission, require of the Councell that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piarius</hi> may be admitted to their Communion, and that they would be content to submit themselues to the Romane Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. The Fathers of the Councell produce the autentike copies of the Nicen Canons, which they had procured from Alexandria and Constantinople: by which the Romane forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was euidently conuinced. Here began a fresh contention, <hi>Faustinus</hi> resolued to execute his Commission to his vtmost power, exclaimeth against the Sea Apostolike, against the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latours of the Nicen Canons. The Councell protesteth that they will imbrace all true Canons, that they will yeeld to the Church of Rome all true priuiledges: onely in the lawfull, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, and necessary defence of their owne freedome, and of the Churches freedome, they must stand, and therefore could not admit a forged claime without shew of truth. As they were in the heat of contention, the one side striuing to impose the yoke of their Iurisdiction vpon the Church, the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7970:46"/>
to stand close and faithfull for the freedome of the Church: behold of a suddaine <hi>Apiarius</hi> the firebrand of this contention, touched by the very finger of God, and drawen to giue God the glory, and so to end this contention; falleth<note place="margin">Concil. Affrica. cap. 105.</note> downe on his knees before them all, and confesseth all those crimes to be most true, which were obiected against him: and with humble supplication craueth pardon of the Councell. And so this Tragedy ended.</p>
               <p n="19">19. The Fathers of this Councell hauing this experience of the Popes corruption and dishonestie: write to <hi>Caelestinus</hi> to this purpose.

We may the better beare the reproaches of the Romish Sinagogue, when they sharpen their tongues and pennes against the seruants of GOD in our times, seeing they laue done as much against the auncient godly Fathers. For what can the late Popes say more against <hi>M.

Then when we denie their Iurisdiction, wee denie it with the Fathers: when wee are therefore condemned by the Pope and his Court, we are condemned with the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with them we suffer, with them we are reuiled, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. The goodnesse of our cause, the fellowship of the auncient Saints, the warrant of the truth, is able to support vs against the impotent malice and fury of these men, that haue no other cause to be offended at vs; then their Fathers had against S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and the rest of the auncient and holy Fathers, who haue resisted the Romish Iurisdiction, and therein haue left a worthy example to vs, to follow their foot-steps.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow we enter into those fatall times of our cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity: For wee confesse that our Fathers were by a iust iudgement of God brought into a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity farre greater then the Babilonian. Our Kings, our Bishops, our people, our Church, and all were oppressed. And they that led vs captiues aske vs, where was our Church then? Wee answere, in captiuity. For though the greatest number then followed the pleasures and delights of Babilon, yet among them the true Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael of God remained. And we are able, by the grace of God, to proue a true Church to haue continued in the doctrines of the trueth, vntill God sent in his wonderfull mercy, a deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from this captiuity. But this belongeth to another que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
               <p n="2">2 After these times the Iurisdiction of Princes and of the Church, was oppressed by the Pope. But before they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that great oppression and captiuity, it pleased God, for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter testification of his truth to all ages, and for the confusion of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7970:49"/>
this tyrannie gotten and maintained by forgerie; to cause one of the Popes to dispute this question with such zeale and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, that it remaineth an euerlasting testimonie against this Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, and against all his successours. For when <hi>Iohn Bishop</hi> of Constantinople would haue had this title of Oecumenicall Bishop confirmed to him, <hi>Gregory</hi> the first (questionlesse the best Pope that hath beene since his time) vseth such reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Iohn,</hi> as are sufficient to proue, that no Bishop hath right to that Iurisdiction which now the Popes claime, and that hee who vsurpeth that place aboue his brethren, is Antichrist. And if the iudgement of <hi>Gregory,</hi> be sufficient to determine this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie, it will follow that Antichrist hath beene raised vp in the Church of Rome presently after <hi>Gregory,</hi> and hath in the succession of those Bishops sit there euer since: because since the time of <hi>Gregory,</hi> they haue taken and claimed this title, and thereby so much increased in pride, ambition, and enormous practises against the Church, and against states, that he that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth these times with the former, shall finde it another state, then it was in the time of <hi>Gregory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 And because the Pope now glorieth in this title of vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Bishop, from which title he would draw a Iurisdiction ouer all Bishops, <hi>Gregory</hi> herein is peremptory, that whosoeuer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that title, robbeth Christ of his place and glory. For, saith he: <hi>Sub vno capite omnes membra sunt Ecclesiae, sancti ante legem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 4. indict. 13.</note>

                  <hi>voluit.</hi> [All the Saints as members of the Church are vnder one head, the Saints before the Law, vnder the Law, and vnder grace: and no man would euer suffer himselfe to be called an vniuersall Bishop.] This was then the learning of the Church of Rome, that because Christ was the onely head of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Church, therefore no man may be. For the deuise which after this the Friars brought in, of <hi>caput ministeriale,</hi> was then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. The reason of <hi>Gregory</hi> is well to be obserued: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause euery man is a member of the vniuersall Church, no man can be both head and member of the same. And therefore hee vrgeth this thing often; as namely where he saith: <hi>Vniuersa sibi</hi>

Thus saith <hi>Gregory</hi> of him that sought this title of vniuersall Bishop. In many other places he proueth the same: that Christ is the onely and sole head of the Church, and therefore no man can challenge this title of vniuersall Bishoppe, <hi>or head</hi> of the vniuersall Church. Whosoeuer doth it, must bec that Antichrist that thrusteth Christ out of his place. For it is well to bee obserued, that the reasons of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> against the claime of vniuersall Bishoppe, or head of the vniuersall Church, doe as well and truely refute all these names of pride now chalenged by the Popes, as this which then was chalenged by <hi>Iohn</hi> of Constantinople.

For he saith, that hee that taketh this name of vniuersall Bishop, is the fore-runner of Antichrist.

vpon a rotten and ruinous ground-worke, seeing their aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Popes haue vpon the same reasons grounded the proofe of Antichrist.

               <p n="8">8. When thus the Pope had driuen the Emperour out of all Italie, and by that meanes had drawen Italie into as many Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions in a, manner, as there were great Cities; the strongest began to pray vpon the weaker. Heere began the fire of emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to kindle betweene the Pope and the Lumbards, for the Lumbards were the strongest part of Italie then, and the Popes part was the second: all other were weake in respect of these two; and these two thereto agreeing well hitherto, so long as both conspired against the Empire: began now to fall at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance about the deuiding of the spoile. The Pope finding the Lumbards too strong for him, in this parting of the spoile of the Empire; as before hee had vsed the strength of the Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards, to suppresse the Emperour: so now following the same arte, called <hi>Pipin</hi> the Constable of Fraunce into Italie, by whose power hee repressed the Lumbards: and compelled <hi>Astulphus</hi> their King to receiue conditions of peace. <hi>Platina</hi> saith, that <hi>Gregorius</hi> chiefe Secretary to the Emperor, did meet <hi>Pipin</hi> as he came into Italie, and intreated him that if he should ouercome the Lumbards, he would restore the Exarchate of Rauenna to the Emperour, to whom of right, said hee, it belonged, (All that poore right that then he sought to hold in Italie, detained as then by the Lumbards, but presently falling vnto the Popes share) and that he would not yeeld it to the Pope. The aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere of <hi>Pipin</hi> was, he came into Italie to gratifie the Pope, and that he would helpe him as much as he could. That which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the victorie fell to the Popes part, and to Rome, was saith

All this was accordingly performed; and <hi>Pipin</hi> was absolued from the Oath of Allegeance, and so were all the Barons and people of France absolued from the Oath of obedience: which before they<note place="margin">Uspergensis Nau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="9">9. This Storie I haue briefly set downe, that the ground of the Popes Iurisdiction may be the better obserued: for from such straunge grounds, these Romane Catholikes draw the Popes Iurisdiction, and the parts thereof, as a man of ordinary reason would least suspect: so capricious are they now growen. As for example, from this fact of Pope <hi>Zacharie,</hi> who absolued subiects from the Oath of Allegeance to their true King; who would thinke that the Popes Iurisdiction could bee drawen? who would not rather iudge that the Popes arrogancy, pride, vsurpation, oppression, corruption might by this be prooued? And yet <hi>Augustinus. Anconitanus</hi> maketh this fact the onely ground and proofe of his Iurisdiction: we looke for such a Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction as Christ left to his Church, we looke for proofes from Scripture: but we find no other Iurisdiction prooued, then the Iurisdiction of Antichrist, opposite to Christs Iurisdiction, and ouer Princes: for proofes out of the word of God, we find no other proofes, then such as are drawen from the Popes rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conspiracie against the auncient Emperours, from their vniust vsurpation, and oppression of lawfull Kings, from an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious power pretending authority to breake and violate oaths, and faith, and Allegeance of subiects. And this manner of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7970:53"/>
proose is held so strong, that nothing is more common among them then thus to proue Iurisdiction. One of that ranke would after the same maner proue this Iurisdicto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Popes dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing against oathes and vowes.

This Iurisdiction wee graunt Popes haue practised but with shame ynough, heere is the difference betweene them and vs, betweene an euill cause and a good, betweene impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie, and confidence in the truth: both they and we bring the same examples, but to contrary ends: they bring these exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Popes practises, to prooue Iurisdiction: wee vrge the same examples to shame the Pope with his Iurisdiction, Let the indifferent and ingenuous reader iudge, whether applie them to the true right and proper end. For let them aunswere vs, if they can, whence the Popes haue authoritie to execute such a Iurisdiction, as they haue neither from Christ, nor from the Princes of this world?

But now by the fall of the Empire, Papacy rising, and a newe straunge image of the Empire, rising vp in the Papacy, this Iurisdiction was then in hatching, which afterward was brought foorth by a monstrous birth.</p>

My purpose is, to note the occasions of alteration of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction in the Church of Rome; and how the Popes hauing cast off the Iurisdiction of the Ciuill Magistrate, did in time draw to themselues a new forme of Iurisdiction; increasing the same by degrees. For wheras at the beginning as we haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Bishops of Rome with others, were vnder the coactiue Iurisdiction of the Ciuill Magistrate: the absence and fall of the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7970:54"/>
Empire gaue opportunity to the Bishops of Rome to raise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. The first beginning of their Iurisdiction, was by getting appeales to be made to them: the enlarging &amp; aduancing of it, was by obtaining the title of <hi>caput Ecclesiae,</hi> &amp; vniuersall B. The Pope was not called <hi>caput Ecclesiae,</hi> but the Church of Rome got that title vnder <hi>Phocas,</hi> the Pope got it by his flatterers long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the great, they had gotten in one foote farther into this Iurisdiction; for then they began to refuse the coactiue Iurisdiction of the ciuill Magistrate. All this while they were not come to the height and top of thei Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to practise coactiue power ouer and against the ciuill Magistrate, to depose Princes, to raise vp rebellions, to absolue subiects from their faith and alleageance, though some of these things were a new founding, yet they were not come to their perfection till after this time: as we purpose in order to declare. And as we note their practises, so we must no lesse haue an eye to the men and meanes, which withstood them in these ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous courses.</p>
               <p n="13">13 These attempts of Iurisdiction were then most famously withstood, when they were brought to their full hight. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the Popes had begun to stretch their Iurisdiction to the preiudice of Kings and Princes, then began the opposition most to appeare, learned men being stirred vp to write, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to examine this question. Whereof my purpose is to speake farther in the last Chapter of this Treatise. Here we will onely note what resistance it found at the beginning, before it was growne vp to that hight, whereunto it came in time. First, wee finde that both <hi>Charles</hi> the great himselfe, and other Princes and Bishops, haue withstood the Bishop of Rome heerein; and seeking to giue euery one his right, haue giuen many parts of that Iurisdiction, which now the Pope claimeth, to the ciuill Magistrate. For after that <hi>Charles</hi> had subdued the Lumbards, as his father <hi>Pipin</hi> had done before him: and besieging <hi>Deside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> King of the Lumbards, came to Rome from the siege, to know what hee should haue for his trauaile, for recouering S. <hi>Peters</hi> Patrimonie, as the late Patrimonie of the Emperour fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Pope, then began to be called, (for the Pope had
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7970:55"/>
promised to <hi>Charles</hi> for oppressing the Lumbards, and recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this new Patrimonie, so much desired, so hotely pursued, so dearely bought, that hee should be made Emperour of the West, and the auncient authority and Iurisdiction of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire should be restored to him.) For the better effecting of these affaires, <hi>Charles</hi> hauing set a strong siege about Pauy, and taken order with his Captaines for that seruice; left the siege &amp; came to Rome, bringing with him a great number of Bishops &amp; Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, to holde a Synod with Pope <hi>Hadrian;</hi> and therein by all their industry and knowledge, to finde out what were the true and auncient priuiledges of the Empire, and what was the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Iurisdiction confessed. Pope <hi>Hadrian</hi> receiued <hi>Charles</hi> honourably, and at his pleasure called a councell. Wherein que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionlesse some parts of the auncient Iurisdiction were restored to <hi>Charles.</hi> For that Synod gaue him power to choose the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome, and in all Prouinces of his gouernment to inuest all Archbishops, and Bishops. Thus much is acknowledged by as many witnesses in a manner, as are Writers of the Story of this time. But of late some haue quarrelled against this Story, denying it to be true: which quarrell I purpose to handle and discusse in the next Chapter, in his proper place. <hi>Theodoricus de Niem</hi> writing of this councell, and of the end and purpose of those that held it, saith, that this Synod was gathered purposely to search out the auncient vses, lawes, and customes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and Church: that each power knowing their owne limits, the one might not encroach vpon the other. <hi>Celebrata est</hi> (saith<note place="margin">Theodor. de Niem.</note> he) <hi>ab</hi> 153. <hi>viris religiosis, Episcopis &amp; Abbatibus, &amp;c. ab vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersis regionibus et oramibus almae vrbis, à cuncto eti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>m Clero huius sanctae Rom. Ecclesiae, ex quirentibus vsus, leges, &amp; mores eiusdem Ecclesiae et imperij.</hi> That is: [It was celebrated by one hundred and fifty three religious men, Bishops &amp; Abbots, &amp;c. by all the regions and degrees of the City of Rome, by all the Clergy of this holy Church of Rome, making search and inquisition for the vses, lawes, and customes both of this Church and of the Empire.] Then we see that <hi>Charles</hi> recouered some part of the auncient Iurisdiction of the Empire. Which notwithstanding since his time, the Popes by inuincible contentions, wrested
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7970:55"/>
from the Emperours, chalenging it to be a part of their owne Iurisdiction, and charging the Emperours with Heresie and Schisme for practising that right, which other Popes before them, acknowledged to bee the auncient right of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p n="14">14 And because to the Iurisdiction of Princes it belonged of olde, both to call councels and to confirme them, therefore <hi>Charles</hi> did not omit this part of Iurisdiction, though as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent declared, it was much against the Popes pleasure. He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Synod at Frankford, wherein was condemned the doctrine of worshipping of images, which doctrine the Pope had late be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore confirmed. The occasion hereof grew thus. <hi>Leo Isaurus</hi> Emperour, being much offended that the Saracines had that great and iust exception against Christians, that they worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped images: called a Synod at Constantinople, wherein the<note place="margin">Paulus Diacon.</note> worship of images was condemned, and the images burned. He sent also to the Bishop of Rome, as then <hi>Gregory</hi> the second, commaunding him to doe the like, if he would haue his fauour, saith <hi>Paulus Diaconus. Gregory</hi> the second tooke this in su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>h in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, that he rebelled against the Emperour, and raised all Italy into a rebellion, by which meanes the Emperour lost all that then was left in Italy. <hi>Gregory</hi> the second, in the middes of these stirres died, and <hi>Gregory</hi> the third succeeded, who prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the purpose of his predecessour, called a Synod at Rome in the yeare seuen hundred thirty three by <hi>Sigebert:</hi> seuen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred<note place="margin">Sigebert.</note> thirty nine by <hi>Palmerius.</hi> In this Synod the doctrine of<note place="margin">Palmerius.</note> worshipping images was confirmed; <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperor was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated and depriued. Thus began the Pope to practise a new Iurisdiction, in deposing Emperours. After this <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> sirnamed, or rather nick-named, <hi>Copronimus,</hi> in the yeare of<note place="margin">Sigebert.</note> Christ, saith <hi>Sigebert</hi> seuen hundred fifty fiue, called a Synod at Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantinople, wherein the worship of images was againe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. But another Synod was held at Rome by Pope <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> the third, in the yeare of Christ seuen hundred threescore and eight, wherein the worshipping of images was againe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued. Which was more famously confirmed in the yeare of Christ seuen hundred foure score and eight, by another <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:7970:56"/>
and his mother <hi>Irene,</hi> who called the second Nycen Synod, wherein Imagerie preuailed much by the helpe of Pope <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. Vpon these stirres, <hi>Charles</hi> the great was moued to call a Synod at Franckford. Thither sent Pope <hi>Hadrian</hi> the acts of the second Nicen Synod, to be approued there, and to direct this Synod at Frankford, if they would take any direction from the Pope. But the Fathers of this Synode not regarding the Popes direction, tooke a meane course betweene the Greekes, who destroyed and defaced images, and the Church of Rome, which maintained the worship thereof. For they decreed that it was not impious to set vp images, but to giue any worship to them, this they held to be vtterly against Christian faith, and to be a thing receiued from the superstition of the Gentiles. This Synod was called and confirmed by <hi>Charles</hi> the great. Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the Pope had not gotten all Iurisdiction ouer Kings, which now he claimeth. For the Emperour called Synods: not the Pope. Neither as then had hee gotten Iurisdiction ouer all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,<note place="margin">In Synodo Francsord.</note> because we see many Bishops were found in Germany, France, Aquitany, and England (for all these Nations <hi>Charles</hi> nameth in his letter to <hi>Elepandus</hi> Metropolitane of Tolet, as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring and maintaining the trueth against the worship of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) which resisted the Pope in this matter: so that his great and soueraigne Iurisdiction was not then established.</p>
               <p n="16">16. About this time that most worthy, most religious, and learned King <hi>Alfred</hi> raigned in England. <hi>Aser Meneuensis</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">Aser praefat, ad Alphredum.</note> his life, entituleth him, <hi>Omnium Britanniae insulae Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum rectorem.</hi> Which title doth not much differ from that which is now in part giuen to the King: supreame Gouernour of all persons Ecclesiasticall. For whereas at this day the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Court of Rome, exempteth Clerkes from the Kings Courts, and consequently from the Kings gouernment, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that in King <hi>Alfreds</hi> time, this thing was vtterly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to the world: therefore this King is called and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to bee the Gouernour of all Christians within his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. Now because Bishops and Clerks were Christians, he was hereby questionlesse vnderstood the gouernour of Clerkes
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7970:56"/>
aswell as of others. As then all forraine gouernement and Iurisdiction was excluded by that title, so nowe there is no other thing sought but in like sort to exclude all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine power and Iurisdiction, whether the Popes or any other. At this time whe n King <hi>Alsred</hi> liued and raigned, the sense, iudgement, and vnderstanding of the world, was no other; but that Kings were supreme gouernours of all persons and caufes Ecclesiasticall and Temporall within their owne Dominions. Ivnderstand gouernment here, as throughout this question I haue often admonished, gouernment or power coactiue: for this exemption of criminous Clarkes from their Kings Courts, was a thing vnknowen in the world in those dayes. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whereas it is commonly taken by our aduersaries (who vse to begge such principles, as they cannot prooue) that the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, sense, and iudgement of the world ranne wholly for the Iurisdiction, which now is practised in the Court of Rome, this wee vtterly denie. For we are able to shew when the sense, iudgement, and religion of the Church, was against them, in euery part of their pretended Iurisdiction. For first whereas the Pope claimeth Iurisdiction ouer Bishops, this is one part of his Iurisdiction, and is now the sense and iudgement of the Court of Rome, but in the times of the sixt and seuenth Carthaginian Councels, of the Affrican, and Mileuitan Synodes: at this time, I say, and alwayes before, the religion, sense, and iudgement of the whole world ran contrary. If any obiect, that these were not generall Councels, but prouinciall: I aunswere, wee vrge not their Canons onely, to rule the Pope, but their testimonies to know the truth of those times and before. For they made an exact and diligent search through all the famous Churches of Christendome, for the Popes Iurisdiction ouer Bishops, and hauing once so famously refuted that Iurisdiction, we take and reuerence their testimonies, which will for euer be held hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the Church. Before these times, the religion, sense, and iudgement of the world was not, that any Bishop or Clarke of forraine Prouinces might appeale to Rome, which now is the sense and iudgement of the Court of Rome. The Pope clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth now this Iurisdiction likewise, to depose Princes, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7970:57"/>
and vndoe the obedience of subiects; this is now the sense and iudgement of the Court of Rome: but before the time of King <hi>Pipin,</hi> the sense and iudgement of the world ran alwayes contrary. That the Pope is vniuersall Bishop; and the Church of Rome the head of other Churches, yea, the Pope the head of the vniuersall Church, is now the sense and iudgement of the Court of Rome: but this was not the sense, iudgement, and religion of the Church of Rome before the time of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the first, as the same <hi>Gregorie</hi> doth sufficiently witnesse. That cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Clarkes should be exempted from the Courts of their Kings, is now the practise and iudgement, sense and religion of the Court of Rome; but before the yeere one thousand, this was not the sense and iudgement of the world. That the Pope is aboue a generall Councell, is now the sense, and religion of the present Court of Rome: but it was not the sense and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of Rome before the time of the Councell of Trent. In like sort of any part of their Iurisdiction whereof here we speake, we are able to point to the time, when it was not the sense, and iudgement of the Church of Rome.</p>
               <p n="17">17. About the time wherein <hi>Alfred</hi> raigned (who began his raigne in the yeere of Christ eight hundred seuenty two, &amp; died in the yeere nine hundred.) The Popes hauing already intruded vpon the Iurisdiction of Bishops and Archbishops, beganne to make many desperate attempts vpon the Iurisdiction of Kings also: but they were repressed where the Emperours had any power to resist; and though they assumed Iurisdiction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Emperours, yet they brought not all to an effect. <hi>Cran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Concerning this Iurisdiction there was a long contention between the Papacie and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, this was the Iurisdiction which the two <hi>Henries,</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

But as the contentions betweene the two <hi>Henrics,</hi> and the two <hi>Fredericks,</hi> and others, did fully open and reueale to the world the Popes purpose for Iurisdiction: so when it was once reuealed and fully knowen to the world; it was denied and oppugned by the men of the best learning, that then liued in the Church of Rome: which thing we are more fully to declare hereafter.</p>

THe Popes and the Court of Rome, perceiuing well how much it made for the aduancement to that Sea, if they might be secured for the right and title to this Iurisdiction which they purposed to challenge and practise: And vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that none would beleeue that they had any right to it, vnlesse they shewed some antiquity for it: finding also that they wanted Scriptures, &amp; the testimonie of the ancient Church: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a most desperate and vile practise, to forge antiquities, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uising certaine writings, &amp; fathering the same vpon the ancient Bishops of Rome; all was to make some shew and title to this Iurisdiction, whereof they were so much inamoured.

simplicitie and ignorance of that age. For when the fatall time was come that Antichrist must send vp that smoak, wherwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the truth was darkened: then fell such a iudgement vppon the world, that together with the darkening of Scriptures: learning, knowledge, and iudgement was decayed, and they did with greedinesse beleeue lies and forgeries, who could not examine the truth. Then began they to publish new decretall Epistles, vnder the names of <hi>Clemens, Anaclet, Euaristus, Sixtus, Telesphorus, Higinus, Pius, Anicetus Soter, Eleutherius, Victor:</hi> and many others. In whose names, certaine Epistles are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to claime this Iurisdiction, but so absurd, the stile so vnfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ages wherin these Bishops liued, that the learned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists themselues blush at the forgerie. The argument of all these Epistles is in a manner one and the same, all plead for Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and if this question might be determined by these testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, then should they obtaine their Iurisdiction without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie. The things which are most of all handled and repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therein; are, the Primacie of the Pope, the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Church of Rome; exemption of Clarkes, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation to the Sea Apostolicke: these are the things handled and repeated ouer and ouer.

Trid. sess. 4. decret. 1</note> Canon, that the traditions of the Church of Rome, must be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and imbraced with the like honour and reuerence, as the holy Scriptures are honoured. Therefore they deuise the word of God to be either written in Scriptures, or vnwritten in Traditions, which vnwritten Traditions they reuerence for Gods word, no lesse then the holy Scriptures themselues. And if you aske, how shall men trie true Traditions, they aunswere there is no better triall then the iudgement of the Church of Rome. <hi>Ex tcstimonio huius solius Ecclesiae sumi potest certum ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentum ad probandas Apostolicas Traditiones.</hi> By these prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,<note place="margin">Bellar. de verbo Dei non scrip. lib. 4. cap. 9.</note> if they might once haue them graunted, they thinke themselues able to conclude any thing, to delude the holy Scriptures, and to set vp prophane, and Barbarous forgeries in place of holy Scriptures. For if wee denie this pretended Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, they will aunswere that it is grounded vpon the word of God: if we demaund, what word they haue for it? They tell vs: <hi>Tu es Petrus, &amp;c.</hi> and such like. If wee say the sense and meaning of those Scriptures doe no way maintaine that Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, the auncient Fathers neuer expounded them so: that that sense was neuer drawen from these Scriptures, before these forged decretall Epistles deuised it. To this they will say, they take that sense of Scriptures, which the Church of Rome ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, and the Pope, who onely hath authoritie to giue the sense of Scriptures. The summe and conclusion of all, is this: the Traditions of the Church of Rome, are to be honoured and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7970:63"/>
with the same honour as the holy Scripture: but these filthy, forged, and corrupt Epistles containe the Traditions, yea, are the Traditions of the Church of Rome: therefore these fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy forgeries of corrupt men, are to be honoured, and reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as the holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Now though some men vnlearned may be caried away with this vaine shew of Traditions, yet wee see not how their learned men can plead ignorance, or excuse, who know that those expositions of these Scriptures, were first forged in the decretall Epistles: these be their Apostolicall Traditions, these be matched with holy Scriptures. I appeale to the conscience of any Papist that either is, or would bee esteemed learned: whether these Epistles be not forged, in his iudgement? And whether the ground of their Iurisdiction be not hence drawen? And whether this Iurisdiction which in these Epistles is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, concerning appellation: was not repressed, and vtterly denied by Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> and the rest of those auncients in the Cartheginian, Affrican, and Mileuitan Councels? Perhaps it is not hard for a man of a leaden heart, and a brasen forehead to rush through these difficulties after the Romane Catholike ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner without blushing; but let a man in humility and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, set himselfe to seeke the truth herein, and to giue God the glory, and it will bee impossible for him to wrastle out of these nets, but by confessing the forgerie, and reiecting the Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction forged.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Moreouer that it may it further appeare; that this Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is esteemed all in all, and more then all by these men: and that all other parts of their religion, are not so deare to them, as this: we may further obserue, that as the Pope ouer-ruled the Councell of Trent, so the thing that swayed the Pope, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to resolue vpon this course which now is established by the Court of Rome, in the Councell of Trent, was onely the feare of loosing, and care of maintaining this Iurisdiction. For before the Councell of Trent (which thing we shall hereafter by Gods helpe more manifest at good opportunity) the Church of Rome stood so indifferently affected in the chiefe points of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: that if the respect and practise of the Pope had not

For after that time that they had begun to challenge this Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, &amp; before the Councell of Trent, the Popes were alwayes afrighted at the name of a generall Councell; as <hi>Paul.

For if the Popes were wont so much to feare and flie a generall Councell in regard of censur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ng and inhibiting their Iurisdiction; then must these conclusions fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: That the Councell of Trent was not a generall Councell, because the Pope was not afraid of it: that the Popes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues did acknowledge, that the Iurisdiction of a Councell was aboue their Iurisdiction: for otherwise why should the Pope be afraid of a free Councell? So that if the Councell of Trent had beene like to those Councels which the Popes did so much feare; it might haue giuen as good satisfaction to true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as now it doth to the followers and flatterers of the Court of Rome. And before that Councell, there was great hope that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7970:64"/>
it might haue bin so. For the minds of al good men were maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously prepared to peace, and to a mutuall consent. And for the points of doctrine, if the Friars and such as were by them infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, had not troubled all, the truth might haue preuailed. For Cardinall <hi>Contaren</hi> made a good preparation to the doctrine of<note place="margin">Card. Contaren. tract. de iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catione.</note> iustification: which being the greatest point in controuersie, is handled by him conformable to the doctrine of <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,</hi> and directly against that which was concluded in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent: this he wrote in the yeere one thousand fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fourtie and one, a little before that Councell. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall therein teacheth nothing, but that which was before him the knowen doctrine of the Church of Rome: from which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Councell of Trent swarued, therefore they made the separation, and not we. This wisdome and moderation of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Contaren</hi> and others of that side, gaue great hope to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Bucer,</hi> and some other of this side; to labour for an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and mutuall consent: and assuredly there was great reason to hope it. For if the rest had beene of that spirit and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Cardinall <hi>Contaren, Georgius Cassander, Iohn Ferus,</hi> Master <hi>Antonius Flaminius, Espencaeus</hi> and many others, a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all consent would haue beene obtained. But will yee haue the truth? the points of faith and doctrine, were not the things which most hindered this concord; for in these things many of that side were very conformable, and moe might haue beene drawen: but there was another thing which crossed all peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble purposes; this was the Popes Iurisdiction. If it had not bene for this Iurisdiction, the doctrine of <hi>Luther</hi> might haue beene easily granted: for what taught he, which was not before him taught in the Church of Rome? I graunt that the contrary was also taught by Friars: for in the Church of Rome before the Councell of Trent, some taught after the manner of the new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised doctrines which Friars brought in: others taught the truth preseruing the auncient doctrines in most points, till that time, as by their writings extant appeareth. So that if the Councell of Trent had beene indifferently chosen of learned men then liuing: and if their voyces had not bene forced and forestalled by an oath of obedience to the Pope, and to satisfie his lust: (a

                  <p n="15">15. And because wee haue so often mentioned, and are so<note place="margin">The Councell of Trent.</note> often to mention the Councell of Trent, seeing we wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect it, and our aduersaries wholly rest vpon it: it may bee expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that wee should giue some reasons why we disable it so much: I may answere, the reasons are in the doctrines and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions themselues, which are throughly and worthily exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Master <hi>Chemnifius</hi> and others. But ouer and besides the falshood of doctrines, which are concluded there directly against the manifest truth of holy Scriptures, we haue also these iust ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions; that, that Councell was neither a generall, nor a free, nor a lawfull Councell. Generall it was not, because if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider<note place="margin">Not a generall Councell.</note> these Westerne parts of Christendome, for the benefite whereof that Councell is pretended to be gathered, the greatest part was excluded from that Councell.

The King of England by publicke wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, protested against it, when first it was appointed by the Pope to be held at Mantua, the reasons which King <hi>Henry</hi> allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged<note place="margin">Iohn Sleidan. lib. 11.</note> against it are these: [That it belonged not to the Pope to cal Councels, but to the Emperor &amp; to the Kings of Christendom: that the Pope himselfe was to be censured by the Councell, and therefore Italy was no fit place for it: that there was no caution made to him and his Embassadours, and Bishops for their safe conduct: that though there were publike caution giuen, yet the practice of Popes in breaking their faith, and violating publike cautions, and sucking the blood of innocent men was too well knowen. In fine the King giueth aduise to all other Princes, and Magistrates, to gouerne their owne people, to establish true religion, to reiect the Popes tyrannie, as hee had done.]</p>

Of the Princes of Germanie there is no doubt made, but that they would neuer yeelde consent to it.

At the next meeting the matters being proposed as before, it was found that the voices of these that were come so lately, did alter all; and east it at the Popes pleasure: and yet their wretched pollicies rested not thus. If any were supposed to excell in knowledge, grauitie, learning, and godlinesse, they were (some before the Councell, that their presence should not hinder or disturbe the Popes purposes: some afterward) secretly taken away by poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: this was the end of that worthy Cardinall <hi>Contaren,</hi> and<note place="margin">Sleidan. lib. 14.</note> others: who for their eminency in vertue, were suspected of Lutheranisme.

                  <p n="21">21. This was the first thing that made the alteration of the Church of Rome famous. For before the institution of Friars, the doctrines of the Church of Rome stood sound and vnchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in most things. The alteration was afterward wrought es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by these Friars, both in doctrine &amp; Iurisdiction. For at the first Friars were set vp to oppresse the old Priests, to alter
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7970:67"/>
the auncient religion, and to exalt the Popes power in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter measure then it was before. In which businesse they haue not beene idle, but taking directions onely from the Pope, haue brought in a great chaunge in all things. <hi>Wiclife</hi> obserued, that Friars pursued, imprisoned, and burned Priests onely for repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their sinnes. So that then questions of doctrine made not the quarrell betweene Priests and Friars, but only the reproofe of the corrupt and vncleane liues of Friars: as in corruption they began, so they continue. And this is testified by others<note place="margin">The first cause of persecution by Popes: not for doctrine, but for Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</note> also, that the first cause of the Popes persecutions was not for doctrine, but onely for the Popes Iurisdiction. <hi>Reinerius</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting against the Waldenses, testifieth thus much: that they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from the Church of Rome in no point of doctrine, but onely they denied the Popes Iurisdiction. <hi>Haec secta Leonista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reinerius</note> (for so they were called) <hi>magnam habet speciem pietatis</hi> (saith he) <hi>eo quod coram hominibus iuste viuant, &amp; benè omnia de Deo credant, &amp; omnes articulos qui in Symbolo continentur; solam Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manam Ecclesiam blasphemant &amp; oderunt.</hi> So that all the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie which then was found in them, was onely against the Popes Iurisdiction, they swarued not from the doctrines of the Church of Rome, but the Friars made the alteration from that aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent doctrine. Then howsoeuer since that time some Popish writers, vpon humour and partialitie haue charged them in points of doctrine: yet the writers of that age, and neere it, euen their aduersaries, do therin iustifie them, and shew that the quarrell was not for points of doctrine, but only for the Popes Iurisdiction. And it is worth obseruation, that the same <hi>Reine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> confesseth that there was no origin of this sect knowen, some, saith he, asfirme that this sect hath continued from the time of <hi>Siluester:</hi> others thinke it continued from the time of the Apostles, himselfe concludeth that out of question, it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter then any other sect.

                  <p n="22">22. And that this was an end of the institution of these or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: to make some chaunge in that ancient religion, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore stood in the Church of Rome in some tollerable measure,

That these men may better be knowen, I will note what <hi>Iohn Wiclife</hi> and some others haue obserued.</p>
                  <p>Friars taught (saith <hi>Wiclife</hi>) that the King of England is not<note place="margin">VViclife lib. de sundam. legum Angl. cap. 36. pag. 42. 4.</note> Lord of the Clargie, but that the Pope is their Lord.</p>
                  <p>Friars so streitched the priuiledges of the Clargie, that though an Abbot and all his couent ben open traitours conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring<note place="margin">Companit. pag. 9</note> vnto death of the King and Queene, and other Lords; and inforce them to destroy all the Realme: the King may not take fro them an half-penny, ne farthing worth.</p>

Friars sayen, that they han more power then the<note place="margin">p. 28.</note> Curat, and thus they make dissention and discord among Ch i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian men. Friars labour to roote out true Priests that preach<note place="margin">p. 30.</note> Christs Gospel, themselues han their chamber and seruice like Lords or Kings, and senden out idiots full of couetise, to preach not the Gospell, but Chronicles, Fables, and leesings to please the people, &amp; to rob them.

                  <p>They shew not to the people their great sinnes, and namely<note place="margin">p. 31.</note> to mighty men of the world, but pursuen other true preachers, for they will not glose mighty men, and comfort them in their sins.

                  <p n="23">23. By this wee may in part see those innouations, which Friars brought into the Church, raysing a new Iurisdiction to the Pope, defrauding and robbing the King of his auncient Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction: these are they who first taught, and practised obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to another Soueraigne then the King, conspiracy against the life of Princes: impropriations, turning tithes first from their true and auncient vse: persecution for preaching the Gospell;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7970:69"/>
exemptions; the vse of Legends in the Church, and reading of fables to the people: Symonie, flattery, pardons, indulgences: the heresie of an accident without a subiect: singular and blind obedience; the vse of commutation of penance into money: they were instruments of warres and bloodshed, they inuented works of supererogation, the doctrin that reprobates are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Catholike Church: to robbe the land of money. These are the things in part which are obserued by <hi>Wiclife</hi> to haue beene first inuented by Friars. Now whereas <hi>Iohn Wiclife</hi> was reputed an hereticke, wee finde that this imputation was laid vpon him especially by Friars. For he was a professed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to them, and to their innouations, holding with the Church of Rome, and maintaining no other doctrine, then that which he found publikely maintained and receiued in the world, before Friars altered it. Still he pleadeth the cause of the Priests against Friars, which sheweth that he taught no otherwise then those Priests did teach. And albeit the Friars did marueilouslly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order the Church in his time, yet hee witnesseth that the third part of the Clergie of England defended the truth against Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars. Then the Friars being set vp to alter the auncient doctrine<note place="margin">Confess. de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram. pag. 64.</note> and Iurisdiction, and to induce new: did labour herein through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imploying their best skill and power, for the aduancement of the Pope, and suppressing of the truth. Heerein the Iesuites succeed their forefathes, in this inheritance of innouation, daily adding some new monsters, to those which these old Friars left to their hands.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. The Vniuersitie of Paris hath likewise declared their iudgement against Friars, somewhat before this time wherein <hi>Wiclife</hi> liued. They gathered seuen Articles against Friars, which because they proue Friars to be the authors &amp; introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of innouation in the Church, I will here set them downe. [First, we say, that Friars are not to be admitted into our Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasticall<note place="margin">Extat catalog test. veritat.</note> societie, except by our consent: because the society<note place="margin">Tom. 2. p. 798.</note> ought not to be coact but voluntarie. Secondly, because wee haue found by experience, that their fellowship hath beene ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes hurtfull and dangerous to vs. Thirdly, seeing they are of a diuerse profession from ours: for they are regulars, and wee
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7970:70"/>
schollers; we ought not to be ioined or mingled together in one scholasticall office. For the Spanish Councell saith, Thou shalt not plow with an Oxe &amp; an Asse, thatis, thou shalt not associate men of diuers professions together in one office: for how can they agree together, whose studies, vowes, and purposes are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers? Fourthly, because they raise dissentions &amp; offences, but the Apostle saith: we beseech you brethren that you obserue them, that is, that you discerne such as make dissentions for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which you haue learned of the Apostles, and eschewe them; for they serue not the Lord, but their belly. Gloss. for they flatter some, they backbite others, that they may fill their bellies: and by glosing words and their benedictions they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile the hearts of the simple. Fiftly, because we feare least they bee such as enter into houses, because they thrust them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues into euery mans house; they search and sift the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men: &amp; seduce such as they find like women ready to be seduced. And who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue once seduced, them they draw from the Councels of their owne Prelates, to their Councels: for they bind them by oath to their Councels, such the Apostle commaundeth to eschew. Sixtly, because we feare they are false Prophets, for they are not Bishops, nor Parish-priests, nor their Vicars, nor by them inuited: yet they preach, being not sent, against the Apostle saying, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. How shall they preach except they be sent. For they worke no miracles, thereby to witnesse that they may preach: the Church then ought to auoid such men, being so dangerous. Seuenthly, because they are curious, and hauing no lawfull calling in the Church, they busie themselues with other mens businesse, &amp; thrust themselues into other mens callings: and yet they are neither Apostles, nor their successours; that is, Bishops, neither are they of the seuenty and two Disciples of the Lord, neither their helpers, or Vicars, as before is said. Now the Apostle commaundeth vs to eschewe such as will liue so: saying, 2. <hi>Thess. vlt.</hi> We declare brethren to you in the name of the Lord Iesus Christ, that you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw your selues from euery brother that walketh inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not according to that tradition which they haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of vs, &amp;c.]</p>

                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:7970:70"/>25. Thus haue we set downe the sincere iudgement of that Vniuersitie, before it was corrupted and infected with Friars. They haue prooued that Friars haue no lawfull calling in the Church to preach, or administer the Sacraments; because they haue no institution of Christ or his Apostles. And howsoeuer since those times the iudgement of that Vniuersitie was chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, after they had once receiued these serpents into their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes: yet the reasons which they haue brought against Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, are vnchaungeably true, and will alwayes prooue that which then they prooued, that neither the old Friars, nor the new Iesuits, haue any lawfull calling in the Church. As thus they haue beene the bane of the Church in chaunging the old bounds: so they haue beene the ruine of Princes, and the cause of great warres and bloodshed, yea of all the persecutions that haue bene since. For before that time that the orders of Friars were brought foorth by a new and monstrous birth in the Church; there was no bloodshed nor persecution offered by the Pope, nor the Church of Rome, for matters of Religion. <hi>Berengarius</hi> was forced to a Recantation before, but no blood was shed. But after that <hi>Dominicke</hi> had instituted the order of the Iacobites, or preaching Friars; and <hi>Francis</hi> the order of the Minorites, professed beggars: then began great bloodshed and persecution to be practised vpon men, that did not allow the Popes Iurisdiction: in blood was it first founded, and so it hath beene euer since maintained.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. The first persecution began against them, that were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Albingenses:</hi> whose opinions are made hainous by some that write affectionately since that time; but by the writers of that time there appeareth no other thing wherewith they were<note place="margin">Albegesij, quorii dogma nemo ad hunc diem notus scriptor reliquit: &amp; cum haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos eos vocent, genus tamen hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reseos praetere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt.

Wherein wee behold the endes of such. Councels as the Pope calleth, and wherein he is President: as the Councell of Lateran, and the Councell of Trent. For as vpon the time of holding the Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran Councell, the first Friars were ordained, and allowed by the Pope; so vpon the time of the Councell of Trent were the Iesuites confirmed to be an order by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third: after both Councels, great warres and bloodshed followed through Christendome; wherein the Friars were the Popes instruments, and the procurators of the warres at both times, and euer since.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. As these first orders of Friars increased in number, swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming like Locusts vnder the Popes protection; he like an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Captaine, prouidently ordered his troupes, and set them to their seuerall taskes: some to writing of books, some to the practises of state against Princes. By those that were set to write, as <hi>Aquinas, Scotus,</hi> and such like, the alterations of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines were brought into the Church of Rome first: so that herein appeareth their full &amp; finall end, in raising vp rebellions; first against God, and corrupting of the truth: and then against Princes, by impugning their soueraigne authoritie and Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. In both which practises, the Friars take continuall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the Pope, by whose power they were created, by whose authoritie they stand, from whose spirit they breath, and for whose seruice they are deuoted, and resolued to spend their breath and blood. In these practises, the Iesuites being the last brood, striue to surpasse all other, for their audacious corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

ANother especiall meanes of aduauncing this Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was practised by exacting Oathes: which is also much practised now; because by experience they finde great vse of it; an Oath being the greatest bond of humane societie, and the fittest meanes to ingage men throughly in any cause: the first exacting of Oathes, was from Archbishops, and Bishops, by which meanes their Allegeance was strangely withdrawen from their Soueraigne Princes. Whereas then first princes for their owne safetie, and for the safetie of their Countrey, vsed to exact an Oath of Allegeance, aswell of the Ecclesiasticall, as Temporall subiects: The Popes began to withdraw the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie from this obedience, and Allegeance; and so farre they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed, that the Friars taught, that the King of England was not lord of the Clergie, but that the Pope was their lord: as we haue declared from <hi>Ioh. Wiclife.</hi> And now the Pope begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in these desperate dayes, to forbidde them of the laity, to take the Oath of Allegeance to their Soueraigne: whereby as they began to steale away the hearts of the Clergie first, from the true and lawfull obedience of their Soueraignes; so now proceeding in the same course with the laity, what will they leaue to Kings in the end? And because this containeth an especiall mysterie of Iurisdiction, therefore we thinke it needfull to be plainely opened.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. That Kings did out of dutie and Allegeance, exact an Oath of their subiects, euen of Bishops; and had the same yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7970:72"/>
as a due homage to them, and confirmed also by decrees of Councels: it is well and worthily obserued of late, by that booke written most learnedly and exactly, intituled, <hi>Tripliei nodo triplex cuneus.</hi> Where this vse is confirmed from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the fourth <hi>Toletan</hi> Councell, held in the yeere sixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirtie: and from the fift <hi>Toletan</hi> Councell, held about the same time. And from the sixt <hi>Toletan</hi> Councell held in the yeere sixe hundred seuentie and sixe. And from the tenth <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Councell, gathered in the yeere, sixe hundred ninetie and soure: as also from the Councel of Aquisgrane, in the yere eight hundred thirtie and sixe. We may adde (though it be needlesse) some fewe and small obseruations thereto. It appeareth, that this practise of taking an Oath of Allegeance of subiects, is drawen from the law of nature, as necessary for the preseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of States, and it seemeth to be as auncient as the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of States. For <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the first founder of the State of<note place="margin">Plutarch Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgo.</note> Lacedemon, hauing once well ordered that State by good lawes: tooke an Oath of them all that they should preserue those orders till his returne from the Oracle: that is alwayes. If any thinke that this was not an Oath of Allegeance to the State, I suppose it will be hard to distinguish betweene an Oath to preserue the lawes, or to be true to the lawes; and an Oath to be true to the State. For it is certaine, that the State of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon, was preserued by those lawes in great honour and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie, for the space of fiue hundred yeeres, as the same Author reporteth: Or as hee saith in another place, for sixe hundred<note place="margin">Plutarch. ibid.</note> yeeres; and vpon the breach of those lawes came in the ruine<note place="margin">Plut.

This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth the antiquitie of this Oath, as proceeding from the law of nature; which yeeldeth this helpe to States for the necessarie preseruation of themselues. For which cause it hath bene practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, whensoeuer the State thought it needful: for after the kings were driuen out of Rome, L. <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Collatinus Tarquinius</hi> being chosen Consuls: <hi>Valerius Publicola</hi> grew so offended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause himselfe was not respected in that choise, that he retired from the Senate, &amp; from all publick action to a priuate life. This thing drewe the Senate into some suspicion of his Allegeance. Wherfore <hi>Brutus</hi> the Consul called all the Senate to a solemne
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7970:72"/>
Oath of Allegance: which Oath <hi>Valerius</hi> first of al others took<note place="margin">Plutarch. Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licola.</note> most cheerefully. Thus in the danger of the State, they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to this practise as the most lawfull, and assured helpe of States. And <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> is much commended in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane<note place="margin">Liui. Plutarch.

After the same manner was this Oath of Allegeance yeelded by the Church of the Iewes of old. For <hi>Iosephus</hi> reporteth, that <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> required an Oath of Allegeance; which Oath, saith he, all the nation of the Iewes did take, sauing o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And therefore these Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises, he describeth to be seditious and intollerable stirrers in States, euen such as the Friars prooued afterward. The words of <hi>Iosephus,</hi> though they be long, yet I will set downe; because they open the practise of this Oath of Allegance, the consent of the auncient Church of the Iewes, and the seditious and pestife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous practise of the Pharises, that the Iesuites the broode of these Vipers may the better be knowen: his words are these.</p>

For they were troublesome, seditious, the stirrers of wars, iniurious and immoderate prouokers of trouble with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause or ground.

But they, to recompence this her great liberalitie, tooke vpon them the foretelling of things to come, as men forsooth indued with diuine inspiration: they prophesied that K. <hi>Herods</hi> end was at hand, decreed by the diuine Maiestie, and the end of all his issue, and kinred: and that this woman their Benefactour with her husband <hi>Pherora,</hi> and

By this wee perceiue the Popes meaning, in denying that Kings ought to exact an Oath of Allegeance of Clarkes: especially of Bishops, for they finding that the Oath of Allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance draweth subiects to the obedience of Princes, resist it by all possible meanes: because the Popes seeke Soueraigne Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance: which cannot be performed both to the Pope, and to Princes: so that if the Popes purposes stand, ciuill obedience to Princes cannot stand. And howsoeuer the Iesuites cauill at the late Oath of Allegeance by Parliament enacted, quarrelling against it, as if it were not a meere Ciuill Oath: yet this is but their friuoulous exception, for it is euident by this Epistle of the Pope, that an Oath of meere Ciuill Allegeance, standeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Popes purposes. For this Oath which <hi>Fredericke</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteth,<note place="margin">The like Oath was exacted of all the Cities of Italy, vnder the Empire, by <hi>Henry</hi> the fift Emperour.</note> was for meere Ciuill Allegeance; and yet the Pope deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Emperour ought to take such an Oath of Bishops: the reason was that which <hi>Iohn Wiolife</hi> descried, because Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops must be the Popes subiects, not the Kings. This was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a part of that quarrell, wherewith <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> troubled the State in his time; for he hauing first taken the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance<note place="margin">Naucler. 2. gener. 38.</note> to King <hi>Henrie</hi> the second; afterward repenting, sought<note place="margin">Houeden. part poster.</note> to be absolued of the Pope.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. Then this Oath of Allegeance to Kings, was in vse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we finde it exacted by the Pope: the Pope did first exact it of Archbishops. The first that I can find to binde himselfe in an Oath to the Pope, was <hi>Boniface</hi> tearmed the Germane Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, Archbishop of Mentz, an English man by birth named <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefride.</hi> For Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the second, desirous to draw the Germanes vnder the yoake of his ceremonies (the Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion being long before planted among them) sent this <hi>Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fride,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Boniface,</hi> to reduce all to the obedience of Rome as much as might be. For this purpose he exacted an Oath of <hi>Boniface,</hi> the forme of the Oath is extant in <hi>Auentinus,</hi> thus: [In the name of our Lord and Sauiour, <hi>Leo</hi> being Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,<note place="margin">Auentin. Ann. lib. 3.</note> &amp;c. I <hi>Boniface</hi> promise to thee S. <hi>Peter,</hi> which wast the chiefe of Christs Apostles, and to <hi>Gregorie</hi> who now represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thy person, and to all thy successours by the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, &amp;c. I vow by this thy holy body,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7970:74"/>
that I will follow the sincere truth of Christian pietie, as long as my life and strength last, I will keepe concord, I will shunne persons excommunicated, I will giue notise of lying sects, of pestiferous errours against the decrees of our Elders, to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome.] This Oath carrieth a shew of great moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being compared with the formes of those Oathes which succeeding Popes exacted.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. We declared before how <hi>Hildebrand</hi> caused the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, to displace certaine Bishops: and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after that he had made a breach betweene the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and them, he restored them all to their seuerall places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; and exacted an Oath of them, to be true to him, the forme of that Oath I find not: but it seemeth that then an Oath was exacted much in preiudice of Princes. For <hi>Anselme</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Canterburie, by reason of that Oath which then the Popes exacted, was enboldened to raise a contention with <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Rufus,</hi> about inuestitures. And <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> by vertue of the like Oath, contended with <hi>Henry</hi> the second: for that vpon the quarrell for inuestitures, Bishops were strictly tied to the Pope by an Oath, we finde in the contention which was betweene Pope <hi>Paschalis</hi> the second, and <hi>Henrie</hi> the fift Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. For when <hi>Henrie</hi> the fift had bene set vp by the Pope, to raise warres against his owne Father, and had at the Popes instigation, robbed him of his Empire and life: he himselfe found afterward the same measure at the Popes hands, which his Father had found before him; for claiming the right of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uestitures as belonging to the auncient right of the Empire, he was denied: the matter brake out into a tumult, in which tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult Pope <hi>Pascbalis</hi> was taken, and being in the Emperours power, graunted and confirmed vnto him the right of inuesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. From which graunt the Pope reuolted afterward, and shewed himselfe more vehement in this quarrell, then any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. After some stirres and contention, the Pope held a Synode at Trecae in France: this Synode was held in the yeere one thousand one hundred and seuen. Wherein the Bishops of Germanie were suspended by the Pope, for doing any part of<note place="margin">Vspergens.</note> Episcopall function, (saith <hi>Vspergensis</hi>) because, fauouring the

                  <p n="35">35. Thus were Kings robbed of their strength, when Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were by an Oath so bound to the Pope, that what hee commaunded, they must doe. And if the Pope listed to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell Princes for their auncient rights and priuiledges, it was enough for him to say, those priuiledges of Princes were mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Ecclesiasticall or Spirituall, and must therefore belong to the Pope: and not to Temporall Princes. What thing could more weaken Princes, and bring them to that poore state, that the Pope might triumph ouer them, as he did, then this subtill practise whereby Bishops, who before with other subiects held their Allegeance inuiolated to their Soueraignes; were now by a new policie of Popes, brought by Oath to the Popes subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and forced to violate their Allegeance to their Princes. Consider then what seruice Princes may expect from Popish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops, who are so bound by Oath to the Pope, that they can doe no seruice either to God, or their Prince (if it be against the Pope) but they must violate their Oathes. And this is the great bond of their spirituall Iurisdiction, as they call it. The Popes haue wrested from Princes their auncient right by violence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications, warres, and great bloodshed: these rights of Princes thus withdrawen from them, the Popes hold as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their Iurisdiction: and to strengthen them herein they bind Bishops and other chiefe of the Clergy, by Oaths to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, against their owne Kings: these practises set the Pope in the possession of this Iurisdiction.</p>

To this purpose there is a Canon in the Decretals of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ninth, which Canon because it openeth somewhat, both of the reason and antiquitie of this Oath, I will set downe<note place="margin">De elect. &amp; elect. potest. cap. 4. Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificasti.</note> the whole. Thus it is: <hi>Significasti Reges &amp; regni maiores admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione permotos, &amp;c.</hi> That is: [You signified to me by your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,<note place="margin">Apocrisiarius, id est, responsalis negotiorum Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiast corum.</note> that the Princes and Barons of the Kingdome, were moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with admiration, that the Pall was offered you by our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisiaries, (that is <hi>Chaplanes</hi>) with this condition, that you should take that Oath which they brought you written from vs.<note place="margin">Hinc marus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. 3.

Now if the creator of consciences, and searcher of secrets vsed this condition, and that not once, but the second time and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, till he had made him sorie: What care then ought we to haue that so great a Prelateship of the Church bee not by vs committed to our brethren, whose consciences we know not. They obiect that all Oathes are prohibited by the Lord, and that this practise of exacting Oathes, is not found either esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by the Apostles of Christ, or by Councels. What then is that which the Lord addeth as next following: That which is<note place="margin">Hoc enim am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For euill compelleth and forceth vs (the Lord permitting) to exact this which is more. For is not this euil, to start from the Church, and obedience of the Sea A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicke? And to breake out against the constitutions of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons? Which many haue done, after their Oath to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.

They obiect that this thing is not established by Councels: as though any Councels may prescribe a Law to the Romane Church, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Councels are by the Authoritie of the Bishops of Rome enacted, and haue their strength. And in their Canons the Popes Authoritie is manifestly excepted.]</p>
                  <p n="38">38. The Reader may be intreated hence to obserue: First, that this Oath in the time of <hi>Paschalis</hi> the second, who wrote this (for <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ninth Collected it from him) was receiued with great admiration, both of Temporall Lords, and of the<note place="margin">Anno 1099.</note> Archbishop himselfe, as a thing neuer practised before that time. Then we haue the antiquitie of imposing such an Oath. Secondly, we obserue this cursed boldnesse of the Pope, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting Scriptures to serue his pride and lust. Without which blasphemous abuse of holy Scriptures, this Iurisdiction could neither at first haue beene imposed; nor since maintained. Thus hee handleth all the Scriptures that he meeteth withall, as in these few words two diuers Scriptures. Thirdly, he graunteth that euill compelled him to this, God onely permitting, which is as if he should say: The diuell compelleth and driueth him to it, God onely permitteth. He who acknowledgeth thus much, is wittingly and willingly the seruant of the diuell, and of that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7970:76"/>
euill which by his owne confession compelleth him. Fourthly, he reiecteth the authoritie of the Apostles and Councels, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe aboue them. Fifthly, his reason is to bee noted, drawen from Scripture: Christ saith, That which is more then this is of euill; therefore the Pope may exact an Oath of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops. And the Popes Canons hauing once expounded this Scripture thus; it must alwayes be the true sense of it: For that say they is the true sense which the Pope giueth. Sixthly, where we find this Oath exacted of an Archbishop, accounted a thing so strange by the Barons of the land: We collect that the Pope at the first required this Oath of Archbishops onely, which was the cause that mooued many Archbishops to ioyne with the Pope in the pursuite of this new Iurisdiction against their owne Soueraignes. And hence we see a reason, why <hi>Anselme</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the King against the liking and consent of all the Bishops of the land, as we shall hereafter declare: Because this Oath was exacted of Archbishops, <hi>Anselme</hi> had taken it. For (as by this Canon it appeareth) it was conueyed with the Pall to the Archbishops, if they will haue the Pall, besides the other price, they must take this Oath. But the Bishops as then had not taken the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oath, which made them freer to withstand <hi>Anselm.</hi> Seuenthly, and last of all, obserue what kind of Oath the Pope required: An Oath of Allegeance, And therefore the summe and purpose of that former Canon, is thus set downe in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the thirteenth. <hi>Electo in Archiepiscopum sedes Apostolica Pallium non tradet, nisi prius praestet fideluatis &amp; obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae iuramentum.</hi> That is, [The Sea Apostolike will not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Pall to any Elect for Archbishop, except he first take an Oath of Fidelitie and Obedience.] Then the Oath which the Pope requires, is an Oath of Allegeance. By this the purpose, reason, Antiquitie, and honestie of this Oath may the better appeare.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. Besides this Oath which Popes haue exacted of the Clergie, they haue laboured to bring the Emperours also vnto their obedience by an Oath: There is the forme of an Oath set<note place="margin">D. 63. cap. 33.</note> downe, <hi>Dist.</hi> 63. as exacted by Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the twelfth, of <hi>Otho</hi> the first Emperour: but because in that distinction there is much

counterfeited stuffe thrust in, as that Canon which beginneth <hi>Ego Ludouicus, &amp;c.</hi> which <hi>Carolus Molinaeus</hi> hath by irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable proofes manifested to be forged; therfore this is to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected to be of the same kinde. And this thing seemeth so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, that there is no reason to receiue it, without better story, then the Popes Canons: For <hi>Otho</hi> the first was a Prince of great worth, wise and valiant; and <hi>Iohn</hi> the twelfth, a Pope that deserueth no better Titles of the Historiographers, then a Monster and a Beast. Neither was this Emperour at any time in the power of that Pope, but the Pope in his; for <hi>Iohn</hi> the twelfth helped <hi>Beringarius</hi> and his sonne, against <hi>Otho,</hi> which caused <hi>Otho</hi> to bring an Armie against him: And as <hi>Luitpran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>

Then for any Oath that <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho</hi> should take to the Pope, we finde nothing in Storie but the contrarie. True it is, that <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth Emperour was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by <hi>Hildebrand</hi> to such an Oath: for this Emperour being by him excommunicated, his Nobles and Bishops falling from his obedience, was driuen to come bare-foote with his wife and little sonne, in a sharpe frost to Canusium (where the Pope then lay) and to stay at the gates of the Citie all night: and though in greatest humility he intreated pardon, yet <hi>Hildebrand</hi> was so busied (forsooth in company of his Harlots) that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour<note place="margin">Naucl. Gener at 36.</note> was forced to attend three daies in this grieuous affliction, before he might haue accesse to his holinesse. And when hee<note place="margin">Schardius by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomn.</note> came before him, he must be contented to be bound by an Oath to stand to the Popes iudgement: that at the pleasure of the Pope, before the triall of his cause, he should be ready either to leaue or to retaine his Kingdom: that he should vse no Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly habite or ornament in the meane time: that hee should not vndertake any part of gouernement: that he should not exact an Oath of Allegeance of his owne subiects: that hee should neuer reuenge this wrong vpon the Pope. When he had thus
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7970:77"/>
hampered the Emperour with an Oath, and with such strange and mercilesse conditions (such is the Popes mercy where he is Master) behold a stratagem, a president of humility, godlinesse, patience, mildenesse of a Pope, he set vp <hi>Rodolph</hi> Duke of Sueuia against him in battell.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. The Popes hauing once extorted an Oath of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, were desirous vpon such presidents to make lawes: for they had no other meanes to build vp their Iurisdiction: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when as first by force they extorted some Oathes, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they set such examples in their Canons, and last of all they expounded those Oathes, which sometimes Emperours tooke, to be Oathes of Allegeance to the Popes. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose there is a Canon in the Clementines: <hi>Clement</hi> the first confesseth that <hi>Henry</hi> the seuenth Emperour, refused the Oath which he would haue imposed vpon him: and so doe other sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries witnesse, that the Emperour refused to take that Oath. But<note place="margin">Naucler. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. 43.</note> if we will beleeue <hi>Clement</hi> in his Canon, <hi>Henry</hi> afterward yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that Oath, but would not acknwledge that it was an Oath<note place="margin">Lib. 2. tit. de iuramentis.</note> of Allegeance, because the Emperours neuer sweare Allegeance<note place="margin">See the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this Canon, cap. 8. by <hi>Marsilius</hi> and <hi>Occham.</hi>
                     </note> to Popes, but Popes to Emperours: therefore <hi>Clement</hi> in that Canon, declareth that these (which some Emperours yeelded to some Popes) were Oathes of Allegeance. <hi>Declaramns</hi> (saith he) <hi>iuramenta praedicta fidelitatis existere &amp; censeri debere:</hi> That is, [We declare that the foresaid Oathes are, and must be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be, Oathes of Allegeance.]</p>
                  <p n="41">41. By this we see how highly they would aduance the hornes of this Iurisdiction. And still we finde this confirmed, that the Oath which is giuen to the Pope, is vnderstood an Oath of Allegeance. And to certifie vs yet more fully of their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; it is set downe not onely as a law in their Decretals, but published as an ordinarie Ceremony, which al must take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of. In the booke of their Ceremonies it is said that an Oath is to be ministred to all Emperours, before their Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and before they enter the territories of the Romane Church. The Oath is there thus set downe: [I will exalt the Pope, <hi>secundum meum posse, &amp; vitam:</hi> hee shall neither loose<note place="margin">Sacrar. ceremon lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p n="42">42. In this Mysterie of Oathes they haue proceeded so far, as to exhibite an Oath not onely to the Clergie, but to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall subiects of other Princes, whom they may poyson and peruert, by reconciling them to the Pope; which as it is a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise most dangerous to them that are so taken, and insnared as Birds in the net of their owne destruction, so is it no lesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious for such Princes from whose obedience these are dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen: whereby the Pope seemeth to bring the question of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction to an issue with the Princes of Christendome, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he shall ouerthrow them, or they him: for it is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that both should stand vp together: for what is left to Princes, if their Crownes and the hearts of their subiects be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them? Or what is it, that Princes can haue a more tender feeling of, then of their Crownes, and of the hearts of their subiects? And what is more forcible to steale away the hearts of subiects from their Prince, then to binde them with an Oath of Allegeance to another Prince? Then these men that haue bound themselues by an Oath to the Pope; how is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible they should performe true Allegeance to the King? For that the Oath which is exhibited to the Pope, is an Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance and fidelity; the Popes themselues by their Decretals haue assured vs. And if you will seeke it out, this you shall finde to be the true reason, why Pope <hi>Paulus</hi> the fift in his late Breues hath forbidden the Recusants of this land, to take the Oath of Allegeance to the King, because they haue taken an Oath of Allegeance to the Pope. Now it is not possible that a man should performe Allegeance to two Soueraignes: if one be vassal to the other, happily one may hold Allegeance to two; as for example, a Tenant may sweare homage to his Land-lord, and to his Prince also: but this cannot be done to two Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes.<note place="margin">August. Anco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. lib. de po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test. Eccles. q. 22. art. 3. &amp; 4.</note> And if one shall take an Oath of Allegeance to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Lordes, it is concluded, that if the Pope be one of those Lords, he must be obeyed before all other whatsoeuer. Then it
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7970:78"/>
is not a Fatherhood in the Church, that the Pope striueth for, but a power ouer Princes, by weakning and vndermining their authority, withdrawing the hearts of subiects: exacting an Oath of Allegeance of all whom they can reconcile: and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting their Conuerts to take an Oath of Allegeance to their owne Soueraigne Princes. And because we find that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and conscionable Papists, as Master <hi>Hart</hi> in the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with Doctor <hi>Reynolds,</hi> and such like, being driuen to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the cause aright, cannot chuse but iustifie our cause, and will not yeeld to the Pope, a Princehood ouer the world, but onely a Fatherhood of the Church: not graunting to him<note place="margin">Iohn Hart Epist. to the Reader, and chap. 7. diuis. 7.</note> a power to depose Princes: confessing also that the power which we giue to Princes, is not vnderstood of themselues, for they, before they will vnderstand our cause, thinke that wee meane to giue as much to the Prince, as they doe to the Pope:<note place="margin">Hart. chap. 10. diuis. 2</note> therefore we haue reason to rest herein assured, that if the Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites entred not into the Popes battels with a Pontificall furie, the Pope would vtterly be forsaken in this, wherein all mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate spirits haue already forsaken him: or if hee would relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish this part of the quarrell, which hee maintaineth against temporall Princes, happily he might make himselfe much more stronger then he is, or possibly can be by following this co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And to say the truth, all his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (as likewise all the confidence of that side) consisteth in this new found vnblessed deuise of expunging ancient Authors.

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7970:87"/>
was but foure times at Rome, and this could not be done at his first iourney, because from the expugnation of Pauie, he went presently to the Saxon warres: and thus he proceedeth, vexing his reader with winde, and wordes lighter then winde. Though he be deepely to be charged for this light and vaine reasoning, yet his great and grosse fault wherein he was so grossely ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene, is, that in cutting <hi>Anastasius,</hi> he cut not deep enough: For <hi>Anastasius</hi> in the wordes that are left, doth expresly declare, that <hi>Charles</hi> came from the siege of Pauie to Rome, which <hi>Baronius</hi> denieth and that he brought many Bishops and Abbots with him. Thus both by cutting out of <hi>Anastasius,</hi> that which <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi> witnesseth he wrote, and by leauing in <hi>Anastasius</hi> that which doth proue so much, and testifie their falshood: they are conuinced to be corrupters of antiquities, and new forgers of nouelties.</p>
                  <p n="61">61. <hi>Baronius</hi> perceiuing that all this that he hath said will not helpe him, vnlesse he proceede further to refute likewise all that <hi>Gratian</hi> saith in the next Canon, <hi>In Synodo:</hi> goeth on, and vndertaketh also to refute it: For what other thing can he do, that hath once broken the bounds of modesty and moderation, but proceede to a resolution in impudency? <hi>Gratian</hi> cyteth the Canon of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> who gaue Inuestitures to <hi>Otho</hi> as <hi>Hadrian</hi> did to <hi>Charles. Baronius</hi> denieth that Pope <hi>Leo</hi> wrote so, as <hi>Gratian</hi> cyteth him: what authority can be produced to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie these men? VVe bring the testimonies of Popes, we bring them cyted by such as were the greatest maintainers of the Popes Iurisdiction, and yet it will not satisfie: Why? No reason is brought, but it standeth not with the liking of the Court of Rome in these daies. He saith, that the name of Inuestitures was not knowen in that age, wherein <hi>Charles</hi> liued: But how doth he proue that? No proofe is brought: and what neede he bring any proofe, seeing there are many that are readie, to take all that he saith without proofe? Concerning the name of inuestitures, the Ciuilians are herein resolued, and peremptory, that it came from the Lawes of the Lumbards, as did also all the Lawes, <hi>De feudis.</hi> For of these things there is nothing found in the auncient Romane Lawes, nor in the later Imperiall
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7970:88"/>
Lawes, vntill the gouernment of the Lumbards was raised. And therefore it is certaine, that before the gouernement of the Lumbards was erected in Italy, this word Inuestiture, can not be proued to haue beene in vse. But seeing by the Lumbards it came in, and the Lumbards were at their highest before, and in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the great (for they were ouerthrowne by <hi>Charles,</hi> after that they had raigned two hundred and foure yeares in Italy, and had possessed all Italy in a maner, except on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Palmerius An. 776.</note> the City of Rome, as diuers Authors doe witnesse) it can not<note place="margin">Naucler. gener. 23.</note> be chosen but that in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> this word was in vse. And when we haue of the one side good reason, the testimonie of histories, the iudgment of Lawyers, concurring with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse wordes of the Popes Canons which vse the same word: shall it be thought a sufficient refutation on the other side, to say the word was not then vsed, and bring no reason thereof? Then this thing was vsed in <hi>Charles</hi> his time, and the name of Inuestitures knowne. The same thing was vsed long before <hi>Charles</hi> his time, but not vnder the name of Inuestitures. This name, and the ceremonie of a staffe and a ring came in by the Lumbards. Then whether we consider the thing without this new name and ceremony, or with it: wee finde it alwayes the Princes right. Thus <hi>Sigebert</hi> is iustified, the truth tried, and the Knaue knowne.</p>
                  <p n="62">62. Now to come to the Kings of England, as their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was no lesse then the authority of other Princes in their Kingdomes, so more we seeke not. And therefore whereas a certaine Catholique diuine, telleth vs, that <hi>Henry</hi> the first cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged<note place="margin">Answer to the fift part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.</note> Inuestitures, as vsed by his father and brother before him, whereof yet (saith he) we finde no expresse proofe, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in any of our Histories, that they had vsed them, much lesse that they were lawfully graunted: how strange is this dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? beseeming none but such as he is. For is not this proofe good and sufficient, when the King chalengeth no more, then that which was in fresh memory and vse in his brothers dayes, and fathers? When wee finde so many testimonies of Story, of Councels, of Popes, that there was no other right of giuing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uestitures knowne through Christendome, then the right of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7970:88"/>
Princes: shall base persons quarrell the testimonie of a King, founded vpon such proofes? Let the world iudge of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of him who writing hee knoweth not what, will tell vs that the sense, deuotion, and iudgement of the world, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to the contrary: fancying conclusions like a dreamer, not prouing like a disputer. Now touching the particular of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the first, it is certaine that hee began no new custome, but Pope <hi>Paschalis</hi> the second, began to debarre him from that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient custome and right, which he and his Elders had alwayes vsed.</p>

                  <p n="65">65. I stay the longer vpon this point, and am more willing to search the truth herein, because it is a matter of especiall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance concerning this question of Iurisdiction, which wee seeke to know. For <hi>Robert Persons</hi> the masked Catholique di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine confesseth in effect thus much, that if wee can proue that Inuestitures belong to temporall Princes, we haue in his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment questionlesse obtained the cause for which we striue. Let<note place="margin">Answer to the fift part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, pag. 171.</note> me set downe his owne words. [Three things, saith he, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in making of a Bishop by diuine and Canon law, to wit, election, confirmation, and consecration. The first, to wit ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when it is iustly made, doth giue right to the elected to pretend the second and third, &amp;c. Yet can he not vpon his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Election, exercise any part of his office of a Bishop either in Iurisdiction or order. But when he hath the second part which is confirmation, and induction to the benefice, which is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Inuestiture; then hath he Iurisdiction vpon those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and may exercise the Acts thereof by visiting, punishing, or the like: but not the Acts of order, vntill he haue consecration also, that is to say, he cannot make Priests, nor administer the Sacrament of confirmation, &amp;c. And a little after he saith: the second which is confirmation and giuing of Iurisdiction, must onely proceede from him, that is the fountaine of all spirituall
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7970:90"/>
Iurisdiction vnder Christ, which is the Bishoppe of Rome, or some Metropolitane or Bishoppe vnder him, that hath authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Commission from him. Thus much the Catholicke Diuine.]</p>
                  <p n="66">66. I forgiue many particular escapes in this short discourse, not spending time in the examination of by-points, I would meete him there, where he thinketh himselfe strongest. For where he saith, confirmation, which also he calleth induction, or which properly, as he graunteth, may be called Inuestiture, giueth Iurisdiction: this we yeeld. And then heere wee ioyne issue with olde Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> in that part of his Collection, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he layeth his greatest hold; and are content to trie the whole<note place="margin">The issue of the quest. of Inuestitures.</note> cause thereon: whether Inuestiture, which by his confession, and the doctrine of his Church, and the consent of all, giueth Iurisdiction, belong of ancient right to the Pope, or to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Princes. If he be able to proue by any auncient, full, cleare, vnsuspected witnesse, that the Popes within the space of the first thousand yeares, or before <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> either had that right, or did practise, or so much as challenge that right: I will for my part yeeld the cause, and will confesse mine errour, if thus much be euidently euicted. But seeing we haue proued by vndoubted Histories, by the consent of Popes themselues, by the Decrees established in Councels, that this was an auncient right of temporall Princes, called <hi>Prisca consuetudo</hi> by Pope <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen, Antiqua consuetudo</hi> by another: that the contrarie was neuer heard of vnder any Christian Prince, confessed by <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the first: Then hath he reason either to yeelde vs the cause wholly, or to reuoke his wordes againe, that Inuestiture giueth Iurisdiction.</p>
                  <p n="67">67. Then the right of Inuestitures standing as the auncient right of our Kings, being neuer questioned in Christendome, before the time of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the seuenth, neuer questioned in this land before the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the first, that King had reason to pleade the vse of his father and brother for himselfe; because it being a thing quietly possessed by them, was, out of doubt, peaceably inioyed before them, because before them the Popes neuer made title thereto.

                  <p n="68">68. OVr purpose being to take a suruey of that Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which we finde challenged by Popes, at and somewhat after the time of the Conquest of England, at what time the Popes power was at the highest: we are to consider in the next place Exemption of criminous Clerkes; for as Inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiture of Bishoppes began then to be claimed, so about these times crept exemption of the Popes Clerkes, which is taken to be another part of this Iurisdiction. My purpose is not to speake of lawfull exemption of the Clergie: for both Diuine and humane lawes approue such immunities, without which, how could the Clergie attend vpon their heauenly businesse? These immunities which Emperours and Princes haue giuen to the Church, the Church ought to inioy without disturbance, and to withdraw such immunities, were high sacriledge and impiety against God and his Church. But the question is not of these immunities which Christian Kings haue giuen to the Church, but of those immunities, which the Pope without the leaue or authoritie of Princes, hath bestowed out of his fulnesse of power vpon the Clergie which liue vnder the gouernement of other Princes, by which the Clergie inioyed a protection from punishment for any sinne: This is the thing for which they are not ashamed to striue euen at this day, as earnestly as they did in the midst of blindenesse. This thing will be better knowne if we search the originall foundation of this errour, from the beginning, and the occasion by which it grew in the

Church. For now this opinion is, and for some late hundred yeeres hath beene so rooted in the Court of Rome (that the Clergie though neuer so much offending by murther, treason, theft, robberies, or such like, is priuiledged from all temporall Courts of Princes, and punishment from the Laity, vnlesse first the Church proceede against them, and make them no Clerks) that they are perswaded both of the truth and antiquity hereof, as of a point of faith: the occasion grew thus.</p>

The first auncient and famous Emperours did out of their godly and zealous affections: and as we may well iudge, vpon good reasons to helpe the Church, and to preserue disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, ioyne the aide of their coactiue lawes, to the spirituall censures of the Church: ordeining that whosoeuer by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of the Church could not be brought to obedience and order, should by the seuerity of temporall punishment be reduced to obedience. The vsuall punishment which.

                  <p n="70">70. Then the ancient practise was, that the temporall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate should punish such as offended of the Clergy, as well as of the Laity. Concerning the antiquity of this exemption of Clerkes from temporall Courts: wee finde no president for it, all the while that the Emperours had any gouernement and commaund in Italy. But when the Pope was able to meet the<note place="margin">Palmer. Chron. An. 726.</note> Emperour in battell, and giue him the worse, then began the authority of the ciuill Magistrate to decay in Rome, and fell at<note place="margin">Naucler. ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. 25.</note> the last into contempt. And the Pope hauing cast off the yoak of obedience, which before he held to the Emperour as to his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, began to take an authority to himself, which neither God nor man had giuen him. Hence proceeded that vsurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of power to giue Lawes to other. Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the first, in the eight hundred and threescore yeare of Christ, writeth in his Epistle to the Emperour <hi>Michael,</hi> in another stile, then his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours had vsed to write to Emperours before. Among other things contained in th Epistle, whereas the Emperour had written for a Clarke that had offended him, and was fled to the Pope; whom the Emperour required to be sent back again to Constantinople, Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> to this maketh this answere. [Wee haue from the great power of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> right and<note place="margin">Epistol. Nicolai. ad Michael. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratorem.</note> power to call Clerkes from any other Diocesse, if wee thinke good, and to inuite them to vs. This is our right: but Christian Emperours haue no right at all to make any inquisition for Monks, vnlesse it be in fauour to pity them.]</p>

Here we obserue the difference betweene the spirits of Popes in this time, and the spirits of auncient Popes who held the doctrine of obedience, as the Fathers then did, drawing the doctrine from the Scripture and examples of Christ and his Apostles.

For the Canon which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cyteth of this Councell, and the masked Romish Catholicke Diuine taketh from <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in some later Editions hath these wordes as they are cyted by him: but in the first incorrupt Edition of Councels, set forth by <hi>Peter Crab,</hi> the wordes of that Canon are thus set downe: <hi>Clericus nec quenquam praesumat apud saecularem iudicem Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po non permitente, pulsare.</hi> And thus it is read by them that aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently cyte the same. Now this agreeth well with the ninth Canon of the Chalced Councell, which ordeyneth that if one Clerke will accuse another, it must be before his Bishoppe; if he will accuse the Bishoppe, it must be in a prouinciall Synode: if he will draw a Metropolitane to answer for some things which he hath done, it must be either before the Primate, or before the Bishoppe of Constantinople. All this we graunt to be orderly established, the things intended are matters of Ecclesiasticall Cognisance, which are to bee heard in such Courts: but our question is of Clerks that are conuinced to be murtherers, or Traytors, &amp;c. Whether such are to bee exempt from triall at Common Law: Of which exemptions these auncient Bishops neuer dreamed.</p>

This manner of degrading and afterward deliuering cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Clarkes to the Secular power, crept in about the time of the Conquest. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> pretending greater antiquity for it,<note place="margin">Bellarm. lib. de Clericis cap. 28.</note> can neither bring reason nor testimony for his opinion. For whereas he saith, <hi>Eusebius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> was first depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed<note place="margin">Theodoret. lib. 1. cap. 20.</note> by the Nicen Councell, and afterward banished by <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> by this offering to proue, that they must first be deliuered to the Secular power, before the Magistrate may punish, and reproueth <hi>Caluin</hi> for not considering thus much: We answere, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> sheweth his skill in shifting, and hiding the truth to deceiue the simple. For <hi>Caluin</hi> in that place which he citeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this Romish immunitie, proueth two things. First, that<note place="margin">Institut. lib. 4. ca. 11. §. 15.</note> coactiue power is in the hand of the Prince, and not of the Church. <hi>Ecclesia cogendi non habet potestatem, de ciuili coactione loquor,</hi> saith he. Secondly, that criminous Clarkes had no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities from the ciuill Courts of Princes. Now that <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> saith, <hi>Eusebius</hi> was first deposed by the Councell, and then banished, is nothing against <hi>Caluin,</hi> but for him. For the Church did not inflict the coactiue punishment of banishment, but the Emperour. And <hi>Caluin</hi> proueth at large in the same place, that Kings and Emperours haue no authority to iudge in causes of faith; Producing the example of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> who in such a cause resisted the Emperour <hi>Valentinian.</hi> Such a cause was that of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius:</hi> the Emperour knew not whether he was in fault or not, before the Church had iudged the cause. But <hi>Caluines</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and our question standeth in two thinges, against which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth not so much as speake one word. First, that coactiue power was not then in the Church, but in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: Secondly, that criminous Clerkes were then punished by the Magistrate. <hi>Eusebius</hi> is not there proposed as a criminous Clerke, but as an example wherein the coactiue power of the Magistrate appeared. But now they say, if a Clerke bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be a felon, murderer, traytor, &amp;c. the Kings Courts may not censure this man, before he be degraded. Against these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities wee speake, for which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> offereth not any
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7970:96"/>
proofe. Let the manner of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> answering bee conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: for it is easie for him thus to answere <hi>Caluin,</hi> and all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, when he toucheth not the point in question: but singling out of some peece from the whole, wresteth that also from the true intent, that he may shape a mis-shapen answere to it. Then we say, that before those desperate times, wherein <hi>Iohn Wiclife</hi> saith, and often affirmeth, that Satan was loosed: no man clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med such a beastly priuiledge, as to be exempt from the Kings Lawes for murder, treason and such like. Godlinesse, reason, and the light of Nature seemeth to be extinguished in these men, that being contented to take the benefite of Lawes, will not be contented to bee ordered by Lawes. This hath forced some<note place="margin">Statut. 25. Ed. 3. de prouisoribus.</note> Princes and States to ordaine Lawes that such should be out of the Kings protection. Thus did that noble Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the third, King of England.

ANother thing whereby this new Iurisdiction of the Pope was so highly aduanced, was, giuing of Lawes to Princes, and their subiects; whereas before Princes had giuen lawes to him. <hi>Marsilius</hi> in the wordes last cyted in the end of the last Paragraffe, speaking of these laws, saith: They now break out into a practise of Iurisdiction, taking vpon them to make lawes, separat and distinct from such lawes, as are for the common and publique good of all: meaning the Canon lawes: which because they intend onely the priuate aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Pope, and not the publique good of the Church: being also made onely by the authority of the Pope, and not by the publique consent of the Church: therefore he doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them lawes, but Oligarchicall, and tyrannicall Decrees; these lawes are to be considered, because they make so great a shew of the Popes Iurisdiction.</p>
                  <p n="85">85. The Church before, was gouerned by Bishoppes and Metropolitanes, in such order, that the affaires of euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Diocesse were ordered by the Bishoppe, or by a Synode of his calling: the affaires of the Prouince were determined by the Metropolitane, or by a Prouinciall Synode of his calling: from an Episcopall Synode, a man might appeale to a prouinciall Synode; and from a Prouinciall Synode, to a nationall: but from a prouinciall or from a nationall Synode, none might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to the Bishoppe of Rome for which thing diuers Decrees were made in prouinciall Synodes, as we haue before declared. As the Bishoppes were Gouernours, so the lawes whereby they did then gouerne the Church, were the Canons of auncient Councels; especially of those foure most famous Councels of Nice, Constantinople, Ephesus, and Chalcedon: For that the Canons of these Councels were held for the lawes of the<note place="margin">Constitutio Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niani quint.

The ancient Bishops of Rome, either did not claime any such Iurisdiction, or if any were carried by leuity, and ambition out of their bounds, they were presently recalled and repressed by the godly Bishoppes of that age: As <hi>Anicet</hi> was by <hi>Polyc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And because the Pope after one thousand and two hundred yeares, had no more right to giue Lawes to the Church, then in former ages he had; therefore this Iurisdiction is vnlawfull, which by these Lawes hee practiseth.

If this obedience had beene required of God to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Vicar in <hi>Anselmes</hi> time, Why was not the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired and yeelded in Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> time? This is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the opinions brought in by men, and the truths of God: that the one standeth alwayes the same in the Church without chaunge, the other hath his times of rising and falling, as this opinion of Appellation to the Pope, which was so strongly reiected by <hi>Augustine,</hi> found a time to rise vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the pride of the Popes, and the seruile flattery of some Bishoppes. And what greater signe of pride in the Pope, and flatterie in his seruants, then to resume these old condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned priuiledges, and therewithall to patch yp a Iurisdiction standing so directly against the iudgement and practise of the ancient godly Fathers?</p>
                  <p n="92">92. And yet was <hi>Anselme</hi> as resolute in this, as <hi>Augustine</hi> was in the contrarie: But heerein a great difference appeared (which might much sway the iudgement of indifferent readers, if there were no other meanes to informe them) that Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> standing against appellations to Rome, had heerein the full consent of all his fellow Bishoppes, not one dissenting.

to purchase a Pall from the Pope, which Pall <hi>Anselme</hi> had not yet at this time of his variance with the King, obtained; for <hi>Malmsbury</hi> saith, he first asked leaue to goe to Rome for the Pall. Now the Pope in graunting the Pall conueyed an Oath of Alleageance with it, as before we haue obserued, which was the reason that moued our Archbishopps to stirre such rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tumults against the Kings of this land: Such was this facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which <hi>Anselme</hi> maintained for the Pope against the King, wherein he was condemned by all the Bishops of England in the question of Appellation, as <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> was after this time condemned by all the Bishoppes in like sort, in the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Inuestitures.</p>

That it may be apparant to the world, that we are so farre from being afraid to confesse this power, which they so much boast of; that we are rather readie to publish it to the world. For hereby all men which haue any vnderstanding of that power which Iesus Christ left to his Church, may know the Tyrannie, vsurpation, pride, vaine-glory, ambition, and madnesse of him
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7970:106"/>
who exalteth himselfe in the Church against God, and against them that are called Gods. Wherein we may learne to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with patience to suffer for a time, whatsoeuer the lust of proud and bloud-sucking Popes haue leaue to do for the sinnes of our Princes, and people, and Churches. For their time is set and drawing to an end, and nothing hath beene done, but that which is fore-warned in the Scripture. So that by these ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and bloudy practises, wee shall finde how the Scriptures are fulfilled.</p>
                  <p n="97">97. For one Scripture saith, that a starre must fall from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,<note place="margin">Apoc. 9. 1. 11.</note> who must be a King of the Locusts, which is called also the Angell of the bottomlesse pit, whose name in Hebrew is <hi>Abad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and in Greeke <hi>Apollyon,</hi> that is a destroyer. Which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie of his destroying power, is verified most apparantly in this practise of excommunicating Kings, and loosing the knot of obedience. Whereby confusion and destruction is brought vpon all Kingdomes of Christendome. Hereby he is proued to be a destroyer, an exterminator, an excommunicator. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the vulgar translation addeth significantly, <hi>Latine habens nomen exterminans.</hi> Another Scripture saith: The tenne Kings<note place="margin">Apoc. 17, 13.</note> shall giue their power and authority to the beast. Though the Kings of Christendome did neuer directly yeeld to the Pope this authority ouer their owne Kingdomes, and ouer themselues, that the Popes might depose and displace them at his pleasure: yet this they gaue him in effect, and by consequence. For they gaue him so much, that he might vpon their owne graunt chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge this, and they who had graunted him so much, had no reason to except against his challenge. For though the King which was to be depriued, denied the Pope this power, yet such Princes did yeeld it to him, to whom the Pope had giuen the Kingdom of the deposed Prince: he did yeeld it, who should vse the benefit of the Popes vsurped power. For example: though the late Kings of France haue alwaies denied, that the Pope had any Authority to depose the French Kings, yet the Kings of France haue giuen him this power. For the former Kings yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, as <hi>Pipin,</hi> and <hi>Charles.</hi> For they had no other title to the Kingdome, then from this power of the Pope. Therefore they
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7970:107"/>
yeelded that the Pope had power and authority to giue King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and in that sense gaue their power and authority to the beast. So that when these first French Kings, honoured the Pope with this vndue honour, though then they seemed to receiue Kingdomes from him, yet the Scripture looketh farther into these practises, then they did which practised them. For they respected onely themselues, their owne present greatnesse: but in receiuing such power from the Popes, they gaue, in trueth, their power and authority to the Popes. For how could they in iustice denie, but that the same power which deposed other Kings to raise them, might as well haue deposed them to raise other. Thus most of the Kings of Christendome gaue their kingdomes to the Popes. That this new and strange power of Antichrist may better appeare, I will open the beginning and continuance of the Popes practise herein.</p>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7970:107"/>
set vp in Churches to be worshipped. This was the ground of the Popes proceeding against the Emperour, which is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. By this wee see the state of Rome cleane changed, for whereas the Emperours at the first were persecutours, and the Bishops of Rome were such as suffered for righteousnesse: Now had they changed places, for the Popes were become persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and the Emperours were such as suffered for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. For what was the Emperour <hi>Leo</hi> his fault in breaking downe and defacing Images, after that hee found that diuine worship was exhibited to them, other then that so much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended zeale of <hi>Ezekias</hi> in breaking downe the brasen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? so that if we looke vpon this fact of the Emperour (which was the occasion why the Popes so proceeded against him) there can nothing appeare but the Popes persecution, and the Emperours suffering for righteousnesse. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the third, after this called a Synod in Rome, wherein the worship of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges<note place="margin">Platin. Greg. 3.

All this the Emperour lost at once by the practise of Popes.</p>
                     <p n="99">99. Now because wee consider these beginnings of the Popes persecutions, (for he began with the Emperour, whom thus he driued out of Italy, putting him from all gouernment in Rome, and after tooke vp his place and gouernement) let vs heere remember an auncient tradition of the auncient Fathers, who wrote before these times with freedom. For they are al re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued vpon this, as vpon an Apostolicall tradition, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist must driue the Emperour out of the gouernement of Rome and Italy, and take vp his place and seate. <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth<note place="margin">Tertull. lib. 3. contra Marcion. Lib. de resurr. carnis.</note> often repeate this sentence, <hi>Romanus status cedet Antichristo.</hi> That is: [The Romane Empire must giue place to Antichrist.] And in another place he saith: <hi>Qui nunc tenet teneat, donec de medio fiat. Quis? nisi Romanus status.</hi> That is: [Hee that now with-holdeth, shall with-hold till he be taken out of the way:
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7970:108"/>
Who is that? the Romane Empire.] And vpon those words of the Apostle: [He that now with-holdeth, shall with-hold vntill<note place="margin">2. Thess. 2. 7.</note> he be taken away:] The auncient Fathers writing, doe with an admirable consent agree vpon this, that the thing which the Apostle saith, did with-hold, and should with-hold for a time, was the Romane Empire. For the Empire of Antichrist must be raised vp in the same place, where that Empire stood that is in Rome. And therefore <hi>Hierome</hi> writing of those wordes of the Apostle, except there come a departing first, &amp; that that man be disclosed: saith, <hi>Nisi venerit discessio primum, vt omnes gentes</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hieronim. Ad Algasiam.</note> 
                        <hi>quae Romano Imperio subiacent, recedant abeis.</hi> That is: [Vnlesse a departing first come, that all the Nations which now are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Empire of Rome, may depart from that subiection.] Therefore he saith, that the Apostle left this tradition which he thought not good to commit to writing. Remember you not that when I was with you, I tolde you of these things, saith the Apostle. If any man aske why the Apostle thought good rather to commit this thing to their memory, then to writing: to this the same Author Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> aunswereth in the same place: <hi>Si apertè audacter<expan>

If any man demaund this question; why then, doe you admit some Apostolicall traditions? I answer.</p>
                     <p n="100">100. Let these two limitations be remembred, and then I know not why Apostolicall traditions may not bee admitted. First, it must haue an euident ground in the Scripture: Secondly, it must haue the consenting testimonie of auncient Fathers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming it to be an Apostolicall tradition. These two conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are both kept, in this particular which now I speake of; and in the baptising of Infants. But to take a tradition from the

My purpose is not to speake of Antichrist; but onely passing through these Stories of the Popes temporall exaltation, I thought it a small labour for the Reader to compare the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies of Scripture, and the iudgement of auncient Fathers with the euent, which fell out in the time of the two <hi>Gregories,</hi> the second and third. Before which time the Popes neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into such furious attempts against their Soueraigne Lords the Emperours. For they yeelded exact obedience to Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours from the time of the first Christian Emperour, vntill the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the first. All which while they refused not to be ruled, commaunded, directed by the Emperours as by their Soueraignes, not onely in ciuill affaires, but euen in matters concerning the externall Discipline of the Church, as calling of Councels, and confirming them: punishing and censuring disorderous Clarkes and Bishops, that offended the Imperiall Lawes, and such like. In such things the Emperours ruled, the Popes obeyed: no striuing, no threatning, no casting off of the yoake appeared all this while. But after that <hi>Phocas</hi> had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Beniface</hi> the third Pope, the title of Oecumenicall Bishop, and that the Church of Rome should be head of all other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: then began that starre to fall from heauen, falling from<note place="margin">Apoc. 8. 10. &amp; 9. 1.</note> the simplicity of truth &amp; from sincerity of obedience, into pride, ambition, and noysome lusts; and neuer ceased rolling down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards till at last it fell into the deepe practises of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse pit. Thus when they began to fall, they had one fall after

THe Popes hauing proceeded thus farre in depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Emperour, thought all their labour lost, vnlesse they might haue those Territories made subiect to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, from which they had expulsed the Emperor: Their feare was, that either the seuerall Cities would procure their owne Freedome, or that some that were strongest would surprise all the rest, and so a small part might come to the Popes share. The Lumbards were then strongest in Italy, and had soone gotten the rest vnder their Dominion: To preuent their rising, and to inrich S. <hi>Peter</hi> with a new Patrimonie, the Popes after they had vsed the power of the Lumbards against the Emperour, so now against the Lumbards begin to call new aides into Italie, drawing first <hi>Pipin,</hi> and then <hi>Charles</hi> against the Lumbards, by whose meanes they obteyned their purpose: <hi>Pipin</hi> was made<note place="margin">Harman.

These were practises which before this time were neuer attempted by Popes: From these beginnings and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the succeeding Popes tooke light, and made rules of their Gouernement; and therefore after this, the world could take no rest for the Popes.

And what holdeth the Spaniard so stiffe in Popery, but onely an hope that by the Popes authority he may inlarge his Dominions in the same sort? It is to be noted also, that they who thus offer their seruice to the Pope, are honoured by him, as the onely defenders of the Church, whereas none haue spoiled the Church more then these: for <hi>Paulus Aemylius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth, that <hi>Carolus Martellus</hi> (father to <hi>Pipin</hi>) being then Constable of France, robbed the Churches and Monasteries of France at his pleasure, promising that if he should obtain victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie against the Sarracins, he would bountifully repay all: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter most great and rich victories, he not onely repayed nothing, but thrust also the Bishpppes from their Seas, held the Seas empty to pay souldiers; which thing brought a foule confusion vpon the Church of Fraunce: yet this man for his seruice to the Pope was accounted a great defendor of the Church.</p>

This was made a great quarrell against <hi>Frederick,</hi> and though he made his reasonable excuse, that this was the first time that euer hee serued in that sort, and might therefore be pardoned for any thing vnskilfully done: that the office proceeding from good will, it made not much matter on which side he came, that came to reuerence him: yet the Pope would not be satisfied; but shewed himselfe so much offended, that the Emperour began to be somewhat moued; so that the parting was with some stomacke on both sides. The next day the Emperour meeting the Pope, helde the right stirrope, to please him: and when they were set, the Pope thus began. The Princes of auncient times your predecessours, when they came to make petition for the Imperiall crowne, were wont by some worthy office to promerit the fauour of the Church of Rome; that by preuenting the blessing, they might declare by some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregious seruice that the Crowne was due to them.

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:7970:128"/>
declareth his appeale; <hi>appellauimus ad futurum generale Concilium, &amp; ad sanctam Catholicam Ecclesiam.</hi> This was done<note place="margin">Naucl. gener. 45. Anno 1338. Paralipom. Usperg.</note> in an Assembly held at Franckfort, published as a Decree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Processes of <hi>Iohn</hi> the two and twentieth: which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree though it be somewhat large, yet because it conteineth the iust claime of the temporall Magistrate, against the pretended Iurisdiction of the Pope, I must draw at least the summe of it to giue some satisfaction to the Reader: He declareth the Popes claime, for he claimed that hee had temporall Iurisdiction ouer Princes: that the imperiall power was from the Pope: that he that is chosen King of the Romanes hath no Iurisdiction by his sole Election vntill he be annointed, consecrated and crowned: that in temporall matters the Pope hath a fulnesse of power. This was first the Popes claime; whereunto the Emperour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth [That this standeth against the auncient Canons of the Church, against law, and against reason.] Hee cyteth for this diuers Canons, to proue that the Emperour hath not his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from the Pope, but from God alone. Against each of the foresaid Positions he cyteth diuers Canons out of the Decrete of <hi>Gratian.</hi> Secondly, Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the two and twentieth obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted against the Emperour, that hee the said Pope had annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the Emperours Election; and that therefore the Emperor had no right to administer the imperiall lawes, but that this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration belonged by right to the Pope. To this the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour answereth: [That this standeth against the liberties of the Empire, and against the liberties of them that are Electors, against the lawes and liberties of all the Princes and subiects of Germany.]</p>
                     <p n="144">144. And whereas thirdly the Pope obiecteth, that he hath excommunicated all that shall adhaere, performe obedience and reuerence to the Emperour, and saith that the iudgement of the Pastor, whether it be iust or vniust is to be obserued. To this the Emperor answereth [That these denunciations are of none effect: for it is a rule, that if a Prelat in commaunding or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding, shall not keepe the forme prescribed by the Canons, they who disobey him, doe not incurre the sentence of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. Now the Canons, and the Church doe take from
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7970:128"/>
the Pope power in temporalities, which power <hi>Iohn</hi> the two and twentieth vsurpeth: this is one of those cases wherein the sentence of a Prelat is not to be feared. Another reason is, because by law that sentence is of no force, where there is an expresse errour in the sentence: as if a subiect should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not to obey his Superiour: or if something should be commaunded against God, or against holy Scripture. Now it is manifest that <hi>Iohn</hi> the two and twentieth hath commaunded the subiects of the Empire, not to obey vs, whom they are bound to obey by the lawes of God and man. Another reason is, because it is a thing confessed, that the sentence which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen after a lawfull appeale, is void and of no strength: but it is well knowne that from <hi>Iohn</hi> the two and twentieth, and his Processes against God, and iustice, we appealed to a generall Councell, and to the holy Catholicke Church: which appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was brought to the knowledge of the said <hi>Iohn</hi> before he published Excommunication against them that fauour vs.]</p>
                     <p n="145">145. If it be said the Pope hath no Superiour, and therefore no man may appeale from him. To this the Emperour answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thus: [It is manifest by the Catholicke doctrine, that the Pope in matters of faith is subiect to Councels. 16. <hi>dist. sicut in tex. &amp; in Gloss.</hi> 25. <hi>q.</hi> 2. <hi>sunt quidam.</hi> 19. <hi>di. Anastasius.</hi> 40. <hi>di. Si Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa.</hi> Moreouer in matters of diuine right, a Councell is aboue the Pope. Thus then we haue appealed to a Superiour, that is to a generall Councell, against our aduersaries who impugne vs, the Empire, the Catholicke faith, which the holy Church of Rome handleth.] This is the summe of that Decree which the Emperour published against the Pope: it was dated at Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the eighth of August, <hi>Anno</hi> one thousand three hundred thirty and eight. The processe of this worthy Prince giueth vs occasion to consider some things which declare the sense, iudgement and Religion of the Ghurch of Rome at this time. By the Church of Rome I vnderstand these Westerne parts of Christendome, for so I find it tearmed heere, and other-where separate and distinct from the Pope.</p>
                     <p n="146">146. For first by this appeale from the Pope to a generall Councell, we finde that it was the iudgement and common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:7970:129"/>
sentence of that age, that a general Councel is aboue the Pope, may iudge the Pope, censure and depose him: this is here declared and confirmed: this was not onely the doctrine of the Church then, but long after it continued, and was neuer denied by the Church of Rome, before the Councell of Trent, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after we shall declare. Moreouer we finde a distinction obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the learned men that held this Assembly (that is by the Prelates of the Empire, for so the Decree runneth, <hi>De concilio ac assensu Praelatorum omnium, &amp;c.</hi> And many other learned men of Christendome, yea many Friars which were here assembled, especially the Minorites, who were then oppressed by the Pope) The distinction, I say, betweene the Pope and his flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers on the one side, and the Church of Rome on the other side. For the Emperour appealeth from the Pope, to the Church: and this was a practise vsed by diuers, as hereafter we shall obserue. Then the Pope and his flatterers did not represent the Church of Rome, as now they pretend to doe. Againe wee obserue that the Emperour being defamed for heresie and appealing to a generall Councell, as he denieth the Pope to be his Iudge, so he refuseth not to be iudged by the Church: for as S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, <hi>Imperator intra Ecclesiam, non supra Ecclesiam est.</hi> Then the authority of the Church bindeth the greatest members<note place="margin">Ora.. in Auxent.</note> thereof, euen Kings and Emperours. If our aduersaries obiect against vs and our Church: why then doe you giue to the King the Title of supreame head or Gouernour of the Church? We answere, such obiections proceede from an obstinate and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ignorance in mistaking of our doctrine. For when the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is of Iurisdiction externall coactiue, wee giue to the King the place of a supreame Iudge: but if the question bee of faith and Religion, we say the King is no Iudge, but to be iudged by the Church: as we see godly Princes haue beene, and namely this worthy Prince <hi>Lodouicke,</hi> who being accused of heresie by the Pope, appealeth to the Church.</p>
                     <p n="147">147. Last of all we obserue in the sense and iudgement of this Emperour, and of the learned men that were assembled with him, that in the point of Iurisdiction no such thing is left to the Pope as he claimeth. For in matters of faith, the Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7970:129"/>
is in the Church, as here it is acknowledged: in matters of coactiue power the Iurisdiction is in the Emperor; as all these learned men did yeelde in this Councell, and after the Councell did maintaine by their writings. For wee finde the same trueth maintained by <hi>William Ockham, Marsilius Patauinus, Michael Caesina,</hi> and many moe, who with great courage and learning did maintaine the Emperours Iurisdiction heerein against the Popes vsurpation. This wisedome and moderation of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in defending his right, not onely by force of Armes, but by learning and iudgement, moued the Pope who succeeded <hi>Iohn</hi> the two &amp; twentieth; that is, <hi>Benedict</hi> the twelfth, in spite of malice to giue him many ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But the Pope did but fraudulently put him off from day to day: which thing when the Emperour perceiued, he called a Diet of the Empire at Rensium, where he did with that wisedome, courtesie, and liberality binde the Princes Electours to him, that they tooke a solemne Oath to maintaine the liberties of the Empire, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creede that all the processes of <hi>Iohn</hi> once Pope, against <hi>Lod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Iesuites and our owne Popish Countrie-men crye out against vs, for giuing Iurisdiction to such as are no Priests, but onely temporall Princes. It will be hard for them to accuse vs, and defend their owne Doctors.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Because this manner of maintaining the Popes Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is grosse to set him aboue temporall Princes in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Iurisdiction, therefore diuers since this time haue sought to mollifie this harsh manner of speech, by a distinction which they haue found out of late, betweene Power direct ouer Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and indirect: These men say that the Pope hath power to depose Princes, not directly, but indirectly, in respect of some spirituall good. But when they come to the application of this distinction, it appeareth nothing but a Miste to dazzle the eyes of men, wherein there is no simplicity or truth. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is one of those that admitteth this Distinction, vpon which Distinction graunted by Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> Master <hi>Blackwel</hi> thinketh he hath a good ground for taking the Oath of Allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. And when <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>llarmine</hi> reproueth him for that, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth him by his owne Distinction: a reasonable answere; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>d yet such is the Mist of this Distinction, that you can hardly tell whether of these two speaketh more cunningly. For <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>

saith, that the Pope hath power to depose Princes not<note place="margin">In ordine ad spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituale bonum. l. 5. c. 6. de Rom.

This <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will denie: for he will say that no priuate man must be iudge of this spirituall good, but onely the Pope. Now let the Pope bee Iudge, and then this Distinction is as good as nothing: for whensoeuer the Pope deposeth a Prince, or dischargeth his subiects from their Oath of Alleageance, he will iudge it to be for some spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good. So that in this vnderstanding, and sense of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> there is no reall difference betweene direct power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In like sort when Master <hi>Blackwell</hi> saith, the Pope hath power to depose Princes indirectly, or in respect of some spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good, and iudgeth the taking of the Oath of Alleageance to respect a spirituall good end, giuing this reason: because the<note place="margin">Examination of M. <hi>George Blackwell.</hi> Epist to <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
                  </note> refusal of this Oth wold bring vpon vs the ruines of Catholicke families &amp; the lamentable extirpation of the whole Catholicke estate among vs: We say the case of this man, and of those that depend vpon him, is much better then the case of them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse the Oath: but yet to drawe them a little further into the loue of obedience, let vs note the imperfection of his defence. We commend his action, and speake here onely of his manner of defending it; for the reason that draweth him to obedience, and to take this Oath, is not a conscience of that commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, which commaundeth obedience to Magistrates: but the danger of Catholickes, and of himselfe; which proueth an indirect obedience. So that in pleading for a verball distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of power, direct or indirect, they descry a reall distinction of obedience direct or indirect. Now there is not much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene these three opinions of them that holde the Popes direct power, and his indirect power, and that say his power is to respect the present danger of the Catholickes. For whatsoeuer <hi>Triumphus</hi> bringeth vnder his direct power, that Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will reduce vnder indirect power: so that though they differ in the manner how this power commeth to the Pope, directly or indirectly, yet they both are agreed that

the Pope hath this power; and this is also Master <hi>

First, That the doctrines of that Church, be the doctrines of Christ and his Apostles: Secondly, That so wee may regard the Church of Rome, that wee be sure to hold vnity with the true Church, the body of Christ.

ouer the vnity with that particular Church.

This question of the Iurisdiction of a Councell had often beene moued, as we finde by the appeales of Emperours and Kings, and others from the Pope to a generall Councell: but it came not to be put in execution before the Councell of Pisa, which was gathered vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this occasion.</p>

The Councell was summoned to meete at Pisa: the Bishops, Prelates and Princes being orderly summoned, and meeting heere in the yeare one thousand foure hundred and eight, proceeded against both the Popes, deposed and depriued them; condemning them both for Heretickes and Schismatickes, commanding all Christians not to take them for Popes, or yeelde obedience to them.

The Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node hauing thus deposed all those other Popes, made choyce of <hi>Martin</hi> the fift: And to preuent such schismes and the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles which grewe by them, it was decreed in the same Synode, that such Synodes should be often called; the first should bee called fiue yeares after this: the second seauen yeares after the first; the third tenne yeares after the second; and so from tenne yeares to tenne yeares continually. This order and Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church declared in Synodes, did so terrifie the Popes that they sought by all meanes to defeat it, they could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure such a Iurisdiction aboue themselues, to call them, censure them, depose them, as this Synode had throwen downe three Popes at once. Therefore the Popes after this laboured by all meanes how they might oppresse the authority of a Councell, (which they could neuer doe before the Councell of Trent) and all these partes of Christendome on the other side la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to maintaine the authority of the Councell aboue the Pope.</p>

According to the Decree of this Synode, Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the fift, after fiue yeares called a Synode at Pauie: thither came they that were sent by the Pope, and expected the nations without whose presence a generall Councell could not bee held. But the plague increasing greatly in that towne, they changed the place of this Synode to Sene: where Pope <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> perceiuing that <hi>Benedict</hi> began to stirre againe; to preuent troubles, dissolued this Synode, and according to the Decree of the Synode of Constance, appointed the place of another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell after seuen yeares to be holden at Basil; and when the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed<note place="margin">Anno 1430.</note> time came, hee sent Cardinall <hi>Iulianus</hi> to Basil for the furthering of the same.

But after many admonitions he reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked that dissolution, declaring it to be voide and of none effect: and so gaue great hope of peace to the Church. But after this againe, he attempted the second dissolution of the same Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, which after many admonitions hee would not reuoke: wherefore these fiue conclusions are declared against him: First, The first dissolution of this holy Synode of Basil, pretended by <hi>Eugenius</hi> the present Pope, from the fulnesse of Apostolicall power (as he saith) attempted, is repugnant to the two foresaid truths. Secondly, <hi>Eugenius</hi> the present Pope, did in forme of law prescribed vnto him, iudicially reuoke all errours repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the two foresaid truths, after the first pretensed disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution or translation, being admonished, and commaunded by the Synode so to doe. Thirdly, The pretensed dissolution or translation of this holy Synode of Basil repugnant to the two foresaid truths, attempted by <hi>Eugenius</hi> after he was cyted vpon the point of reformation, proceeding (as he saith) out of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of power in case it should proceede against himselfe, or any of his Legates Presidents: this should conteine an inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable errour in faith: Fourthly, The second pretensed dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or translation of this Synode, repugnant to the two foresaid truthes, doth proue the said <hi>Eugenius</hi> to be a relapse, falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into his reuoked and condemned errour: Fiftly, This se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond dissolution or translation repugnant to the two foresaid truthes, as also the contumacy of <hi>Eugenius,</hi> and his long perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance therein, and the open rebellion of the said <hi>Eugenius,</hi> after that he was admonished by the Synode to reuoke that pretensed dissolution or translation; and also the erection of another Congregation vnder the name of a generall Councell to fortifie that pretensed dissolution, and that during the time of this holy Councell of Basil: all these are euident testimonies of the pertinacy of the same <hi>Eugenius,</hi> and so euident that they neede not the clamor of any other accuser.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. Vpon these grounds this Councell deposed <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth, and elected <hi>Amadeus</hi> Duke of Sauoy, who was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:7970:153"/>
                     <hi>Felix</hi> the fifth. But <hi>Eugenius</hi> resisted by force, and helde himselfe as Pope, the Synode not being strong enough for him by coactiue power, though in spirituall Iurisdiction it was aboue him: yet would not this Councell acknowledge <hi>Eugeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> to be the Pope, but <hi>Felix.</hi> In the meane time <hi>Eugenius</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and <hi>Nicolaus</hi> the fift was chosen in his place. All this while the Councell of Basil stood vp: so that a new Schisme was like to rise; but all was compounded thus: <hi>Felix</hi> the fift should abdicate the office which he was content to doe, seeing <hi>Eugenius</hi> was dead who was deposed by the Synode: <hi>Nicolaus</hi> should be acknowledged and confirmed Pope. This <hi>Nicolaus</hi> thus confirmed, should by his bull approue and confirme all the things done and concluded in the Councell of Basill: all this was performed, and Pope <hi>Nicolaus</hi> by his <hi>Bull</hi> maketh a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne confirmation and approbation of this Synode: which <hi>Bull</hi> is annexed to the Synode: bearing date <hi>Calend. Iul.</hi> 1449. But the Synode seemed not much to respect this confirmation, because they rested vpon that authority which the Church hath from Christ.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. Now let vs consider how this Synode prescribed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Popes Iurisdiction so much, that if the reformed Churches by the power and godly labours of their Princes, might once obtaine that which they haue so long wished, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, free, lawfull holy Councell: they would not desire much more freedome therein then was practised in this Synod of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sill. For first concerning the safe conduct for comming to the Councell, and manner of proceeding, there is so much graunted by this Councell to the Bohemians, whom the Councell inuited to a disputation, that more then this, none will desire. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the safe conduct for comming and going freely and safely, they are agreed vpon the iudge of controuersies: admitting that iudge which onely was alwayes acknowledged the iudge in all generall Councels: for the Pope was neuer acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged<note place="margin">Saluus condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus Boemorum conc.

This Synode of Basil admitting herein the manner of proceeding held in auncient Councels, reiecteth the Pope, and admitteth another iudge, in these words. <hi>Lex diuina, praxis Christi Apostolica &amp; Ecclesiae primitiuae vna cum</hi>

Wee haue the iudgement of the Church against them, both of old time, and at this time of late: and before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent it was neuer otherwise.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. Moreouer, whereas the Pope sent his Legates to this Councell of Basil, requiring that they might be admitted as Presidents of the Councell in his place: this the Councell gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, limiting the same graunt with these conditions: that these who thus were admitted Presidents of the Councel in the place of Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> should be in that place without all coactiue Iurisdiction: that the manner of proceeding by disputations<note place="margin">Ibid. sess. 17.</note> should stand inuiolate: that all the Councell being equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided<note place="margin">Sine omni Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictione coacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua.</note> into foure deputations, nothing should be concluded but that which was confirmed by three deputations at the least: that the things thus confirmed should be inrolled by the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents or one of them: that if they refused to inroll such things, then should it be lawfull for any other man, which was in one of the deputations, to doe it: which must after this be brought to the congregation, and read there and publikely approoued before it be concluded. They condition also that all the Actes of the Councell shall be done and dispatched in the name, and vnder the seale of the Councell.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. Further in these late Councels there is no memorable mention of the fiue nations. There was free accesse for all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that would come, but there is especiall mention of fiue nations, because these were the principall nations of these we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne parts: they are named in the first session of the Councell of Basill, Italy, Brittaine, Germanie, France, and Spaine: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might be concluded vnlesse it were first diuers times pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in the presence of the fiue nations, and by the generall
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:7970:154"/>
consent of them, confirmed. If things had passed in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the Councell of Trent, that free accesse might be giuen to all nations; that the Scriptures with the Fathers founding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vpon Scriptures, might bee admitted the onely iudge of controuersies; that the Pope should haue no coactiue authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that nothing should be concluded, but by the consent of the fiue nations; then would wee admit that Councell to bee free and generall: but because in stead of these, the contrary was practised in Trent, that no iudge could be admitted there, but the Pope; that none might haue accesse to that Synod, but they who were first bound in an oath to the Pope; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Pope practised coactiue power, that nothing could there be concluded but by the direction of the Pope: therefore when we reiect the Councell of Trent, we doe no more then onr fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers did in the Councell of Basill, &amp; before that in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Constance, and before that in the Councell of Pisa. We are the children of them that held these Councels: whom see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we finde to be so peremptor ily bent against the Pope, and against the proceedings of the late Councell of Trent, haue we not warrant following the footsteps of our forefathers, vtterly to reiect and to condemne the Popes Iurisdiction which wee haue now found to be so late, so basely bred, without antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, honour, honesty or libertie?

                     <pb n="287" facs="tcp:7970:157"/>53. In these words some things are obseruable: First, That this vnlimited Iurisdiction is giuen to the Pope onely by base fellows, flattering knaues, against the iudgement of the learned and graue men of the Church of Rome, and against the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of these Councels: Secondly, that the iudicious and graue men of this age, as <hi>Gerson</hi> and such like, yea all that were assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in this Councell, were noted by these base flatterers, and suspected or condemned of heresie. The Pope and his flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers wanted no good will then, to haue made them al hereticks. And it is to be obserued that the heresie which most of all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Pope with his flatterers, stood in this pretensed Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: for this is the cause wherefore flatterie, as <hi>Gerson</hi> saith, would haue imputed hereticall prauity to the Councell: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and last of all, the distinction betweene the Church of Rome and the Court of Rome, wherof we haue so often spoken, is here againe confirmed. For these flatterers stood for the Popes Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction against the Church of Rome heere assembled in a Councell: but howsoeuer they haue preuailed since, wee see heere that by the Church of Rome, they were accounted then but a base companie of flatterers. These bee they who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward preuailed in the Councell of Trent, lifting vp the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Pope aboue the Church: And this is that Church on the other side, which then was in danger to be pronounced heretickes by the Pope, and these who are marked and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, not by me, but by <hi>Gerson, Cusanus, Aeneas Siluius,</hi> and the rest of both these Councels of Constance and Basil, to bee no better then a generation of base flatterers.</p>
                  <p n="54">54. Then there is no great thing done, or at which the world may maruel, when we see the reformed Churches at this day accounted heretickes by the Pope and his flatterers: for this was a thing long looked for. The Church did beare the pride of the Pope, the ignorance and insolency of his flatterers, as long as she could indure it. And when there was no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, made a separation indeede from the Pope, and his flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, holding on still in the auncient waies of our fathers, who haue from time to time made resistance against the Pope and his seruants: from which auncient way of our forefathers, from
