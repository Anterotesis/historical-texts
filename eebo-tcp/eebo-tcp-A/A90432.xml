         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
PENNY POST
of LONDON.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>FOR the Accommodation of all that Correſpond with any Perſons
in <hi>LONDON,</hi> a Contrivance is ſet on foot in that City, for
Conveyance of Letters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Called, <hi>THE PENNY POST.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dockwra</hi> and Partners, the Undertakers of that Deſign, having
appointed Meſſengers (who have given Security for their faithful perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance)
to attend daily from Seven of the Clock in the Morning, till
Ten at Night, in all parts in and about the Town, for Conveying any
Letters or Parcels, not exceeding a Pound weight (or Ten Pounds in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue)
from one place to another, be it farther or nearer, in any parts of
<hi>London, Weſtminſter, Southwark,</hi> and parts adjoyning, as the perſon
that ſends them ſhall direct; and this to be done for <hi>One Penny</hi> each
Letter or Parcel, to be paid by the party that ſends; and nothing will
be demanded or taken (if offered) by the Meſſenger at the Delivery
thereof.</p>
            <p>Now though the Limits of this Conveyance by <hi>The Penny Poſt of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
extend no farther than in and about that City, yet the Uſefulneſs of
it is unlimited and infinitely extenſive. For as Negotiation and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
from all parts of the World centers in <hi>London,</hi> ſo not a Dealer or
any other Perſon, either in any part of <hi>England</hi> or the World in general,
that ſend Letters to <hi>London,</hi> either by Land or Water, but may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
by <hi>The Penny Poſt:</hi> For when Letters are brought to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
from ſuch remote places as have no conveniency of ſending by the
<hi>General Poſt,</hi> there often happens either far greater trouble of charge
in conveying them from one part of <hi>London</hi> to the other; that is, from
the hand that brings them to Town, to the perſon to whom they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
then there was in conveying them from the remoteſt part of the
Kingdom to <hi>London;</hi> which inconvenience the ſaid <hi>Penny Poſt</hi> remedies,
by handing them ſafe for <hi>One Penny a piece,</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To reduce it to practice, Any perſon that would ſend a Letter by a
Friend to <hi>London,</hi> muſt ſend a <hi>Penny</hi> with it to pay the <hi>Penny Poſt;</hi>
and likewiſe if more than one, then as many Letters, ſo many Pence
muſt alſo be ſent for the ſame end. And the Letters and Money muſt
be wrapt up together in one Cover, faſt ſealed and directed to
Mr. <hi>William Dockwra</hi> and the reſt of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakers of the <hi>Penny
Poſt.</hi> And being ſo directed, will be taken in free at any <hi>Penny
Poſt Houſe</hi> of <hi>London</hi> without any thing demanded. There being
many Hundreds of <hi>Penny Poſt Houſes</hi> in and about the City, ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſt
in all parts, that there is one ſtill ready at hand in every part
of the Town, well-known to the Neighbourhood, to accommodate all
that have occaſion; from whence the Letters are immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
away as directed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☞All Perſons are to write ſuch plain and full Directions, of Sign, Trade, and
Place, whereby their Friends may readily be found. And to take notice, If
they do not ſend <hi>a Penny</hi> encloſed, their Letter will lie undelivered.</p>
