            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Firſt, too much extremitie and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much lenitie ſhould not bee vſed, becauſe extreame law ſometimes is thought to bee extreame wrong, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much lenitie breedeth illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſnes

and ſundrie vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in all ſorts. But omitting theſe particularities, who ſo deemeth of the generall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp; diſpoſition of lawes, taketh his ayme amiſſe, and ſhooteth wide fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the marke: for doubtleſſe the lawe will tolerate no parcialitie, the condition thereof beyng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to all ages and all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: for as Cicero ſayeth, <hi>Vera lex eſt recta ratio, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae congruens, diffuſa in om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, conſtans ſempiterna.</hi> True Lawe is a right reaſon of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, agreeyng therewith in all points, diffuſed &amp; ſpred in all Nations, conſiſting perpetuall: and though men erre in conſtruyng the true meaning thereof, and albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it diuerſe in the executing thereof haue vſed parciality,

Wherfore Demonax when he ſaw a iolly ſwaine ſit in his Scarlet gowne, well pleaſing his own humor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding himſelf placed in the Theatre of dignitie, ſaid vnto him, Sir, this robe of yours was a ſheepes coate, before it came to your backe; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that his wealth or gay attire could not ſhrowde his ruſtick maners. Wherby we may learne, that it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wealth, gay attire, or gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous robes, nor yet grauitie of yeeres without wiſdome, knowledge, prudence, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:22867:45"/>
other vertues, that can cauſe a man to deſerue that place, wherein he is to miniſter iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice &amp; equitie: riches cannot alter ſimplicitie, nor wealth procure prudencie; and as for grauity of yeeres &amp; ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of age, it is a thing which ought ſomewhat to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, if ſo bee it carieth a ſmacke of vertue and a taſte of wiſedome, for experience hath a great prerogatiue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe grauitie of yeares fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth credite: but as for wealth onely they are not to be eſteemed, neither ſhould a Magiſtrate in conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof be choſen; for aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of riches maketh him to liue ſecurely, and want of wiſedome, to attempt any thing wilfully, for ignorance is a blinde guide, and a rude

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:22867:46"/>
of which, as Ariſtotle ſayeth, ther are in general two kinds which do beare office; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he calleth one a neceſſarie Magiſtrate, without which a citie cannot rightly ſtand. Of the ſortes of Magiſtrates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the firſt kinde, there is one politike, which is imploied about ciuil matters, as were thoſe of the citie of Rome, conuerſant about ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill affaires, &amp; <hi>munera muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipialia,</hi> by which meanes they were partakers with the citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of any gift or reward, which by right they might challenge in regard of their ciuill offices. There is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holy or godly magiſtrate which is buſied in diuine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. The aforeſaid politike Magiſtrate, is either a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour officer, or an inferiour:
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:22867:47"/>
ſuperiour officers were they, in whoſe handes all the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment did depend or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, as in the citie of Rome, wherein the Senatours were the ſuperiour officers, or as ſome would haue, the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians were the ſuperiour of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, who were made by the Centurian conuocation, and as thought neceſſary, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Lege curia.</hi> The inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our officer was accuſtomed to care and foreſee common matters, and enquired of any lawfull or vnlawfull thing committed, and after what ſort they were done, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iuſt or vniuſt, &amp; aſsiſted other officers in executing their duties. Such officers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo were in the citie of Rome, which were thought to be the common people, created
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:22867:47"/>
               <hi>Lege Tributa</hi> and this inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was of two ſorts, either of ſmall note or account, or of leſſer regard or eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they that were of ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, they againe were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the towne, becauſe townſemen, or without the towne and precincts, which were termed of the ſuburbs, The vrbane and towne offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, were thoſe which were carefull ouerſeers, prouiding all things neceſſarie, &amp; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the want therof, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to make prouiſion, and procuring reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either of dilapidations, or any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed or ruinate thing to be amended. The Magiſtrates that were without the citie or ſuburbes, were the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers of the fieldes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided wood and ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:22867:48"/>
The foreſaid Diuine officers, were thoſe which were buſied in godly and holy matters: of which there were two ſorts, either thoſe which did accompliſh holy and diuine things, or els did care and prouide for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matters: they that buſied themſelues in holy matters, were Prieſts and Preachers: thoſe that cared for holy and diuine affaires, were inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our miniſters, vnto whom <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               </hi> charge of the holy ſanctuarie was committed, and thoſe were termed, <hi>Quaeſtores ſacri</hi>: or High prieſts. The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate belonging to the firſt kinde, that Ariſtotle called, Leſſe needfull, was required as an ornament for ciuill life, for reformation of maners.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Magiſtrates are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly

            <p n="2">2. The Magiſtrate that politikely intendeth the good of the common weale, may be termed vpright, but hee that practiſeth onely for his own profit, is a vitious, and a lewd Magiſtrate.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:22867:54"/>IVdges are the Phiſicions of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to adminiſter iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to decide controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and for the puniſhing of malefactors, by whoſe means worldly quietnes is preſerued &amp; truth maintained. In theſe Iudges there are 4. things to be conſidered: firſt, to heare curteouſly, to anſwere wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to conſider ſoberly, and to giue iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciality: which are no leſſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, then is the ſoule in a liuing bodie. For being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to both parties, he reduceth that to equalitie, which he thinketh vnequall: not vnlike vnto a line cut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vnequall partes; that part which is too long is cut ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; added to the other. So doth the Iudge, being the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:22867:54"/>
law, &amp; as it were an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle in the common weale. The Iudge ought alſo to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count himſelf an interpreter to lawmakers, a miniſter of iuſtice, and his chiefe vertue muſt be, to know what is iuſt and true: he ought therefore not to ſwarue from law, and the meaning therof, but giue iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as the law, equity, &amp; iuſtice doth command: for which reſpect it behoueth him to be ſworne, to the end that God may be preſent to witnes his inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, which of al other things God hath made in man moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine. Let <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               </hi> Iudge be free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ire, and all ſuſpition of hope, loue, and hatred, not corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with giftes, not fearfull of threates, nor by flatterie ſeduced: for where Iudges
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:22867:55"/>
are ſubiect to theſe paſsions, Iuſtice is farre remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iudiciall ſeate, and the Iudge himſelfe. For there is nothing that infecteth the Common wealth more with ſeditious hate, and iniuries, than the corruption and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice of Iudges, By good &amp; equall iudgements, the loue vniuerſall of men is preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, quarels, enmities, warres and ſedition are thereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, becauſe they are in euery eſtate of ſuch great force, as by good iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, the whole Common wealth doth ſeeme to be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and by euil Iudges ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted. This Iuſtice which concerneth iudgement, hath greateſt power to extirpate vices in all eſtates: for if of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders be puniſhed, there

will be no place left for vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, fraude and audaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, preſumption &amp; iniuries. The perſon of Iudges was by the auncient Philoſophers painted like vnto a faire vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, hauing a ſeuere &amp; fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful aſpect, piercing eies, chaſt and modeſt countenance, inclined to grauitie: which image ſeemeth to repreſent, that Iudges ought to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt, chaſt, ſeuere, ſharpe witted, good conceiuers of all things, graue, conſtant, &amp; inexorable. Cambiſes, king of Perſia, cauſed the skinne of one vniuſt Iudge, to bee ſlayed from his bodie, &amp; han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vp in the place of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the end that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, all Iudges might be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be iuſt and vpright. In like maner ought our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:22867:56"/>
to take heed that their Iuſtice (which extendeth to all ſorts of people) may bee moſt dutifull, and that both in making and executing of Lawes, he may ſhewe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a man of a ſingular iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: for it were ſhame for him not to obſerue Lawes, who is the executer of them. He commandeth others, &amp; the law co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth him, not that law only which is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in books, &amp; tables of braſſe, but the liuing lawe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which remaineth in our minds. Iulius Ceſar had ſuch regard of equitie and iuſtice, after hee had obtained the gouernment of Rome, that he neuer omitted any paine or labour, as well in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſes, concerning the defence and aſsiſtaunce of

where all men liued vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſsing the laws, yet fearing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no leſſe than a tyrant.

            <head>Of Prudence. Cap. 18.</head>
            <p>PRudence is a buſie ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and true inuentor of verity, which alloweth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to haue fellowſhip with the truth, except it be ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with reaſon, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with wiſdome. This ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is allowed as a ſoueraigne precious good and is termed the very touchſtone of truth, which guideth the ſteps of men, in an vnfallible way, to the attaining and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of vertue, which procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth felicity. Cicero defineth this vertue to be the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things which ought to be wiſhed or obtained, &amp; of thoſe things which ought to be eſchewed, like a proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent mother foreſeing what
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:22867:68"/>
with decency ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in euery enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, who prepareth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; fit abode, where all other vertues might ſecurely execute and diſcharge their ſeueral duties and offices: for ſhe accuſtometh to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant in the chooſing of good and euil, being the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and miſtreſſe of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues whom ſhee fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. This vertue cannot ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be taynted, or inueigled with any lewd canker of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, nor fettered within the bonds of folly, being garded with al the troups of vertues, and tried in the fire of zeale, ſhining bright, and yeelding a fragrant ſmell and fauour to the noſtrels of the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and poſſeſſors thereof, like a beame proceeding
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:22867:69"/>
from the cleere ſunne, which doth not onely lighten and kindle the affection, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo doth illuminate the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and knowledge of man: wherefore wiſe men haue laied a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene ſcience &amp; prudence, ſaying, that ſcience is a dead knowledge of things, which of it ſelfe cannot change the will, in ſuch ſort that it may embrace and followe the knowne good, and auoid the euill, which is euident in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, imbrued with vice, &amp; endued with knowledge. Wherefore Socrates was wont to admoniſh his ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, that in all their life time, they ſhould haue theſe three things in memory, to witte, Prudence in minde, which is an inuiolable caſtell (as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſthenes
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:22867:69"/>
ſaith) Scilence in their tongue, and ſhamefaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in their countenance, without which, nothing may bee done wiſely: becauſe prudence is the prince and guide to all other vertues, wherein the knowledge of our ſoueraigne good, and the ende of our life depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. Wherefore we may in no ſorte behaue our ſelues more prudently, then by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how we may deale imprudently. Such a prudent man was Ageſilaus king of the Lacedemonians, who, when there was a battel to be pitched at Mantinia, by his ſubiectes the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, counſelled them thus wiſely, that they ſhould be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d all their force and ſtrength, and leuell at Epiminondas,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:22867:70"/>
ſaying, It was a poinct of prudence to cut off the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt ſouldier firſt of all; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that valiant men were the cauſers of victory, which when they had obſerued, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the conqueſt, and ſo preuented the daunger, and preſerued their liues &amp; ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Whereby it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that in warre one pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man was of greater force to ſubdue, then an whole army of vnwiſemen. For (as Homer ſaieth) <hi>Ille ſapit ſolus, volitant alii velut vmbrae.</hi> Likewiſe Ioſeph ſo excelled in prudence, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſing Pharao to prouide a man of wiſedome and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and ſet him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the land of Egypt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Let Pharao make and appoint Officers ouer the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:22867:70"/>
land, and take vp the firſt part of the land of Egypt in the ſeuen plenteous yeeres: alſo let them gather all the foode of theſe good yeeres that come, and lay vp corne vnder the hand of Pharao for foode in the citie, and let them keepe it; ſo the foode ſhalbe for the prouiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the land,<note place="margin">

In like ſort the prudence of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus, the reformer &amp; law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker of the Lacedemonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s was the cauſe of the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of their flouriſhing eſtate aboue 500. yeeres,

ſo that it was the chiefeſt in all Greece, both for glory, &amp; excellency of gouernment: from whence they digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not, vntill ſuch time as they wholy neglected thoſe lawes, and godly ordinances the which hee gaue them. Wherefore to conclude, the vigor &amp; ſtrength of this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in all actions, whether it be ingeneral to all in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtike life, or Oeconomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call appertaining to families, or politike which is the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt of all, vſed to the good of the Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth, hath ſuch efficacy, that nothing without the ſame may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be effected: for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation whereof and a finall concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we need no more then the liuely example of Argos, which had his head

But becauſe of theſe, Plato (<hi>de legibus</hi>) and Cicero with diuers others haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, I will leaue off to ſpeake any thing of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity of the ſortes and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof, but yet not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the quality, I thinke it meet to proceed farther, becauſe as Cicero teſtifieth, without this vertue there is nothing done or effected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maner of way, which in proceſſe of time weareth not away, excepting Iuſtice, which the more ancient it is, the more it flouriſheth: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there ought to bee no time which ſhould bee void of iuſtice, as it well appeared by Byas the ſage and graue Philoſopher, being to iudge a man to die, bewailed and lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the miſery of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

and thought woorthily hee ſhould bewaile his ſiniſter fortune: whom a certaine ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beholding, demaunded why he ſhould weepe and powre teares, when it reſted at his pleaſure to condemne or free any man. To whom Bias an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, I muſt of neceſſity pardon the frailty of nature, but to erre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iuſtice &amp; law, is a pernitious thing, and not to be tolerated: meaning that iuſtice was a meaſure ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from God, amongſt his creatures, to his honor, &amp; the defence of the feeble and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, without which hee eſteemed nothing perfect, except it were guided by this vertue: wherefore he ought not to erre herein, nor dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate any thing from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, being the fundation of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:22867:100"/>
all creatures. Therfore, as it were for the auerring of this ſaying, Manlius Torquatus ſhewed himſelf ſo iuſt in the executing of iuſtice, that he conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned his owne ſonne, &amp; cauſed him to be put to deth, being againſt equity a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour: deeming that hee owed more duty to maintain the rights of iuſtice, then ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loue towards his ſonne, or els to the triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ph &amp; glory of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queſt that his ſonne had gotten. Phocion alſo of Athens, being of Antipater requeſted, that hee would vſe iniuſtice priuily, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, Thou canſt not vſe me both a friend and a flatterer: for a friend doth ſo long continue a friend, as Iuſtice and equity doe permit him. Meaning, that
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:22867:101"/>
neither friends nor kinſmen ſhould be an occaſion to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the execution of iuſtice, which being neglected, both the loue of God &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

this dutie ſheweth our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and in accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, we leaue an example of the feare and diligent care we haue in the obſeruing &amp; effecting of that, that we are commaunded. The diuerſity of this vertue is manyfold, as belonging vnto diuers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Firſt, our obedience towards God, vnto whom belongeth all honor, dutie, and obedience, whereupon all our ſtay, hope, and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is built: ſecondly, our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience towards our king and ſuperiors, to whom we ought in all humblenes and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to ſhew our ſelues obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and loyall, as wee are commaunded by the holy ſcriptures in theſe words, Let euery one ſubmit himſelf vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the higher power. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:22867:105"/>
wee are bound to obey our parents; for as Tully ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in his booke of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere of ſouthſaiers, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the beginning had made a concord betweene vs and our parents: ſo then it were deteſtable to infringe the rights of nature, and not to obey them. Fourthly, and laſtly, is the obedience of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants towards their maſters, whom in all honeſt &amp; meeke ſort they ſhould obey &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

When Salomon deliberated with himſelfe in this behalfe, viz. after what ſort a citie might be ſafely preſerued: he anſwered, If the citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s obey the magiſtrates, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates obſerue the lawes: meaning, that obedience in the ſubiects was a ſigne of great loue and loyalty, and a cauſe why the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth

Firſt, of Chriſt himſelfe, which obeyed his mother Marie and her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band Ioſeph: then of Dauid, who after hee was anointed King, obeyed his parents, and followed their direction in all domeſticall affaires. Wherby we may gather, the great duty we owe vnto our parents, to be no leſſe then a firme bond of nature, fixt in the minds &amp; bowels of euery one:<note place="margin">Cicer. pro Plan.</note> the which obedience Cicero ſo highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he ſaid, The obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of children towardes

Of which mind Torquatus ſonne was, who thought nothing ſo wicked, as to diſobey the will of his parents: wherfore being vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diſpleaſure of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther baniſht, he killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. So likewiſe the duety which ſeruants doe owe to their maſters, is not much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to this, whom they are to ſerue with al lowlines and ſeemely demeanure, ſuſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with patience all corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, though I deeme them not ſo much ſubiects, as the ſeruants of Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>chmen were, ouer whome their maſters had power of life and death; and as Gellius ſaieth in his 15. booke and 19. chapter, The ten wiſemen thought, that authority not onely of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:22867:108"/>
maſters ouer their ſeruants, but alſo of parents ouer their children, was very neceſſary throughout al dominions, by which means they report the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth long to haue ſtood.

            <p>FAith (as Cicero ſaieth) is a conſtant &amp; firme bond of all ſayinges, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, appointed for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of promiſes, and what ſhould be aſſuredly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed vpon, or as Diuines

Ennius reprehended the Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, becauſe they viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their faith and fidelity, which was the firſt cauſe of the ſubuerſion of their city, who contended for the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the whole world, with the Romanes, which of al na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were a people of moſt
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:22867:112"/>
proweſſe and valour. But what maruaile is it that theſe were ſo ſlender in obſeruing of faith, which is the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all equity, when in all places it is litle regarded, and vtterly excluded out of doones, begging her bread with teares, as a vagabond of no reputation, that I am almoſt aſhamed to ſpeake of the diffidency of men, and the litle regard which they haue of their faith, which ought to be of effect amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt enemies, vnleſſe it bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, by conſtraint and compulſion aſſured? And yet wee haue experience of many, that would rather die, then vpon compulſion or conſtraint pawne their faith and credite: as for example, Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius Ceſar the Centurion,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:22867:113"/>
being taken of Scipio, the father in law of Pompey, to whom Scipio promiſed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, vpon condition that he would be the Souldiour of Cnaius Pompeius: to whom Pontius anſwered, Scipio, I yeeld thee thankes; but I need no ſuch condition of life, for I had rather die, then to violate my faith. Whoſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity may be vnto vs a moſt liuely patterne to imitate: in ſo doing wee purchaſe our ſelues eternity, and the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our realme hereby is maintained: for what elſe doth cauſe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth to bee ouerwhelmed, but where the people are vnloial and diſobedient towardes their gouernours? But on the contrary ſide, happy is that eſtate, wherein the ſubiects

are moſt louing and faithfull vnto their gouernour, and where the gouernour ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his communalties ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and is full of clemency, which is the nexte way to binde and vnite affection in duty: ſeing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth together a Common wealth as faith, which is both the originall, and as it were the chiefe conſtitutor &amp; ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uator thereof: therefore it is a reproch, eyther to promiſe lightly without performing, or in firmely promiſing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe and neglect it: as Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus king of Aragon was often wont to ſay, that the very bare worde of a king to the performing of his fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was ſo much reckoned, as the othe of priuate men, and ſaied, It was an vnſeemely

But omitting many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notable exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, which both in writing and of late remembraunce are extant, I will onely ſpeake of the diuerſity and difference of this word Faith, how it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.

This connection of ſundry willes and mutual conſent of minds, is hardly to be found, vnleſſe it be betweene good men, and withall cannot be found without vertue: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as Ariſtotle ſaieth, Friendſhip is a vertue ioyned to vertue, &amp; requireth equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Wherfore in all that be good this friendſhip cannot be, except they be of like co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

exceeding one an other in age; for where there is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of nature, there may be no amity, becauſe it is an entire conſent of willes and degrees. In reſpect hereof, Ariſtotle ſaith, that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip hath three obiects, that is, Honeſty, profit, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. According to the firſt, the friendſhip of good men conſiſteth (as I haue afore mentioned) that there could be no friendſhip but amongſt good men: according to the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, proceedeth a familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of daily conuerſion, and that is betweene marchants, and diuers other mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trades men, giuen to the world, and regarding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, amongſt whom there is no friendſhip: for as Cicero ſaieth, <hi>Amicus eſt alter ego</hi>:
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:22867:118"/>
that is, I eſteeme my friend as my ſelfe: but they regard more their welth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe, which they thinke may procure them ſufficient friends euery where. Is not this an odious thing in a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, that friendſhip ſhould be contemned, which procureth concord and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, vnity peace, peace tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, tranquillity ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of life, which are the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſes of the maintayning and long continuance of the good eſtate of the Common wealth?

ſuch there wantes conſtancy and diſcretion, as it euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth: for this friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip endureth but for a time. The like vnto this (though a worſe) is that of theeues, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, conſpirators, and diuers other malefactors, who, as birds of the ſame feathers, do flocke and reſort together, not for any loue they owe one the other, but for the good will they beare vnto thoſe lewde practiſes which they do vſe. Wherefore they are excluded of all men, and in reſpect hereof, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort together for friendſhip ſake, as they terme it, which is no frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſhip, but carrieth a ſhewe of friendſhip: becauſe friendſhip onely is ſaid to be amongſt good and vertuous me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is the neceſſarieſt

               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:22867:121"/>LIberality is a vertue, grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully beſtowing gifts vpon others, and is ſaied to be the encreaſe and yerely fruits or annuities, of thoſe bleſsings which God hath beſtowed vpon vs, for the relieuing of the diſtreſſed.

Neuertheleſſe in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing we muſt be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and conſider where, when, and to whom; becauſe liberality conſiſteth not in the quantity of the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, but in the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and natural inclination and diſpoſition of the giuer. For he is neuer ſaid to giue in vaine, as Auguſtine ſaith, that giueth with a zeale and deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; they are accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted liberall and bountiful, which beſtow giftes vpon him that deſerueth well, &amp; requeſteth nothing. For doubtleſſe, that gifte is double to bee accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which proceedeth from a free hand and a liberall hart: becauſe Plautus ſaieth,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:22867:122"/>
that he giueth too late, that giueth when he is asked: for the requeſt of the thing that is giuen, deſerueth the gift: wherfore he is rightly accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted liberal, that giueth of his owne accord, and receiueth not, and withall the benefite of the giuer doth more profit him that giueth, then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer; which Phocion, the whole credit of Athens, did eſteeme rightly to be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, who when Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great had preſented him with giftes, and ſundry coſtly Iewels fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Perſia, did ſhew a liuely example here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in refuſing the gift, adding this ſentence, I wil not learne to take, leſt I forget to giue. Wherein hee ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a patterne of liberalitie, well befitting the worthines
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:22867:123"/>
of his perſon. Herby we may coniecture, that to be liberal, is a ſigne of an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mind.

The property
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:22867:125"/>
of this matchles virgine, is to ſuſtaine thoſe crimes which are layed vpon her, not tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating her ſelfe to be haſtily carried to reuenge, nor eaſily ſpurred to wrath: but enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe reſteth, to be of a ſetled &amp; ſtaied re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and to carry a milde and gracious mind: for hee that purchaſeth otherwiſe, wanting clemency, is ſaied to cary duſt againſt the winde. Wherefore let all Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, which do know for a certainty they haue their power from aboue, po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der in their minds in what caſe they themſelues be daily, if God did not abounde in mercy, who would ſpeedily, aſſoone as they had grieuouſly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſmite them with his rod of correction, although as the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:22867:125"/>
Scripture ſaieth, the pureſt man liuing paſſeth not one howre, which deſerueth not ſome puniſhment: but God being infinit in mercy, vpon hope of amendeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. As therefore imitating his example, and following his ſteps, let all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly embrace clemency, which is of ſuch excellency, that the hart of man cannot conceiue, nor his tongue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter either the infinit goodnes thereof, or how admirably it linketh humane ſociety. Wherfore as Demonax was wont to ſay, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought not to want clemency, nor to waxe angry in correcting faultes, vſing the example of Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are not moued to fret at their ſicke patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, but mildly to cure the diſeaſe:
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:22867:126"/>
meaning hereby, that the only remedy, and ſureſt way to winne the good will of the ſubiects, is alwaies for the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to be courteous and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which cauſeth loue in the ſubiects, and procureth the good of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. Of ſuch clemency was Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey the great, who, when Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes king of Armenia by him conquered, kneeled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, yeelding vp his Crowne and Scepter at his feete, and himſelf to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as a captiue, tooke him vp in his armes, embraced him, put on his crowne on his head, and reſtored him to his kingdome againe.

in ſo much that he could not onely force all humane powers, but alſo time &amp; place themſelues? &amp; yet who hath left greater proofe of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe then he? for as he was on his voiages, vndertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the conqueſt of the Indians, he &amp; Taxilles might not war one againſt the other. If thou (ſaith this king vnto him) art leſſe then I, receiue benefits: if greater, I will take them of thee. Alexander greatly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending, &amp; withal admiring the grauity and courteous ſpeach of this Indian, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thus, At the leaſt we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat for this, namely whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of vs twaine ſhalbe moſt beneficial vnto his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion.

Nothing ſo much as clemency. Adrian a noble Romane, conceyued great hatred againſt a famous gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Rome: but aſſoone as this noble Adrian was made Emperour, by chaunce meeting his enemy in the ſtreet, that very day that hee was created Emperour, ſaid with a loud voice, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all the people, <hi>Eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſistime,</hi> Thou haſt wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne the conqueſt: meaning, that he being made a Prince, might in no ſort reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the wrongs that he conceiued before.

Iulius Ceſar was alſo of ſuch courteous behauior, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing conquered Pompey, &amp; all his enemies, hee wrote to his friends in Rome, that the greateſt and moſt eſtimable fruit, which he of his victory conceiued, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſted in ſauing daily the life of men, being his owne countrey men, who had borne armes againſt him.

            <p>WArre is of two ſortes; ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ciuill, or forraine: ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill warre is the ouerthrower of all eſtates &amp; monarchies, and the very roote of al euil,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:22867:160"/>
which inge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence towards God, diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Magiſtrates, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of iuſtice, being ſprung of the diuerſitie of religion; but in effect, ambition. And forreine warre is a more law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full contention, as being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for religion ſake, and to procure peace and vnitie. This ciuil war ſtirreth vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelfe, both the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred &amp; weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to him that deſireth it. For hee that vexeth his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects vnworthily, ſeeking ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to rule ouer them by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, then to gaine their good wil with iuſtice, he quite ouerthroweth his countrey, preferring dominion and greatnes of his power, before the benefit of the ſame: he is brought oftentimes in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:22867:160"/>
to his enemies, and diminiſheth his owne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, whiles he laboureth to poſſeſſe another mans right by violence. Auguſtus the Emperour ſaid, That to haue lawfull warre, it muſt bee commended by the gods, and iuſtified by the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. And Elius Spartianus affirmeth, that Traian one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Romanes, was neuer ouercome in battel, becauſe hee vndertooke no warre, except the cauſe thereof was very iuſt. But wee may well ſay, that no warres betweene Chriſtians a ſo iuſtified, but that ſtill there remaineth ſome cauſe of ſcruple. Moreouer wee ſee, that the famine and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence moſt commonly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low war: for the abundance
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:22867:161"/>
of all things being waſted, want of victuals muſt needes follow, wherupon many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes doe growe. Briefly it bringeth nothing with it, but a heape of miſeries, and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draweth and allureth the violence and euill diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of many, to follow the eſtate of time: for they that deſire a chaunge, are very glad of ſuch an occaſion, to ground their platformes vpon, which they could not do in time of peace, becauſe men are then of better iudgement and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as well in publike, as alſo in priuate matters. It was for theſe conſiderations, that Phocion the great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Athenians la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to ſtoppe the warre, which the people of Athens determined to make againſt
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:22867:161"/>
the Macedonians, at the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of Leoſthenes: and being dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would he counſaile the Athenians to warre? When I ſee (quoth he) that the yoong men are fully reſolued to leaue their riot, that rich men contribute money willingly, and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors abſtaine from robbing the Common welth. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles, the crime was leuied againſt his counſell: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wondring at the greatnes and beauty thereof, asked him, how hee liked that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. It is faire for one brunt, ſaid Phocion: but I feare the returne and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the warre, becauſe I doe perceyue, that the city hath no other meanes to get money, or other furniture, or men of warre beſides thoſe.
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:22867:162"/>
And his foreſight was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by the euent: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Leoſthenes proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the beginning of his enterpriſe, (wherupon Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion being demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee would not gladly haue done al thoſe great and excellent things, anſwered that he would, but not haue omitted that counſell which he gaue) yet in the end hee was ſlaine in the voyage, the Grecian army ouerthrowne by Antipater &amp; Crateres too Macedonians, and the city of Athens brought to that extremity, that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſend a blanke for capitulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of peace, &amp; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue within it a garriſon of ſtrangers. Thus it falleth out co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly to thoſe, that ſeeke for warre by al means, either
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:22867:162"/>
by right or by wrong.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Warre ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately begu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but ſpeedily ended.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The euents of warre are doubtfull, but the dammage certaine.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Warre by might maketh his anceſtors who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he pleſeth.</p>

            <p>TO further the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth, many prouiſoes may be inuented, which muſt be aſwell noted to the ſimple, as to the careful magiſtrate, vpon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> relieth the charge hereof, not apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe outwardly to

that which his conſcience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly reprooueth, leſt hee ſhould be ſaid, wilfully to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the lawe of God. What greater felicity can happen to any earthly wight, when hee is by the higheſt Father preſſed with care of ciuil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, that wholy depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon vertue, and onely for the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhment therof is put in vre, then as beyng ſurcharged with this great burden, or ouerladen with it, to find a comfort to mitigate his diſtreſſe, tempered with a mild medicine of hope, that rooteth out the ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kred fleſh of deſpaire, with the plaſter of truſt? In this forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, &amp; in the flooriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate of all people, by the reforming of all degrees, it is good to ſtrike the ſtith whilſt

the yron is hote, and amend al faults while they are green and freſh, which may not be but by the ſeruitude of laws; &amp; alſo to prouide, that in all points, the common ſort bee tractable and obedient, and the magiſtrates diligent and careful to rule, as conſcience and duty bindeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which being once ſtained with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice, is alwaies tied with a guilty remorſe. Otherwiſe if they practiſe diſcreetly &amp; reuerently thoſe things that are godly and lawfull, that their conſciences may bee cleere, and others by their doings not offended, then it may bee ſaid generally, as it was of the great king of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couy, (who was thought to controll all the Monarches of the world, hauing gotten

By which meanes he grewe ſo mighty within a litle while, that all his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, which were the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians, Sueuians, yea and the Turks themſelues, canoniz'd

Where ſuch loue and obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is wrought in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects towardes their ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, and of the ſoueraigne towards his ſubiects, there ſhall vertue enioy her free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and poſſeſſe her priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by the rights of law, &amp; all the people ſhall flouriſh with equity: Iuſtice ſhall maintaine peace, peace ſhall procure ſecurity, ſecurity ſhall nouriſh wealth, wealth felicity. Where want hereof breedes a flatte denial or not like ſufficiency to all, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this defect, let none be diſmaied, at his ſmall ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, or grudge at an others greater proſperity: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, nature hath by her ſecrete motion, denied none ſome perfect quality to ſupply that want, which in

himſelfe breedes diſcontent or miſlike: for eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the fiſh hauing no eares, hath moſt cleere eyes, ſo though want of dignity bee a diſgrace to ſome, though want of coyne diſcontent diuers, &amp; though lacke of wealth impaires the credite of many, yet nature hath ſupplied that outward orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, with ſuch an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall guerdon, as a loyall and a louing heart guided with conſtancy, willingly dyeth for the good of the common wealth, or ſpendeth all his time in the procuring of the ſecurity thereof.
