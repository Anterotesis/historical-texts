            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </l>
               <l>The world ſhould know ſoon why thou'rt dealt with thus:</l>
               <l>The Gaoler, like a Priſoner at the Bar,</l>
               <l>Should ſet thee forth, and what thy offences are</l>
               <l>Proclaim, and prove, That being dead in Law,</l>
               <l>(As if you car'd not for that death a ſtraw)</l>
               <l>You walk'd, haunted your Church, thinking to scare</l>
               <l>Away the Reader and his Common-Prayer;</l>
               <l>And with your Alphabet of Faces fright</l>
               <l>Your Auditors, worſe than a Fiend or Spright</l>
               <l>Rais'd from the Shades: Nor did you onely walk,</l>
               <l>But (like a <hi>Puritan</hi>) much nonsence talk.</l>
               <l>Dead, and yet <hi>Faction</hi> preach? theſe <hi>Kirk</hi>'s vile Slaves</l>
               <l>Will preach <hi>Rebellion</hi> in their very <hi>Graves.</hi>
               </l>

               <l>You'l not the Dove with th' Olive-branch of Peace</l>

               <l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But your great Theft you acted in your Church:</l>
               <l>I do not mean you did your Sermon lurch;</l>
               <l>That's a ſmall crime with you; but you did pray</l>
               <l>And preach, that you might ſteal the hearts away</l>
               <l>Of Loyal Subjects, Viper-like, and eat</l>

               <l>Conjure, and lay you ſafe in <hi>Newgate</hi> Hell;</l>
               <l>For (to diſplay my thoughts) there cannot be</l>
               <l>Prepared for you better Company</l>
               <l>Than Roaring Boyes; ſure <hi>mirth</hi> you cannot want,</l>

               <l>But I'm confin'd too to as bad a place;</l>
               <l>Let's then for Sympathy compare our caſe:</l>
               <l>For if in ſuffering we do both agree,</l>
               <l>Sir, I may challenge you to pity me.</l>
               <l>I am the older Gaol-bird; my hard fate</l>
               <l>Hath kept me twenty years in <hi>Cripplegate</hi>;</l>
               <l>And were all I deſerve conferr'd on me,</l>

               <l>He my fat Body for the <hi>Kirk</hi> does take,</l>
               <l>Where he reſides and tortures every Limb</l>
               <l>That wont againſt the <hi>Head</hi> rebel with him;</l>
               <l>And cauſes me againſt the <hi>Church</hi> to prove</l>
               <l>So ſtiff, that I one <hi>Article</hi> cann't move:</l>
               <l>An Enemy to <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> he</l>
               <l>Hath from't theſe twenty years ſuſpended me:</l>

               <l>I'm ſure to go to the <hi>Repentance Stool.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>He binds up, looſeth, ſets up, and pulls down,</l>
               <l>Pretends he draws the Humors from the <hi>Crown</hi>:</l>
               <l>But I am ſure he maketh ſuch adoe,</l>

               <l>O I would give all I am worth, a Fee,</l>
               <l>That from his <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> I were free.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now, Sir, you find our ſufferings do agree;</l>
               <l>The <hi>Biſhop</hi> clapt up you, the <hi>Kirk</hi> hath me.</l>
               <l>But oh! the difference too is very great,</l>
               <l>You are allow'd to walk, and drink, and eat:</l>
               <l>I want them all, and never a peny get,</l>
               <l>So much the <hi>Preslyter</hi>'s againſt me ſet.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>May then bad <hi>Angels</hi> and worſe <hi>Women</hi> come</l>
               <l>To make your Priſon Hell, and bring your Doom:</l>
               <l>And may it be ſo, till you do repent</l>
               <l>Of that which cauſed your Impriſonment;</l>
               <l>May, for the greater torture of your Lives,</l>
               <l>The tortures of your Conſcience (than your VVive's</l>
               <l>VVhen ſhe lies in) be worſe, and may you ſee</l>
               <l>Such bitter Satyres as now come from me.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I'l now ſubſcribe, and play the Fool no more;</l>
               <l>I'l keep my Parſonage e're I'l die poor:</l>
               <l>And if by th' <hi>Kirk</hi> I'm ever more beguil'd,</l>
               <l>Let the whole Univerſe proclaim me <hi>Wilde</hi>;</l>
               <l>For if I don't conform unto the <hi>Miter,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I've made in vain my <hi>Boreale iter.</hi>
