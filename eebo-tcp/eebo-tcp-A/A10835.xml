            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Christian reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo severall treatises (good reader) have been formerly published by several men in answer to Mr Bernards book, yet have I thought it meet to adde a third, not as able to speak more then they, but intending something further: namely, an examination of the particulars one by one, that so in all points the salve might be answerable vnto the soare; applying my self therein to such a familiar and popular kinde of defence, as Mr B. hath chosen for his accusations, where the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer answers onely intended a summary discovery of the insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of his probabilities to disswade from, &amp; reasons to disprove the things he opposeth.</p>
            <p>The zeal Mr. B. manifesteth here and every where both in word and writing is exceeding great, as all men know. And surely fervent zeale in Gods cause is a temper wel befitting Gods servants: neyther is there any more bastardly disposition to be found in a Christian, then indifferency in religion. It makes no matter of what religion the man is that is indifferent in it: <hi>for Christ vvill spue out of his mouth</hi> (as loathsome) <hi>the luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvarm,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 16.</note> whether wine, or water.</p>
            <p>Yet as the case of religion is most weighty, so is the affection of zeale in it most dangerous, if it be eyther pretended onely, &amp; not in truth; or preposterous and not according to knowledge.</p>
            <p>And therefore as there is singular vse of this fyery zeal for these frozen times of ours, so are we to take great heed that our fyre be kindled at the <note n="â€ " place="margin">Levit. 9. 24. 1 King. 18. 38.</note> 
               <hi>fyre of the altar vvhich came from heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>.</hi> For as Luke. Act. 2. 23. speakes of <hi>fyery tongues vvhich came from heaven,</hi> so doth Iames, 3. 6. speak of <hi>a tongue vvhich is set on fyre of hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this we are the more carefully to mynd, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1037:3"/>
almost all men have taught theyr tongues in the generall to speak goodly words, and that zealously also for advantage, but more specially and with respect to the busines in hand, for that many of the weaker sort have theyr tender harts rather affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the truth of the Lord by the deep protestations and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations of their guids, then any way stablished in those perplexed pathes (wherein they walk) with them, by sound reasons.</p>
            <p>Now as the Lord is to be intreated for those people, that he would vouchsafe them wise and stable harts, that they may <note n="â€ " place="margin">

                  </gap>1.</note> 
               <hi>try all things and hold that vvhich is good,</hi> and neyther suffer themselves to be withheld nor withdrawn from the truth by any such semblances of zeale, or other passion, though never so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and seeming never so sincere, so for theyr better direction herein I have thought it not amisse to commend vnto their godly harts two or three considerations, by way of caution, in this case.</p>
            <p>First therefore it must be considered that there are some<note place="margin">I.</note> of that hoysterous and tempestuous disposition that they can doo nothing calmly or a litle, theyr vnruly affections which should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after leysurely do force on so violently theyr vnderstanding will, and whol man, as there is no stay with them, but in all their motions they are like vnto those beasts, which for the vnequall length of theyr hinder leggs cannot possibly goe but by leapes. Such a stormy nature, with a very litle zeal amongst, may make a great stir in the world, but is iustly to be suspected. And that especially (which is the 2. caution) in such men, as are suddaynly<note place="margin">II.</note> caryed, and as it were transformed from one contrary to another without eyther competent tyme or means. A suspitious course; for all thing ordinarily whither in grace, or nature, are wrought by degrees, and the passage from one extreme to another without due means, as it can hardly be sound, so can it not possibly be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suspected. Now ther are many men to be found which are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent in all things but constant in none. And though all things
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1037:3"/>
be with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> as the figs in Ieremyes <note n="*" place="margin">Ier. 24. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>. 2. 3. two baskets</note> 
               <hi>tvvo baskets, the good very good and the evill very evill,</hi> yet are they ever shifting hands out of the one basket into the other. Today they will lift vp and advance a cause and person to heaven, and to morrow they will throw downe both it and him to the lowest hell. It is good to have such men in a godly iealousy, and there zeale with them. And that chiefly (which I desyre may be observed in the third<note place="margin">III.</note> place) when this theyr zeale rises and falls as the tymes serve. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all men will at tymes manifest zeal, but the most have this gift withall, that they wilbe sure to take the strongest syde, or that part at least, which hath some hope of prevayling. And so whylst there remaynes hope of bearing things over at the breast, they are very forward and fervent in there courses; but when that hope shaketh, theyr edg is of, and they turne theyr backs shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vpon the truth, yea and oft tymes theyr faces agaynst it.</p>
            <p>And herevpon it comes to passe that many (formerly great advauncers of the cause of reformation) have of late tymes not onely fouly forsaken, but violently opposed the same both in us and them also amongst themselves, which doe in any measure desyer it, publishing theyr books vnto the world so filled with empty words and swelling vanityes, as they not onely bewray the weaknes of theyr cause, but the evill and corrupt disposition of theyr hearts, as rather striving to manifest theyr servil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> affections for insinuations into the favours of the myghty; then to bring any thing of weight for the conviction of the adversary. The application of this I leave to the godly and wise reader, as he shall see iust cause.</p>
            <p>And so leaving those things which are more generall, I desyre in particular, and for the present purpose that the christian reader take knowledg of this one thing, that as the pretence of zeale in the forward Ministers against all corruptions is as a thick mist, holding the eyes of many wel mynded from seing the truth;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1037:4"/>
so the person with whom I now particularly deal, trusts to this insinuation above all others, conveyghing himself vnder this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour into the harts of the simple, and hereby making way most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, not onely for his sage-seeming <hi>counsels</hi> &amp; <hi>advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> for the quenching of their affections towards the truth: but also for his idle guesses and <hi>likelyhoods,</hi> with such perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall comparisons, and imputations, as wherewith his book is sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to alienate mens harts from it.</p>
            <p>But the godly reader is to consider that <note n="â€ " place="margin">Prov. 24. 23.</note> 
               <hi>to accept the person in judgement is not good,</hi> especially in the cause of the Lord, and that <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>the faith of our glorious Lord Iesus is not to be held in respect of persons:</hi> but that the naked and simple truth is to be inquired after, with an vnpartiall affection. And then the Lord which gives a single heart to seek after it, will give a wise hart to find it out. Math. 7. 7.

            </p>
            <p>And for my self as I could much rather have desired to have built vp my self and that poore stock over which the holy Ghost hath set me in holy peace, (as beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>meth the house of God, wherein <note n="â€ " place="margin">1 King. 6. 7</note>

            <p>And so desiring as earnestly the Christian reader into whose hands this my defence shal come, to manifest vnto me such errours in the same (if by the word of God they may so be found) as to receive from me such truthes, as are therin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Such persons are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>monly called amongst themselves professors, vertuous and religious, &amp; thereby distinguished fro the body of the land, which make no such profession, and are therefore accounted (and iustly) prophane, and without religion, and that as roundly by Mr. B. as by any other in the Land. But it seemeth he had forgot both his Epistle &amp; whom both he in it, and others every where, call Professors for distinction sake, when he wrote his book; for in it <note n="â€ " place="margin">Pag. 112. 113.</note> he makes all the kingdome profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors at a venture, and Christian professours I hope he meaneth.</p>

            <p>And where (Mr Ber.) in the body of the Epistle, you seat your self in the middest between <hi>the schismatical Brownist</hi> (as you charitably term him) &amp; <hi>the Antichristia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> Papist, the one snatching on the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d, and the other on the left,</hi> it is something which you say, and more belike then you are aware of.</p>
            <p>Fitly may you be seated in the middest betwixt both, being indeed a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glement &amp; compound of both, and wel may both snatch at you, and yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do you wrong, if neyther require more then their owne. Iustly may the Papists challenge from you that stinted service book, devised Ministerie, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian Hierarchie, and Babylonish confusion which you have stollen away from them, as <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Gen. 31. 19. 34.</note> Rahel did her Fathers idols though she covered them never so close. And iustly also may we chalenge from you such godly people as you fraudulently deteyn, and such truthes of doctrine as you teach, as being the peculiars of the true Church: as the holy vessels were of the temple <note n="*" place="margin">Ier. 52. 17<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 18.</note> though violently with the people caried to Babylon and there kept.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:1037:5"/>But if you will still hault betwixt both, as <note n="â€ " place="margin">1 King. 18 21.</note> Israell did betwixt God and Baal, and carry in your right hand many Evangelicall truthes with vs, &amp; in your left many Antichristian devises with the Papists, no marvell though both partyes remayne vnsatisfyed; neyther must you be offended, though the Papists for the truthes you hold with vs account you hereticks, nor though we for the devises you reteyn with them call you Antichristian. And so you see your midle standing betwixt them and vs more wayes then one.</p>
            <p>And thus much of the Epistle dedicatory. In the next place I come to the preface: where amongst other iust complaynts of the iniquityes of the tymes, you reckon (and that worthily) as the most daungerous <hi>Atheisticall securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; carnall living vnder a generall profession,</hi> to which purpose you alledg 2 Tim. 3. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. and so instance in <hi>your English people:</hi> This place of Timothy alone had you well weyed, and throughly improved especially the fifth verse, where separation from such persons (as having a shew of godlines do deny the power thereof, as you confesse the English people do) is expresly commaunded, it would eyther have stopped your mouth from reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs as you do for separation, or els have opened the mouth of the most sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reader to reproue your vanity, as God did the mouth of the asse to reprove Balaam.</p>
            <p>The next thing I observe is how vauntingly you bring as chalengers into the lists Mr. Gyshop, Mr Bradshaw, D. Allison and other vn-named Ministers, all which you say are vnanswered by vs. And no marveil, for sundry of their writings never came to our hands, and besides it were a more equall and compendious way for these men to take vp the defence of their Churches cause, where their fellowes have forsaken it, and left it desolate, then thus to make new chalenges, though in truth with the same weapons (it may be new frubbished over) wherewith the other have lost the field. Yet are theyr books and (by the grace of God assisting) shalbe answered in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar as they come to our hands, and are thought worthy answering: though in truth it were no hard thing for our adversaries to oppresse us with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of books considering both how few and how feeble we are in comparison (besides other outward difficultyes) if the truth we hold which is stronger then all, did not support it selfe.</p>
            <p>The difference you lay down in the next place touching the proper sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the power of Christ is true in it selfe being rightly vnderstood, and onely yours wherein it is corruptly related, and specially in the particular concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1037:5"/>

            <p>And where further you advise the reader to <hi>take from the Iay other birds feathers,</hi> that is, as you expound your self, <hi>to set vs before him as we differ from all other Churches.</hi> Therein you make a most inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and vnreasonable motion.</p>
            <p>If a man should set the Church of England before his eyes, as it differeth but from the reformed Churches, it would be no very beautiful bird. Yea what could it in that colour afforde, but Egyptian bondage; Babylonish confusion; carnal pomp; and a company of Iewish; Heathenish, and Popish ceremonies? Whatsoever truth is in the world it is from God, and from him we have it, by what hand soever it be reached vnto vs <note n="â€ " place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 36.</note> 
               <hi>Came the word of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you onely?</hi> &amp; vnto it we have good right as the Israel of God, unto whom he hath committed his oracles. Rom. 3. 2.</p>
            <p>Towards the end of the Preface you do render two reasons vpon which you do adventure to deal against vs as you do, the one <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>fidence in your cause,</hi> the other <hi>the spirituall injury which some of late have done you, in taking away part of the seale of the Ministery.</hi> Touching the first: as it is to vs that know you wel, no new thing to see you confident in all enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises; so doth it much behoove you to consider, how long and by what meanes you have been possessed of this your confident perswasion. I could name the person of good credite and note, to whom vpon occasion you confessed (and that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1037:6"/>
since you spake the same things, which here you write as confidently as now you write them) that you had much a doe to keep a good conscience in dealing against this cause, as you did.</p>
            <p>But a speach of your own vttered to my self (ever to be reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>bred with fear and trembling) can not I forget, when after the conference passing betwixt Mr H. and me, you vttered these wordes, <hi>Wel, I wil returne home, &amp; preach as I have done, and I must say as Naaman did, the Lord be merciful unto me in this thing:</hi> and therevpon you further promised with out any provocation by me or any other, that <hi>you would never deale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this cause, nor with-hold any fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>it:</hi> though the very next Lords day, or next but one, you taught publikli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>w, the Lord graunt, not you conscience.</p>
            <p>And for the seale of your Ministerie, deceive not yourself and others; if you had not a more authentick seal in your black box to shew for your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery at your Bishops visitation, then the converting of men to God, (which is the seal you meane,) this seale would stand you in as little stead, as it doth many others which can shew as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>re this way as you, and yet are put from their Ministerie notwithstanding. And wil you charge your Bishops &amp; Church representative to deale so trecherously with the Lord, as to put downe his Ministers and Officers which have his broad seal to shew for their Office and Ministerie? What greater contumely do these <hi>vipers,</hi> these <hi>schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Brownists</hi> lay vpon your Church then you doe herein.</p>
            <p>The Church of England acknowledgeth no such seale as this is. The Bishops ordination and license, conformitie vnto their ceremonies, subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their articles, devout singing and saying their service-book is that which will beare a man out though he be far enough eyther from converting, or from preaching conversion vnto any.</p>
            <p>And here I desire the reader to observe this one thing with me. When the ministers are called in quaestion by the Bishops, they alledge vnto them their former subscription conformity in some measure, at least their peaceable cariage in their places, but when they would iustify their ministerie against vs, then their vsuall plea is, they haue converted men to God, herein acknowledging (to let passe their vnsound dealing) that we respect the work of Gods grace in any, at which they know the Bishops and their substitutes, if they should plead the same with them, would make a mock for the most part.</p>
            <p>I do most freely acknowledge the singular blessing of God vpon many truthes taught by many in the Land, and do and alwayes shal so far honour those persons as the Lord hath honoured them herein. But that the simple
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1037:6"/>
conversion of sinners, (yea though the most perfect that ever was wrought) should argue a true office of Ministerie; the scriptures no where teach; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall I ever beleeve without them.</p>
            <p>This scripture 1 Cor. 9. 1. 2. is most frequently alledged for this purpose. But as vnsoundly as commonly. For if simple conversion should argue an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postleship, then should a common effect argue a proper cause, an ordinarie work, an extraordinarie office: for the conversion of men is a work common to extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie and to ordinarie officers, yea to true and false officers, yea to such as are in no office at all, as hereafter shall appeare.</p>
            <p>And what could be more weakly alledged by Paul to prove himself no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie but an extraordinary officer, an Apostle, (which was the thing he intended) then that which is common to ordinary officers with him? Might not the Corinthians easily have replyed! Nay Paul it followes not that you are an Apostle immediately called and sent by Christ, because you haue begotten vs to the Lord, &amp; have been the instrument of our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>versio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, for ordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters Pastors &amp; Teachers called by men, do beget to the Lord as wel as you.</p>
            <p>The bare conversion of the Corinthians then is not the seal Paul speakes of, but together with it their establishment into a true visible Church, and that with such power and authority Apostolicall, as wherewith Paul was furnished by the Lord. Of which more hereafter.</p>
            <p>But <hi>the father of these childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               </hi> (you say) <hi>you are which thus vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally fly from you, and whereof we so injuriously have deprived you,</hi> in which respect also you make this your <hi>hue &amp; cry</hi> after vs and them, for <hi>through the gospel you have begotten them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And have you begotten them vnto the faith, as Paul did the Corinthians? and are you their father, as Paul was the father of the Corinthians? then it must needs follow that before you preached the gospel vnto them, and thereby begot them to the Lord, they were in the same estate wherein the Corinthians were before Paul preached vnto them, that is unbeleevers, and without faith, and so were to be reputed. And how then true matter of the Church, for which you so much contend?</p>
            <p>Besides, these your begotten children were baptised long before you saw their faces, some twenty, some thirtie, some fourtie yeares. Now this their baptisme was true baptisme, and so the true seale of their forgivenes of sinnes, and new birth as you affirm &amp; prove, page 119. &amp; this their seal of the new birth hath stood good vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> them all this while visibly and externally, and yet after all this you preach vnto them &amp; beget the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> a new visibly &amp; externally (for onely God knoweth that which is true within.) You have begot them through the Gospel.</p>

               <hi>God is the God of peace,</hi> so are not they Gods children, nor borne of him, which desire it not; yea even in the middest of their contentions.</p>
            <p>But as all vices vse to cloth themselves with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites of vertues, that vnder those liveries they may get countenance and finde the more free passage in the world, so especially in the Church all tyranny and confusion do present themselves vnder this colour, taking vp the politick pretence of peace, as a weapon of mere advantage wherewith the stronger, and greater party vseth to beat the weaker. The Papists presse the protestants with the peace of the Church and for the rent which they have made in it, condemn them beyond the heathenish souldiours, which forbare to devide Christs garment; as deeply do the Bishops charge the Ministers refusing conformity and subscription, and both of them vs. But the godly wise must not be affrighted eyther from seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or embracing the truth with such buggs as these are, but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note n="â€ " place="margin">Iam. 3. 17.</note> 
               <hi>the wisdome which is from above, is first pure, then peaceable,</hi> he must make it a great part of his Christian wisdome to discerne betwixt godly and gratious peace, and that which is eyther pretended for advantage, or mistaken by error, &amp; so to labor to hold peace in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Let it then be manifested vnto vs that the Communion which the Church of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d hath with all the wicked in the Land,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1037:8"/>
without separation, is a pure communion, that theyr service book devised and prescribed in so many words and letters to be read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and over with all the appurtenances, is a pure worship, that their goverment by Nationall Provinciall and diocesan Bishops ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s, is a pure goverme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, &amp; then let vs be blamed if we hold not peace with them in word &amp; deed; otherwise though they spake vnto vs never so oft both by messengers and mouth of peace, and agayn of peace, *as Iehoram did to Iehu, yet must<note place="margin">2 King. 9.</note> we answer them in effect, as Iehu did Iehoram, what peace whilest the whoredoms of the mother of fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s the Iezebel of Rome do remayn in so great number amongst them?</p>
            <p>And I doubt not but Mr Bern. and 1000 more Ministers in the land, (were they secure of the Magistrates sword, and might they go on with his good licence) would wholly shake of their canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call obedience to their Ordinaries, and neglect their citations and censures and refuse to sue in their Courts, for all the peace of the Church which they commend to vs for so sacred a thing. Could they but obteyn license fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the Magistrate to vse the libertie which they are perswaded Christ hath given them, they would soon shake off the Prelates yoke, and draw no longer vnder the same in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion with all the profane in the land, but would break those bonds of iniquitie, as easily as Sampson did the cordes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Dalilah tyed him, and give good reasons also from the word of God for their so doing. And yet the approbation of men and angels, makes the wayes of God &amp; workes of religion never a whit the more lawfull, but onely the more free from bodily daunger. Wherevpon we (the weakest of all others) have been perswaded to embrace this truth of our Lord Iesus Christ, though in great and manifold afflictions, &amp; to hold out his testimony as we do, though without approbation of our Sovereigne, knowing that as his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation in such points of Gods worship, as his word warranteth not, cannot make them lawful; so neyther can his disallowance make unlawful such duties of religion, as the word of God appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, nor can he give dispensation to any person to forbeare the fame, Dan<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 3. 18.

            <p>These things I thought good to commend to the reader that he

               <p>For a man may commit a sinne agaynst God, in doing a thing wherein there is no sinne. The sinne may be in the person doing, &amp; not in the thing done: as when a man doth a good thing against his conscience or doubtingly, and without fayth. 1 Iohn. 3. 20. Rom. 14. 23.</p>
               <p>And where Mr. Bern. further adviseth rather to offend many private persons then one lawful Magistrate, I doubt not he gives no worse counsayle then he himself followes, who (except I be much deceaved in him) had rather offend half the private persons in the diocesse, then one Arch-bishop though he be an vnlawfull Magistrate.</p>
               <p>But of the case of offence hereafter. In the meane whyle, let vs remember our care be not to offend the Lord, and if with the offence of a private person (though never so base) be joyned the offence of the Lord, better offend all the both lawfull and vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Magistrates in the world, then such a little one. Mat. 18. 6.</p>
               <p>Lastly where Mr. Ber. concludes this decade of counsayl with that which is written Rom. 14. 17. 18. he misinterprets the Apostles words if he put them down (as it seems he doth) for a reason of that which goes before. For the Apostles in that place hath no reference at all to the authority of the Magistrate, whose kingdome indeed doth stand in meate and drinke and the like bodily things, wherin he may command civilly, &amp; is to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Lord: but the Apostles purpose is to admonish the strong in fayth to take heed of abusing theyr Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> liberty in the vnsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>able vse of meats &amp; drinks &amp; the like (to the offence of the weak brethren)
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1037:10"/>
as though the kingdom of God stood in the pere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ptory vse of those things, &amp; that they were therein to shew the libertie of the gospel.</p>
               <p>Furthermore howsoever the kingdome of God be not meat &amp; drink, yet is the kingdom of God much advanced or hindred both in a mans self and in others, in the seasonable or vnseasonable vse of them. A man in vsing them (or rather abusing them) with offence to a weak brother, may destroy both him, and himself al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in breaking the law of charity. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 15. 20.</p>

               <p>Now this order of the Lord was violated, in the bringing of it out of the house of Abinadab vncovered and vpon a cart, after the fashion of the Egyptians, 1 Sam. 8. 7. 8. And the breach of this

order the Lord punished very severely, making a breach vpon Vzzah the Preist for touching the Ark, which was his perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sinne, and for carrying it vpon the cart, which sinne was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the rest of the Preists with him; he was striken dead by the hand of God in the same place. 2 Sam. 6.</p>

               <p>Secondly, where the Apostle, ver. 25. 27. directs the faythful to make no conscience of eating, he further addeth, ver. 28. 29. that for the offence of a weak brother scandalizing at the eating of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lothites, they ought to make conscience and to forbeare.

Notwithstanding since Mr. B. casts this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, as a stone in the way to other matters of importance, I may not altogether overstryde it, but will turne it over as I goe, that the reader as he passeth by, may see what wormes and other vermine, lyes vnder it.</p>
               <p>First then to l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And so those ceremonyes supposed indifferent, agreing with the mayn parts of Gods worship in theyr ends, must agree also in their natures with them, since <hi>fines rerum sunte formis,</hi> &amp; so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly must have holynes in them, or els your worship Mr. B. is very vnholy.</p>
               <p>And what necessity is put in them, all men see when the purest preaching in the land without them is thought not onely vnnessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but even intollerable. And if <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>necessity be layd vpon the Ministers to preach the Gospell,</hi> then that to which the preaching of the Gospell must give place, is more necessary, and so made.</p>
               <p>Moreover, to make a thing indifferent, and yet to serve for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, order and edification, includes a contradiction: For it is not an indifferent thing to minister the ordinances of Christ decently orderly and to edification, but a matter of simple necessity, 1 Cor. 14. 26. 40.</p>
               <p>Yea I adde, if the Ceremonyes make the worship of God the more comely, orderly, and edificative, they ought continually &amp; diligently to be vsed, yea though they were forbidden by the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est power vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> earth: as on the contrary, if they advantage not the worship of God for those purposes, they are vayn and frivolous, &amp; to be forborn in or about the worship of God, which abhorrs all such vanity.</p>
               <p>Lastly, as we live in a very indifferent age for religion, wherein the most are indifferent of what religion they are; yea whither they be of any or none; so no mervayl though men sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d stis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y for indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency of things. And when they have amongst them such devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as they neither can approve for good, nor wil condemn as evil, they baptize them into the name of indifferent things. But the truth is, there is nothing simply indifferent in the vse: but be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so base or meane a ceremony, circumstance or appurtenance to any solemn action, it is eyther good or evill according to the furtherance or hinderance which it affoardeth to the mayn<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

If it give furtherance to a naturall action, it is naturally good; if to a civil action, civily good; if to a religious action, religiously good; and so to be reputed: otherwise it is vayne at the least: and vanity as it is every where evil, so is it in the matters of religion the taking of Gods name in vayn.</p>
               <p>The next thing which Mr. Bern. vndertakes, is to set downe how scrupulosity of conscience ariseth in men: for which disease (if it arise) surely he sheweth himself a physitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of no value for the healing of it: but eyther smothereth the same vnder the authority of the Magistrate, or dispenseth with it vpon good meanings, or forceth it on without assurance, or entangleth it with new doubts.</p>
               <p>In the first enquiry which he wils men to make into themselves, touching scrupulosity of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>science amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>gst other things he speaks thus.</p>

               <p>And the grosse ignorance or vngodly concealment of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, is the cause of great confusion.

which they are imposed; from which two ariseth necessarily a third difference to be made in the conscience of obedience vnto them.</p>
               <p>First then it cannot be denyed, but matters civill and politick do come vnder the generall administration and goverment of the world, and do respect the outward man for this present life. On the other side, matters ecclesiasticall come vnder the special admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the Church, and serve for the edification and building vp of the inward man to life eternall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Magistrates and men in authority, do enact and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their civill decrees and ordinances upon theyr subiects, by a Kingly and Lordly power, as being Kings and Lords civilly over the outward man, and his outward estate; Math. 20. 25. and may by their Kingly and Lordly power commaund in their owne names, and that vpon occasion to the civill hurt and hinderance of many of theyr people, &amp; are therein to be obeyed notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Rom. 13. 1. 2. 3. &amp;c.

               <p>In civill affayres we may and ought to obey for the authority of the commaunder, yea though we know not any good, but on the contrary much harm to our bodily estate, comming vnto vs by the same: but in matters ecclesiasticall which are subordinate to the souls good, we must obey onely for the ends of the things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

               <p>To conclude this poynt, since the Apostles expresly commaunds, that all things in the Church be done to the edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of the same, I would demaund of Mr. B. with what fayth or good conscience he or any other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, can do or enterprise any one thing in the Church, which he or they are not perswaded by the word of God (which is the rule of fayth) tends to edification.</p>

               <p>The example of Ioab in obeying David, is impertinent. The case was civil, and in civill affaires many thinges may lawfully be vndergone, which are vnlawfully imposed. For example: If the King merely for his pleasure should enioyne Mr B. vpon some great penalty to come into the field souldierlike, to draw a sword, shoot, march or the like, the Magistrate might do evill in thus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding, and yet not Mr B. in obeying: but thus to do in the Church or pulpit in the tyme of Gods worship, were as finfull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience as were the commaundement sinfull. All actions ecclesiasticall, in or about Gods worship, are subordinate to the edification of the Church and to good order; if they tend thereto they are lawfull in the commaunder, if not they are vnlawfull in him that obeyeth.</p>
               <p>Besides, Davids co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mandement for numbring the people, was no

But had Ioab judged the thing commaunded sinne, and not to have been obeyed, he had sinned in obeying, as well as David in commaunding.</p>

               </p>
               <p>To this I answer sundry things, as, first to preach the gospell<note place="margin">Ans.</note> vpon condition of obedience in that wherein a man eyther jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth or suspecteth himself to sinne, is nothing lesse then to preach the gospell freely: though this be in truth that free preaching of the gospell in the Church of England whereof we heare so many lowd boasts. And to perswade a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> vnto this, is, to perswade him to do evill that good may come thereof, as though the Lord stood<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> need of mans sinne, for the publishing of his truth, or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his elect.</p>
               <p>The preaching of the gospel is a most excellent thing, and the fruits of it far better then those of Eden (and oh how happy were we, if with exchaunge of halfe the dayes of our lives we might freely publish it to our own nation, for the converting of sinners) yet must no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> be so far possessed with the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cy of the obiect, (as were our first parents with the goodnes, bewty, and supposed benefit of the forbidden fruit) as to presse vnto it by vnlawfull wayes: and for a man to go about to perswade to the practise of a thing by the casuall fruits and effects of it, &amp; not in the meane whyle to cleare the way of feare and scruple of sinne in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1037:261" rendition="simple:additions"/>
meanes of attayning the proposed good, is to go about to deceive him whom he perswadeth, and by a bayt (as it were) to til his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, as a byrd into a snare, into most fearful intanglements.</p>
               <p>And for Paul, as it is a very vngodly suspition cast vpon him, that he should do any thing which he doubted to be syn, or which he did not most assuredly know was pleasing vnto God, so is it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vntruly affirmed that he did that he did, eyther as yeelding to the evil disposition of men, or to procure free liberty to preach the gospel. He did all things most freely and without any respect to humane authority, fulfilling the royall law of love in tendering the weaknes of the brethren newly converted from Iudaism, observing with them the legall rytes, &amp; those also made a part of Gods worship by them, and that without all probability of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whereof you impeach him.</p>
               <p>Now for Moses he did not graunt, that is, approve of the bill of divorcement, but onely permitted it for the avoyding of a greater evil, which civil Magistrates may do in some cases, which notwithstanding no man vsed without sinne. And what doth this better your popish ceremonies?</p>
               <p>The last thing in quaestion is the case of offence, touching which you make many doubts, where the holy ghost makes none; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting your owne good admonition, that men should <hi>take heed of g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

What sway authority hath in the Church of England, appeareth in the lawes of the land, which make the goverment of the Church alterable at the Magistrates pleasure: and so the Clergy in their submission to K. Henry 8. do derive, as they pretend, their eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall jurisdiction from him, and so exercise it. Indeed many of the late Bishops and their Procters, seeing how monstrous the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration is of divine things, by an humane authority and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and growing bould vpon the present disposition of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, have disclaimed that former title, and do professedly hold their eclesiasticall power and jurisdiction <hi>de jure divino,</hi> &amp; so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>What if the King should discharge and expell the present ecclesiasticall goverment, &amp; plant in stead of it the Presbytery or Eldership, would they submit vnto the government of the Elders, yea or no? if yea, then were they traytors to the Lord Iesus submitting to a goverment, overthrowing his goverment, as doth the Praesbyterian goverment, that which is Episcopall; if no, then how could they free themselves from such imputations of disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to Princes, and disturbance of States, as wherewith they load vs &amp; others opposing them.

Neyther can there be any reason given, why the merits of saynts, may not as wel be mingled with the merits of Christ for the saving of his Church, as the lawes of men with his lawes, for the ruling and guiding of it. He is as absolute and as intire a King as he is a Preist, and his people must be as carefull to praeserve the dignity of the one, as to enjoy the benefit of the other.</p>

               <p>This question is answered affirmatively, by the Bishops &amp; their<note place="margin">Ans.</note> adhaerents, and so with one voice they affirme in their books, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits and other publik determinations: but herein as palpably flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Magistrate, as ever Canonist did the Pope.

               <p>Now for <hi>the differences betwixt the best reformed Churches</hi> (as Mr B. calls them, granting thereby his owne to be the worst) <hi>and vs,</hi> they ar extant in print, being few in number, &amp; those none of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test weight. But what a volume would these differences make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt those reformed Churches, and the vnreformed Churches of England, if they were exactly set downe. And yet for the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions reproved by vs in the reformed Church where we live, I do vnderstand by them of good knowledge, and sincerity, that the most or greatest of them are rather in the exequution then in the constitution of the Church.</p>
               <p>Our differences from the reformed Churches, Mr B. aggravates by two reasons. 1.

               <p>For the first, it is not truely affirmed that we separate from them. What our judgment is of them, our confessions of fayth and other wrytings do testify; and for our practise, as we cannot possibly ioyn vnto them, would we never so fayne, being vtterly ignorant of their language; so neither do wee separate from them, save in such parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars as we esteeme evill; which we also shall endeavour to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest vnto them so to be, as occasion and meanes shalbe offered.</p>
               <p>And secondly, for the taxations layd by Mr B. and Mr G. vpon the Eldership, or other practise in the reformed Churches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were any way excessive we both have disclaimed, &amp; alwayes are and shalbe ready to disclayme the same.

               <p>The instance he brings of one of vs cyting Act. 20. 21. to prove<note place="margin">Answ</note> that all truth is not taught in the Church of England, is, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded (if not worse) mistaken by him. For who would bring Pauls example to shew what the Ministers of England do, and not rather what they should do? what they do is knowne well enough, and how both they in preaching the will of God, and the people in obeying it, are stinted at the Bishops pleasure.</p>

               <p>That the Apostle here speaketh not of the invisible, but of the visible Church, appeareth not by our bare affirmation, which we might set gaynst Mr B. naked contradiction, yea though he bring in D. Allison in the margent to countenance the matter, but by these reasons.</p>
               <p>1. Peter being <note n="â€ " place="margin">Gal. 2. 7.</note> the Apostle of the Iewes wrote vnto them whose Apostle he was, &amp; vvhom he knew dispersed through Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Galatia, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1. But Peter was not the Apostle of the invisible, but of the visible Church which he knew so disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, where the invisible Church is onely knowne unto God, 2 Tim. 2. 19.</p>
               <p>2. The Apostle vseth the words of Moses to the visible Church of the Iewes, Ex. 19. 6. which do therefore well agree to the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church vnder the gospell, whose excellency, graces and holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, do surmount the former by many degrees.</p>
               <p>3. Peter wrytes to a Church wherein were Elders and a flock depending vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> them, to be fed &amp; governed by them, 1 <hi>Pet</hi>

which to affirm of the invisible Church is not onely a visible, but even a palpable error.</p>
               <p>4. The Apostle wrytes to them which had the word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongst them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 25. And this Mr B. himselfe, pag. 118. 119. makes a note and testimony of the visible Church, and to that pupose quotes the former chap. v. 23. as he doth also this very chap. ver. 5. which is the same with v. 9. 10. to prove the form of the visible Church. And thus I hope it appeares to all men vpon what good groundes this man thus boldly leadeth vs with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptfull dealing in the scriptures. And this instance, I desire the reader the more dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tly to observe as being singled out by Mr B. as a pickt witnes against vs, &amp; countenanced by D. Allisons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring testimony, but especially because it poynts out the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Churches, clean in contrary colours to the English Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, being vnholy and prophane; and this is the cause why Mr B. and others are so loth to haue this Scripture ment of the visible Church.</p>

               <p>The difference betwixt you and them in the gathering and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting of Churches is as great as betwixt copulsive conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vnto the service book and ceremonyes, which is your estate, and voluntary submission vnto the gospell by which all &amp; every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them is ioyned to the Church, and as is betwixt the reigne of one Lord Bishop over many Churches, and the government of a Presbytery or company of Elders over one.</p>
               <p>And if you would take viewe of this difference nearer home, do but cast your eyes to your next neyghbours of Scotland &amp; there you shall see the most zealous Christians chusing rather to loose liberty, country, and life then to stoop to a far more easy yoke then you bear. Yea what need I send you out of your owne horizon? The implacable &amp; mortall hatred the Prelates bear vnto the Ministers and people wishing the government and Ministery receaved in the reformed Churches proclaymes aloud the vtter emnity betwixt them, &amp; your vnreformed Church of England, of which I pray you hear with patience what some of your own have testified. <hi>Those that will needs be our Pastors and spirituall fathers</hi>

And if this Argument be good or likely, then is it likely that neyther the reformists have the truth in the Church of England, nor the Prelates, for there are many and those both godly and learned, which in their differences do oppose, and that very vehemently the one the other.</p>
               <p>Now, as for myne owne part, I do willingly acknowledge the learning &amp; godlynes of most of the persons named by Mr B. &amp; do honour the very memory of some of them, so do I neyther think the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> so learned, but they might erre; nor so godly, but in their error they might reproch the truth they saw not.

               <p>This reverence every man stands bound to give to the graces of God in other men, that in his differences from them, he be not suddaynly nor easily perswaded, but that being iealous of his owne hart, he vndertake the examination of things &amp; so proceed, with fear, and trembling, &amp; so having tryed all things, keep that which is good. 1. Thes. 5. 21. So shall he neither wrong the graces of God in himselfe, not in others. But on the othersyde for a man so farr to suffer his thoughts to be conjured into the circle of any mortall man or mens iudgment, as eyther to feare to try what is offered to the contrary, in the ballance of the sanctuary, or fynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to bear weight, to feare to give sentence on the Lords syde, yea though it be agaynst the mighty, this is to honour men above God, and to advance a throne above the throne of Christ, who is Lord and King for ever.</p>
               <p>And to speak that in this case which by dolefull experience I my selfe have found, many of the most forward professors in the kingdome are wel nigh as superstitiously addicted to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of their guids and teachers, as the ignorant Papists vnto theyrs, accounting it not onely needles curiosity, but even intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable arrogancy to call into question the things receaved from them by tradition.</p>
               <p>But how much better were it for all men to lay asyde these &amp; the like prejudices, that so they might vnderstand the things which concern theyr peace, and seeing with theyr own eyes, might live by theyr owne fayth.</p>
               <p>And for these famous men here named by Mr B.

as they.) It will not be denyed but the fathers (as they are called) Ignatius, Irenaeus, Tertullian<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Ciprian, Ambrose, Ierom, Austin, and the rest were both godly and learned; yet no man (if he have but even saluted them) can be ignorant, what way (though vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly) they made for the advauncement of Antichrist which followed after them: And if they notwithstanding theyr learning and godlines thus vshered him into the world, why might not others (and that more likely) though learned and godly as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, help to beare vp his trayne? espcially considering, that as his rising was not, so neyther could his fall be perfected at once. And for vs, what do we more or otherwise for the most part, then walk in those wayes into which divers of the persons by Mr B. named, have directed vs by the word of God, in manifesting vnto vs by the light thereof what the ministery, goverment, worship, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of the Gospell ought to be? we then being taught, and beleeving, that the word of God is a light &amp; a lanthorne not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to our eyes, but to our feet &amp; pathes (as the psalmist speaketh) <hi>Psal. 119. 105.</hi> cannot possibly conceave how we should iustly be blamed by these men for observing the ordinances which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves not onely acknowledged, but contended for, as appoynted by Christs testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t to be kept inviolable till his appearing, as some of them have expresly testifyed.</p>
               <p>To conclude, let not the Christian reader cast our persons, &amp; the persons of our opposites whither these or others, in the balla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce together, but rather our cause, and reasons with theyr oppositions and the grounds of them, and so with a steady hand, &amp; vnpartiall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <list>
                  <item>1. The reformed Churches are gathered of a free people ioyned together by voluntary profession without compulsion of humane lawes. On the contrary the Church of England consists of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple forced together violently by the lawes of men into their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall, Diocesan and Parishionall Churches (as their houses sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d) be they never so vnwilling or unfit.</item>
                  <item>2.

               </list>
               <p>Now if Mr B. can at once walk in so many &amp; so contrary wayes, he had need have as many feet as the Polypus hath.</p>
               <p>Secondly, understanding by his Churches way such doctrines &amp; ordinances as wherein we oppose it it is an empty boast to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that the same is spread into other nations.

               </p>

               <p>But let all men learn not to behould the Church of Christ with carnall eyes, which like fearfull spyes will discourage the people, but with the eyes of fayth and good conscience, which like Ioshua and Caleb will speak good of the promised Land, the spirituall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, the Church of God.

               <p>That Mr B. may make sure work he strikes at the head, and whetteth his toung like a sword, and shooteth bitter words like arrowes at such principall men, as God hath raysed vp in this cause, whereof some have persevered, and stood fast vnto death, others have fallen away in the day of temptation, whose end hath been worse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The first person in whome he instanceth is one Boulton, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> he wryteth thus: that <hi>he being the first broacher of this way</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr B.</note> 
                  <hi>came to as fearefull an end as Iudas did:</hi> adding therevpon, <hi>that God suffereth not his speciall instruments called forth otherwise then after a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon course to come to such ends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:1037:28"/>To this I do first answer, that neither this man was nor any other<note place="margin">Answ.</note> of vs is called forth by the Lord otherwise then after a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon course: even that which is common to all Gods people, which is to come out of Babylon, and to bring theyr best gifts to Syon for the buylding of the Lords temple there.</p>
               <p>It is true that Boulton was (though not the first in this way) an Elder of a separated Church in the beginning of Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths dayes, and falling away from his holy profession recanted the same at Pauls Crosse, &amp; afterwards hung himself as Iudas did<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> And what marvayl if he which had betrayed Christ in his truth, as Iudas did in his person, came to the same fearefull end which Iudas did?</p>
               <p>Nay rather the patience and long suffering of God is to be mervayled at that others also, who eyther have embraced this truth and after faln from it, or refused to submit vnto it when they have both seen and approved it, have not been pursued by the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull hand of God. <hi>And for the promise of Gods presence with his, Gen.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>Ios.</hi> 1. 9. it must ever be taken conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, viz. whylest they are with him and do his work faythfully as they ought, and no further.</p>
               <p>Now touching Browne it is true which Mr B. affirmeth that as he forsook the Lord <hi>so the Lord forsook</hi> him in his way: and so he did his owne people Israel many a tyme. And if the Lord had not forsaken him he had never so returned back into Egypt as he did to live of the spoyles of it, as is sayd he speaketh.</p>
               <p>And for the <hi>wicked things</hi> (which Mr B. affirmeth) <hi>he did in this way,</hi> it may well be as he sayth<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and the more wicked things he committed in this course, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Of Mr Barrow and Mr Greenwoods spirit of rayling (as this man rayleth against them) in another place.

               <p>Now for the things objected, it is first to be noted how Mr B. affirmeth, that <hi>none with them eyther truely fearing God, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

How then are all of them saynts by calling, and where is that profession of faith for which they are to be held true members of the Church? And what detestable crimes the members of the Church of England fall into, (if there were none other testimony) the very gallowes, &amp; gibbets in every country declare sufficiently, vpon which for treason, witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, incest, buggery, rape, murders and the like, the members of that Church (so living and dying) do receive condigne punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t: Where with vs if any such enormities arise (as what temptations have befallen any we are subiect unto the same) those monsters (without their answerable repentance) are by the power of Christ cut of from the body, &amp; do for the most part returne to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per element the English synagogue.</p>
               <p>But what if all were true which Mr B. avoucheth, what advantage hath he more against vs then the heathen Corinthians had against the Church there, where <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 1.</note> such fornication was found, as was not once named among the Gentiles?</p>

               <p>Mr B. having thus handled (as you see) some particular, and principall persons, proceeds to set vpon the whole body in general, as if with the accuser of the brethren he had obteyned liberty to strike the same from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot with the boyles and borches of reproch: &amp; therefore writeth that<note place="margin">Mr B.</note> 
                  <hi>If men be but inclinable to this way, they iudge the Minister to have lost the power of his Ministery, wherein the fault is in the alteration of their owne affections, and if they be once entered into it, they are then so bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as that where before they were humble and tractable, they then become proud and wilfull, where before they could with vnderstanding discern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt cause and cause, they then lick vp all that comes from themselves as Oracles though never so absurd, where before they could feel in themselves lively markes of the children of God, &amp; so iudge of others, they then are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded against former fayth to think that neyther themselves had, nor others have any outward markes of the children of God.</hi>

               <p>Let the reader here observe in the first place that Mr B. accounts<note place="margin">Ans.</note> all them <hi>inclinable to this way</hi> which dislike comformity &amp; subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Ministers; for them onely D.

               <p>To the chalenge of pryde and wilfulnes vpon them in this way though before they were humble and tractable I do answer, that as true humility is ever commendable so is there also a sinful sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection and submission of mynd, by which spirituall tyrants accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theyr fleshly wisdom in volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tary religion would rule over the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sciences of the simple, of which the Apostle warneth vs, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 18. which superstitious humility or humble superstition if the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God begin to shake of &amp; to stand for that liberty so dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bought by Christ, and so highly commended by the Apostles of Christ, then begin these imperious Maysters to rage, thinking by reproches to compell them againe under that subiection, in which by former delusions they could not conteyn them.

Thus dealt the bloody Bishops with the servants of God in Queen Maries dayes, calling them proud, wilfull, conceyted, &amp; what evill not? and very well do the like accusations become Mr B. mouth in the like case.</p>
               <p>Whether our opinions (which we are charged by Mr B. to lick vp as Oracles) be absurd or no, will appeare in the discussing of them in the sequell of the book: in the mean whyle this is most true and vndeniable, that a great part of the splene vttered against vs in this invective grew from this very cause, that sundry of his hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And why not he as well in refusing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church of Rome where these things are to be found, as we in disclayming the Church of Engl. where the same and other the like good things are known to be?</p>
               <p>Thus when a mans eyes are blynded, by partiality towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and his mouth opened by mallice against his adversary, it is mervaylous to see what vnequall judgment he will passe.</p>
               <p>But least Mr B. in charging <hi>our beginning</hi> (as he doth) as <hi>accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, vncharitable, vnnaturall, and vngodly,</hi> might seeme to curse where God curseth not, he annexeth certayn portions of scripture, which he also sets downe at large, as though they made largely against vs, and our separation, and the end why he alleadgeth them is to prove that there is cause of reioycing in the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. The scriptures are these. <hi>Rom. 15. 17. 18. Act. 10. 34. 35. Rom. 14. 17. 18.</hi> To which I do answer first in generall.</p>
               <p>There may be &amp; oft tymes is cause of reioycing in the events and issues of things by a speciall hand of God determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, though the secundary meanes and instruments which the Lord vseth for the producing, and bringing forth of these is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues &amp; events (as of light out of darknes) be most accursed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in more, or els, hath a christian heart cause of reioycing then in the death of Christ? And yet what can be imagined more abominable then the meanes and instruments of working it.</p>
               <p>But to speak nearer Mr B. purpose. If some Iesuite, or other, sent by the Pope into America amongst the Pagans and Infidels, should there perswade any to beleeve &amp; confesse one God, and his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1037:34"/>
sonne Iesus Christ made man for the redemption of the world, &amp; that they should also give vp their lives for these truthes, there were cause of reioycing in theyr testimony, and yet I suppose Mr B. (knowing as he doth) would be loath to have communion in the Iesuits Ministery. More particularly. The Apostle Rom. 15. 17 18. in commendation of his Apostleship layes downe the effects of it and how great cause of reioycing he had, that God by his ministery had planted the Churches of the Gentiles whom he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther describes by theyr obedience in word and deed.</p>
               <p>And how serves this for the Church of England? Thus. It serves first to exclude all those word Saynts for whom Mr B. pleads so much in his book.</p>
               <p>Secondly it serves to shew what small cause there is of reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the English Churches being planted of such vniversally &amp; so still continuing as are indeed abhominable and disobedient, &amp; to every good work reprobate.</p>
               <p>The second Scripture is Act. 10. 34. 35. <hi>Of a truth I perceave that God is no accepter of persons, but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousnes is accepted of him.</hi> And is it so?</p>
               <p>What sacrilegious presumption then is it in the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to compell God to accept of persons, and to accept for his people &amp; servants such as neither fear him, nor work righteousnes but the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>trary? to offer vp theyr persons &amp; sacrifices to him in the name of Christ in whome they have no portion? to seale vp the covenant of his grace and peace vnto them in the sacraments with whom it never came into his hart to strike hand, neyther hath he peace with them?</p>
               <p>The third Scripture is Rom. 14. 17. 18. <hi>The kingdome of God is not meat, not drink, but righteousnes, and peace and ioy in the Holy G. for whosoever in those things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence (to let passe the drift of the Apostle in this place els where opened) thus much must necessarily follow, that where righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and peace, and ioy in the Holy Ghost are not, nor men in those things serving Christ, there the kingdome of God is not, nor these men his subiects. And where Gods kingdom is not, there is the kingdome of Satan, and they that are not the subiects of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1037:34"/>
one, are the slaves of the other. And so I leave it to the godly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to iudge whither the assemblyes in England gathered at the first, and at this day consisting of such persons for the most part as do not thus nor in these things viz: righteousnes peace and ioy in the Holy Ghost serue Christ, but the contrary, can be rightly &amp; by the word of God accounted the kingdome of God &amp; Church of Christ. Thus the 3. Scriptures which Mr B. stretched out like a threfold coard to hold men in the assemblies, are in truth and in their right meaning as a three stringed whip to scourge those that fear God out of them.</p>

               <p>And for the concluding of this point, I would onely demaund of Mr B. whether those <hi>godly ministers</hi> whom he brings in pag. 130 to bear down all before them, be not of that company which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuse to be silenced by the Prelates, yea &amp; so perswade others also, then to submit to their ceremonies, &amp; subscription.

               <p>Now for the preaching of the word and gospell of salvation, as Mr B. doth but worthily and according to the excellency of it, magnify and advance the same, so doth he most iniuriously, and deceiptfully oppose it vnto the holy order within which the Lord hath rainged it, and to the true constitution of the Church and other the ordinances thereof, with which it consorteth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily by the Lords appoyntment, and so they make together a most heavenly harmony. And thus to set the ordinances of Christ at iarre amongst themselves, and in the commendation of one principall to bury the rest as vile, and vnnecessary, is a most effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall delusion, and deep deceipt, by which the mistery of iniquity is much advantaged in the false assemblyes, and the hearts of the simple fast held in the snares of error, and impiety.</p>
               <p>The Bishops &amp; those of their sect do in their sermons &amp; writings extoll prayer. But to what end? That they may depresse preaching, and oppresse preachers, and so establish theyr service-saying Preists in the Ministery.</p>
               <p>Mr. B. here, and so the forward sorte commonly will magnify preaching: but as he here, so they oft tymes with an evill ey to the right gathering, lawfull goverment, and orderly administration of the holy things of &amp; in the church.

               </p>
               <p>And for the preaching of the gospel would Mr B. but turne his eye a litle upon himself, and his nationall Church, he might finde that every text brought by him for the advancement of preaching<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> is as a sworn evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce both against himself, &amp; the Church for which he pleads.</p>

               <p>But to the very poynt which Mr B. drives at. There is not one scripture alledged by him which iustifyes the preaching of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell out of a true (much lesse in a false) constitution. They do all and every one of them necessarily presuppose the same, howsoever he would separate the things which God hath ioyned together. Take one for example and that such a one, as he makes a pillar in his building. It is written and so by him alledged, <hi>Psa. 147. 19. 20. He shewed his word vnto Iacob, his statutes and his iudgments vnto Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell: He hath not so dealt with every nation, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Here</hi> (sayth Mr B.) <hi>the Lord preferrs his word before a constitution, as a testimony of his speciall love.</hi> But vntruly. For in this very place the Lord prefers a constitution before his word, statutes, and iudgments as the cause why he gave them. For wherefore did the Lord <hi>shew his word vnto Iaakob, his statutes &amp; iudgments vnto Israel,</hi> but because of their constitution? that is, because Israel was the Lords peculiar people separated from all other nations, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Lord into covenant, as no other nation was.

               <p>Indeed no man can challendge Mr B. &amp; his Church of Worx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sop for any such heady and rash excommunications, they are very moderate this way, and can beare in communion with them any graceles person whomsoever til his dying day, and then commit ful charitably the body of their deceased brother to the grave, with a devout prayer for his joyfull resurrection: so charitable are they both to the living and the dead.</p>

               <p>And for corruptions in the Apostolical Churches it is true the Apostles mentioned them, but allwayes with vtter dislike, severe reproof, and streight charge of reforming them. Rom. 16. 17. 1 Cor. 5. 1. 6. 7. 11â€”13. 1 Thes. 5. 14. 2 Thes. 3. 6. 1 Tim. 6. 5. Rev. 2. 14â€”16. 20.</p>
               <p>But how do these things concern you? Though Paul, and all the Apostles of Christ with him, yea though Christ himself from heaven should admonish any of your Churches to put away from among themselves any person though never so haeretical or flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1037:42"/>
you could not do it, neither could you reform any abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination otherwhere, though the same be as conspicuous as the <note n="*" place="margin">2 Chron. 26. 20.</note> leprosy of Vzziah which brake forth in his forehead. And this want of the power of the Lord Iesus for reformation, which an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man would think were an intollerable slavery Mr B. pag 68. turnes to good advantage, and thinks himself &amp; his Church halfe excused of all the evils which are amongst them, because they want power to vse the remedy: thus pleading for a priveledg the mark of the beast, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> which the servants of God ought to abhor, herin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing passing witty above other men in making an advantage of that evill, which the most have enough to do to excuse.</p>
               <p>And for true Churches not vsing aright the power they have for reformation, they are like true bodyes which through some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, or stoppings for a time cannot voyd things noxious, &amp; hurtful till there be a remedy: but the Church without this power is as a monstrous body wanting the faculties &amp; instruments of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuation and expulsion of excrements, or other noy some things<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and therefore is never appointed of God to live, but devoted to death and destruction?</p>
               <p>Of the reformed Churches &amp; our cariage towards them I have spoken els where, and for your Turkish Argument in the margent wherein you incense the Magistrate against vs, as otherwise incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible, it well becomes the rest of your book joyning violence to slaunder. But are you your self wholly conformable Mr B? If not, why do you incense the magistrate against vs being your selfe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to his displeasure? Or do you not hope to escape persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion your self by persecuting vs? This is too ordinary a practise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you. But the Lord seeth your haulting, and rewardeth you in your bosomes, as you have served vs. And when you and others more forward then you do consider &amp; feel in what hatred you are with the King and state, me thinks your harts should smite you, as the harts of Iosephs brethren did them in their trouble for their barbarous crueltie towards him. Gen. 42.</p>

               <p>And if Mr B. himselfe thus wryte and speak in private, why blames he vs for our publique testimony?</p>
               <p>Now if the Bishops be Antichristian and so the spirit of Divils Rev. 16. 14. why might not Mr Barrow affirm <hi>theyr Ministery and ministration to be of and by the Divill?</hi> and what are they but eyther <hi>the tayl, or some</hi> other lim <hi>of the beast?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for theyr <hi>excommunications</hi> by name, it is evident by this they are not of God, for that the most religious in the kingdome make least account of them.</p>

               <p>And for <hi>the Bible in the Bishops hands</hi> which he gives his Preists in ordination, Mr Barrow calls it <hi>the libell</hi> not in contempt of the book, but in reproof of the ceremony, &amp; that iustly since the Lord never appointed the scriptures for any such vse, nor any such cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in the ordination of his Ministers. Christ, and the Apostles would have such Ministers ordeyned as have the Bibles in their hearts: the Bishops of England to supply this want give it into the hands of their Preists which they think sufficient, though in truth the most of them are more vsed to handle a paire of cardes vpon an alebench, then the holy bible.</p>

                  <hi>Your Patrons</hi> Mr Barrow calles <hi>great Baals, &amp; Lord Patrons;</hi> and iustly in respect of that Lordly power they vse in obtruding their Clerks vpon the Parish assemblies: your <hi>ministers yea all and every one of them Preists,</hi> which is their proper name given them both in your book of ordination, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon prayer: your <hi>Deacons half-preists</hi> according to the nature of their office, betwixt which &amp; the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons office in the new testament, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 1. 2. 3. 4. there is no consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude.</p>
               <p>For the other more harsh termes wherewith he enterteynes such persons and things in the Church as carry with them most appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of holynes, they are to be interpreted according to his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and a distinction vsed by Mr B. in <note n="â€ " place="margin">pag. 79.</note> another place is here to be applyed.

               </p>
               <p>But first it is not true that any thing may be condemned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this sort. The constitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of the Ch: Apostolike could in no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

               <p>Secondly, the constitution even of Rome (as now it stands) is not simply false, but onely in this &amp; that respect.

               <p>To come nearer the matter. The constitution of the Church is the orderly collection and coniunction of the sayncts into &amp; in the covenant of the new Testament: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The word (saith he) is the constitution of the Church: His mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, or should be at the least, that the word is the ordinary out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meanes for the collecting, and constituting of the Church of God<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> I graunt it.

               <p>But what wilbe the conclusion of all these premises?</p>
               <p>The Proposition is this. The true Apostolick Churches ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a true constitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> were gathered &amp; constituted of such men and women as by the preaching of the gospel were made disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, had faith and repentance wrought in them to the obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the forgivenes of sinns, &amp; promise of life eternall and to sanctification and obedience.</p>
               <p>Now though my logick be not much better then yours Mr B. yet since my cause is, I will help you with an assumption or 2. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
               <p>But the Church of England was not so gathered after Popery, but on the contrary without preaching of the gospel, &amp; of men &amp; women for the most part ignorant, faythles mispenitent diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> no promise of the forgivenes of sinns, &amp; life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ynes: whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>clusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> necessarily followeth, that the constitution of the Church of England is not true or Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, but false counterfeyt and apostaticall.</p>
               <p>Secondly the scriptures (sayth Mr B.) make externall professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the visible constitution of the Church. His meaning must be, that profession of faith is required of such persons of yeres before they be admitted into the visible Church. Which truth the place cited by him Act. 8. 12. 37. 38. doth iustify, to which one place many other may be added to the same purpose, as Act. 10. 46. &amp; &amp; 16. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>4, &amp; 18. 8.</p>
               <p>But what is the Church of Worxsop better for this? what profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of faith did the particular members make, when at the first of an Antichristian Synagogue (as in Popery it was), it became or was constituted a true Christian Church? was not the house built at the first as it is at this day repayred? Let a man but hire a house within the precincts of your parish, &amp; he is a ioyned member in your Ch: <hi>ipso facto,</hi> though he cannot manifest the least kernel of faith, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, yea though he professe himself an atheist, horetick, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this very excommunication shewes him to have been a member of you, for onely a brother is to be excommunicated, <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 15. 16. 17 and onely he that was within, may be cast out, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. 13.</p>
               <p>And here, as before I will help to form your argument.</p>
               <p>The members of the Apostolick Church which were truely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted were admitted by their personall profession of faith, and confession of sin, <hi>Math.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 37. 38. <hi>and</hi> 10. 46. &amp; 16. 14. &amp; 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>. &amp; 19. 18.</p>
               <p>But the members of the Engl. assemblies neyther were nor are so admitted, but according to the parish perambulation whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver impiety they professe.</p>
               <p>Therefore their constitution is proved false by the evidence brought to iustify it.</p>
               <p>Lastly for the sacraments, as they are not the constitution of the Church, but do necessarily presuppose a Church constituted vnto which they are committed as <note n="â€ " place="margin">Act. 7. 38. Rom. 9. 4.</note> the oracles and ordinances of God vnto Israel, so is not the Church of England the Israel of God, the seed of Abraham, a peculiar people unto the Lord, but a mingled seed, as Ezra, 9. 1. 2. uncapable of the sacraments the seales of the covenant of grace. And the places Mr B. brings forth are so far from iustifying the constitution of the Church of England by the sacraments, as they do most notably evince the prophanation of the sacraments by the Church.</p>
               <p>The two places are Mat. 28. 19. 1 Cor. 10. 16. In the former the Lord Iesus sends his Apostles first to teach, or make men disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and then to baptise them (including the children in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents according to the covenant made with Abraham into which the gentiles were in their time to be gathered. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. 1, 2. 13. 14. &amp; 3. 6.) But on the contrary the Lord Bishops in Engl. having found a readier way send out their parrish priests to baptise all before them that are borne in their parishes, whether their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents be taught or vntaught, the disciples of Christ or of antichrist, and the Divil, not passing by the children of recusant Papists &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers refusing all communion with them, whose children they use to baptize by force, &amp; against the will of their Parents, as I could prove (if need were) by sundry instances.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:1037:47"/>And is not here an orderly constitution, and a Church truely ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by the sacrament of baptisme?</p>
               <p>Now 1 Cor. 10. 16. the Apostle teacheth that the bread and wine in the supper are the communion of the body and blood of Christ, that is effectuall pledges of our conjunction, and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with Christ, and one with another: and in the 17. vers. that all which eat of one bread, or one loaf, are one mysticall body. This place alone if Mr B. and his fellow ministers would seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consider and set themselves faithfully to observe they would rather offer their owne bodies to be torn in peices by wilde beasts, then the holy misteries of Christs body to be prophaned, as they are.</p>
               <p>And here as formerly I will help the Arguments raysed from the scriptures produced by Mr B. and some other of the same kinde into form thus.</p>
               <p>The sacrament of baptisme is to be administred by Christs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and the Apostles example onely to such as are (viz externally and so far as men can judge) taught and made disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. do receive the word gladly, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 41. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and so professe <hi>Ch.</hi> 8. 12. 13. 37. have received the holy Ghost <hi>Ch.</hi> 10. 47. and to their seed. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14.</p>
               <p>But baptisme in Engl. is ministred by a far larger commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion then Christs: though there be in the parents neyther ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of faith nor holynes, if in stead of them they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure godfathers and godmothers to cary the children to the font (yea will they nil they) the parrish priest hath commission to make them Christian soules every mothers childe of them, borne within his parrish precincts. And therefore the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism in Engl. is not Christs baptisme in the administration of it.</p>
               <p>For the Lords supper the Apostle sayth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. that the bread and wine sanctifyed to that purpose is the communion, that is, an effectuall symbole or pledge of that communion which the receivers have with Christ. Wherevpon I do turne the point of this scripture into the bowels of the Church of Engl. thus.</p>
               <p>That which ioynes such men in communion with Christ as by his expresse word he excludes from all communion with him, that is so far from being the true constitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of the Church
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1037:47"/>
as it shewes both an vnholy confusion in the Church and a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent prophanation of the ordinance by it.</p>
               <p>But the supper as it is ministred in the Parish-assemblies, (as they were at the first, &amp; still are clapt together) ioynes them with Christ with whom he expresly disclaymes all communion &amp; fellowship as their practise compared with these scriptures doth make manifest to all men. 2 Cor. 6. 14. 15. 1 Ioh. 1. 6. Ergo.</p>
               <p>So that baptisme and the Lords supper are amongst you Mr B. and in your hands &amp; handling, but as the holy vessels of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Babylon &amp; there togeither with the Lords people deteyned by frawd and violence.</p>

               <p>And where Mr B. affirms this to be <hi>contrary to the course of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scriptures never taking Idol in this sense, because neyther he nor Marlorat finds the word Idol so vsed,</hi> he must know it is as impossible for eyther him, or Marl. or any other man to enumerate or reckon vp all the Idols wherof the scriptures speak, though not in expresse terms yet by iust co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sequence &amp; proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>) as to number all the creatures in heaven and in earth, yea all the workes of mens hands, yea all the thoughts of their harts, for all these may and do in some abuse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Idols.</p>
               <p>And that we may better discern whether there be a like truth and boldnes in this assertion that <hi>the scriptures never take idol in this sense,</hi> let vs consider and compare together a few places.</p>
               <p>The Lord commaunded Moses, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. &amp; 26. &amp; 27. to make the tabernacle and sanctuary of the Lord for the place of his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and worship, and to this end did appoint both the matter<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and form of the whol work even to the least pin: &amp; if Moses had

framed it, eyther of other matter, or of the same matter after an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fashion, had not this forgery and devise for the worship of God been a reall, sensible, and palpable Idoll, a sinn against the second Commaundement which forbids nothing but Idolatry? It cannot be denyed. Hence it followeth that the constitution or frame of the tabernacle or temple of the new testament, which is the visible Church 2 Cor. 6. 16. if it be other eyther in matter or form (as yours is in both) is a reall and substantiall Idoll. Secondly Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianism is Idolatry, and is in that respect called <note n="â€ " place="margin">Rev. 118. and 14. 8.</note> Babylon, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Egypt spiritually, so Antichristians are sayd <note n="*" place="margin">Ch. 14. 9.</note> to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the beast: now a devised constitution, frame and fabrick of the Church is a part of antichristianism, &amp; of the apostasy of Antichrist &amp; therefore a reall Idol: and as Mr Smyth truely affirmeth a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Idoll then eyther the Antichristian ministery or worship.

And lastly the Church being the end of the ordinances, Mar. 2. 27. 28. is more excellent then they being true, and being false a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable Idoll then any of them.</p>

               <p>It is with you in this case as it was sometimes with Rechum &amp; Shimshay who making a shew as though they would have built the temple Zerubbabel (but not being the men to whom this work appertayned) laboured afterwards to hinder &amp; discourage him, &amp; the Iewes with him whom it did concerne.

               <p>Once you know Mr B. you did separate from the rest an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred voluntary professors into covenant with the Lord, sealed vp with the Lords supper, to forsake all knowne sinn, to hear no wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked or dumb Ministers, and the like, which covenant long since you have dissolved, not shaming to affirme you did it onely in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy

There never entred into my hart a thought, nor passed a word out of my mouth so contumelious against the true &amp; orderly constitution of Christs Church: though I have (and that worthily) disliked, (as I stil doe) that hard &amp; rash censure passed by some vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the persons of such as of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the Lord by the evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t work of his spirit gives a better tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony.</p>
               <p>And for the poynt in hand, I am perswaded and so professe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all men that I see not by the revealed will of God in his word how to iudge otherwise of any ordinance of the Church, or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of communion out of a true constituted Church then of the sacrifices out of the tabernacle or temple, within whose circle they were concluded by the word of God.</p>

               <p>The Lord protesteth <hi>Is.</hi> 1. that Israel did <hi>rebel against him,</hi> that they <hi>did not vnderstand,</hi> but were a most <hi>sinfid nation,</hi> yea as <hi>Sodom &amp; Gomorrah,</hi> and yet he calls them <hi>children &amp; his people.</hi> v. 1. 2. 3. 4. 10. yea passing Sodom in iniquity, and yet the <hi>daughter of his people,</hi> &amp; daughter Zion, Lam. 4. 6. 22.

               <p>The third scripture is 1 Cor. 1. 1.</p>
               <p>Paul wrytes there onely to visible Churches, to the Church of Corinth primarily and so by proportion to all other visible Churches in the world, for to them alone the censures, sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, prophesying, and other matters there handled, do apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne. 1 Cor. 5. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. and 11. 20. and 14. 4. 5.</p>
               <p>The brother spoken of in the fourth and last place which is 2 Th. 3. 15. was a member of the visible Church and subiect of Christs kingdome, though walking inordinately in his calling as appeareth, v. 11. and therefore to be discountinanced and made ashamed by the Church that he might the more faythfully apply himselfe to his busines.</p>

               <p>The Apostle 1 Cor. 5. reproves the Church for tolerating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them the incestuous person vncensured, charging them to vse the power of the Lord Iesus given vnto them, for that purpose, and that as vpon him for the present, so vpon other notorious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders at other times.

And this limitation of the power of Christ to the proper obiect, he sets downe in this 12. verse, affirmatively, to them that are within,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1037:49"/>
and negatively, to them that are without. From this place then I do thus reason.</p>
               <p>They that are within are subiect to the power of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication by the Church gathered together in the name of Christ, they without not.</p>
               <p>But you Mr B. and so of the rest, are not subiect to the judgement of the Church thus gathered together, but to the Archbishop of York, Who is not the Church of Workxsop.</p>
               <p>Therefore you are not within but without in the Apostles meaning.</p>
               <p>The second place we apply against you is, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. 12. whence I reason thus.</p>
               <p>They that are aliants and straungers from the common wealth of Israel, are without.</p>
               <p>But such are you, and your whole parrish.</p>
               <p>Ergo.</p>
               <p>The first Proposition is the Apostles words: for to be without Christ (as there he speakes) and to be a stranger from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon wealth of Israel, is all one.</p>
               <p>The second Proposition is thus confirmed.</p>
               <p>The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon wealth of Israel was a religious policy consisting of a peculiar people, of whom every one was by the word of God se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated into the covenant of his mercy <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10. 11. 12. 13. <hi>Neh.</hi> 10. 1. 28. 29.</p>
               <p>But to affirme that every person in the Church of England, or in any parish Church is admitted by the Lord into the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or testament, is both against the expresse word of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. and his owne conscience (I am perswaded) that affirmed it.</p>
               <p>And thus so long as you keep your standing, you must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to stand without in the meaning of the Apostle in the places forenamed, neither can you wrythe in your self, or corrupt these places to get in by them, though you give sundry attempts. as</p>

            <div type="section">
               <p>You object secondly, <hi>that this makes that David, Iehoshaphat,</hi>

               <p>I do answer to the exception, first that you cannot prove the holy men you name to haue sinned in all the particulars wherwith you charge them, as Moyses in tolerating the bill of divorcement which you injuriously affirm he allowed, much lesse can you prove they were convinced of sin in suffering these things, and yet suffred them. Nay is it not your owne doctrine, that grace, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in sin without repentance cannot stand together? But what countenance doe the infirmities of these holy men give to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and graceles multitude against whom we deal? and whom alone we cast out of the account of Saincts? with what conscience
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1037:53"/>
or colour can any man bring in the infirmities of Moses, David, and Iehoshaphat to plead the Saintship of all that godles crew in the English assemblies?</p>
               <p>And for the Churches of Corinth, &amp; Thyatira, eyther they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent vpon admonition, though not at the first, or els the Lord in his time discharged them, as he threatned in the same, &amp; the like cases. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5. 16. 21. 22. &amp; 3. 15. 16.</p>

               <p>The third exception is that <hi>the scriptures we bring are places speaking</hi>

               <p>It cannot be manifested that we bring one scripture meant of<note place="margin">Answ.</note> the invisible Church, to prove the holynes of the visible Church.

               <p>In the 4. place you come to speak of this saint-ship in question negatively, and affirmatively.

               <p>And thus much of your respects of Sainct-ship whereof some are not true in themselves, others impertinent to your estate, and the most flatly condemning it.</p>
               <p>And though you Mr B. say it never so oft, and all <hi>the divines in the world with you</hi> (as here you speak) that the <hi>visible Church is a mixt company</hi> (as your very owne book of Articles affirms the contrary, describing the Church to be a company of faithfull people) yet do the divine scriptures speak otherwise, which I will clearly manifest, and therein also free the Parable, Math. 13. which you bring in for proofes, from that violence, which you and others offer them: forcing Christ clean against his will to plead for Antichrist. And with the scriptures I do affirme against you, that the Church of Christ is no such mingled meslyne, or monstrous compound, but a body simple, vniform, &amp; one, proportionable in every me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ber vnto the head, informed by one spirit, and called in one hope, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
               <p>And for wicked, and vngodly persons so farr are they from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true naturall members whereof the body consisteth, as the whol of the parts, as they serve indeed for no other purpose then to infect, and corrupt the rest, and if redresse be not had in time, to eat out the very hart of the whole.</p>
               <p>But before I come to the point in controversy, I will lay down two cautions for the preventing of errour in the simple, &amp; of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in such as desire to contend.</p>
               <p>First it must be considered, that where the quaestion is about<note place="margin">I.</note> the visible or externall Church which is by men discernable, and not of that Church which is internall and invisible, which onely the Lord knoweth, we speak here of visible and externall holynes onely, whereof men may judge, and not of that which is within and hid from mans ey. For we doubt not but the purest Ch: vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> earth may consist of good and bad in Gods ey, of such as are true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faythfull, and sanctifyed, &amp; of such as have onely for a tyme put on the outside and vizard of sanctity, which the Lord will in due tyme pluck of, though in the mean while mans dim sight cannot pearce through it.</p>
               <p>2. I desire it may be reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>bred that the question betwixt Mr B.<note place="margin">II.</note>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:1037:56"/>
and me is about the true and naturall members whereof the Ch: is orderly gathered and planted, and not about the degenerate &amp; decayed estate of the Church &amp; members; for we know that <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Is. 1. 2. 21. 22. Ier. 2. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>children may become rebellious, the faithful city an harlot, the silver drosse, and the wyne corrupt with water: the noble vine so planted whose plants were all naturall, may degenerate into the plantes of a strange vine.</hi> But as it were fond Phylosophy, in the description of wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and their true &amp; naturall properties, to make rebellion a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a child, because many children prove rebels against their parents, or to make whoredome a property of a wife, because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wives prove vnfaithful that way, so is it as prophane divinity to make vngodly persons the true matter of the Church, &amp; their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanenes a true property of the same, because many seeming saynts at the first do so creep in, and do afterwards discover their owne shame, &amp; are oft times through want of zeal too long tolerated in the Church, to the dishonour of God &amp; prejudice of the gospel.</p>
               <p>And so I come to manifest by an induction of particulars, that all the visible Churches gathered and planted by the Lords line &amp; level fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the beginning of the world were in their collection &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, simple, vniform, and vnmixt, consisting of good alone in the respect in hand.</p>
               <p>And first the Lord created a Church of Angels in heaven, which wer all good &amp; holy without mixture, til <note n="â€ " place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 4 Iude, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>some by sin fell fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> their first and originall estate, &amp; so leaving their own habitation were cast down to hel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After that God created a Church of mankind in Paradise, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of two persons both holy &amp; good. And thus the Churches of creation were gathered of angels and men without mixture.</p>
               <p>Now if any man object that in these instances I fetch my begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings too farr of, my answer is that the Lord had, &amp; hath the same ends and respects in the creating &amp; restoring of his Ch: which are his own glory &amp; their happines. And if it were the will of the Lord that persons notoriously wicked should be admitted into the Ch: then should he ditectly crosse himself &amp; his own ends, &amp; should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive into the visible covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t of grace such as wer out of the visible estate of grace, &amp; should plant such in his Church for the glory of his name, as served for none other vse then to cause his name to be blasphemed<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Hereupon I frame an Argument thus.</p>

                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:1037:58"/>And now I will come to the two parables, Mat. 13. with which as with two mighty Engines Mr B. &amp; others, will needs push over the partition wall of separation of the saynts from the world, of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes from unrighteousnes, of light from darknes, of Christ from Beliall, of the beleevers from the vnbeleevers.</p>
               <p>And for ingresse into the exposition of these two parables of the field and draw nett, I do desire it may be considered, that for the atteyning of the right sense of the scriptures we must remember to interpret the more dark and obscure places by places more playne and easy; and so parables being dark speaches, and more hardly vnderstood without expresse exposition, Mat. 13. 10. 11. Mark, 4. 11, 12, are not to expound playne rules, but to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by them. Which proviso alone being observed might stand in stead of all answer to whatsoever out of these perverted parables could be objected.</p>
               <p>The point is, Mr B. following (I confesse) the most beaten way, makes the field the visible Church, and the tares scandalous offenders, seen and discovered. Wherevpon it must follow, that as the Lord forbids the servants to meddle with the tares, or with the plucking them vp, but will haue them, &amp; the wheat to grow together in the feild till the harvest, so both ministers and people are str<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The venemous weeds, the noysome tares, (Idolaters, hereticks, covetous persons, blasphemers and all) whose nature is to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread and choak the wheat, must be suffred still to grow with it.

casting down of every thing exalting it self against the knowledge of God is not onely weakened, but even disanulled by this vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exposition, that tares, that is, notorious offenders must still be suffred to grow in the feild, the Church.</p>
               <p>And if the parable be thus meant, hovv can it be defended that any Church should cast out any offenders whomsoever? how dare the Prelates in Engl: with their substitutes take this forbidden weedhook into their hands, &amp; vse it against any tare amongst them? if any tares be to be plucked vp, why not all? &amp; if all be to be let alone, why med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle they with any? Indeed I must needs acknowledge &amp; will not wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>g them, that if they should execute their owne canons, as they have framed them, they should not very oft practise against this expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, nor gather the tares fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> among the wheat, but the wheat fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> amongst the tares. But to proceed. It may be some wil answer, that Christ doth not here absolutely forbid his disciples the vse of the Censures against the wicked, but rather acquaints the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> before ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d what wilbe the estate of the Ch: &amp; how the wicked wilbe suffred to continue in it vncen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured. And if this were so it made nothing against me, nor for Mr B: it were the Churches sin so to suffer them, &amp; I deny not but Churches vsually are to negligent &amp; remisse, through want of zeal &amp; faithfulnes to the Lord in this duty. But it is plain the Lord Iesus layes a flat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition against the weeding out of these tares, &amp; expresly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maunds to let them alone: &amp; this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t also he backes with two sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial reasons, the first <hi>least they pluck vp the wheat with the tares.</hi> v. 29: the 2. because the Lord hath appointed another time, <hi>the tyme of the harvest for the plucking them out,</hi> v. 30. Now some being ashamed of the grosnes, &amp; in deed of the iniquity of this exposition, would fayne moderate &amp; qualify the matter, by turning it off to these &amp; these sinns, &amp; sinners. Some say that by the tares are meant the ministers onely, &amp; that they are not to be medled with, though they transgresse, least the wheat be plucked vp with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>: as though the Lord would have the persons of men respected in judgement: yea verily there is more need to look to them in such cases, then to any private me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>bers whomsoever, as whose sinns are more displeasing vnto God, more scandalous to them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, &amp; more pernitious to the Church then of any others. Some again wil have this prohibitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> onely to take place, when the multitude of the offenders is so great, as that they cannot be censured without
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1037:59"/>
danger of schisme, and distraction, as though the multitude of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders should priveledge the offence, and as though the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus by his power given to his Church; 1 Cor. 5. 4. should fear to meddle with them for their multitude, and might, as David feared to meddle with the <hi>sonnes of Zeruiah,</hi> because they <hi>were too hard for him.</hi> The Apostle sayth, (speaking of the incestious man) that<note n="â€ " place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 6.</note>

                  <hi>little leaven leaveneth the whole lump:</hi> how much more a great deal, which makes all more sower.</p>
               <p>And for answer to both, it is apparant the Lord here forbidds the rooting out of any tares whither fewer or more in number, whither of high or low growth.</p>
               <p>Let men then cease to draw in by the hayr of the head these pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables for the tolerating of the wicked in the Church: (an intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wickednes) as most prejudicial to the<note n="*" place="margin">Isa. 52. 5. Rom. 2. 24.</note>

                  <hi>holy converversation</hi> of the Church should be provoked to the love of the truth.</p>
               <p>These things being thus cleared, I come in the next place to the true and naturall exposition, which (I doubt not) these scriptures will well bear.</p>
               <p>I do then find two interpretations, eyther of both (I am assured) more agreable to the truth, then this forced glosse by me co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>futed, and neyther of them conteyning in it any thing which the words of the Parable will not beare, or which is dissonant to the analogy of faith or any other scripture.</p>
               <p>First admit the feyld be the Church which Christ expounds the world, then say I, by tares in the feild are meant not notorious offenders, but hypocrites, not so throughly discovered, which by the envy of Satan are foysted into the Church. It wilbe sayd that tares are easily discerned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> wheat: I answer not alwayes so, though oakes may, as one of your owne hath spoken upon this scripture:<note place="margin">Mr Cartw.</note> and it is certainly reported by such as have travayled Iury &amp; those parts, to which the Lord hath reference, that the weeds we call tares are there very hardly discerned from the true wheat. If it
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1037:59"/>
be further pressed that the tares are espied, I do further answer, that it is in parables both curiosity and danger to labour to make all partes meet in every particular: and since this particular of spying the tares is omitted by Christ in the exposition wee may well be modest in it. But let it be that the tares are seen (as the words are) the question is who those servants are espying them, and so desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to have them rooted out. These servants may well be some speciall persons in the Church endued with a singular spirit of watchfulnes, and discerning, by which they do discover in some persons this tarish disposition vnder the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ayl of holynes: so Paul spied out that bitter root of <hi>envy,</hi> and pride, by which some were<note place="margin">Phil. 1<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 15. 16.</note> set a work <hi>to preach Christ:</hi> such persons notwithstanding must be born till their sinnes be ripe, and<note n="*" place="margin">Psa. 125. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lord lead them forth amongst the workers of iniquity.</hi> Or by the servants may be here meant the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who by conversing much with the Ch: both can &amp; without doubt do through the subtilty of their nature, &amp; long experience spy out in the Church much cloked wickednes, &amp; impiety, which as the zealous ministers of Gods justice they are ready to revenge.</p>
               <p>But since the Lord Iesus, who best knew his owne meaning, calls<note n="â€˜*" place="margin">vers. 38.</note> the <hi>feild the world,</hi> and makes<note n="â€ " place="margin">v. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>the harvest</hi> which is the end of the field, <hi>the end of the world,</hi> and not of the Church, why should we admit of any other interpretation? Neyther is it like that Christ would in the expounding of one parable speak an other, as he should have done, if calling the feyld the world, he had meant the Church. As God then in the beginning made man good, &amp; pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him in the field of the world there to grow, where by the envy of the serpent he was soon corrupted, so ever since hath the seed of the serpent (stirred vp by their father the Divel) snarled at the heel of the womans seed, and like noysome tares vexed and peste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the good and holy seed, which though the children of God both see, and feel to their payne, yet must they not therefore<note n="â€ " place="margin">Luk. 9. 54. 56.</note>

               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:1037:60"/>And that the Lord Iesus no way speaks of the toleration of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane persons in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>First, because (as hath been observed) he doth not contradict<note place="margin">I.</note> himself by forbidding the vse of the keyes in one place, which in an other he hath turned vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> impenitent offenders, Mat. 18. 15. 16. 17.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Lastly the Lord Iesus speaks of the vtter ruinating &amp; destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the tares, <hi>the gathering and plucking them vp by the rootes,</hi> vers. 28. 29. and to this end they are reserved by the husbandman, v. 30.

               <p>But, to conclude, admit of Mr B. exposition, &amp; that the field here is the visible Church, the good seed the good, &amp; godly, the tares wicked and vngodly persons, I am contented that the difference in this place betwixt him and me be tryed at the tribunall of this very scripture, even thus expounded, and I doubt not but it will pronounce a cleare sentence on my side in the thing for which I contend: and that is, that the Church in the right gathering of it out of Antichristianism, or Paganisme, out of Babylon, Egypt, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome spiritually, or civily so called, or out of any other society or Synagogue, which is not the true visible body of Christ, must be &amp; is constituted and compact of good onely, &amp; not of good &amp; evill.</p>

But our exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> in this case is, first that the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland was never truely gathered, the Church of England I say, that that is, the National Church, consisting of the Provinciall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and those of the Diocesan Churches, and the Diocesans of the Parochyall Churches, according to their parish precincts, with

their governours &amp; government correspondent. That there were true visible Churches in the land gathered out of Paganism at the first, I will not deny, but that ever the whole Land in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of it was a Church is an affirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of them which consider not what is eyther the matter whereof, or the manner how the Church of the new Testament is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Graunt that the way of the kingdom of Christ, the Church were now so wyde that a whol nation might walk a brest in it, and that England had been some times that Canaan, the holy land, wherein none vncircumcised person dwelt, yet in the apostasy of Antichrist it could not be so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, but was in the body of it divorced fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> Christ with Rome, whereof it was a member, except you (Mr B.) will affirm (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do) that Rome remaines still a true visible Church, and that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristianism is true Christianism, Antichristians true Christians, the body which hath the Pope the head, the true body of Christ: &amp; so except the Church of Engl. had been sowen with good seed without tares since that general apostasie, it cannot be the L. field.</p>

What husbandman is eyther so foolish, or carles, as to sow his field with tares &amp; wheat together? And yet this fair field of Engl: of whose beauty all the Christian world is enamoured, is so sowen, this pleasant orchyard so pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ted, this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And as was the root, so are the branches, as were the first fruits, so is the whole lump.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point, thus I reason. The Lords field is sowen with good seed onely, though tares may in time be conveyed into it by the Divels mallice and mans negligence. But the Engl: natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Ch: was not so sowen, but with tares &amp; wheat together.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is not the Lords field.</p>

               <p>If Mr B. were but as able to confute vs by just reason, as he is<note place="margin">Answ.</note> willing to bring vs into hatred by unjust and odious accusations, we should then have as much cause to feare his skill, as now we have to complayn of his mallice. Onely herein his skill is to be commended, that where he findes not our opinions such as he thinks wilbe disliked by the simple multitude, he makes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> such, and so deales against them.</p>
               <p>Here come in many things of great weight to be discussed: and although it were in it self the readyest way to reduce things to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1037:61"/>
some heads, and so to prosequute them in order, yet since I have taken this task vpon me to trace Mr B. in the particulars, therfore I purpose to follow him step by step, notwithstanding all his vnor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly wandrings and excursions.</p>
               <p>And first Mr B. charging vs with errour for giving <hi>authority to preach, minister the sacraments, excercise the censures to the whole Church, and not to the principall members thereof,</hi> playnely insinuates that the authority to do all these things amongst them is in the principall members of the Church. But the truth is otherwise in the parish Church of Worksop, and in all other the parish Churches in the land. You have one onely member that hath power, (and that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ordinary) to any of these things, and that your self the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Priest, though perhaps the parish clerk may by speciall indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence be licensed, to bury the dead, Church women, read service on light holy dayes, and do some such like drudgery in your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. But for the exercising of the censures, that belongs not to the whole body, or to any member thereof principall, or lesse principall, but to the Bishops and his substitute, which are forreyners and strangers as in theyr office from the true Church, so even in theyr persons from yours. All your portion in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures Mr B. is to do the exequutioners office, when the Officiall hath played the iudge, which if you should be so bold as to refuse, besydes the punishment of your contumacy, the Church doore would do your office, for the bull of excommunication hanged vp there by the sumner byndes the offenders both in heaven &amp; earth. And for the position it self, howsoever we do indeed maynteyne the most of the particulars against which Mr B. intends his refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet as he sets it down, we do vtterly disclayme it with all the errors in it.</p>
               <p>First for teaching in the Church we do not vse it promiscuously, nor suffer it to be vsed but according to the order (as we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded) which Christ and his Apostles have prescribed. And for the sacraments, the contrary to that which you affirme is to be seene of all men in our <note n="â€ " place="margin">Article 34.</note> 
                  <hi>confession of fayth,</hi> wherein it is held that <hi>no sacraments are to be administred vntill Pastors or Teachers be ordayned in theyr office:</hi> neyther have we practised otherwise? And this Mr B.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1037:62"/>
knew, when he writ this book, as well as our selves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, touching the censures we do expresly confesse that <note n="â€ " place="margin">Act. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>the power, as to receive in, so to cut of any member is given to the whole body together of every christian congregation, and not to any one member a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>These things being thus, the vntruthes, which he sayth we build vpon this opinion are his and not ours, as the groundwork is his, so is the whol building raysed from it. But touching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of scripture by private brethren, and pollution by sinn vnreformed in the Church, &amp; separation from it for the same, we shall speak in their places. Onely I desyre it may be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that rather then Mr B. will forbeare to accuse vs that we hold it lawfull for one person to excommunicate the whole Church, he will back this most odious calumniation with as fond and false an assertion: and that is, that <hi>separating from a Church and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr B.</note> 
                  <hi>excommunicating of it is all one in substance, though called lesse odiously.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Answ.</note> But the contrary is manifested by these two reasons.</p>
               <p>First excommunication is a sentence judiciall presupposing ever a solemn and superiour power over the party sentenced: but no such thing is inferred vpon separation.</p>
               <p>2. Excommunication is onely of them which are <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor: 5. 12. 13. Math. 18. 15. 17. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>within and of the Church,</hi> but separation may be from them without. And I would know of Mr B. whither a person, though never so meane, might not separate from the assemblies of Pagans, Turkes, Iewes, Papists, &amp; other haeretiques, and Idolaters? I hope he would not draw such a man within his <hi>separatists schism:</hi> &amp; yet for the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municate such an assembly were a sinful prophanation of Gods ordinance. And though we held (as we do nothing lesse) that one man might excommunicate the whole Church, yet were it not <hi>more</hi> (as you affirm) <hi>then your Church allowes to any Bp. in Engl.</hi> no nor so much by a thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d parts: for one Bishop with you may excommunicate a thousand Churches: every Diocesan Bishop all the Churches in his Dioces, the two Provincial Bishops theyr two
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1037:62"/>
Provinces, so livelyly do the reverend fathers the Bishops resemble the holy father the Pope, which may judge all men, but be judged by none.</p>

            </div>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <p>1.

               </p>
               <p>2. That this company being a Church hath interest in all the<note place="margin">II.</note> holy things of Christ within &amp; amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>selves immediately vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him the head, without any forreyn ayd, &amp; assistance. Of which holy things in particular we shall consider as they come in our way.</p>
               <p>These two grounds (by the grace of God) I will prove in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and for the confirmation of the former take these reasons.</p>
               <p>The first is gathered from the authours owne words, <hi>that a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

                     </gap>.</note> assembly howsoever gathered together: and so a set company of visible beleevers must needs be a constituted visible Church: and to manifest the vanity of that distinction, that one place shall serue<note place="margin">Act: 19. 32. 40.</note> Act. 11. 26. where in the same verse the same persons<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> are called <hi>the Church, Disciples, and Christians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two or three or more people making Peters confession, <hi>Math.</hi> 16. are the Church. But two or three or more may make this confession without officers. Therefore such a company is a Ch:</p>
               <p>The former proposition is evident by that promise Christ made <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 16<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>to build his Church vpon the rock</hi> of Peters confession.</p>
               <p>The second, namely that men without officers may professe their faith is without question, except we will hold that without offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers no men can be saved, Rom. 10. 10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if the new Testament speak of ordeyning Elders in the Church, then doth it necessarily conclude yea expresly affirm, that there were Churches before Elders were ordeyned in them.</p>
               <p>But the first is manifest Act. 14. 23. therefore the second. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can Mr B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>shift of the place by saying such assemblyes are called Churches by <hi>Anticipation,</hi> any more then the Papists can the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 1 Cor 11. 26. against transubstantiation, by alledging that the Apostle speaks by <hi>Posticipation.</hi> For why may not the Papists as well answer that Paul calles Christs body bread, not because it is bread, but because it was bread before the words of consecration, as Mr B: that Luke calls the assemblyes without officers Churches, not because they were so, but were so to be after the Elders were ordeyned amongst them, neyther is it true which you affirme for confirmation of your distinction, <hi>that heaven and earth were so called before they were, Gen.</hi> 1. 1. the meaning of Moses onely is, that God created heaven and earth first, and when before they were not.</p>
               <p>If yet it be further answered by any, that the Church Act. 14. had Apostles over them, it must be remembred, that Luke in that place and action of ordination notes out three distinct orders of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Apostles ordeyning Elders, the Elders ordeyned, and the Churches in which the Apostles ordeyned Elders.</p>
               <p>Of the same nature is the fourth Argument grounded vpon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. where <hi>God</hi> is sayd to have <hi>appointed</hi> or set <hi>in the Church</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:1037:63"/>
                  <hi>Apostles, Prophets, Teachers,</hi> necessarily implying a Church before, wherein they were appointed: as a Sheriffe appointed in a shyre, a Maior in a City, a Constable in a Parish, a Steward in a familie do necessarily presuppose the Shyre, City, Parrish, Familie, wherein they are appointed. And indeed where should the Lord set his ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards but in his familie? Is any societie capable of the Lords offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers but his corporation? Is not the Eldership an ordinance given to the Church? &amp; so the Elders called the <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note> Elders of the Church. In the Church is not an ordinance given to the Elders, nor ever called their Church in the whole New Testament.</p>
               <p>Fifthly they with whom the Lord makes his Covenant <hi>to be their God, and to have them his people, to dwel amongst them as in his temple, which have right to the promises of Christ, and to his presence,</hi> they are the Church of God, &amp; of Christ. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 11. 12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. 20. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. 11. 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 16.</p>
               <p>But a company of faythful people, though they have no offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers amongst them, may be received into <hi>Covenant with God,</hi> may be his <hi>temple,</hi> and have him <hi>dwell amongst them,</hi> may have <hi>right to Christ and to his promises, &amp; presence,</hi> except we wil say they may not be <hi>gathered in Christs name,</hi> may not be <hi>called,</hi> may not <hi>come out from among unbeleevers</hi> nor <hi>separate themselves &amp; touch none unclean thing. Mat.</hi> 18. 17. 20. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. 17. except they have Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters going before them. For they that may <note n="â€ " place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 16</note> separate themselves from unbeleevers may be the temple of God, that is the true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible church, which the temple typed out.</p>
               <p>Men are not to come out of Babylon, and there to stand stil, &amp; remember the Lord a farr of, but must resort to the place where he hath put his name, for which they need not go eyther to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, or to Rome, or beyond the seas, they may find SiÃ²n the Lords mountain prepared on the top of every hil. If they as <hi>lively stones</hi> couple themselves together by voluntary <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> profession &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, they are a <hi>spirituall building,</hi> the Lords Temple.</p>
               <p>6. If a company of faythful people without officers be not a Church, then if all the officers of a Church should dye or fall away the Church should be nullified, and become no church: and to come nearer home (graunting for a while the parish of Worksop to be a company of faythfull people) if Mr Bernard should leave his Vicaridge for a better, then the church of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sop should be dischurched, and remayne a Church no longer:
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1037:64"/>
and thus an assembly might be Churched and vnchurched, and Churched agayn every week in the time of persecution or plague, by having and loosing, and recovering againe her officers: and thus the officers should not be the eyes or tongue of the body, for the body remaynes a true (though an imperfect) body without them, but the head of it: yea the Pope though he hold himself the head of the Church, yet acknowledgeth it a Church without him, and in the time of vacancy.</p>
               <p>Wee read, Rev. 2. 5. that the Lord threatens to <hi>remove the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestick</hi> from the Ephesians except they amend. Now the candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick is the Church, chap. 1. 20. and to remove the candlestick is to dischurch the assembly, or to wipe it out of the beadrowl of Churches. Here is sin the discharging an assembly, but that the death of the officers should do it, is no where found. We will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Ministers to be the <note n="â€ " place="margin">Math 5. 4. Rev. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>lights, starres,</hi> &amp; candles in the the candlestick the Church, &amp; that the Ministers death or fall is the removing of the light in a great measure, but we may not graunt them to be the Candlestick: that is the Church, wherein they are set, as 1 Cor. 12. 28. which may stand still though they fall.</p>
               <p>7. If a company of Saynts, where no officers are, be not a true<note place="margin">VII.</note> visible Church, then may they have no visible communion toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eyther publick, or private; the reason is, because the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of saynts is an effect, or property of the Church, and the Church a cause of it: the invisible Church of invisible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and the visible Church of visible communion. And as we can have no fellowship with Christ in his merits, and other works of mediation, till we be in our persons ioyned vnto him by faith, and grafted in him, as the <note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. 15. 1. 2. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>braunches in the vine:</hi> so neither can we have communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> one with another in any spirituall grace, or work, till we be vnited one to another in love, as the members of the body vnder the head. Communion in works whether na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, civil, or religious, doth necessarily presuppose vnion of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Yea if such a company be not a Church, I see not how their seed can have right to baptism, no nor how their own baptism ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> be accounted true in the right ends, &amp; vses of it. For 1. baptism is within, and not without the Church: Ephe. 4. 4. 5. Secondly, it
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1037:64"/>
is the seal of the covenant (which is the form of the Church) to the faithfull, and their seed, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. 39. Thirdly, it is of the members into the body of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. 13.</p>
               <p>Lastly where the essentiall causes of a Church are to be found, viz. matter and form, there is a Church. But this may be in such assemblies as have no officers, ergo.</p>
               <p>The former proposition is evident in it self, for the essentiall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses give being vnto the th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>The 2. I gather from Mr B. own graunt, where treating of the causes and properties of the Church, he makes the <note n="â€ " place="margin">pag. 112.</note> 
                  <hi>true matter such as professe Christ Iesus their onely saviour:</hi> and the <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 116.</note> 
                  <hi>form to be the vniting of men to God, and one to another visibly.</hi> Now except he will say (which God forbid) that none may make profession of faith, and be vnited to Christ without officers, he cannot deny but there may be, (and so be called) a Church without them. For all vnited vnto Christ the head, are members of the body, which is the Ch: and so the whol assembly ioyntly considered is an whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre body and Church. So that to deny an ordinary assembly or communion of Christians to be a Christian Church, is an vnchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian opinion. And here I entreat the indifferent reader to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether these mens wayes be equall, or no. When we deny their assemblies to be true visible Churches, though they consist for the most part of prophane, and vngodly persons, vnder the government of a Provinciall, or Diocesan Bishop, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of a dumb or prophane Preist, as the most do, (to which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the best is subiect within one moneth) they complayn of vs, as most injurious detracters, and yet will not they acknowledge any assembly of faithful &amp; holy people onely (if vnfurnished for a time of officers) to be a true Church, or capable of that denomination. But let not the harts of Gods servants be discouraged, he is no accepter of mens persons, he hath not tyed his power and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to any order, or office in the world, but accepted of them that feare him, and work righteousnes, hating the assemblyes of the wicked, and all their sacrifices.</p>
               <p>Vpon this point I haue insisted the longer, partly because it is the ground of the other truthes to be handled in their places, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1037:65"/>
partly in detestation of the vnsufferable pryde of this Prelacy, and Preisthood, which will have the very life of all Churches to hang on the breath of their nostrels, yea (I may safely say) on their lusts; if they dy yea or forsake their charges in never so fleshly respects their Churches are dissolved, at least during the vacancy, and so the brethren dismembred from being of the visible body of Christ. But so far are the officers from being the formall cause of the Church (as is intended) as they are in truth no absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appurtenance vnto it. The power indeed to enioy them is an essentiall property seated in the body which may braunch out it self (as God gives fit means) into officers accordingly, which if they prove unfruitful, it may also accordingly lop, or break off. And so farr is the Holy Ghost from giving countenance to this opinion, that the Officers make the Church, as when he speakes distinctly of the body, and officers, and considers them severally, he calls the body the Church, excluding the Elders, as appeares in these, amongst many o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The second poynt now comes to be manifested, which is that two or three faythful persons joyned unto the Lord in the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Gospel, have immediate interest to Christ in all his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</p>

               <p>And the reason is because civil Magistrates have authority an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed

to their office, and order, and though both they, and their commaundements be most vnjust yet do they still reteyn their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which their subjects may not shake of: but ministers and Church governers have no such authority tyed to their office, but merely to the word of God.</p>
               <p>And as the peoples obedience stands not in making the Elders their Lords, Soveraignes &amp;, Iudges, but in listening to their god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly counsels, in following theyr wise directions, in receiving their holy instructions, exhortations, consolations, and admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in vsing their faithful service and ministery, so neyther stands the Elders goverme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t in erecting any tribunall seat, or throne of judgement over the people, but in exhorting, instructing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting &amp; improving them by the word of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. &amp; in affoarding the Lord and them their best service.</p>
               <p>But here it wilbe demaunded of me, if the Elders be not set o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Church for her guidance, and government; Yes certayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the physition is set over the body, for his skill, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to minister vnto it, to whom the pacient (yea though his Lord, or Maister) is to submit: the lawyer over his cause, to attend vnto it; the steward over his family, even his wife and children, to make provision for them: yea the wachmen over the whole city for the safe keeping thereof. Such, and none other is the Elders, or Bishops government.</p>
               <p>Now to conclude this point. All the scriptures which Mr B. brings (as the reader may see) serves to prove that the governers of the Church, must be in, and of the Church they govern: but the governers of the Church of Worxsop, are not of it, neyther would Mr B. I dare say, be well pleased they should. But where it is further affirmed, that <hi>during all the Apostles dayes, the body of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation attempted nothing of themselves, but that alwayes Church matters were begun, governed, and composed by the Apostle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> hold that where there are officers in the Churches, &amp; those faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all things, as th' Apostles were, there things are not to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted without them, so is it not true which is affirmed, neyther do the scriptures alledged prove any such thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:1037:69"/>The three first places, <hi>Act. 1. 15. 23. 24. 25.</hi> and <hi>6. 3. 6.</hi> and <hi>14. 19. 20. 23.</hi> do onely prove that the Apostles being general men, &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of all Churches, did when they were present with the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches govern and assist them faythfully in all things, which we also affirm to be the duty of al Elders in their particular charges, whom the people are accordingly to obey. More particularly. The two former places speak of the Church at Ierusalem, where some of the Apostles were ever present: what marveil then if the congregation attempted nothing without them? But touching the last scripture which speakes of the Churches of and amongst the Gentiles, and of the ordination of Elders there, <hi>Act. 14. 23.</hi> the case is otherwise. Of these Churches some were converted to the Lord by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and other by private brethren scattered thither, &amp; there pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing the Gospel. <hi>Act. 8. 12. &amp; 10. 36-44. 47. 48. &amp; 11. 19. 20. 21. 23. &amp; 13. 2. 12. 48. &amp; 14. 1. 2.</hi> &amp; that some certaine yeares before any ordination of Elders amongst them.</p>
               <p>And can it be conceived with any reason, that all this long space, during the Apostles absence, these Churches never assembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their edification and comfort, in prayer, prophesying<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and other ordinances? were there no other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>verted al the while which desyred to be admitted into their fellowship? or had they no use of excommunication for the preserving pure of their communion for sundry yeares? But to let passe these more generall things and to come to the speciall busines mentioned: <hi>Act. 14, 23.</hi> The same rules which were after left in writing to Timothy and Titus for the choyce of Bishops, or Elders were then in use amongst the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: &amp; amongst other qualifications, it was required of them that they should be <note n="â€ " place="margin">1 Tim. 3, 1, 2, 4, 5.</note>

of them, their gifts, and faythfulnes for the publique ministery by due experience. The Apostles came, but occasionally to visit the Churches, and to comfort them, making (in many very small or no continuance) and fynding fit men for officers in the Churches where they came, and the same known, testified and commended to be such by the peoples election, they ordeyned Bishops or Elders over them, and so departed. <hi>Act. 14. 21. 22. 23.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what reason can be given, why the Apostles did not at the first planting of the Churches, but so long a space after, ordeyn officers, (as also that Paul did not perform that busines himself in Creta, but left Titus the Evangelist for that purpose, <hi>Tit. 1. 5.</hi>) save onely that men of gifts might be trayned vp in prayer, prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying, and carrying of such other Church affaires as fell out, and so due tryall made of theyr gifts, &amp; good knowledg taken of their faythfulnes in and by the Churches whereof they were, and over which they were to be set, being found fit for that service? Now the fourth scripture which is, <hi>1 Cor. 5.</hi> doth directly oppose that for which it is brought. It was the Churches fault not to have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out that sower leven, the incestuous person before they eyther heard from Paul, or he of that evill amongst them: and for theyr negligence herein the Apostle reproveth them, as all men see that are not willingly blynd. And for Paul he in generall as a penman of the Holy Ghost wrote scriptures for the direction of the Corinthians and all other Churches to the worldes end, and in speciall, as a chief Officer of that Church by <note n="â€ " place="margin">v. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But what of all these, and many other the like scriptures to be alledged? because the Churches are in all things to be guided by theyr officers ministring faythfully, and according to the word of God, and theyr duety, that therefore if eyther there be no officers, or if they be absent, or fayl in their duety, the Church may do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing eyther for information, or reformation?</p>

And what if the Lord should now rayse vp a company of faythfull men and women in Barbary, or America, by the reading of the scriptures, or by the wrytings, conferences, or sufferings of some godly men, must they not separate themselves from the filthines of the heathen to the Lord? nor turn from Idols to the true God? nor ioyne themselves vnto him in the fellowship of the gospell? nor have any communion together for theyr mutuall aedification, and comfort, till some vagrant Preist from Rome or England be sent vnto them to begin theyr Church matters with his service book?

Nay if this were a true ground, that Church matters might not be begun without officers, it were impossible that such a people should ever eyther enioy officers, or become a Church, yea I may safely ad, that ever there should be in the world after the vniversal visible apostacy of Antichrist, any true eyther Church, or officers; and so we must hold with the Arians, that except ther should come new Apostles to gather the Churches, and so a new Christ to call those Apostles, that there can be to the worlds end neyther true Churches nor true officers.

after this manner and for this end is a Church matter. Whence it followeth, that both Church matters, yea and Churches also may and in cases must be begun without officers. Yea even where officers are, if they fayl in theyr duetyes, the people may enterprise matters needfull, howsoever you will have the minister the onely <hi>primum movens,</hi> and will ty all to his fingers. And to let passe the godly Kings of Iudah which were no Church officers (about whom the question is) which sundry tymes set the Preists a work, &amp; other with them in Church matters, as <hi>2. Chro. 17. 7. 8. 9. and 29. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. &amp;c.</hi> and other instances in the old Testament, which in the handling of the particulars will fall into consideration, <note n="â€ " place="margin">Act. 11. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe was called by such as were no Apostles or other officers, to render a reason of his <hi>going into men vncircumcised,</hi> which he also did to Gods glory, and the Churches satisfaction, v. 18. Now how soever they which so contended with him erred in the matter, and it is like, dealt too contumeliously with him in the manner, yet had it been simply vnlawfull for them to have propounded, and begun a matter of that kynde, Peter would have reproved and broken off theyr disorderly course, and not have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with them in their sinne by vndertaking the answer of the matter, which in the generall he doth approve, by his orderly, and satisfactory answer.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, where the Lord Iesus, <hi>Math. 18. 19.</hi> directs a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in case, &amp; order, to <hi>tell the Church</hi> of his brothers offence, what can be more playne then that he enioynes a private brother to begin a Church matter? Yea though there be Elders in the Church, yea though the Elders alone, yea the chief of them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as Mr Bernard would have it) be the Church, yet must the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be brought to, and begun in the Church by him that is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and his witnesses. To presse this yet a little further: if any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely scandalous, or notorious sin be committed in the Church by a brother, and the Elders neglect all means of redressing it, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> put the case the Elders themselves be in the transgression, and by name, that they preach haeresy, or both preach and practise noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Idolatry, and that the body of the Church also be corrupted by them, and joyn hands with them in their mischief, what now
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1037:71"/>
must a private brother doe in this case, whose heart the Lord esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisheth in the truth, and whom he plucks as a brand out of the fyre? must he goe on, and ioyn with that Idolatrous assembly in theyr wickednes? God forbid. And leave them he may not till he have dealt with them about this Church matter, and convinced them of this Church sinn: for if Christ would not have a brother cast of his brother til he have dealt with him, nor the whole Church to cast of a private member, till <hi>he refuse to hear it, Math. 18.</hi> much lesse will he have one brother to forsake all the brethren, and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers also, or a private member to disclaym the whole Church till he have by the best meanes he can affoard in himself, or procure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, and after the best manner, convinced, admonished and exhorted both the Officers and people, and so found them obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and irreclamable.</p>

               <p>Now it seems by Mr BERNARDS doctrine that if the officers withdraw in these things, and will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the reformation of them (or if they dy or fall away) that the silly multitude must beare all evill, and forbeare all good; they must not <hi>mark and avoyd</hi> haereitcall and schismaticall whether teachers or others, they must not <hi>put out the old leven, that they may become a new lump: nor confirme theyr love to any penitent person, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him,</hi> though his repentance be never so ful or publique: nor

And thus the Ch: without the officers help (though it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>not possibly be had) as a deaf, a du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>b, a blynd, a lame, yea a liveles &amp; senseles body: it must both have the eyes put out, and the eares stopt, and neyther see nor hear, it must be tongue-tyed from speaking, &amp; fast bound hand and foot from doing any thing for the generall, and joynt good, yea it must not be saved without the officers, for other ordinary way of salvation know I none by the revealed will of God in his word, but in the vse of the ordinances, which Christ hath given vnto his Church.</p>
               <p>Â¶ It is the stewards duety to make provision for the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but what if he neglects this duety in the maysters absence? must the whole family starve, yea and the wife also? or is not some other of the family best able, to be imployed for the present neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity? It is the Pilottes office to guide the ship, but what if he igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, or negligently, or desperately will run the same vpon the rocks, or sands, must the rest of the mariners forbeare to interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and so perish?

Yea even in the most peaceable &amp; best governed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon-wealthes, a private man may in a case of necessity become a Magistrate for a mayne work, and that which ordinarily is the Magistrates peculiar.

               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:1037:72"/>So may the Church as the wife of Christ, if the steward the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster neglect the provision, vse the help, and service of an other the fittest in the family to provide food; the multitude, as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, if the minister the Pylot be desperate, set an other the most skilfull at the stern: the body of the army the Church, if the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers as the Captaynes be perfidious, vse the help and guidance of some other the most expert: so may, as a private citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> a magistrate, a private member become a minister, for an action of necessity to be performed, by the consent of the rest. These first things even na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the light of it teacheth the natural man, the latter, grace, &amp; the spirit of grace the spirituall man. Of these things the more largely I haue spoken in the generall, I may be the breifer in the particulars. Onely for conclusion I must demaund of Mr B. this question: if Church matters be to be performed onely by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, why his Sexton being no minister reads divine service in his absence, and that by authority from the Ordinary. If this be not a Church matter, and that materiall, there is small Church mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the most Churches in the land.</p>
               <p>Now the last thing I have to observe touching this first reason is, that so far as the authour speaks the truth in it, so far he speaks most playnly against himself. In that he graunts (as he doth <hi>pag. 90. 91.</hi>) the people under the law aright from the Lord, to <hi>approve of the appointment of the Levites, and that the body of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were made acquainted with that which concerned them,</hi> yea and <hi>had liberty to chuse their officers, and to present them to the Apostles,</hi> therein he overthrowes both his own, and all other the ministeries in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, as by the lawes both civil and ecclesiasticall they are consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted. For the law (with you Mr B.) allowes not onely Ministers ordeyned at large, without any certeyn congregations, but enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles them also to their speciall cures, without so much as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples knowledge: many parishes never seing the faces of their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters till they come to ring their belles in signe of victory: much lesse doth the law provide, they should be approved, least of all that they should be chosen, and presented by them.</p>
               <p>As the truth you speak in this place makes against you, so had you spoken more fully, you had brought more cleare testimony against
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1037:72"/>
yourself, you do therefore take vp yourself in time, and mingle some vntruthes amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>g<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> like darknes with light, least the light should shine too clearely in the eyes of the reader.</p>
               <p>Where you then affirm that <hi>the people did onely approve of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites at the Lords appointment when they took their charge,</hi> Numb. 3. 6<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 12. Lev. 8. 2. 36. &amp; <hi>that the body of the congregation was onely made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the choice of Mathyas,</hi> Act. 1. 15. you speak vnfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but where you adde, that <hi>onely the liberty was graunted them by the Apostles then to chuse</hi> Officers &amp;c. it is both false and fond. False as the former, for the Levites were not onely approved by the people, but given by them: they were the the peoples gift, and therefore theirs (for they gave nothing but their owne) and by them given to minister vnto the Lord in stead of the first borne, <hi>Exod. 13. 2. 12. 13. and 22. 29. Num. 3. 12.</hi> The Levites are expresly called the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples â€  <hi>shake offring,</hi> and so were not onely approved, but given by<note place="margin">Num. 8. 9. 10. 11.</note> them as their offering, even the offering of <hi>the whol congregation,</hi> and that by solemn ordination &amp; imposition of hands by the people Men may approve the thinges done by others, but the people were principall doers themselves: the offring was theirs, and by them as their gift presented, and so by Aaron offred vnto the Lord in their name.</p>
               <p>And as shameles an vntruth is it which you avouch touching the calling of Mathyas, Act. 1. that <hi>the body of the congregation was onely made acquainted with that which concerned them all.</hi> For howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the ministration were extraordinary, being an Apostleship, to which he was called, and therefore the Lord reserved to himself the prerogative royall of immediate designation of the very person, <hi>Gal. 1. 1.</hi> yet would he haue the libertie of the people so inviolably preserved, as that by direction, they were to present two, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to acknowledge by common consent that particular person which by the Lord was immediately singled out, and designed to that work. vers. 23. 26.</p>
               <p>Lastly the liberty graunted to the people for the chusing both of Deacons, and Elders, <hi>Act. 6.</hi> &amp; <hi>14.</hi> was not by any courtesie of the Apostles, as by the Popes indulgence for that time, as Mr B. would cunningly beare the simple reader in hand, but it was an
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:1037:73"/>
ordinance eternall, and perpetual, never reversed but by Antichrist, even a part of that connsell of God wherewith the Apostles ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Churches, and one of these co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maundements which they were to teach all Churches to observe, which they also did.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p>And so I come to the third reason against this imputed popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,<note place="margin">Mr B.</note> taken from <hi>the commission of Christ to his Apostles, and their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessourt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is something generally set down, but the thing (I perceive<note place="margin">Answ.</note> by his proofs) which Mr B: intends is, that the vse of the keyes &amp; power of binding and loosing was committed by Christ to his A postles, and to those which succeeded them.</p>
               <p>And first here, I do graunt with Mr Bernard, that look to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the power of binding and loosing was primarily, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed, in their successours it recideth for ever: so that the onely point in quaestion is into whose hands the Lord Iesus hath properly &amp; immediately given the keyes of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the power of loosing, and binding sinnes.</p>
               <p>For the better vnderstanding then of this point it must be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the kingdome of heaven is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>pared to a great house into which some are admitted, and others denyed enterance: the doore into this howse is Christ: the key that opens and shutts this doore, is the gospel: the opening of it (which is the loosing of sinnes,) is the publishing, opening, manifesting and making knowen of the gratious promises of the forgivenes of sinnes and life eternall to such as beleive, and repent. The shutting of this doore (which is also the binding of sinnes) is the declaration and denunciation of the wrath of God, against sinne, and of coudemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons impenitent, and vnbeleevers: and both these according to the pleasure of the mayster of the house, though the latter of them be not of the nature of the gospell, which is in it self <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 6</note> 
                  <hi>the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of life, and of the spirit which giveth life,</hi> but accidentall vnto it, by mens own fault, which through their vnbeleeving, &amp; impenitent hearts turne this key as it were, the wrong way vpon themselves.</p>
               <p>Now by the evidence of the former generall truth approved (I doubt not) to the conscience of every indifferent man (which is, that a company of faithfull people vnited together in the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1037:73"/>
of the gospel, though without officers, is a Church, This specialty in hand wilbe cleared. And wheresoever the promise of forgivenes of sinnes, and life eternall is to be found, there hangeth the golden key of heaven gates, there sinnes are loosed in heaven: for what els is it to loose sinnes, but to publish, proclayme, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in the word of God &amp; righteousnes of Christ, the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of sinnes to them that repent. But of these things hereafter.</p>
               <p>I will in the first place consider of Mr Bernards proofs, and of his collections from them.</p>

But the pointes in controversie betwixt vs are first, whether these things and all of them, and with them all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church affairs not here mentioned, be so appropriated to the Officers, as that none other may meddle with them: and 2. whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this power be committed to them immediately from, and by Christ, or mediately from Christ by the Church: which considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whilest you neglect, you erre your self, deceive such as follow you, and injury them you oppose.

               <p>The Apostles by Mr B. own graunt in this place, &amp; by these scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, &amp; at this time, and not before, had <hi>their commission of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That by the keyes is meant the gospel of Christ, opening a way by him, and his merits, as the doore into the kingdome, I have formerly declared, and we must take heed of that deep delusion of Antichrist, in imagining that this power of binding or loosing sinnes, of opening, or shutting heaven gates, is tyed to any office, or order in the Church; it depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ds only vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

Deut. 31. 9. whence I do by the way gather thus much, that since the keyes of the kingdome of heaven is the gospel, and that the gospel is give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to the whole Church, and to every member of it, whether there be Ministers or no, it therefore followeth, that the keyes are given to all and every member alike, as the gospel is, though not to be vsed alike by all, and every one, which were grosse confusion, but according to the order prescribed by Christ.</p>
               <p>Now for the place in hand, (which is <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 18. 19.) it is graunted by all sides that Christ gave vnto Peter the keyes of the kingdome, that is, the power to remit and reteyne sinnes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratively (as they speak) as also that in what respect this power was given to <hi>PETER,</hi> in the same respect it was, and is given to such as succeed Peter: but the quaestion is, in what respect or consideration this power spoken of was delegated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. The Papist affirmes it was given to Peter as the Prince of the APOSTLES, and so to the BISHOPS of ROME as PETERS successours, and thus they sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the POPES primacy: the <hi>PRELATES</hi> say nay, but vnto <hi>PETER</hi> an APOSTLE that is, a cheif Officer of the CHVRCH, and so to vs as cheif Officers succeeding him, which is also Mr B: judgement, <hi>pag.</hi> 94.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:1037:75"/>
Others affirm it to belong to Peter here as a Minister of the word, and sacraments, and the like, and so consequently to belong to all other Ministers of the gospel equally, which succeed Peter in those and the like administrations. But we for our partes do beleeve &amp; professe that this promise is not made to Peter in any of these fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named respects, nor to any office, order, estate, dignity, or degree in the Church, or world, but to the confession of faith, which Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made by way of answer to Christs question, who demaunding of the disciples, v. 15. whom (amongst the variety of opinions that went of him, ver. 14.) they thought him to be, was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered by Peter in the name of the rest, <hi>Thou art Christ the sonne of the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>So that the building of the Church is vpon the rock of Peters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, that is, Christ, whom he confessed: this faith is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Church: against this faith the gates of hell shall not prevayl: this faith hath the keyes of the kingdome of heaven: what this faith shall loose, or bind on earth, is bound, &amp; loosed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And thus the Protestant divines (when they deal against the Popes supremacy) do generally expound this scripture, though Mr B. directly make the Pope and his shavelings Peters successours in this place, as hereafter wil appeare. Now vpon the former ground it followeth, that whatsoever person hath received the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious faith with Peter (as all the faithfull have, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Pet. 1. 1.</hi>) that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hath a part in this gift of Christ: whosoever doth confesse pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish, manifest, or make knowen Iesus to be that Christ the sonne of the living God, and Saviour of the world, that person opens heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> gate, looseth sin, &amp; partakes with Peter in the vse of the keys.</p>
               <p>And herevpon also it followeth necessarily, that one faithful man, yea or woman eyther, may as truely, and effectually loose, and bind, both in heaven, and earth, as all the Ministers in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:1037:75"/>But here I know the Lordly clergy, like the bulles of Bashan, will roar lowd vpon me, as speaking things intollerably derogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the dignitie of Preisthood, and it may be some others also, eyther through ignorance, or superstition, will take offence at this speach, as confounding all things: but there is no such cause of exception. For howsoever the keyes be one and the same in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and efficacy, in what faithful mans or mens handes soever, as not depending eyther vpon the number, or excellency of any persons, but vpon Christ alone, yet is it ever to be remembred, that the order, and manner of vsing them is very different.</p>
               <p>These keyes in doctrine may be turned as well vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> them which are without the Church, as vpon them which are within, and their sinnes eyther loosed, or bound. <hi>Math. 28. 19.</hi> but in discipline (as we speak) not so, but onely vpon them which are within. <hi>1 Cor. 5. 12. 13.</hi> Againe the Apostles by their office had these keyes to vse in all Churches, yea in all nations vpon earth: ordinary Elders for their particular flockes. <hi>Act. 14. 23. &amp; 20. 28.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly there is an vse of these keyes publiquely to be had, and an vse privately: an use of them by one person severally, and an use of them by the whole Church ioyntly, and together: an vse of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> ministeriall, or in office, and an vse of them out of office: but the power of the gospel (which is the keyes) is still one, and the same, notwithanding the divers manner of vsing it.</p>
               <p>And this distinction well observed will stop the hole, by which Mr Bernard in his reply, sundry times scapes out (where otherwise he should be vnavoydably taken in Mr Smythes arguments) by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vantage at, and perverting of a phrase vsed by Mr Sm: which is <hi>the ministeriall power of Christ.</hi> This ministeriall power Mr S. makes that externall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municated, &amp; delegated power of Christ with and to the Church, serving onely for manifestation and declaration of the remission, or retention of sinnes, opposing ministeriall power in the creature, to that power essentiall, &amp; incommunicable which is inhaerentin Christ and God the creator: but Mr B. on the other side, eyther ignorantly, or deceiptfully, misinterprets the terme <hi>Ministeriall,</hi> as meant onely of the power in office, opposed to that which is out of office, and so creeps out at this cranny. But with
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1037:76"/>
what reason can it be eyther conceived, or suggested that Mr Smyth should affirme, that the body of the Church, or a private brother out of office, should have this power spoken of in office?

               <p>3. Lastly I do affirme with Mr Smyth that the twelve were as yet but disciples, and not actually Apostles.

A man may call such a woman his wife, before they be actually maryed, and such a child his heire, though he be not for the present possessed of a foot of his inheritance, nor like to be before the testators death: and that this was the condition of the twelve, I prove by these reasons.</p>
               <p>If the twelve were called to the office of Apostles, <hi>Mat. 16.</hi> then Christ called men to an office, for which they were altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, &amp; vnfurnished, which to imagine were impious against Christ.</p>

               <p>Secondly, they were ignorant of the nature of Christs kingdom<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> not forecasting his death, nor beleeving his resurrection, vnfurni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed also with the gift of tongues, and so vtterly vnable to teach the gentiles, for whose sake they received their commission in a speciall manner, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 21. 22. &amp; 20. 20. 21. &amp; 26. 51. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 11. 14. <hi>Luke</hi>

               <p>Now since Mr B. disclayms this scripture as not intended at all of the goverment of the Church, &amp; that in his 2. &amp; better thoughts, I have no reason to spend much time in answering him.

And by this, I hope, it appeareth in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall contrary to Mr B. affirmation, that the power of Christ (or keyes of the kingdom) is not delegated or committed primarily much lesse solaryly, or alone, to the officers of the Church how so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they as the governours are to direct, and as the minister to exequute in the vse of this power, or of these keyes. Of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars hereafter. That which comes next into consideration is, that <hi>the Apostles committed that theyr power received from Christ not to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr B.</note> 
                  <hi>the body of the people, but to the cheife ministers of the gospell, and cheife of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First here let the reader observe how Mr B. interesses these<note place="margin">Answ.</note> cheiftayns onely in the power of Christ as the Apostles successours (excluding himselfe and the rest of his rank) that he may advance the throne of Antichrist in his cheife ministers the Lord Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops &amp; Bishops, whose chayre he thus stoutly laboures to vphold with both shoulders.</p>
               <p>Secondly I deny, that eyther the Evangelists, such as were Timothy, and Titus, succeeded the Apostles in their office, or that any other ministers in the Church, did or do succeed eyther the Apostles, or Evangelists, as they were such (as we speak). They
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1037:78"/>
were extraordinary officers in the first pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ting of the faith amongst the gentiles, theyr qualifications extraordinary, and miraculous, as the gift of tongues, and the like, and so theyr offices were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in theyr persons. And yet I deny not but the true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the gospell the Bishops or Elders, in theyr particular Churches do succeed the Apostles (though not in office) yet in theyr ordinary ministration of the word, sacraments, censures, prayer, ordination, &amp; all other ordinances of the Church whatsoever, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order Christ hath left; but that the Apostles and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists have by any order committed theyr power or any part of it to any such <hi>Cheif Ministers</hi> or rather Lords, yea spiritual tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts as the Lordbishops &amp; Archbishops in Engl. are, that I deny withall my power. There are no such cheifteyns in the Church of Christ, or communion of saynts. The Apostles did, by the Churches free choyce, ordeyn in every particular assembly a company of Elders or Bishops, whome they charged with the particular flockes, in, and to which they were to minister the holy things of God, and none other. <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>and</hi> 20. 17. 28. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. 2. 4. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Much lesse are the great Antichrists of Rome, the Popes, and Cardinalles, the Apostles, and Evangelists successours in any right by the word of God, or capable in that theyr estate of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall or other ministeriall power of Christ, as you Mr B. will make them, of which your Popish errour more in place.</p>
               <p>Now for the scriptures cited, they serve well to prove that which no man denyes, in which kynd of disputing Mr B. hath a speciall faculty.</p>
               <p>The scriptures are<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>and</hi> 3. 14. 15. <hi>and</hi> 5. 21. 22. <hi>Tit.</hi>

               <p>And what followes vpon this? I know well what Mr B. infers: namely, that the cheif Ministers alone in the Churches whether
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:1037:78"/>
pure, or impure (by which latter he meanes the Church of Rome) as he expounds himself<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> pag. 145. that is, that Popes, Cardinalls, Archbishops, Bishops, Suffraganes, Chauncelours<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and the rest of the triumphant Clergy, and they alone should medle with supres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing errour, rectifying things amisse, calling and ordayning mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and that all others are absolutely inhibited any medling with these things. Well, (to let passe your fearefull retyring (Mr B.) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the battered bulwarks of the Papists for succour, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of your selfe, and all the inferiour ministery that these cheif ministers might reigne alone) the scriptures do not debar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e the members of the Church from medling in those things in their place, and order, nor impropriate them to the cheife Lords, as is pretended, onely they declare that the officers are to do theyr own duetyes in those businesses, and to put the brethren in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of theyrs, to commaund, teach, and speak those things, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting &amp; rebuking with all authority by the word of God as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion serves. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6. 11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 15. And if Mr B. will conclude any thing for his purpose by the scriptures he alledgeth he must take this position for graunted, that whatsoever Paul wrytes to Timothy, or Titus, touching the Church, about that onely they, &amp; theyr successours the cheif ministers are to medle; which presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous affirmation is sufficiently refuted by the very recitall of it. He that reads over the Epistles but with a pece of an ey may see the contrary. There is no greater force in this collection then in that <hi>Mar.</hi> 13. 34. bycause the porter is to watch, therefore he alone, and not the rest also, which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>trary to the expresse words immediatly following, where all are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maunded to watch, v. 37. And thus the conclusion, which Mr B. would make, <hi>that the place,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>though generally spoken, must be vnderstood of the cheife officers of the Church,</hi> is without pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Onely I must needs take knowledge of that part of the truth, which Mr B. being set vpon the rack of his conscience in reading this, 1 Cor. 5. is compelled to confesse, and that is, <hi>that from v. 5.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Towching which his graunt I observe these three particulars.</p>
               <p>First it overthrowes the practise in the Church of England, where the offender is excommunicated by the Chauncelour, or Officiall, it may be, fourty miles off from the body of the congregation, whereof he is a member, and that most what without the presence of any one of the body, yea or their privity eyther, till such tymes as eyther the Parish Preist, or Church dore signify the matter vnto them.</p>
               <p>2. If the officers must judge, and excommunicate in the open assembly, then can they alone in no sense be the Church. For the Church is nothing but the assembly. And it is all one to say the<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                  </note> officers in the assembly, are the Church, as to say the officers in the assembly, are the assembly<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> which is a senseles affirmation. And if the Officers alone be the Church, to which complaint is to be made, and which is to reprove the offender and judge him, they must do it in a distinct assembly from the body, and not in the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly compounded necessarily of the officers and the body: as your Courtkeepers doe in their Consistories, &amp; the Elders in the reformed Churches in their private Chambers.</p>
               <p>3. It is most vntrue which you say, that no more can be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from this place, but that excommunication was performed in the presence of the body of the Church, and with their knowledge being gathered together: it is apparent that they which were <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, were by the power of Christ to deliver to Satan the offender, to purge out the old leven, to iudge, and to put out from among themselves that wicked fornicatour.</hi> v. 5. 6. 7. 12. 13. of which more hereafter.</p>

Similitudes (as they say) do not run vpon four feet: &amp; to streyn them above that which is intended by the holy Ghost in vsing them, is a course full both of vanity and errour. The Deacons are the handes of the Church for the distribution of her bodily things to them that need, &amp; yet I trow, you would not have the Church suffer the poore to starve, where the Deacons are wanting to minister, or fayling in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration: so are the Elders the eyes &amp; mouth of the Church for her government, and ministration of spirituall things, &amp; yet must not the Church perish spiritually for their want, or negligence: no, the Lord is more mercifull to his people then so, and doth nor ty them so short in the meanes of their aedification, &amp; salvation, how streyt and hard hearted soever you M.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous of them: they may, and must use in cases of necessity their best helpes, for the distribution of things simply necessary to the body. And dare you say (as you haue done in both your books) that the officers are absolutely to the Church, as the eyes

to the body? and that there is no spirituall light in the rest of the members save onely in them? and that all the body besides and without them is darknes? Indeed such a blind beetle your spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Lords, and you make your Churches, and so you lead them. But, oh you the people of God, yet in Babylon, partakers of the heavenly illumination, trust not these your Seers too much. they would be thought all ey from top to bottom, and would make you beleeve, that you the multitude are stoneblind, and can not possibly without them see one step before you, that so they might lead you by the lip, whither they list: but open your eyes more and more, and you shall see more and more clearely that the wayes of your Nationall Church<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> are not the wayes which Christ hath left for his visible Churches to walk in, but a very by path: and take heed that these men, which would be thought all, and onely light, cause not a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To proceed. This one scripture, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. 11. 12. truely expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and according to the Apostles meaning, serves at one blow to overthrow the whol ministery of your Church of England, and all communion with it.</p>
               <p>Your whol plea for your Ministery is, that you teach the word of God, &amp; the true word of God, and therewith you invite all your guests vnto your ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>quet.

               <p>The officers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> which Christ hath given for the aedificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of his Church to the worlds end are, Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, &amp; Teachers, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. 11. 12.

                  </hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> here spoken of, you Mr B: and the Ministers of your or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would be thought the men. Of what sort then (I pray you)
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1037:81"/>
are your grand Metropolitans, your Archbishops, Bishops, Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes, Deanes, Archdeacons, Chauncelours, Officials and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidew of that Lordly Clergy? They must needs be of some other order then is here named, and the gifts of some other cheif Lord then of Christ, when he ascended on high, and gave his gifts, &amp; that is Antichrist, whose gifts they were when he ascended on high, even to the throne of his Apostasy.</p>
               <p>And now for you, which are set over the particular Parishes, to teach the people, (as I confesse you of all the rest to be likest vnto the true Pastours) so by your own confession are you excluded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> that rank. The Officers which Christ hath appointed, when he ascended, have received power (by your own assertion) not onely <hi>for preaching and administring the sacraments,</hi> but <hi>for government also.</hi> The<note place="margin">pag. 92.</note> want then of the power of government bewrayeth you to be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers gift then Christs, even his and none others, which hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised an other order, and distribution of giftes then ever came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christs hart to appoint.</p>
               <p>Lastly, as it is true you affirm, that <hi>Christ never sayd to the body of the congregation,</hi> viz: in expresse termes, <hi>go preach,</hi> so is it most vntrue which you intend, viz: that he never gave libertie, and charge to any out of office to teach in the exercise of prophesy. This point I have touched formerly, but will more fully handle hereafter. The same I also affirme in the second place touching the <hi>power of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> not opposing your words well interpreted, but your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which is, that none but men in office have power eyther to reforme any abuse in the Church or to perform any other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Church duty without them. And for shutting vp of this fourth Argument, let it be considered, that here is a great difference in administration of doctrine by teaching, and of admonition &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication in the order of discipline. Onely one man in the Church doth teach at once, and all the rest both Elders &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are taught by him, but the whol Church may admonish, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate one or more at once, or by one act: and so though Christ never say to the Church, goe teach, yet, he sayth to the Ch: admonish, &amp; excommunicate. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. 5.

               <p>And yet for more speciall answer vnto you Mr Bernard, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes not, that, bycause the people are not interessed in the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of abuses by the scriptures you cite, therefore it is <hi>never found eyther in the old, or new testament,</hi> that any such duty lyes vpon them. The scriptures do not intend to speak of all things at once, but that charge, which is omitted in one place, is oft tymes supplyed, and prescribed in another. And to this purpose, I do desire that these few scriptures amongst many others may be considered of: <hi>Num. 5 1. 2. Iosh. 7. 1. 11. 12. 24. 25. &amp; 22. 11. 12.â€”16. 17. 18. 20.

Gal. 6. 1. 1 Thes. 5. 14. 1 Cor. 5.</hi> whol Ch. &amp; all these &amp; many other of the same nature will manifest, that the people are charged with the reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of abuses for the keeping pure of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion, as well as the officers, though not in the same order, or degree. But what need we seek further? as all the scriptures brought forth by Mr Bern. do charge the govervours with refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and none of them exempt the people in their rank, and order, so are there some of them so pregnant against him in
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:1037:83"/>
the point, &amp; by which he hath been so oft silenced to his face, that, if he had not set himself in opposition, without all measure, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, he would never offer his cause to be tryed by that evidence in writing, by which in speach, he hath been so oft cast and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced.</p>
               <p>The scriptures I especiall mean are <hi>Rev. 2. &amp; 3.</hi> And the thing which he would prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> from those scriptures is, that, bycause Iohn in the verses named by him, speakes to the Angels of the particular Churches, that therefore it conernes the Angels, that is, the chief officers alone, and no way the people (no nor any of the Officers but one in a Church by Mr Bernards expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition) to see to the reformation of such abuses, and disorders, as in those Churches are reproved. But if in these scriptures he thus sever, and sejoyne the officers, and people, why might not the officers be excluded by a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The answer, and truth then is, that Iohn <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 1. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>writes and sendes these Epistles or this book, to the 7. Churches in Asia,</hi> as he is expresly directed by Christ: &amp; so willeth all men to <note n="â€ " place="margin">Chap. 2. 7. 11. 17. 29. &amp; 3. 6. 13. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>heare,</hi> and take knowledge <hi>what the spirit sayth to the Churches:</hi> but bycause the matters were publique, &amp; he absent from the Churches, it was both most convenient, &amp; neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary he should direct his letters to the officers for the whol Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as being not onely most fit for their knowledge, but most bound by their places to provoke the Churches vnto, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and goe before them in the reformation of such evills as were found amongst them. As if the King at any time write his letters to any corporation in the land about some such publick busines, as wherein every free man hath an hand, he directs them to the MAIOR, BAYLY, or some other cheife offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, by whome they are to be published to the whole body, and the matter managed, which they conteyn, though as I former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sayd, every freeman be to speak to, and consent in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:1037:84"/>And here it is too much Mr B. should say (as he doth) that <hi>no mention in these places of the revelation is made of the people, but of the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours onely,</hi> where Christ expresly enjoynes Iohn <hi>to write his vision, and to send it vnto the 7. Churches,</hi> ver. 11. where Iohn expresly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes them with grace and peace, as Paul and others do them to whom they write in the beginning of their letters, v. 4. Where he also calls those candlesticks he saw in his vision, the Churches, though distinguished from the Officers, or Angels, whom he calls starres, or lights. ver. 12. 13. 20. and lastly and specially where after his both commendations, &amp; reproofs, promises, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, he wills me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to listen what the spirit sayth not of, but vnto the Churches. Chap, 2. 7. 11. 17. 29. &amp; 3. 6. 13. 22. which do neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily conclude the people in them.</p>
               <p>But to let passe generalls, &amp; to come to such particulars in these Chapters, as wherein the suffring of evills in the Churches is reproved. Onely I must needs shew Mr B. his great oversight, that, where he should prove, that onely the angels of the Churches were reproved for suffering evils vnreformed, he points vs to sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Angels, and Churches, where there is no mention at all made of suffring evils, but all of doing, as well by the Angels, as Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as in Ephesus, Sardi, and Laodicea: and which is worse, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other Angels, and Churches, where there were no evils at all worthy reproof eyther done or suffred: as in Smyrna, and Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia. And is not this sound dealing? The Lord Iesus finds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Ch: of Smyrna &amp; Phyladelphia worthy of taxatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, but all of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mendation, ergo the cheif governours onely in these Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are reproved for suffring evils vnreformed. I now come to the particular scriptures, in number two, where mention is made of evils suffred vnreformed, and reproof layd vpon them which suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them in the two Churches of Pergamus and Thyatira.</p>
               <p>And that Iohn directs his reproofs against the Churches, and not against the Officers alone, I do thus manifest.</p>
               <p>1. Them, <hi>whose workes Christ commends,</hi> for that, <hi>dwelling where Satans throne was, they kept his name, and denyed not his fayth,</hi> &amp;c. them I say he reproves, and against them he deales, for <hi>suffering them that m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>tans,</hi> v. 13. 14. 15. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:1037:84"/>2. They which are commended by Christ for their <hi>workes, love, service, fayth, patience, and encrease in works,</hi> they are also reproved by him <hi>for suffering the woman Iezebell, the false Prophetesse to teach and to deceive,</hi> vers. 19. 20.</p>
               <p>But it were senselesse to affirm, that the Angel alone, and not the people with him, was commended for dwelling where Satans throne was, keeping Christs name, and not denying his fayth in persecution, that the Angel alone was commended for his works, love, service, fayth, patience, and the like, and as senseles, as to affirm, that onely <hi>some of</hi> the Angel of the Church of Smyrna was to be <hi>cast into prison.</hi> ver. 10, and therefore, as the faythfull, the brethren, the saynts, the people, had their portion in these Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an vertues, and in the commendations given vnto them, so also do they beare their part in the reproofs due to the toleration of such evils as were found amongst them, and are exhorted to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. v. 16.</p>
               <p>And this the two adversative conjunctions <hi>but &amp; notwithstanding,</hi> or neverthelesse, v. 14. &amp; 20. do evidently declare. In many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces these Churches did abound, and faythfull they were in great tryalls, <hi>but,</hi> or <hi>notwithstanding</hi> in this they fayled that they were not zealous enough against such deceivers, as crept in amongst them, but suffered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to others hurt, &amp; their owne danger also. ver. 24.</p>
               <p>Of these things I have spoken something the more at large, to discover the bold injury which Mr B. offereth vnto these scriptures: which may also serve to manifest both the libertie &amp; dutie of the people for the reforming of abuses in the Churches, against the usurpation of the English, or other Clergie whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Now to that which is inferred by way of conclusion, <hi>that 1 Cor. 5. must be expounded by other places, and by the whole course of scripture,</hi> &amp; the like, &amp; that, <hi>tell the Church, Mat. 18. 17. must be vnderstood, tell the cheif Officers of the Church,</hi> these severalls must be answered.</p>
               <p>First let it alwayes be remembred, that we beleeve, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that the Elders which Christ hath left in his Church, are to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the same in all things (provided alwayes the nature of eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall government be not exceeded) according to the lawes by him prescribed, and that so doing, the brethren are most streyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:1037:85"/>
bound to obey them, without disturbance, intrusion, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, vnder peyn of Gods wrath for their rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> against him, and them. Heb. 13. 17. But as els where is observed, it is one thing to be the Church, an other thing to govern the Church, one thing for the officers to direct, and go before the brethren in all things as guides, and another matter vtterly to exclude the brethren from any part of the communion, as neyther being the Church, nor any part of it, as this exposition doth.</p>
               <p>These things Mr B. ignorantly blunders together, and so he and others rayse odious clamours against vs of Anabaptism, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity, and the like, as if we confounded all persons, and things, and made the Church a very Chaos, or Babel, without form or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>2. I acknowledge that one scripture must be expounded by an other, but ever the more dark, and obscure by that which is more playne and lightsome: now so playne, cleare evident, and perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous are the two scriptures in hand for excommunication, the former <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15. 16. 17. for the order and degrees of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the other 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. for the persons interessed in the buesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as that to bring in other scriptures for the expounding of them, is in truth as needlesse, and lost a labour, as to light the sun and moon a candle.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <p>Now for the places, severally, and first for <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 17. where<note place="margin">Mr Bern.</note> sayth Mr B. <hi>tell the Church, is tell the cheif officers of the Church: and so must be expounded.</hi>

               <p>Well, the words are cleare as the sun, tell the Church, that is,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> the congregation or assembly whereof the offender is a member. But where you make the Church, not the officers simply, but <hi>the cheif officers,</hi> therein you deale both wisely and dutifully.

Well Mr B. whomsoever the Lord Iesus meant by the Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1037:85"/>
he never meant, that the Archbishop of York, the Archdeacon of Nottingham, the Officiall of Southwel, were the Church of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sop: and for this I vvill spare all Arguments, and send you to your owne guilty conscience for conviction, which as it condemns you in yourself, (which is also the case of many thowsands in the Land) so do I earnestly wish both you, and them to remember with fear and trembling the condemnation of him that is <hi>greater then your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi> Ioh. 3. 20. So far are they from being the Church of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sop as they are not so much as members of it, nor of any other particular Church in the kingdome: they are neyther the Pastours (so called) nor vnder the Pastors of any particular Church, but with their tanscendent jurisdiction in their Provinciall, and Diocesan Churches, take their scope without orb, or order: and as clouds without rayn, carryed about with the wind of ambition, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnes for the the greatest part.</p>
               <p>To leave them, and come to your reasons Mr B. by which you would prove, that tell the Church, is tell the governours. But here behold the fruites of an vnstable mind. This man in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer book laboured by many scriptures, and reasons to lay downe the nature of the Churches government, and in speciall to prove, that the Church, <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 17. to vvhich complaint of sinns was to be made, was the cheif officers onely, and this he affirmes also to be <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 98.</note>

                  <hi>young divines,</hi> &amp; <hi>seely coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people,</hi> (as he speakes) (and as in truth they had need be both young, and seely, that are perswaded by him) that <hi>the points of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Church-government are not so apparant by the scriptures, as that they can rightly iudge of them.</hi> And to this end he brings in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of iudgements, and contradictions of learned men, some holding no government at all, others that an externall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be had, but of these, some holding it alterable, others constant, and perpetuall, and of these some to be in the Pope, &amp; Cardinalls, others in the body of the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, some in the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, with the peoples consent, and others, (which he puts last, as best and for which he brings sundry reasons, referring the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1037:86"/>
to the treatises written to that end) in the Bishops his Lords. And againe touching the punishment of offenders, some he brings in holding excommunication, but not suspension, some holding both, and some neyther. And particularly for <hi>Math.</hi> 18. he mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in thick, and threefold reasons and persons so reasoning, and proving, that the place (and so of <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 17.) doth nothing at all concern discipline, or ecclesiasticall censures, but that Christs meaning there was onely to direct the Iewes how to carry things before the Synedrion, in cases of bodily injury. And thus he brings mens contrary opinions to darken the scriptures, which are most playne, like so many foul feet to trouble the pure fountaynes of living water, that the thirsty may not drink of them. And as a learned man in our age, &amp; nation, to discover the vanity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnosticatours, gathered together their contrary guesses of the we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so presented them: so this man to make the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christs Church as vncertayne as an Almanack, sets toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so offers to the vvievv of the world the contrarieties of opinions concerning it. Now if other men should take this course Mr B. doth, in other points of religion, and one lay down the differences that are about predestination &amp; the points depending vpon it, some vtterly denying it, others affirming it, and of these some grounding it vpon Gods mere grace, others vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> mans faith, or workes foreseen: an other about baptisme, some denying it to all infants, others ministring it to all, others to such onely as are of Christian parents in a sort, and others onely to them that are of beleeving parents, at the least on the one side: a third about the Lords supper, in which point some hold transubstantiation, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers consubstantiation, others onely a sacramentall vnion, which some also will have merely rationall, others reall also: there could not be a playner way beaten for all Atheism to come into the world by, nor a course devised by the Divell more pregnant to perswade the multitude, that there were no certaynty, nor soundnes in the scriptures. But let God have the glorie of his truth, and of the clearnes in it, and let men bear the just blame, and shame of their naturall blyndnes: and in speciall let Christ have the honour of being as <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 3. 5. 6.</note>

setting orders and officers in it and let not vile flesh dare to flatter Princes and Prelates, to mislead silly soules, and to preach liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and licentiousnes to the world, make Christ Iesus an Idol King, having a kingdome vpon earth without lawes, or officers, for the administring of it: nor to make his redeemed, Idoll subjects, as whom it concerns little or nothing, whether they be vnder Chrits lawes, and officers, or vnder Antichrists his professed adversary. Now though I will not trouble my self, and the reader about eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry stone, that Mr. B. idely casts in the way, yet such as may stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the weakest passenger, I will remove, and so returne to my former task.</p>
               <p>And in the first place I will answer certaine reasons in number six, brought by Mr B. for the superiority of his Lord Bishops: but those not backed with the scriptures, as in other points (when he thinks he speaks the truth) his manner is.</p>

               <p>I answer first, that these were not Bishops set over certayn Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches<note place="margin">Ans.</note> here, and there, (though vpon occasion they tarryed some good space in some certayne Churches) but generall men, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and Evangelists, without successours in their Offices: &amp; so the Protestants do generally answer the Papists instancing them, as you do now.</p>
               <p>2.

And where you seem to make the <hi>Chief Priests besides the high Preist,</hi> a superiour order to the other formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differing, it is more (if I be not deceived) then can be proved by the word of God. I know no diversity of administrations amongst them, but that any of the Priests might in their course, and order offer sacrifice, &amp; performe other the most solemne duties of preist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <p>But where you further adde that <hi>onely the high Priest did type out Christ, and not the other Preists so:</hi> you are much mistaken. The whole preisthood of Aaron, <note n="â€ " place="margin">Heb. 10. 1. Heb. 7. 11 <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>vnder which the law was established,</hi> was a type of Christs Preisthood (though the high Preists in a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner) and their sacrifices, of his: and being a part of the law (which was a shadow or first draught, whereof the gospel is the lively portrature) it must needs be ceremoniall, and so a type: &amp; to affirm otherwise is a grosse Iewish errour. Lastly as I graunt one end of the subordination of Ministeries to have been the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of order, so I deny that same order is to be preserved in the nevv testament, and in the old. The order of the old testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was the order of a nationall Church, but the order of the new testament is the order of a particular Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there needs no such subordination of Ministeries as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which was nationall, the ey of common sense sees this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
               <p>The <hi>law of nature</hi> whether written in the hart of man, or to be seen in the workmanship of the world, from which you draw your fift Argument, doth not prove superioritie amongst officers in a<note place="margin">V.</note> particular assembly, but onely that there must be government in all
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1037:87"/>
societies, which may well be, though the governours be of one or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and rank.</p>
               <p>Lastly they against whom you deale, <hi>doe mainteyne</hi> (as you say)<note place="margin">VI.</note> 
                  <hi>an inequality in their government, in making the Pastor superiour to the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</hi> &amp;c. and if they do so, why deal you against them? and why do you labour so carefully to prove against them their own practise to be lawful? though if they had not better warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t then you bring, they were ill bestead. But this is the point, Mr B. (which you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver touch) do they which hold two kindes of officers, teaching, and governing Elders, or they which hold three orders, Pastors, Teachers, and governing Elders, eyther of them both hold such a superioritie, as gives the superiour jurisdiction over the inferiour Ministers? do they make a Bishop of Bishops, or a sheepheard over a flock of sheepheards? or do they set vp any such ravenous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as devours the liberty, and power both of the people, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther officers, as your Bishops do, even as <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 41. 18. 19. 20.</note>

               <p>Now howsoever I purpose not the refutation of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in Mr B. second volume, which he might have drawen into as few lynes well nigh as he hath done leaves, had he not rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to have vttered many words, then many things: yet seing how he labours, even till sweating, to trouble the mindes of his <hi>young students,</hi> and <hi>seely countrymen,</hi> especially about the government, &amp; discipline of the Church, not caring how absurd expositions of scriptures he admits of, nor how contrary one vnto an other, so he may weaken the faith of any that way, I will not therefore alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether hold off myne hand, but will open as I goe, his vnsound dealing in this case, especially about <hi>Mat. 18. 15. 16. 17.</hi> which he will no way have meant of the piscipline or censures of the Church, &amp; the order of proceeding therein, but that Christs meaning there, is to direct the Iewes how to prosecute their suits in matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury before the heathenish Magistrates. And this he labours, <hi>p. 218. 219.</hi> and so on, to prove by many obiections, &amp; answers, yet (as
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1037:88"/>
borrowed from other mens books) so put out as other mens say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that by this meanes he himself may avoyd some part of that iust hatred, by the better sort of people, which he knowes will ly vpon this odious and vngodly glosse.</p>
               <p>First then Mr Bernard graunts, <hi>pag. 212.</hi> that Christ hath left <hi>a government</hi> in his Church, and so consequently an order for the censuring of offenders, and he accounts the contrary opinion <hi>but a familisticall conceipt,</hi> and yet this truth he cannot let passe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some vntruth at the end of it, and therefore he addes that to this <hi>familisticall conceipt, the seely Brownists are drawn by force of their own grounds,</hi> which are because <hi>they will have all</hi> in the Church <hi>to be voluntary professours; where voluntarynes is taken away by being vnder any government: to be subiect, &amp; ruled is an estate far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> freedome: Christians loose thereby Christian liberty,</hi> &amp;c. And say in good sooth Mr B. would you haue men vnvoluntary professours against their wills, their profession must eyther be voluntary, with their wills, or vnvolun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and against them. <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Gen. 9. 27</note> 
                  <hi>Noah</hi> prophesying the calling of the Gentiles of Iaphets line, foretells, that <hi>God will allure or perswade them to dwell in Shems tents.</hi> And the scriptures do expressely affirme, that the Churches were gathered by <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 28. 24. 2 Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>perswasion,</hi> &amp; <hi>voluntary submission vnto the gospel.</hi> And it is a strange thing, even above wonder, that any man should have preached so many yeares, and written so many books about religion, and yet not know, that the nature of religion is not to be constreyned, but perswaded.</p>
               <p>And tell me (Mr B.) did you subscribe the last tyme vnto your Bishops government <hi>sponte</hi> &amp; <hi>ex animo,</hi> according to the Canon, yea, or no? Of if you think that to curious a quaestion, answer me, whether you be vnder the Kings goverment voluntarily, or against your will? If against your will, it is a treacherous disposition in you: if voluntarily, or willingly, how seelely then do you (which are thus rife in imputing seelines vnto others) argue, that <hi>volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines is taken away by being vnder any government?</hi> as though all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment were tyranny, and all obedience slaverie: but reason, why Mr B. should thus speak, know I none, except it be, bycause in the Church of England the Ecclesiasticall government of &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall obedience vnto the Praelates is such, as he speakes of<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

And so passe on to the thing I che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ly intend, and that is to shew, that if there be a government left for the Ch:, and order set for the punishment of offenders by Christ the King thereof, that then this <hi>18.</hi> of <hi>Mat.</hi> is the place, where that order is to be found. Let Mr B: that I may vse his own words, Pag. 224. 225. <hi>declare where els is</hi> (not a more perfect rule, but) <hi>any rule for it</hi> left by Christ, <hi>or</hi> not <hi>any supply,</hi> but any mention made, <hi>els where</hi> &amp;c. The reasons now follow in the next place by which Mr B. would prove that Christ Iesus, <hi>Mat. 18. 15. 16. 17.</hi> speakes not of Church admonitions, and censures, but of private injuries, and the civil menaging of them.</p>
               <p>His first reason is taken from <hi>the cohaerence</hi> of these verses with<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>that which goes before in the Chapter:</hi> where <hi>Christ, admonisheth his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to take heed both of the offences that should be given, as also of offending others.</hi> True Mr B. for the meaning of Christ was not onely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them against the manisold scandals, and stumbling stones of offence (especially in the new kingdom to which he prepared the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>) which Satan would cast before them every step they took, eyther to turne them out of the way of life, or to stop them in it: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to lay strayt charge vpon them, that they for their parts cast no stumbling blocks before others: admonishing them very severely neyther easily to take nor to give offence. And because through pride in our selves, and contempt of others we are imboldened to give offence, especially to them, in whom we behold any great infirmities, our saviour Christ proceeds to shew what great care the Lord takes for the meanest of his, and what account he makes of them, teaching them all moderation and compassion towards them in their infirmities. But least any should then say, if it be so, the best way is to let men alone in their sinnes, Christ prescribes a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1037:89"/>
remedy for this evill, even that golden mean, v. 15. 16. 17. that we should neyther be bitter or rigorous towards them to cause them to scandalize, nor yet so remisse, as by connivency to flatter them in their sinnes.</p>
               <p>For the occasion of the words, &amp; the Argument taken from it,<note place="margin">II.</note> bycause the authour puts it downe, not as he proves it to be, but <hi>as it is thought,</hi> I passe it by as one of the thoughts spoken of by the wise man, in the Prov. and with it the scope, which he tells vs, <hi>is held to be a moderating of the Iewes passion for private iniuries offred,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both together, &amp; with them the exposition also in the 4. place, as being onely so many beggings of the quaestion in hand. The sum of which exposition is (for to relate all Mr Bernards words were too tedious) that <hi>if one Iew offred an other iniury, and would not satisfy him when he required it, eyther privately or with a witnes or two, the party iniured was to complayne to the Iewish Synedrion, and if that would not serve the turne, he might if he would proceed with him, and bring him before the Romayn power, and sue him at Caesars <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>arr, as if he were a publican, or heathen.</hi> The reasons novv to prove this interpretation follovv. And <hi>the first is because Christ spake accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no the tyme, as Mat. 5. 23. 26.</hi> It followes not that because Christ so spake that one tyme, and in that one place, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he so speaks here. What is lesse forceable? 2. As Christ in that place spake <hi>both ecclesiastically and civily,</hi> as you expresly affirm, so, if you graunt in proportion, that he speakes here both civily for injuries, and ecclesiastically for sinnes, you speak truth enough at the least to overthrow your self.</p>
               <p>Your second and third proofs taken from <hi>Peters vnderstanding of Christ, and Christs answer againe in the parable</hi> (though it were no straunge thing for Peter to vnderstand that civily, which Christ spake spiritually, nor for Christ to reply according to the present vnderstanding) do not shew that Christs speach is to be restreyned to personall iniuries: the contrary shall appeare by, and by: And the same answer may serve to the 4. and 6. Argument.</p>
               <p>The fifth Argument is taken from the <hi>propriety of speach in the text:</hi> as first because Christ sayth, <hi>against thee, which</hi> (say you) <hi>shewes the offence to be private,</hi> &amp;c. I graunt it, and that Christ there fetches
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1037:89"/>
his beginning from private, or rather from secret offences, and sinnes, which being knowen vnto one onely, may by one be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Your second Argument is drawne from this terme <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which shewes</hi> (say you) <hi>that Christ meant the Iewes, whom alone both the Iewes and disciples of Christ did account brethren.</hi> If Christ meant onely Iewes, what makes it matter, if the Iewes onely were brethren, that is of the Church? but it is not true you say, that onely Iewes were accounted brethren by the disciples of Christ at that time: Christ shewes that they which beleeve, and obey his words, are his, and so his disciples <note n="*" place="margin">Math. 12. 49. 50.</note> 
                  <hi>brethren</hi> as did amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <note n="â€ " place="margin">Ioh. 4. 39. 41. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>many of the Samaritans,</hi> which were no Iewes, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time. That these words <hi>thou hast gayned or wonne thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, shew an alienation of mind in the party that doth the iniurie,</hi> is idle, as the former. For the alienation of mind will rather be in him that hath received the injurie, which a man may do of ignorance, self love, covetousnes, or other by regards, without any change of his affection towards the person injured: the words in truth shew, that the lost sheep is found, the sinner converted. The next words are, <hi>let him be to thee, which,</hi> you tell vs, <hi>shewes such a Church as the offender might not regard, and so the plantiffe vnremyed might seek further.</hi> If you meane by these words <hi>might not regard,</hi> that he might lawfully not regard it, you erre; if that he might be so wicked, as not to regard, it is no new thing for wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to disregard the Church of Christ. Your addition of <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missing to further proceeding,</hi> is your owne, and so I leave it to you. And the reason why Christ sayth, <hi>let him be to thee</hi> is, bycause the brother spoken to was the first and principall in the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation: as vnder the law, the accuser of the false Prophet must <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Deut. 13. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>first haue his hand vpon him,</hi> whom the rest of the people must follow in putting him to death.</p>
               <p>The last words <hi>Publican and Heathen do not declare that Christ speakes of the Iewes at that time</hi> eyther onely, or civily, but serve for other purposes, as I shall presently manifest, taking Arguments from these words, as from all the rest, to prove, that Christ here speakes of sinne, and of excommunication for sinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:1037:90"/>My first Reason I draw from the cohaerence, wherein I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly<note place="margin">I.</note> manifested, Christ speakes not of private injuries onely, but of all such scandalles, as are to be found in that streyt way to heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>: no nor of injuries at all as they hurt the outward man, but as they are sinnes, and hurt, and hinder the soul in the way of godlynes: and so by the consequence of cohaerence, (if Christs words hang one vpon an other) he speaks <hi>v. 15. 16. 17.</hi> of sinne and the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of it.</p>
               <p>2. I reason from the terme <hi>brother,</hi> which, since it apperteyned<note place="margin">II.</note> at this tyme fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the disciples, to many, which might not be brought before the Iewish Synedrion, as to the beleeving Romaynes, Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, and the like, cannot be meant as is pretended, but speaks of a religious fellowship to which any brother may be brought, of what country, or condition soever.</p>
               <p>As the word <hi>ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>artÃ¡no,</hi> turned offend, is <hi>of generall signification</hi> by<note place="margin">III.</note> your own graunt, and so cannot be restreyned to that particular kind of offence: so is it most properly vsed for sinne, and that v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually by this Evangelist. <hi>Mat. 3. 6. &amp; 9. 2. &amp; 12. 31. and 26. 28.</hi> and which is specially to be observed, when Luke would speak of trespasses, or offences as sinnes against God, he vseth this word, but when in the same place he speaks of them, as of injuries against men, he vseth another word. <hi>Ch. 11. 4.</hi> And see how soundly Mr B. deales, when he should shew that the word turned <hi>offend</hi> is not meant of sinnes, but of injuries, he brings in foure principall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters varying (as he sayth) about the word: and yet the vnadvised man considers not, that all four of them, as he himself alledges them, vnderstand it of sinne, and not one of them of injuries, &amp; so speak against him.</p>
               <p>If Christ here spake of injuries, where he sayth, <hi>if he heare thee, thou</hi>
                  <note place="margin">IIII.</note> 
                  <hi>hast wonne or gayned thy brother,</hi> he would haue sayd, thou hast wonne or gayned thy goods, or good name wherein he injuryed thee.</p>
               <p>If these words be meant of injuries, and wrongs, then Christ<note place="margin">V.</note> commaunds his disciples not to suffer wrongs at their brethrens hands, but to deal with them in the order here prescribed, for Christ expresly commaunds to tell the Church: and so Christs do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and Pauls teaching the <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 7.</note> suffring of wrong should contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1037:90"/>
the one the other.</p>
               <p>By this exposition one Iew might account an other as an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,<note place="margin">VI.</note> which was vtterly vnlawfull, he might not refuse religious communion with him in the temple, into which no heathen might come; he might not deny him a portion in the land of Canaan the type of the kingdome of heaven: he might not account or call him other then a brother, whatsoever he were, till the time came of the Iewes defraction or breaking off for vnbeleef. <hi>Act. 7. 2. &amp; 22. 1. &amp; 33. 1. Rom. 11. 17.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This interpretation confirmes a point of Anabaptistry, namely,<note place="margin">VII.</note> that it is not lawfull for brethren so remayning, to sue at Caesars barre, where it is most evident, that brethren alwayes might, and may, yea &amp; (such a case may fall out) ought to sue, without any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienation of affection, or such heathenish thought one of another, as Mr B. would have Christ in this place to commend vnto them: for even these last words <hi>let him be to thee as an heathen and publican</hi> are a commaundement, as <note n="â€ " place="margin">Mat. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>let your speach be yea, yea, nay, nay,</hi> &amp; hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds others delivered in the scriptures vnder the same form of words. And to conclude, Christ our Saviour in these words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes excommunication by the effects of it, which are, withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the brother obstinate in sinne, both in religious and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile fellowship and familiaritie, as the Iewes did withdraw both fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the Heathens, and Publicans in both. <hi>Ioh. 4. 9. Act. 10. 3. &amp; 31. 28. Luk. 15. 2. &amp; 15. 10. 11.</hi> And this very phrase Paul most clearely expounds, when he directs the Church, 1 Cor. 5. 11. <hi>not to be commingled</hi> with obstinate offenders, <hi>nor to eat with them:</hi> this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver provided, that no excommunication or other act in religion whatsoever, may dissolve eyther civil, or naturall societie.</p>
               <p>The next Reason is drawne from verse 18. where Christ ratifying<note place="margin">VIII.</note> in the hands of his Church this his power, speaks in expresse terms of <hi>binding, and loosing,</hi> not onely <hi>in earth,</hi> but <hi>in heaven</hi> also: which words, me thinks, alone should satisfie the conscience of any god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded man, (yea and stop the mouth of the most shameles) that Christ speaks of sinne, and sin onely. Yet is Mr B. neyther sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, nor silent, but replyes, <hi>that binding, and loosing in this place is not properly, or onely to be vnderstood of Christs Ministers: but is allowed</hi>

Observe further, the very sum of Mr B. answer is, that Christ speaks not here of binding, and loosing in the office of Ministerie. So we affirm, &amp; that by two or three having this power cannot be meant two or three Ministers, considered severally from the body, which alone are not the Church for any publick administration, but the officers of the Church: but by two or three are meant the meanest co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or societie of saints whether with officers, or without officers. And is this a sufficient answering of an adversary to bring sundry reasons to prove the very thing, which he affirmes?</p>
               <p>Adde to all these, that where the injuries offred to Christs disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,<note place="margin">IX.</note> and such as would respect his direction, were vsually for the profession of Christ, it had been a most idle course to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned eyther to the Iewish Synedrion, or Romish Magistracy, which would have added injurie to injurie.</p>
               <p>Lastly, where Christ, v. 23. in his answer to Peters quaestion,<note place="margin">X.</note> makes the protasis or first part of his comparison <hi>the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> which is the Church he shewes plainely, that all the while he hath spoken of Church affaires, and the carying of them. And thus much to prove that the Lord Iesus the King of his Church hath left in this 18. of Math<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> a rule, &amp; order for the punishment of offenders in it. But this tedious matter is not yet ended. For Mr B. marshals in eight fresh reasons, to force all the reformed Churches in the world with vs, to give over this hold of <hi>Mat. 18. pag. 224. 225. 226.</hi> of this his last book: the best is they are of no great strength.</p>
               <p>The first is a bare affirmation that <hi>the former exposition</hi> by me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed <hi>is true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His second Reason is bycause <hi>Christ hath erected no government</hi> in
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1037:91"/>
his Church; (for why he should adde <hi>by publick doctrine</hi> I see not, except he would insinuate, that Christ taught this point privately, and in a corner) but for this brings he no one scripture or reason: as if his bare vvord vvere enough to stablish an Idoll King in his Church, vvithout officers, or lavves. Where notvvithstanding in his former book, <hi>pag 90. 91. 92. 93.</hi> he proves by many scriptures that Christ hath given officers for the government of his Church: which no man denyes, but himself.</p>
               <p>In the third place he affirmes, that <hi>Christ by the Church meanes not the Iewish Synedrion,</hi> wherin I assent vnto his saying, for reason brings he none.</p>
               <p>Touching the nature of the Churches government (which he gropes at in the fourth place) I have spoken els where.</p>
               <p>The 5. Reason followeth, which comprehends vnder it many petty Reasons, and amongst other the 6, 7, and 8 in order: which save for the shew in the margent of 8. distinct numbred Reasons, might vvel enough haue ben spared. The sum is that <hi>this 18. of Mat. is no perfect rule of discipline:</hi> the reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s are bycause <hi>neyther all sorts of sins are here brought in, nor all the parts of discipline here comprehended.</hi> And hovv do these things appear? <hi>First bycause a man is here to proceed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for trespasses,</hi> or as it is better turned for offences, <hi>against himself, but not for sinne against God, against the Magistrate, or against an other.</hi> But here you should have remembred Mr B. that <note n="*" place="margin">1 Ioh. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>sin,</hi> being <hi>the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of the law,</hi> is onely against God, to speak properly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore David, notwithstanding his defiling of Bath sheba, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Vrijah confesseth that he had <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Ps. 51. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>sinned against God onely.</hi> But as the same transgression is so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mitted, as man scandalizeth, or takes offence at it<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> so it is a sinne against him: whether the deed done respect God or man, yea man or beast, publick or private person, a mans self, or others in the object: and so he may forgive it after the order prescribed by Christ. And where by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception you demaund <hi>how one man can remit trespasses done against an other?</hi> it is true it cannot be, if by trespasses be meant personall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries: but considering the same trespasses, as they are sinnes against God, at which a brother takes offence, so the brother offended may forgive them vpon the offenders repentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:1037:92"/>And asking <hi>how men can forgive rebellion against God,</hi> you seem to haue forgotten yourself: for in the very leaf next before going, you both graunt and prove that <hi>not onely Ministers by vertue of their office, but private persons also may bind and loose sinnes.</hi> The thing it self you grant, and for the manner of it, it is as they save, by manifesting, and making knowne outwardly salvation, and the forgivenes of sinnes.</p>
               <p>To your third objection concerning <hi>the keeping secret of publick crymes against the Magistrate vpon the offenders repentance,</hi> you answer yourself, for if they be publick, or of publick nature, they may not be kept secret, neyther are they capable of the order of secret dealing in them.</p>
               <p>And here falles into consideration your seventh Reason, which is, that <hi>if discipline be grounded vpon Mat. 18. then the Church must iudge in civil affaires, and enter vpon the bounds of the Magistrate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And are you ignorant Mr B. that civil actions, as they draw sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous sin, with them, may be censured ecclesiastically, as may also religious actions be punished civily by the Magistrate, which is the preserver of both tables, &amp; so to punish all breaches of both, specially such as draw with them the violation of the positive lawes of kingdomes, or disturbance of common peace? Take your own instance of murder. The Magistrate is to punish it civilly in all his subjects, whether the parties repent or no; the Church is to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure it ecclesiastically in her members, yea though the Magistrate pardon or passe by it, except the parties delinquent repent, for then they are to be forgiven. And what vsurpation is here vpon the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy? you to suppress Gods ordinance do flatter the Magistrate, and accuse the innocent.</p>
               <p>Next you except, that <hi>this of Mat. is a rule for sinnes private, and more secret, but not for publick and open sinne.</hi> You might as well say that the patterne of prayer prescribed by Christ, <hi>Mat. 6.</hi> is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, nor a rule for private prayer, or for things concerning our selves onely, bycause it teacheth vs to say, <hi>Our father,</hi> &amp; <hi>forgive vs our sinnes.</hi> But who knowes not, that generalls include their specialties vnder them? The Lord Iesus in teaching his disciples to say, forgive vs our sinnes ioyntly, teacheth them in the same place to ask for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenes eyther of their own sinnes, or the sinnes of others severally,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1037:92"/>
as occasion serves: so in teaching here all the degrees of admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ioyntly, he implyes also the dealing in any one of them several<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if there be occasion. And this exposition of Mr B. can I not fitlyer resemble then to the practise of some silly pursevant, that, being sent to attach some traytour, or other malefactour dwelling in Barwick, and so to bring him to the Court, if he should meet the party by the way, would refuse to medle with him, and would say, that he was sent to Barw: to fetch him, and would eyther bring him from thence, or would let him alone. And it seems, if Mr B. might construe his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mmission, he would so advise him. But would not common sense teach a man, that the nearer he met with the party he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ought, the more labour were spared, and that he were to apprehend him where he found him? So where Christ sends his disciples to deal with sinne a farre off, as it were, and in the first, &amp; vtmost degree, but if it be come nearer, and be found in the 2. or 3. degree, it is to be taken where it is found. If it be secret, and yet rest betwixt the brother offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ding, &amp; offended, it must there be dealt with: if it become nearer the court, and be wrought before two, or three, or more, it must there, and in that order be vndertaken, the first degree is over, and that labour spared: if it be of publick na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or publikly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mitted, the two former degrees are past, and the labour in them spared: the sin must be dealt with accordingly. And the Church eyther by information from any brother or bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, or by immediate notice taken, may convent or call for the offender, that he which sinned publikly, may publiquely be rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And this may serue for answer to the 8. and last exception.</p>
               <p>Now for <hi>allowing of the plaintiffe to seek further remedy,</hi> &amp; <hi>of the refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the party obstinate vnto him,</hi> which is the sum of the sixt Arg: as also of these terms, <hi>let him be to thee as an heathen and publican,</hi> which is an other exception, together with that consideration, that <hi>the party offended is the principall in all the degrees of proceeding,</hi> I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly spoken in the exposition of the words, to which the reader is to look back for answer, if such idle conjecture give any cause of doubt to any. One onely blow more is to be warded, by which Mr B. would disable this 18. of Math. from being any rule of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and that is, bycause it provides <hi>not for suspension,</hi> we grant it
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1037:93"/>
doth not: and you your self half graunt, that no such thing is to be found in the new testament. And what reason haue you, or any other man to put vs to prove your corruptions and devises, which you know we neyther practise, nor allow of?</p>
               <p>These things thus ended, and the received exposition of <hi>Math. 18.</hi> confirmed, viz: that Christ in it prescribes a rule of discipline in the Church, I come to your reasons Mr B. in your first book by which you would prove that this Church is the chief governours.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p>The first whereof is, that <hi>Christ could not be understood eyther then,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. B.</note> 
                  <hi>or now, except he spake as the practise was then, or took some order afterward,</hi> and so you go about to prove vnto vs, that <hi>the chief governours onely had authoritie to excommunicate, both in the synagogues and in the Church of Corinth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I answer sundry things. First it followes not, that<note place="margin">Answ.</note> Christ was not then, or cannot now be vnderstood, except he spake with some such reference as you note. The words are so plaine, the order so equall, the state of the Church vnder the new testament (which is not, as before, nationall, but a particular as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly) so capable of such an ordinance, as that laying aside pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and politick respects, there can be nothing more playne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spoken or more easily vnderstood.</p>
               <p>2. It doth no way prejudice the exposition we give, though the disciples for the present vnderstood it not: they vnderstood litle, no not touching the death and resurrection of Christ, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his kingdome when they were at the first taught them, till eyther by their own experience, or by the extraordinary gift of the Holy Ghost, or some other meanes, the thinges formerly taught them were brought to their remembrance. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 21. 22. &amp; 20. 20. 21. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 14. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 20. 21. 22â€”25. 26. -44. And it is expressely affirmed, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 3. that the Lord Iesus did the 40. dayes before his ascension <hi>instruct them in such things as concerned the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God,</hi> which is the Church.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be considered is your proofs from scripture, that the power of excommunication was in the chief governours. But the places proove no such thing. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 22. <hi>and</hi> 12. 42. &amp; 16. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>

                  <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> do onely prove an agreement amongst the Iewes, that such as
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1037:93"/>
confessed Christ should be dissynagogued: but that this authority was onely in the hands of the chief governours, cannot be thence collected. I know there was at Ierusalem a representative Church for the whole nation, of which we shall speak hereafter, but that there was such a Church representative in every synagogue, furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with such power can never be concluded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> these scriptures. They rather in deed prove the contrarie. It is sayd <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 22. that the Iewes had ordeyned, that such as confessed Christ, should be dissynagogued: which words do rather interest the people in the busines then otherwise. If you think, that because there is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made of <note n="â€ " place="margin">vers. 13. 15. 16. &amp; Ch. 12. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>the Pharisees,</hi> the officers onely are meant, you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. For Pharisaism amongst the Iewes was not an office, but a sect. There were no other lawfull officers ecclesiasticall amongst them, but <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Lev. 8. Num. 3. 12. 13. &amp; 8. 14. 16. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>the Levites</hi> whom <hi>the Lord took from among the children of Israel in stead of the first borne for his service:</hi> but many of the Pharisees, were of other tribes. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
               <p>Besides, I see no sufficient reason to perswade me, that this casting out of the synagogue was any ecclesiasticall censure, but rather a violent rejection or extrusion out of the place: as nothing was more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon then such tumultuous outrages in those dayes. And the very same word that Iohn vseth, ch. 9. ver. 35. Luke vseth ch. 4. 28. 29. for the violent extrusion of Christ himself by the Iewes, vpon the like occasion, both out of the synagogue, and citie. The same also doth Iohn himself vse, ch. 2. 15. speaking of Christs casting<note place="margin">

                  </note> the mony chaungers out of the temple. And yet neyther the NAZARITES excommunicate CHRIST, nor CHRIST the mony-chaungers.</p>
               <p>But if there were amongst the Iewes at that tyme any such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct ordinance of excommunication ecclesiasticall, it was a Iewish devise, (I am perswaded) and without ground of the scriptures: and that for these causes.</p>
               <p>First every blasphemer, or worshipper of vnknowen Gods<note place="margin">I.</note> was by the law of Moses to dy the death without redemption, that so evill might be put from Israell, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 20. <hi>Lev.</hi> 24. 16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 6. 7. 8. 9â€”12. 13. 14. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:1037:94"/>And so the Iewes reputing this blind man such a one, were to put him to death: but being deprived of this power by the Romayns, through the just judgement of God for their sinnes, they devised this other course of dissynagogueing, or excommunicating offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours by them so deemed.<note place="margin">II.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly the severall synagogues were not distinct Churches, but members of that one nationall Church, which was both repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatively, and originally at Ierusalem: neyther could any of them excommunicate out of the temple, which was a higher communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then theirs: and so it is very probable that Christ found this blind man afterwards in the temple, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 38. compared with 10. 22. into which (had he been ecclesiastically excommunicated) he might not haue entred: neyther hangs it together, that any reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the communion of the synagogue, might be received in the communion of the temple.<note place="margin">III.</note>
               </p>
               <p>3. The Lord did chuse the whole nation of the Iewes to be his peculiar people, and took all and every one of them into covenant with himself, gave them the Land of Canaan for an inheritance, as a type of the kingdome of heaven, erected a policy over them, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, &amp; ecclesiasticall, in the judiciall &amp; ceremonial law, called the old testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, making the same persons &amp; all of them, though in divers respects the Church, &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon wealth, whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the Church is also called the common wealth of Israel. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 5. 6. <hi>Lev.</hi> 20. 24. 26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 6. 7. &amp; 29. 2. 10. 11. 12. <hi>Ios.</hi> 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4 <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. 12. Hence it followeth, that except a man might enjoy one type of the kingdom of heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, as was the Land of Canaa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, &amp; not an other, as was the temple, or tabernacle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. except he might be vnder one part of the old testament, or covenant of God, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the judicial law for the common wealth, and not vnder an other part of it, the ceremoniall law for the Church, it cannot be that any such ordinance as excommunication could be vsed lawfully in the Iewish Church.</p>
               <p>Yet do I not deny but that the lepers &amp; other persons legally vnclean were for a time debarred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of the Church, and from all the sacrifices, and services thereof, but this inhibition say I, was no way in the nature of an excommunication.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:1037:94"/>For first it was for ceremoniall vncleannes, issues, leprosy, and the like, which were not sinnes, but punishments of sinnes at the most.</p>
               <p>2. It did not onely exclude men from the communion of the Church, but of the common wealth also, and the affaires thereof.</p>
               <p>3. It did not agree in the end with excommunication. The end of excommunication is the repentance of the party exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. but the person legally vncleane, whether he repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or no, was to bear his shame till the date of his time were out, yea to his dying day, if his disease continued so long. <hi>Lev.</hi> 12. &amp; 13. &amp; 14. <hi>Num.</hi> 5. 2. 3. 4. &amp; 12. 10. 14. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 19. 20. 21. A type I confesse it was of excommunication, as legall pollution was of morall sin: whence I also conclude that the type, and thing typed outwardly could not both stand together.</p>
               <p>But here it vvilbe demaunded of me, did not the Lord require in the Iewish Church true, morall, and spirituall holynes also? God forbid I should run vpon that desperate rock of Anabaptistry. <hi>The</hi>

                  <hi>Lord was holy then as now, and so would have his people be then holy, as now.</hi> Yea so jealous was the Lord over his people that he took order then as well as now, that no sin should be suffered vnrefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, no obstinate sinner vncut off.

You make an erroneous collection from it out of your owne lamentable experience. Bycause your Church of Worxsop can reforme no abuse within it self, but must complain to your Lords grace of York<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> or his substitute, therfore you imagine the Church of Corinth to have been in the same bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, wherein you are: and Cloe to have complayned to Pauls court. But it is playn Mr B. to them that do not shut their eyes, and harden their hearts against the truth: that the Church of Corinth was planted in the liberty of the gospell, and had this power of Christ to reform abuses, and to excommunicate offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, without sending to Paul from one part of the world to an other, and that the Corinthians <hi>Ch.</hi> 5. are reproved for fayling in this duty. And had Mr B. but taken this course in his writing, that two of his leaves had hung together, he might have spared this objection, considering what he writ, pag. 92. <hi>that the same persons have the power to preach, administer the sacraments, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate:</hi> for that he meanes by government. Now he cannot be ignorant, that both the power, and practise of preaching, &amp; administring the sacraments were in the Church of Corinth in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1037:95"/>
Pauls absence. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20. &amp; 14. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so by your own graunt the Church of Corinth had power to excommunicate though Paul were absent. Wherevpon I also infer it was their sinne not to vse it.</p>
               <p>Now for the practise of <hi>Cloes family,</hi> wee know Paul was an Apostle, and generall Officer, and so intitled to the affaires in all the Churches in the world: wherevpon Cloe complayned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him of such abuses in the Church as were both of publick na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and which the Church vvould not reform: otherwise it had been both slaunder, and solly to have complayned. And what corne doth this winde shake? Do wee make it vnlawfull for any member to informe the officers of publique enormities in the Church, that they according to their places might see reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them? Yea if the Pastor, or other principall Officer of the Church were absent necessarily, we doubt not but it were the duety of any brother, or brethren in the like case, to entreat their help for the direction, reproofe, and reformation of the Church, for any publick enormities there done, or suffered: who might also judge, and condemne the same themselves, and for their parts, exhorting, and directing the whole Church in their publique meeting to do the like as Paul did.</p>
               <p>Your three next Arguments to prove that tell the Church, is tell the Officers, are idle descants vpon the formes, and phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of speach scraped together to fill your book with.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <p>First you affirm that <hi>Christ having spoken in the third</hi>

                  <hi>person tell the Church when he comes to ratify the authoritie to be committed to his Apostles, turnes his speach to the</hi> 2. <hi>person, not saying, what it, but what you shall bind, and loose, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In so saying you give the cause, though you presently eat vp<note place="margin">Answ.</note> your own graunt. For you affirm, that by the Church<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> ver. 17. is meant the whole body, of which Christ speaks in the third person: and what say wee more? But where you adde that the authoritie is not given till the 18. vers. and that then Christ turns his speach to his Apostles, it is your own devised glosse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:1037:96"/>For first it is evident, that Christ establisheth the power of binding, and loosing in the hands of the Church, speaking in the 3. person, <hi>v.</hi> 17. &amp; that so firmely, as what brother soever refuseth to heare her voice is to be expelled from all religious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion. Vnto this the 18. <hi>v.</hi> is added partly for explanation, and partly for confirmation. For where as the party admonished might say with himself, well, if the Church disclaim mee, I shall disclaym it, if it condemn me, I shall condemn it again, the Lord doth here back the Churches censures for her incouragement, and for the terrour of the refractary, despising her voice, and that vnder a contestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that what she bindes, and looseth vpon earth, (namely after his will) he also will bind, and loose in heaven.</p>
               <p>And for the <hi>change of persons</hi> in the 17. and 18, verses, it is mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grammaticall, and not naturall. It is common with the Holy Ghost, sometimes for elegancy, sometimes for explication, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for further inforcement of the same thing, to, and vpon the same persons, thus to vary the phrase of speach in the first, second, or third person grammatically, as the reader may take a tast in these particulars. <hi>Psal.</hi> 75. 1. <hi>Is.</hi> 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. <hi>&amp;c.

            <div type="section">
               <p>Your 3. Reason, that, <hi>bycause Christ speakes of a few, two, or three</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. B.</note> 
                  <hi>gathered together, therefore he meanes the officers of the Church, and not all the body,</hi> is of no force, if the body consist but of two, or three, as<note place="margin">Answ.</note> it comes to passe, where Churches are raysed in persecution, as the most true Churches are. Yet if Christ do speak of two or three officers of a Church, gathered together in his name, he speaks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, where all the power of the keyes over many 1000. Churches are in the hands of two Arch-Prelates, and from them delegated and derived to their severall vnderlings.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, that gratious promise, which Christ here layes downe, for the comfort of all his saints, you do engrosse into the hands of a few Elders. You might aswel affirme, that onely two or three officers gathered together, have a promise to be heard in their prayers, and not a communion of two or three brethren, for Christ, <hi>v.</hi> 19. 20. speakes principally, and expressely of prayer,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1037:96"/>
though with reference to the binding, and loosing of sin, which (as all other ordinances) are sanctified by prayer. The very scope of the place, and reason of the speach is this. The Lord Iesus had v: 18. enfranchised the Church, with a most excellent, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable priveledge: now the disciples did already see with their own eyes, and were more fully taught by their Maister, that the Church should arise from small, and base beginnings, and that it was also, by reason of persequution, subject to great dissipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Math.</hi> 7. 14. &amp; 10. 17. 18. 22. 23. &amp; 13. 31. 32. least therefore their harts should be discouraged, and they, or others, driven into suspition, that the Lord would any way neglect them, or his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise towards them for their paucity, and meannes, he most grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously prevents, and frees them from that jealousy, &amp; telles them and all others, for their comfort, that though the Church, or assembly consist but of two or three (as such beginnings the true Church of God had and have, (though your English Church begu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> with a kingdome in a day) <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 14. 15. &amp; 17. 34. &amp; 19. 7. yet that should no way diminish their power, or prejudice the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of his promise. And the reason hath been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rendred, bycause this power for binding, &amp; loosing, being given to the fayth of Peter, depends not vpon the order of office, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of people, or dignity of person, but merely vpon the word of God. And hence is it that Christ thus gratiously descends even to <hi>two or three, wheresoever assembled in his name,</hi> yea though it be in a Cave, or Den of the earth: of which most gratious and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary priveledge you would bereave them.</p>
               <p>Now in your 4. Reason out of <hi>v.</hi> 19, you do most ignorantly erre in the gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maticall construction: for you make a <hi>change of the person agayne,</hi> where there is no change at all. Christ speakes onely in the third person, as the originall makes it plaine, though the English tongue do not so distinctly manifest it to an ignorant man. Christ sayth not, whatsoever you two shall agree of, shalbe given to them, that is to the Church, but whatsover two of you shall agree of, or consent in, they two that so agree shall obteyne it of God. Which words (Mr B.) you do most vnsufferably pervert, to the sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the ignorant: as if Christ had sayd, if two, or three of you
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1037:97"/>
officers, or you two or three officers, shall agree together of a thing, whatsoever they, that is the Church shall desire, namely of the Officers (for so you expound the words) it shalbe give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> them. where it is most evident that they which are to agree vpon the thing, they are to ask it, and that of God, who will give it them. And where the scripture sayth, that the brother offended (speaking indefinitely of any brother, and so of the Officers themselves) must complayn to the Church, M B. on the contrary (as if he would even beard the Lord Iesus) tells vs the Church must com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playn to the Officers.</p>
               <p>Your 5. Reason followes with many litle ones in the womb of it, which you bring forth in order, to prove, that Christ speakes <hi>here figuratively,</hi> and that by the Church he means the governours.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p>The first is. <hi>It agrees with the practise of the Iewish Church fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> whence</hi>

               <p>And is this the <hi>necessary</hi> proof you speak of? whatsoever is so<note place="margin">Answ.</note> held, is so in truth. And yet in your second book, as hath been shewed, you bring in sundry men holding contrary things, as if contraries could be true. Well, I confesse it is so held, and that by many, with whom I would gladly consent, if the scriptures taught me not to hold otherwise. It had been good here the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour had shewed vs, what the government of the Iewish Church was, and not thus sleightily to have passed over things of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For the purpose in hand thus much.</p>
               <p>The Church of the Iewes was a nationall Church, <note n="â€ " place="margin">Exod. 19. 5. 6. Lev. 20. 24. 26. Deut. 29. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lord separating vnto himself the whole natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> all other nations, to be his people, and that he might be their God.</hi> And as one of the Lords ordinances suits with an other, and depends vpon an other, so from this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Church doth necessarily arise a representative Church. For where communion together in the holy things of God is an act, and operation of the Church, for the mutuall aedification of the parts, and that it was impossible, that the whole body of a nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should in the intire, simple, proper, or personall parts, &amp; mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers communicate togeither, the Lord so ordered and disposed, that that communion should be had, and exercised after a manner, and in a sort, and that was by way of representation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:1037:97"/>And to this end the Lord made <hi>choise of one speciall place in the land, which he gave his people to possesse,</hi> at the first alterable, but afterwards constant, and vnchangeable, where he would haue his tabernacle pitched, and his temple built, where he would put his name, and dwell, and which he would honour above all places, with his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and presence.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now all these were ordinances representative, in a Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative: and other Church representative amongst the Iewes, I neyther know, not acknowledge. And the ground of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation was the necessary absence of the people represented. Necessary, I call it, whether we respect the ordinance of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting the peoples entrance into the place, where the most of these representations were made, or whether wee respect the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of the whole nations ordinarie assembling, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating together.</p>
               <p>And herevpon it comes to passe, that all other Churches since, so framed, and of such qualitie, as that they cannot ordinarily as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble together, &amp; keep communion, haue also as their images, or
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1037:98"/>
shadowes, their Churches representative. The catholik visible Ch: of Rome hath her visible Ch: representative, the Popes Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sistory, or Colledge of Cardinalls, or the generall Council gathered by his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. The nationall Church of Engl:, hath her nationall Church representative, the Convocation house: as have also the Provinciall and Diocesan Churches their representations, the Archbishops, &amp; Bishops Consistories. But as the bodyes of these Churches are monstrous devises of mens braynes, (there being no other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches vnder the new testament but particular assemblies) so are their shadowes, (the Churches representative) mere devises of devises.</p>
               <p>And to apply this nearer the purpose. Since the Church now consisteth not of one nation severed from all other nations, but of particular assemblies of faithfull people, separated from all other assemblies, which like so many distinct <note n="â€ " place="margin">Act <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>flockes,</hi> do ordinarily heard together, and so communicate in the word, prayer, sacraments, &amp; censures, and that where the Church grew sometimes greater by the suddayne, and extraordinary conversion of more then could well so assemble, then was there presently a dispersion of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and a multiplication of more particular assemblies. Act. 2. 41. 42. &amp; 8. 4. 5. 6. &amp; 9. 31. &amp; 14. 23. 27. &amp; 15. 22. 30. Rev. 1. 4. 11. this rases the foundation of all representative Churches, as eyther politick devises, or at the best, praeposterous imitations of the Iewish Church, and polity. For (as I have formerly sayd, and common sense teacheth it) the foundation of representation is the necessary absence of that which is represented, whether person, or thing. And so since there is no necessity, that the body of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church should be absent, but on the contrary a necessity, that the same be present, at and in all the publick administrations, and actions of communion in the Churches holy things, we do therefore disclaym as supersluous, and feyned, all representative Churches whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Secondly if the outward form of Church government now be fetched from the Iewish Church, then as in that representative Ch: there was an high Preist set over the rest, in whose person, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration, the representation of the whole Church was most eminent, so must there now be also in this representative Church
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1037:98"/>
one officer over the rest, and as it were their high Preist. And so the catholik representative Church of Rome hath an vniversall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop the Pope over it: the Nationall, Provinciall, and Diocesan, Churches representative, Nationall, Provinciall, and Diocesan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops over them. And so in all equitie should the Synodes, and Praesbyteries, accounting themselves properly Churches, or bodies Ecclesiasticall, have their Officers over them: and so there should alwayes be one, or more Ministers over the Church of Ministers, and whose charge these Synodes and Presbyteries should be, to be fed by them. And the truth is, this reason fetcht from the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Church, as it far better fitts the Praelates in England, then the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sistorians, so fitts it the Papists better then eyther of them both: for there is one Bishop over the catholick visible Church (as they speak) as there was one high Preist over the whole visible Ch: then.</p>
               <p>Adde vnto this, that if the representative Church at Ierusalem be a pattern for a representative Church vnto vs, then as there not onely hard causes were opened, &amp; declared according to the law, but also the sacrifices offred, and most solemne services performed day, by day, without the presence of the body of the Church, so now in this our representative Church consisting of the officers onely, there must be not onely the vse of the keyes for admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, and excommunication, but there must also be the preaching of the word, and ministring of the sacraments, (which are our most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn services) whether the people be present or no. And to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a power of Christ in the Church of the officers for the vse of one solemne ordinance out of the communion of the body, &amp; not for an other, hath no ground from the Iewish Church.</p>
               <p>Lastly, to fetch the form of goverme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t for the Church now fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the Iewish Church, were to revive <note n="â€ " place="margin">Heb. 8. 13</note> 
                  <hi>the old testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t,</hi> which so long since, is <hi>abrogated, and disanulled.</hi> For to speak properly the old testament is nothing but that externall policy instituted by Moses in the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall &amp; ceremoniall law, for the dispensation of the typicall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Preisthood of Christ, shadowed out by that of <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Heb. 5. &amp; 6.</note>

of those worldly, and carnall ordinances. Now as the judicialls, (which were for the government of the Congregation civily) are dead, and do not bind any civil polity, save as they were of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon equity: so are the ceremonialls, (which were for the Ch: polity) deadly: and may not be revived by any Church, save as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them have new life given by Christ. For though we now be made <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Eph. 2. 12. and 3. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>citizens of the common wealth of Israell, and one body with them,</hi> yet is that in respect of <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 17. 7.

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1037:99"/>
for these Nationall, and Provinciall Synodes, &amp; the like. And the scripture is, Act. 15.</p>
               <p>1. There was no synode, or assembly of the Officers of divers Churches, but onely certayne messengers sent from the church of Antiochia, to the Church of Ierusalem about the controversy there specified.</p>
               <p>2. Neyther the Church of Antioch which sent the messengers, nor the church at Ierusalem whether they were sent, was a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative church, consisting of Officers, much lesse of chief of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers onely. For first it is sayd, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. 2. that the brethren of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochia, which <hi>Ch.</hi> 14. 17. are called the church, and <hi>v.</hi> 28. the disciples, and in this chapt. <hi>v.</hi> 3. the church, and <hi>v.</hi> 23. the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren sent their messengers with Paul and Barnabas to Ierusalem: and it will most evidently appeare by whom the message was sent, if we consider to whom the answer was returned. <hi>ver.</hi> 30. where the messengers did not deliver the Epistle till they had assembled the multitude. And 2. it is apparant that at Ierusalem, not onely the cheif officers the Apostles, yea and inferiour officers the Elders al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, met together about it, and sent answer, but the brethren with them. <hi>v.</hi> 4. 12. 22.</p>
               <p>And these scriptures alone in this chapt. are sufficient to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendge the liberty of the brethren in the discussing of publique co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies out of the hands of all officers whatsoever.</p>
               <p>3. Paul and Barnabas, went not to Ierusalem eyther for autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or direction; for being Apostles, they had both equall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate authority from Christ, and equall infallible direction fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the holy Ghost, with the rest of the Apostles. Onely they went for countenance of the truth in respect of men, and for the stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the mouthes of such deceivers as pretended they were sent by the Apostles. <hi>v.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>4. Their decrees were absolutely Apostolicall, and divine scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by infallible direction from the holy Ghost, and so imposed vpon all other Churches of the Gentiles, though they had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of the Church, or Churches, and so be called a Church, Synode, or the like? I deny it not, so they infringe no order of Christ, or liberty of the brethren, they may so do, and so be called in a sense: but the quaestion now is about such a Church, as is gathered for the publick administration of admonition, excommunication, &amp; other the like ordinances of Christ, which Mr B. in his first book graunts <note n="â€œ" place="margin">pag. 92.</note> 
                  <hi>must be done with the knowledge of the body of the Church, &amp; and in the open assembly.</hi>

               <p>And here falls into handling certayn borrowed stuffe <note n="â€ " place="margin">pag. 178.</note> in Mr B. 2. book about this matter.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p>As first, that <hi>Paul called the Elders of Ephesus, and conferred with them</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr B.</note> 
                  <hi>without the people,</hi> Act. 20. 27. which who denyes, but they which set vp a Lord Bishop to rule alone without advising with eyther<note place="margin">Answer.</note> the inferiour Ministers, or people.</p>
               <p>But that, which he addes in the next place, hath almost as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny errours, as wordes in it, and that is, that <hi>the Elders sate in a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory, with Iames their Bishop at Ierusalem, without the people, and did decree a matter, without asking their voice. Act.</hi> 21. 18.</p>
               <p>First you erre in calling it <hi>a Consistory,</hi> or juditiall Court, for the justification of your own: where it was onely an occasionall meeting for advise. 2. in making Iames a <hi>Bishop</hi> whom Christ had made an Apostle. The Elders were Bishops, Act. 20. 17. 28. Phil. 1. 1. Tit. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>. 7. And so if you would haue held any proportion you should haue made Iames an Archbishop. 3. that you make him <hi>their Bishop,</hi> where Bishops, or Overseers, are set over the flock, not over the Ministers, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. 4. And most ignorantly, where you will have Iames &amp; the Elders to make a decree for Paul, as if the Elders had authority over the Apostles (for that is the drift of your argument) or one Apostle over an other: or as if Paul were subject to Consistorian decrees. It was onely a matter of advise, that passed amongst them, as all men may see.</p>
               <p>An other observation Mr B. hath in this place, as idle as the rest: and that is, that <hi>the Elders are superiour vnto the people, bycause they are set before them, Act.</hi> 15. 22. 23. where if the bould and inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate man had but read the 4. verse of the same Chapt: he should have seen the people set before the Officers: the very same alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1037:100"/>
appeares <hi>ver.</hi> 2. &amp; 12. so if his argument was of force, two contraries might be true, which is a repugnancy in nature. Yet deny we not but the officers are above the Church, in respect of the word, and doctrine they minister, and teach: but we deny the order of Elders to be superiour to the order of saynts, since it is not an order of Maystership, but of service.</p>
               <p>But I will from this place, Mr B. (if I be not much deceived) take a better argument to prove the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>trary to that you say, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Church is an order superiour vnto the officers. And the reason is, bycause the Churches have authority to send the officers, as their messengers, v. 2. 3. 22. 32. Now they that send are ever in that respect, superiour vnto them that are sent.</p>
               <p>That which you adde in the last place, to wit, that <hi>the Apostles &amp; Elders did acquaint the people with the matter, who consented, but had no authority to make the authority of the Apostles, &amp; Elders nothing,</hi> is drawn out of the same cask with the former. In which speach, there is imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, &amp; ignorance. Imperfection, wher you give the people no further liberty then to consent to the matter, being made acquainted with it. For in that it is sayd, ver: 12. that the <hi>multitude kept silence</hi> when they had heard Iames speak truly, &amp; suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, and that <hi>they held their peace,</hi> v: 13. when they heard Paul and Barnabas speak, it shewes they had also liberty of speaking in the matter, had they seen cause. Contradictions you speak, in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the people were to consent to the Elders, &amp; yet in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they could praejudice their power, &amp; authority. For howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this be true for the Apostles, which were infallibly, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately directed by the H. Ghost in their determinations, vnto which all were bound absolutely to condiscend, as are all the saynts at the last day to the judgement to be passed by Christ vpon the reprobate, yet is it not so for the Elders ordinary, then, or now, which may erre, and be deceived. And so where there is liberty of consenting conditionally, and if men see cause, there is also li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of dissenting, vpon the contrary occasion: and so this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the body must eyther hinder the action, or els it is a mere mockery. Ignorance it is, in the last place to make equall the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Apostles, and Elders in this decree. For the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1037:101"/>
was merely Apostolicall (to speak properly) and framed by infallible direction of the Holy Ghost, (which the Elders in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves considered had not) as appeareth, ver. 28. and was, and is, in the right end, and equitie of it, a part of the canonicall scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in penning whereof the Elders had no hand: and so is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vpon the Churches of the Gentiles every where, ver. 23. with whom the Elders of Ierusalem had nothing to do, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Apostles, which were generall men: so that neyther brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, nor Elders did more then consent to the decree it self, &amp; that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily, as vnto a divine oracle.</p>
               <p>These things thus ended, I return to the Arguments in Mr Ber. first book to prove by the Ch: to be meant the cheif Officers.</p>

               <p>Now the inconveniency of carelesnes in all, where matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne all, is a strange allegation. Me thinks it should make all more carefull, the matters especially being of conscience, and the persons consionable, whom they concern. And I see not but you might as well say, it makes all men careles of the knowledge of God, and Christ, and of salvation, and of the scriptures, bycause these things concern all. And why do you not with the Papists de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the multitude of the vse of the scriptures in the mother tongue, that you the carefull Clergy alone might look vnto them? But what though this inconveniency do arise sometimes, through mans corruption, it should be otherwise: and wee must ever co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of the nature of Gods ordinances in their right vse, &amp; when men are exercised in them as they should be, and not according to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And in this plea, Mr Bernard, me thinks you very naturally resemble the mighty oppressours in the world, which vnder this very pretence, do inclose all the commons of their poore neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: for <hi>common things</hi> (say they) <hi>are commonly neglected:</hi> &amp; they can make one aker of ground, thus inclosed, worth two in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon. But if the Lord denounce such heavy judgments against the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of earthly things, Is. 5. 8. 9. what wilbe the end of those spirituall ingrossers and oppressours, if they repent not? And for <hi>pride and contention,</hi> as they and a thowsand worse evils could not but fall out in a Church gathered as yours is, of all the prophane rable in a kingdome, so when they do arise in a true Church, there is power to voyd them out, and the persons with them, in whom they reigne. But if the vnlawfulnes of a Church government might be proved by the pryde, contention, &amp; the like evils arising in it, then surely M B. you that know so well how these and other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheifs reign in your own, should lay your hand on your mouth for shame, and be affrayd to provoke any man to medle in that matt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Touching the exception of confusion, I desire the reader to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member<note place="margin">Ans.</note> what hath been formerly answered: adding further, that Mr B. herein doth not oppose vs but the Apostles, and Apostolicall Churches governed by them: yea the H. Ghost it self propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their examples for our imitation. The Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 1. 15. <hi>&amp;c. standing vp in the middest of the disciples (which were about an hundred and twenty) spake to them about the choise of one to succeed Iudas:</hi> and it is sayd, ver. 23. that <hi>they,</hi> that is, these brethren to whom he spake, <hi>presented two:</hi> as also that <hi>the whole multitude,</hi> Act. 6. 5. <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the seaven for Deacons to the twelve Apostles,</hi> who are sayd, v. 2. to haue called the multitude, and to have spoken vnto them, &amp; <hi>v. 6.</hi> to have prayed, and layd hands on the elect Deacons. Now might not any prophane spirit take vp M.

They must needs speak in presenting these two, <hi>and spake they ioyntly, or all at once? this were confusion contrary to</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 14. <hi>did the women speak? they must not medle in Church matters,</hi>

                  </hi> v. 6. here were
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:1037:102"/>
the like confusion; and besides here were women, and children in the Church also. Now let the indifferent reader judge, what M. B. hath sayd more against vs, then any Lucian or scoffing Atheist might obiect against the spirit of God himself, and his holy pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the Evangelist.</p>
               <p>Yea further, by these and the like consequences, women and children are vtterly excluded from the Church, as no parts of it.</p>
               <p>Luke sayth, Act. 15. 22. that the <hi>whole Church sent</hi> messengers <hi>to Antiochia,</hi> and Paul 1 Cor. 14. 23. speakes of <hi>the whole Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches comming together in one</hi> to exercise themselves in prayer, prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sying, and the like parts of Church communion; but children ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could send messengers, nor pray, nor prophesie, nor the like, and women might not speak in the Church; and therefore both they must be <hi>left out of the Church, and if one part why not an other, &amp; so till we come to the cheif of the congregation,</hi> that they alone may be the Church, and all in all? &amp; as it is iust with God, that he which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the truth, should oppose himself also, so doth Mr B. in this very place inta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>gle himself in the same absurdities, wherin he would ensnare vs. First he affirms the Church, <hi>Math. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then Mr B. is not your congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the true Church of Christ, for the principall of your Church, namely your self, hath no power to excommunicate.

               <p>Again, which is the cheif thing I desire may be observed, you say, these principalls <hi>must be chosen by the rest of the Church, &amp; be their mouth, and stand for the whole.</hi> And how chosen? must the whole Church speak joyntly when they chuse them? that were confusion. must women speak? that is contrary to the scriptures. Yet are they members of the congregation, and so are young youthes, childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, and servants. I adde further, the Church you say, is two or three principall members. Well then, they two or three must speak to the party, how can he els heare? but for two or three to speak to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, is confusion, and contrary to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maundement, 1 Cor. 14. 31. for <hi>all</hi> must <hi>speak by one &amp; one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by this time, I hope you are ashamed of such tristing as
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1037:103"/>
here you vse.</p>
               <p>I do therefore answer in few words: it is not necessary that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of the people should speak to the offender, no nor of the officers neyther. If but one officer do sufficiently evince, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the party, what needs more speak? The rest both Officers &amp; people, may manifest their consent eyther by voice, signe, or si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nce, yet so as liberty be preserved for any in place, and order, to speak, eyther by way of addition, limitation, or dissent. And for women, they are debarred by their s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>x, as from ordinary prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying, so from any other dealing wherin they take authority over the man, 1 Cor, 14. 34. 35. 1 Tim. 2. 11. 12. yet not simply from speaking: they may make profession of faith, or confession of sin, say Amen to the Churches prayers, sing Psalmes vocally, accuse a brother of sin, witnes an accusation, or defend themselves being accused, yea in a case extraordinary, namely where no man will, I see not but a woman may reprove the Church, rather then suffer it to go on in apparent wickednes, and communicate with it therein. Now for children, and such as are not of yeares of discretion, God and nature dispenseth with them, as for not communicating in the Lords supper now, so vnder the law for not offering sacrifices, from which none of yeares were exempted: neyther is there respect of persons with God in the common duties of Christianity.</p>
               <p>And for that so oft reinforced objection of <hi>authority given to two or three, and therefore not to all,</hi> I have answered and do, that to two, or three, and yet to all, when there are but two or three in all, as vsually comes to passe in the raysing, and dispersing of Churches.</p>

for the Presbytery in saying that <hi>some of them did proceed against him,</hi> in the latter you vtterly overthrow that, and step in for the Bishops sole power where you make Paul alone <hi>iudge and determiner</hi> of the busines.

               <p>And for answer to the particulars.</p>
               <p>In the first argument you do most sinfully corrupt the scriptures, knowing that if they be soundly alleadged, they will give no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce to your errour. For where Paul sayth, <hi>it is sufficient for</hi>

Take for this phrase of speach, these scriptures. Dan. 12. 2. Mat. 13. 17. Luke 12. 7. Rom. 5. 19. and 8. 29. &amp; 12. 4. 5. 1 Cor. 10. 17. &amp; 12. 12. 14.</p>
               <p>But mark I pray thee (wise reader) when this man expounds Math. 18. 19. 20. where mention is made of a few <hi>two or three</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the power of Christ, there <hi>by two, or three are meant the officers,</hi> and Christ <hi>hath established the authority of a few for the good of all,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>two or three officers, and a few, have this authority:</hi> and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, when he comes to expound 2 Cor. 2. 6. where men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">pag. 95. 98.</note> is made of <hi>many rebuking</hi> the offender, there by many must be meant the officers also.</p>
               <p>What Mr B: are two or three Officers in respect of the whole body many?

               <p>To the obiection I do answer, that first it doth not appear that the party was excommunicated, it may be vpon admonition he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, and so the extremity spoken of, 1 Cor. 5. 5. was preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and 2. if he were, eyther by many may be meant all, as I have formerly shewed, or otherwise it is sufficient if some reprove, the

               </p>
               <p>The latter of these I have formerly confuted as the reader may<note place="margin">Answ.</note> see pag. 126. 127. &amp;c.

                  <hi>one body,</hi> or Church, and we vnder the new testament that <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Chap. 3. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>one,</hi> or the same <hi>body</hi> or Church <hi>with the Iewes</hi> in the old, so (if the Ministery made the Church, how much more if it were the Church) could it not be, that the Iewes and we should be one Church, for I shall never be brought to beleeve, nor, I think will any man affirm it, that the Ministery of an Apostle, or Elder now, is the same in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the Ministery of a sacrificing Levite vnder the law.

               <p>And for the former of your reasons, (howsoever the place you bring Act. 15. 3. proves no such matter) yet is the thing true you say, namely that <hi>a part of the Church is sometimes called by the name of the whole;</hi> but what part? not the officers, but the brethren, the saynts, as being the matter (an essentiall cause) of the Church: the Elders not so, as being but for the assistance, and well being of it.

And if nature teach this liberty, in bodily daunger, how much greater liberty doth the Lord give in the spirituall daunger, both of soule, and body also? And your quaestion of <hi>examples for the peoples casting out their officers,</hi> is frivolous, if there be a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement or rule for it. What example have you, but grounds, for the baptizing of infants? Or where read you of any officer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate by any? And certaynly if the body of the Church may not cast out the Pastor for obstinate sinne, no person, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons vpon earth may do it.</p>
               <p>But the vanity of your opinion I do thus manifest.</p>
               <p>First you affirm pag. 88. that <hi>to separate from, is all one in substance</hi>
                  <note place="margin">I.</note> 
                  <hi>with, to excommunicate</hi> (though <hi>called by a name l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>sse odious</hi>). Whence it followeth that if the body of the Church may not excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their officers, they may not separate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> them, no not though they prove Papists or Atheists, or never so abominable, oh the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish bondage wherein these men would enthrall the Lords people to their destruction.</p>
               <p>If the Congregation may chuse, and elect their governours,<note place="margin">II.</note> then they may reject and reprobate them: (for they that set vp may pull down) but this liberty (as streyt as you are to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude) you your self graunt them, pag. 97. and if you denyed it, the scriptures assure it them, Act. 1, and 6. 1. 2. 3. 4. &amp; 14. 23.</p>
               <p>But if in these words, <hi>the people have no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maund over their Pastors, nor power to cast them out,</hi> you would intimate, that they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them but not excommunicate them, it would nothing avayl you. For as it were a straunge thing, that men should haue no commaund over their servants, (as I haue of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> strange, if the putting of servants out of their Office, should not argue power over them. And besides deposition (if any such ordinance
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:1037:107"/>
be to be vsed in the Church, is not of persons obstinate in sinne, but of such, as having by grosse idolatry, or some other notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous crime, so scandalously faln, as they cannot be reteyned in their Ministery, with the safety, and credit of the Church, &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, no not though they repent, but (not withstanding their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and continuance in the Church vpon the same) they are to be disseyzed of their Ministery, and <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Ezek. 44 10. 12. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>to beare their iniquity, and shame.</hi> But this is nothing to men obstinate in sin, who may not vpon their deposition, be continued in the Church; and to deal with them a new for the sinne, for which they have been formerly censured, or to censure them twice for one sin, is an idle and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable course. They are therefore to be cast out by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and so vnder their excommunication, is their deprivation comprehended.</p>
               <p>If the Pastour (and so of the rest of the Officers) be a brother<note place="margin">III.</note> in the Church, (as <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 23. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>all</hi> Gods children are the saynts <hi>brethren</hi>) then must the Church not suffer <note n="â€ " place="margin">Lev. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For the Lord Iesus subjects every brother indefinitely, and without respect of persons, to this censure, Mat. 18. 17. 1 Cor. 5. 11, 12. 13. From which last scripture another Argument of the same nature may be drawn, which is, that if the Pastour (and so of the other officers) be <hi>within,</hi> and not <hi>without,</hi> and vnder the Lords judgement, then are they under the judgement of the Church <note n="â€œ" place="margin">verse 4.</note>

                  <hi>say to Archippus, take heed to thy Ministery,</hi> if they may not censure him, if he be heedlesse; for he that wil not heare the Church, must be excommunicated, or (which is a description of excommunication by an effect) must be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an heathen or publican.</p>

               <p>Infinite others are the reasons to disprove the pretended char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by which this popish Clergy would exempt it self from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

And I cannot more fitly resemble this exemption of one, or more officers, from the ecclesiasticall censures, vnto which one or so many brethren are subiect being in the same sinne, then to the like exemption or priveledge, springing (as it seemes) from the same root, in civill judgements, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>monly called <hi>The benefit of clergy.</hi> For as by it a malefactour (if he can read <hi>vt clericus,</hi> as they speak, shall escape death which others do, &amp; so he should without that benefit, vndergoe: so by the benefit of clergy here, the person delinquent is freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the dint of the spirituall sword, the ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sure of the Church, which others do, and so he should without that priveledge, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, as well as they.

               <p>And this may well serve for a seventh reason to prove that the<note place="margin">VII.</note> officers are by the law of God lyable to as deep censures for sin, as the people, and so the Pastour, as any one of the brethren.</p>
               <p>Yet for the further &amp; more full opening of the iniquity of those proud and popish exemptions, and exaltations of Church officers, whereof from these scriptures alledged by Mr B. and the like, they boast so much, and by which they affright, and abuse the simple people, in all places, I will breifly, as I can, lay down certayn such different respects, and relations, vnder which the officers of the Church do come, as being rightly vnderstood, &amp; iustly applyed, will give good light to the discovering of this mystery.</p>
               <p>First then, the officers of the Church are to be considered in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect<note place="margin">I.</note> of the thing, which they minister, and that is, the word, and revealed will of God, in which regard they are infinitely above, &amp;

                  <hi>in the</hi> very <hi>stead of Christ, and of God</hi> himself. And in, for, and according to this message, or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage of God, and of Christ, they are absolutely and simply to be obeyed as is the meanest officer about the King, carrying with him his warrant, and authority, by the greatest Pere in the kingdome.</p>
               <p>In the 2. place they must be considered of vs, in respect of their<note place="margin">II.</note> office, by vertue whereof they do administer. And in this regard they are inferiour vnto the Church, as being by it called to a place of ministery to serve the Church, and not of Lordship to reign over it.</p>
               <p>The 3. consideration they vndergoe, is, in regard of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,<note place="margin">III.</note> and as they are brethren, saynts, christians, (for they cease not to be Christians, bycause they are Ministers, but must mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest their generall calling in their speciall) partakers of the same co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon graces, and subiect to the same common infirmities with the rest: and in this respect they are equall with the brethren, standing in need of the same meanes both for their edification, and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and so particularly, of the censures for their humiliation, if they be so farre left of God, (as they may be, and oft times are) as they will not otherwise be reclaymed. And I had as leiv you should tell me, that, bycause the Deacons are to distribute the Churches almes, therfore the Church is not to releiv them, though they be in daunger to starve bodily, as that bycause the Elders are to minister the Churches judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts, none must iudge them, though they be thorough impenitency in daunger to perish spiritually.</p>
               <p>Now for the particulars, which Mr B. obiecteth: it is true, <hi>the people</hi> are <hi>sheep,</hi> but not the Ministers, but the Lords sheep. Ezech. 34. 6. 8â€”31. neyther are these sheep for the Ministers, as the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sheep for their sheepheards, but for the Lord, and the sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards for them. The people are indeed an house, but not the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers house, but <hi>the Lords house,</hi> for him to dwell in. Ephe. 2. 20. 21. 1 Tim. 3. 15.</p>
               <p>Secondly the people are sheep, yet not vnreasonable beasts, but <hi>men,</hi> Ezech. 34. 31. so to be looked to by the sheepheards, as they are also to <hi>look to themselves,</hi> Act. 20. 28. Luk. 17. 3. They are so a house, as they consist <hi>not of dead, but of living stones,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 5. so
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:1037:110"/>
built vp by the Officers as they are also to <hi>build vp themselves,</hi> Iud. 20. And which is especially to be minded for the purpose in hand, the officers are so <hi>sheepheards,</hi> as they are, also themselves <hi>sheep,</hi> (if they be not goates) Math. 25. 37. Luk. 12. 32. Rom. 8. 36. They are so <hi>fathers</hi> as they are also <hi>brethren,</hi> Mat. 23. 8. Act. 1. 16. 2 Cor. 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>. yea, as they are <hi>sonnes</hi> also, in a sence as <hi>the Levite</hi> was in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry respects, both <hi>Michaes father</hi> and his <hi>sonne<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi> Iudg. 17. 1. 11. They are so <hi>workmen,</hi> or <hi>builders,</hi> as they are also part <hi>of the house,</hi> Ephe. 2. 22. 2 Tim. 2. 20. so seeds-men, as themselves are also <hi>seed,</hi> and a part of <hi>the harvest,</hi> Math. 13. 38.</p>
               <p>These distinctions rightly observed, will both teach the officers how to govern, and the people how to obey, and both officers, &amp; people how to preserve themselves, and one another, vnder the power of Christ given to his Church.</p>

               <p>It is true indeed, that the Lord Iesus sent forth his Apostles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, for the first planting of Churches: (though even in their times Ch: were planted &amp; men turned to the Lord by the preaching of private brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, Act. 8. 1. 4. &amp; 11. 19. 20. 21. &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Barnabas co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ming among them,</hi> is not said to have ioyned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, but to have <hi>exhorted them,</hi> which were ioyned, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

But it is certayn, they are such playne demonstrations, as do evince his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended truthes of popish and popular errours.</p>
               <p>And for the gathering of a Church M. B. I do tell you, that in what place soever, by what means soever, whether by preaching the gospell by a true Minister, by a false minister, by no minister, or by reading, conference, or any other meanes of publishing it, two or three faithfull people do arise, separating themselves fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the world into the fellowship of the gospell, and covenant of Abraham, they are a Church truely gathered though never so weak, a house and temple of God rightly founded vpon the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets, Christ himsef being the corner stone, against which the gates of hell shall not prevayl, nor your disgracefull invectives neyther.</p>

But first if your meaning be, that the Ministers by their office represent Christ in his office, it is little lesse then blasphemy; for Christ is the husband, and mediatour of his Church, by his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and herein not to be represented by any other man, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.

               <p>Wherevpon it followeth that the Officers must be governed.</p>
               <p>And to your reason, whomsoever you count Lords, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and whosoever are Lords, and servants in your Church, I know by the scriptures that in the Church of Christ the officers are <note n="â€ " place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 5.</note> servants, &amp; in that relation the Church may be called a Lord; and if Christ truely call <note n="*" place="margin">Math. 2. 27. 28.</note>

However, fatherhood argues no soveraignty. And yet the holy Apostles &amp; Prophets thought not much vpon all occasions, to account the saints their brethren, and themselves theirs. And I would you wist, whose names <hi>Iohn Bale</hi> in his Paraphrase vpon the Revelation ch. 17: vers. 3. thought <hi>your Grace, your Lordship, your Fatherhood,</hi> to be.

               <p>Lastly your affirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> that the <hi>saynts</hi> are <hi>called Kings,</hi> Rev. 1. 6. <hi>not for any outward power over me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, but for the inward power of Gods spirit sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ctifying the elect, by which, as Kings, they rule over their own corruptions,</hi> is an ill glosse corrupting the text.

                  <hi>the keyes of the kingdome to bind and loose</hi> them, in the order by him prescribed.</p>
               <p>These things thus layd down occasionally, I return to the point.<note place="margin">I.</note> And first against the figurative exposition of these words, <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> I do alledge two approved Rules, and Canon<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> in divinity, for exposition of scriptures. The former is, that scriptures must be expounded according to the largest extent of the words, except there be some apparent restreynt of them. The second is, that they must be expounded simply, and according to the letter, except ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity compell to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the litterall sence to a figurative. And therefore since there appeares not any such necessity, as is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, eyther of figure or restreynt, the words must be taken in their largest, and simplest meaning.</p>
               <p>With these rules I desire the reader to beare in mind that, which hath been formerly observed to the purpose in hand, and amongst other things, that the officers are to govern the Church in the ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, as in all other actions of communion, and therefore cannot
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:1037:113"/>
be the Church; that every true Ch<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> hath, or is capable of, a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery over it, and so there should be a minister of ministers: that the order of officers in the Church is an order of servants, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of saynts an order of Kings (which is the highest order in the Church) fitting vpon the thrones of David for judgement, whom the ministers are to serve in guiding &amp; going before them, in, and in ministring of their judgements. And so I go on.</p>
               <p>The rule prescribed Mat<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 18. concernes all the visible Churches<note place="margin">II.</note> in the world: since the power of excommunication is an essentiall property, one of the keyes of the kingdome, the onely solemn or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance in the Church, for the humbling, and saving of an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate offender, and as necessary as the power to receive in members, without which a Church cannot be gathered, or consist. And therefore the Officers cannot be the Church there spoken of, since true Churches may (and do) want officers, as I have formerly proved.</p>
               <p>If two or three officers be the Church, Math. 18. then may they<note place="margin">III.</note> two or three excommunicate the whole body, though it consist of a thousand persons: for what brother, or brethren soever, will not hear the Church there spoken of, he or they are to be accounted as heathens and publicans. Yea, I ad, if the power of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now whether this power in one or two, to punish judicially one or two thousand, be not Lordly at the least, let the reader judg.</p>
               <p>Further, if the officers be the Church, I would know, if one of<note place="margin">IIII.</note> them fall into scandalous sinne, and will not be reclaymed, what must then be done. It wilbe answered, that the rest must censure him. But what if there be but two in all, must the one excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the other? the ruling Elder (it may be) the Pastour? 2. if the rest of the Elders, (being many) may displace the Pastour by their authority, they may also place him, and set him vp by their authority, and so the poore laity is stript of all liberty, or power of chusing their officers, contrary both to the scriptures, and your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>Now there is nothing that more concernes the body of the Church, then the excommunication of a brother, whether wee respect the commaundement of God, binding them <note n="*" place="margin">Lev. 19. 7.</note>

Now as the Preist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Propheticall offices of Christ are administred in prayer, &amp; preaching, so is his Kingly office in government. In deed if wee thought (as you do), that Christ had left his kingdom, the Church, without lawes, and officers for the government of it, or that this government were an indifferent thing alterable at the willes and pleasures of men, then wee should be as indifferent, where, or how, or by whom it were administred, as you Mr B: are.</p>
               <p>3. The officers are to <note n="â€ " place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>feed the flock,</hi> one part whereof consists<note place="margin">III.</note> in government. Now if admonitions, and excommunications may be administred apart from the body, how is the flock fed by them? or how do those Elders, vpon whom the government of the Church especially lyeth, discharge their publique Ministery, and service vnto the Lord, and his Church, to which they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? or how can the Church see, and know their ministration, that they may <note n="*" place="margin">1 Thes. 13.</note>

                  <hi>they that sin,</hi> are <hi>rebuked openly,</hi> whether Elders, or people, how can <hi>the rest fear?</hi> Yea how can these men which are to feed the flock by government, be accounted faithfull sheepheards, eyther before God, or men, if they gather not the flock together, &amp; see they feed accordingly? though with you Mr B. they that feed the flocks by government, never so much as see the faces of the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred part of their sheep, and when they have a sheep in hand for straying (it may be from a dumb sheepheard to a preacher) they deal with him for the most part many a mile from, but never in, the place, where the particular stock walkes, whereof that sheep is.</p>
               <p>Lastly the administration of Christs kingdom, being a part of<note place="margin">IIII</note>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:1037:115"/>
the communion of saynts, and publique worship, is to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Lords day, as well as other parts are: and to be joyned with the administration of the word, sacraments, almes, and the rest, as making all one entyre body of communion: yea in cases, to go before the rest, (I am perswaded) least the holy things be polluted by notorious obstinate offenders. And if <note n="â€ " place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yea I see not how the Church can compell any to forbeare their bodily labour in the six dayes, wherein God hath given them liberty to work, except it be vpon occasions extraordinary, and as they may be constreyned to meet for any other part of publick worship<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </p>
               <p>Well then it must needs be, that this Church of officers must receive, and examine complaints, reprove and censure offenders publiquely, and with the knowledge of the whole body, met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in publique assembly, and this liberty in the exequution of excommunication, you graunt the multitude, pag. 92. of your book. And surely there must be but one Church for the whole busines. But this course is more vnreasonable then the other, namely, that the brethren must be gathered together to be spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatours, whiles the officers alone sit vpon the thrones of David, to heare, and judge, excluding the brethren from all communion with them, though they be personally present. For the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church stands not in this, that men are present, and see and heare what is done, and receive proffite, (for so may they do which are without) but in the mutuall relation, and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the parts, and is in this ordinance onely amongst them, which are reproved, or do reprove, at least by consent, if they see cause, which are censured, or do censure. And besides it is against common sence, that the officers should be the Church represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, when the body of the Church, which they represent, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, (as hath been formerly shewed:) &amp; to call the officers alone the Church, or assembly, (which are both one) when the people are assembled with them as necessary parts, is to call one part of the Church, the Church, excluding an other part of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:1037:115"/>If the officers alone be the Church to be told, and to admonish,<note place="margin">VIII.</note> and judge the offender, (for there is one, and the same Church for all these) then it must follow, that if the Officers admonish, the Church also admonisheth, and on the contrary, that if the officers refuse, the Church also refuseth to admonish an offendour: but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one, nor the other of these is true. First, the Elders ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving sin, may and ought to admonish the party sinning, whether the Church observ it, or no<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> yea though the whol Church be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise minded, yea any one of the Elders may admonish (if he see cause) both the rest of the officers, &amp; the brethren also: but this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition cannot be the admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of the Ch:, except we will say the Church may admonish where shee sees no sinne, yea against her will, yea which is most senseles, except she may be sayd to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish her self.</p>
               <p>The second point needs no great refutation. For who will say, that, if the officers refuse to admonish, and make themselves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary vnto sin by boulstering it vp, that then the Church is also sayling, and the whole lump thereby levened, except the rest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with them, or fayl in their personall duties: which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing might be sayd of them, and imputed vnto them, if by the Church were meant the officers.</p>
               <p>If a brother, privately considered, may bind sin privately, vpon<note place="margin">IX.</note> the parties irrepentance, then may the same brother, as a part of the publik assembly, bind for his part publiquely: and so he brings the party impenitent privately bound to the Church, holding him still bound vpon the continuance of his obstinacy, but publiquely now, with the whole communion, as privately before by himself <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>th his witnes. The consequent of this argum: Mr B. graunts in his latter book, pag. 200. vpon Mr Smythes vrging Mat. 18. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with some other scriptures much what to this purpose; but the Antecedent (as he speaks) he denyes, or rather distinguisheth of these words <hi>binding and loosing</hi> which he vnderstands onely to be meant of personall wrongs against a man, but not of sinnes at all against God.</p>
               <p>But as this exposition conteyns in it two notable absurdities, the first that other men may forgive injuries or wrongs done vnto me,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:1037:116"/>
and secondly, that <hi>a communion of faithfull men</hi> (for so the words are)<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 14</note> which is the Church, may medle with judging civile matters (as are injuries) otherwise then as they are sinns against God, at which they take offence, or scandalize: so is it evidently convinced by the text, when Christ speaks of <note n="â€ " place="margin">Math. 18. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>binding and loosing in heaven,</hi> whither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries come not, save as they are sinns against God. Yea Mr B: him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self graunts in another place of this book, viz: pag. 223. towards the end, that our saviour in this place, speaks of binding and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing spiritually, and that <hi>not by the power of Christ given to Ministers,</hi> but to <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon Christians:</hi> where he also brings sundry reasons to prove, that the binding, and loosing there spoken of, doth no way concern the Ministers, or publique Officers, but private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; notoriously crossing both his first book in the persons, which he will there needs have officers, and no private men, and here pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate persons, and no officers<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and his second, in the thing, which in the former place he will have merely of civil consideration, but here graunts to be meant religiously.</p>
               <p>The next reason I take from v. 19. where mention is made by<note place="margin">X.</note> Christ of prayer, by which the censures there spoken of are to be sanctifyed both before, and after they be exequuted. Wherevpon I demaund, whether the brethren present with the officers, be part of the Church, to which the offender is brought, and by which he is judged, in the communion of prayer, or no? It will not be denied; thence it must follow, that they are also part of the Church in receiving, and judging of the complaint, or els that they passe in, and out, and in agayn, in respect of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, during one and the same excercise, and the sanctification of it.</p>
               <p>They which are <hi>gathered in,</hi> or into <hi>the name of Christ,</hi> they are the<note place="margin">XI.</note> Church spoken of, Math. 18. and have the power of Christ for binding, and loosing, as is evident, ver. 20. Now as me thinks it should be strange to affirm, that the brethren present with the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, are gathered in or into any other name then the name of Christ, so doth Paul (drawing this rule into practise 1 Cor. 5.) commaund, that the multitude, with the officers (by not onely Mr B. but the Iesuites confession) <hi>be gathered together in, or into the</hi>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:1037:116"/>
                  <hi>name of Christ,</hi> and that they so gathered, do <hi>by the power of Christ<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi> deliver to Satan the offender for his humbling<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> ver. 4<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 5<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

               </p>
               <p>Lastly, if the officers, without the brethren, be the Church for the censures, then are they the Church for the other publique or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of prayer, preaching, sacraments, and the like, and may minister them out of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion of the body; neyther can there be any reason given why they should be<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the Church for one so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ordinance, and not for an other, for one part of the publick communion of the Church, and not for an other. And therefore in the representative Church of the Iewes at Ierusalem were not onely the hard causes opened, about which the people came to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, but there were also the sacrifices offered, and other the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn services performed, according to the dispensations of the times. And to make the officers the Church for one part of the power of Christ, and not for an other, for one solemn administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not for an other, (especially having fit instruments to exequute,) is a broken course, and indeed to devide Christ from himself.</p>
               <p>But about this something wilbe sayd, though nothing against it, and namely this. That the officers are to do in one of these or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, as in an other, and the multitude no more in the one<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> then in the other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> and that as the officers onely are to pray, preach, and administer the sacraments, and the people not to medle with these things, so in the matter of excommunication.</p>
               <p>To this I reply sundry things.</p>
               <p>First, if the officers alone be the Church in the censures, then<note place="margin">I.</note> it is not in this part of communion, as in other parts: for not the officers alone, but the brethren with them, are the Church, in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, preaching, administring the sacraments and the like. And as the Church (being the body of Christ) is the most entire, and best compact of all bodyes, so is the communion in it most entyre, &amp; full amongst all the parts, so far as naturall impossibilitie<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth not. And therefore even children (though by nature vnca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of other parts of communion, wherein it is required they should be agents, or do any thing) yet do communicate in that one ordinance of baptism, in the administration wherof (as of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:1037:117"/>
before times) they are merely patients, and baptized in the name of the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost. But in other actions, and amongst other members, with whom naturall inability dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penseth not, there is a full, perfect, and intire communion, and that as sensible, and bodily amongst all, as may be, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. In preaching, prayer, the Lords supper, psalmes, elections, and almes, all communicate though with some difference of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and manner of the thing. In the first which is preaching, all communicate, one officer teacheth, and the rest both officers &amp; people are taught: in prayer one officer vtters the voice, and the rest of the Church say, Amen, &amp; so all communicate: in the Lords supper all communicate, one by giving, or administring, and all the rest by receiving with him: in singing of psalmes all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, yea and that vocally, and together where they can all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine and concur without disorder: in elections all chuse, or are chosen: in the distribution of the almes, all eyther give or receive, and so communicate together. But now in publick admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and excommunications, there must be a schism, for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Church is by Mr B: excluded from the communion, (yea though locally present) for all the communion passeth betwixt the parties admonishing, and admonished, excommunicating, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, whereof the body of the Church is neyther, but a very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ipher, &amp; a hangby.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is great difference betwixt prayer, and<note place="margin">II.</note> preaching, on the one side, and excommunication on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, in respect of the ordering, and manner of dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing those ordinances. One officer prepareth in secret, and severall from the rest for preaching, and prayer, &amp; so administreth these ordinances lawfully, as the ordinances of the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the consent, yea or foreknowledge of any one eyther brother, or officer: but it is otherwise in admonition, and excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The sin must be told to the Church, and they vpon know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it; must admonish the sinner, and so the excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is publiquely to be prepared, with the foreknowledge, &amp; fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consent, of the body, which otherwise the officers, (much lesse one officer, without the knowledge or consent of eyther other officer,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1037:117"/>
or people) may not minister. One officer<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> I confesse<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> may admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish an offender, without the consent of the Church, yea or of any other officer, be there never so many, yea he may admonish both the officers and Church: but this can in no sense be called the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the Church<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> except wee will say one officer is the Ch: excluding both the people, and other officers, and that the church may admonish her self<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and that against her will, which were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, and senseles affirmations.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for a kind of preaching, namely: that we call <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 12. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sying,</hi> (and so of prayer for the sanctifying of it) that I affirm not to be so appropriated to the ministery, but that others having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a gift there vnto, may and ought to stir vp the same, and to vse it in the Church, <note n="â€œ" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>for aedification, exhortation, and comfort,</hi> though not yet called into the office of ministery, as hath been in part already, and now is more fully proved by these scriptures. Num. 11. 29. 2 Chron. 17. 7. Ier. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And more specially, the Apostle 1 Cor. 14. doth of purpose, and at large handle this busines, not onely giving liberty vnto, but laying charge vpon all such (though not in office) as haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a spirituall gift, to exercise the same, in the ordinance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying. Now for the better vnderstanding of this point, it must be considered, that the Church of Corinth did abound with spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall gifts, above an other Churches, both ordinary and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary: which gifts of the spirit they did abuse too much unto fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ambition. Wherevpon the Apostle takes occasion in the beginning of the 12. hap. and so forward, to direct them in the right vse of these giftes of God, which was the imployment of them to the aedifying of the body in love: and therfore having<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> ch<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 13. layd down a full description, and large commendation of that grace of love, in the 14<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> ch. &amp; the beginning of it, he exhorts to prophesying, and to the study, and vse of that gift<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> which though it were not so straunge a thing, as was the suddayn gift of tongues, not which drew with it such wonder, and admiration, yet was it more profitable for the Church<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and though a matter of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:1037:118"/>
lesse note, yet of greater charity, which must bear sway in all our actions.</p>
               <p>Against this scripture (though in it self most pregnant for the purpose in hand) two exceptions are taken. The one that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaks of such persons onely, as are in office, and so of their ordinary ministeriall teaching: the other, that he speakes of such gifts, as were extraordinary, and so being ceased, that the ordinance as temporary, is ceased with them. But neyther of these rubs, must turn vs out of the way of truth, nor cause vs to forbear this most excellent, and comfortable ordinance of the Lord Iesus, wherein is to be seen, and heard the variety, and harmony of the graces of God, for <hi>the aedifying of the Church,</hi> v. 4. and <hi>gayning of the vnbeleevers,</hi> v. 24. 25.</p>
               <p>That the Apostle in this Chapter directs the Church in the vse of extraordinary gifts is most evident, neyther will I deny, but that the officers are to guide, and order this action of prophesying, as all other publick buesinesses, yea even these wherein the<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> brethren have greatest liberty, but that he also intends the establishing of, &amp; so takes order, and gives direction for an ordinary constant exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise in the Church, even by men out of office, I do manifest by these reasons.</p>
               <p>First, bycause the Apostle speaks of the manifestation of a gift,<note place="margin">I.</note> or grace, common to all persons, as well brethren, as ministers, ordinary, as extraordinary, and that at all times, which is <hi>love:</hi> as also of such fruits, and effects of that gaace, as are no lesse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, then the grace it self, nor of lesse continuance in the Churches of Christ, to wit of <hi>

                     </gap>dification, exhortation &amp; comfort.</hi> v. 3. compared with 1 Thes. 5. 11. 14.</p>
               <p>Secondly verse 21. he permits <hi>all</hi> to <hi>prophesie</hi> and speaks as large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">II.</note> of prophesying, as of <hi>learning, and receiving comfort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now least any should object may women also prophesie? the Apostle prevents that obiection, and it may be reproves that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order amongst the Corinthians, ver: 34. by a flat inhibition, inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them expresly to keep silence in the Church, in the presence of men to whom they ought to be subiect, and to <hi>learn at home of their housbands,</hi> v. 35. and <hi>not by teaching the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>over them,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 11. 12. which the men in prophesying do law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vse. Now this restreynt of women from prophecying,<note place="margin">III.</note> or other speaking with authority in the Church, both in this place to the Corinthians, and in the other to Tim: doth clear the two former obiections. In that Paul forbids women, he gives liberty to all men gifted accordingly, opposing women to men, sex to sex, and not women to Officers, which were frivolous. And againe in restreyning women, he shewes his meaning to be of ordinary not extraordinary prophesying, for women immediately, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily, and miraculously inspired, might speak without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streynt.<note place="margin">IIII.</note> Exo. 15. 20. Iudg. 4. 4. Luk. 2. 36. Act. 21. 17. 18.</p>
               <p>The Prophets here spoken of, were not extraordinary, bycause their doctrines were to be <hi>iudged</hi> by other Prophets, and their <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> to be <hi>subiect vnto the spirits of others,</hi> v. 29. 32. where the doctrines of the extraordinary <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Ephe. 2. 20. &amp; 3. 5.</note>

               <p>The Apostle, vers. 37. makes a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and a man <hi>spirituall</hi> all<note place="margin">V.</note> one, whom he further describes, not by any extraordinary gift, but by that common Christian grace of submission vnto <hi>the things he writes, as the commaundements of the Lord.</hi> Vnto whom also ver. 38. he opposeth a man wilfully <hi>ignorant:</hi> teaching vs, that he doth not measure a Prophet in this place, eyther by the office of ministery, or by any extraordinary propheticall gift, but by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an gift of spirituall discerning.</p>
               <p>It is the commaundement of the Lord by the Apostle, that <note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 2.</note>

If it be sayd, that vpon such occasion, triall may be taken of mens gifts, I do answer,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1037:119"/>
first, that mens gifts, and abilities<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> should be known in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, before they be once thought on, for officers: and 2. that there is none other vse<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> or tryall of those gifts<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> but in prophesy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for every thing<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> in the Lords house is<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to be performed in some ordinance, there is no thing throwen about the house, or out of order in it: and other ordinance in the Church, save this of prophesying, is there none, wherein men out of office are to pray, and teach, which therefore they ought to <hi>covet,</hi> v: 39. and in it to be excercised, and trayned vp, that when officers want, the Church may not need to set vp men, as it were to play their prizes, nor send them like school-boyes to be posed, as your fashion in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland is. And that minister, that is not called vpon the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches experimentall knowledge of his sufficiency in these things, comes not in by the dore, which Christ hath opened, nor may be accounted a true minister of Christ, and his Church.<note place="margin">VII.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, eyther men not yet in office (being accordingly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified) may preach the truth of Christ, or it is not possible, that the people should be taught in lawfull manner, eyther in nations vniversally heathenish, or vniversally apostate vnder Antichrist, before there be true Churches gathered, by which the officers are to be chosen: for as it is not very like that heathenish or antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian preists will sincerely teach the truth, neyther is it lawfull for them to administer, or for any to joyn with them in their admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations, by vertue of any heathenish, or antichristian calling, or ordination<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Rev. 14<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 9. 10. 11. 1 Tim. 5. 22. And howsoever the Church of England hath preferred a dumb, masse, and profane preisthood with a service-book before this ordinance, yet the truth of Christ is otherwise, and so the Church of Christ is taught to practise: which you also Mr B<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> might do well in modesty to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, though you want liberty to vse it.<note place="margin">XIII.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I haue insisted the longer vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> this point, both for it self, and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it serveth effectually to prove the other point in hand. For if the brethren have liberty in this ordinance of prophecy, they haue also liberty in the other ordinance of excommunication: for they are both of the same nature. Look to whom Christ gave the one key of doctrine, to them he gave the other key of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline:
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:1037:119"/>
and they that may handle the one, may have a finger vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the other: they that may bynde &amp; loose by doctrine, reproof, &amp; comfort, they may also bynde or loose by application of the same doctrine, reproof, or comfort to the person obstinate in sin, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> penitent for it. As the one of those doth necessarily establish the other, so take away eyther, and the other cannot stand. And here I gather an other argument agaynst your exposition of Math: 18.</p>
               <p>Lastly, as the Elders principally to be imployed in teaching, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not<note place="margin">XIIII.</note> warrantably be chosen without good experience of their gift, and faculty, in prophesy, and prayer, so neyther can they, which are cheifly to be imployed in government, with good conscience of the Church, be called to that ministration, except they also have given, and the Church taken good proof of their ability, and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity in the discussing, and debating, carrying, and contriving of Church affaires, as also in admonition, exhortation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort publiquely occasioned, and so manifested. And a very presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous sin it is in any Church, to chuse an officer, not thus tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp, and tryed. Wherevpon I conclude, that brethren, (though not in officer<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>) have not their hands tyed from medling in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the Church, especially the censures, but are bound in their places to see to, and assist in the reformation of publique scandalls, and therefore are part of the Church, to which an offender is to be complayned of<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> for onely they are bound to see reformation of the evill, to whom the complaint is to be made, where Christ sayth <hi>Tell the Church.</hi>

               <p>It now remaynes we come to the other scripture, which Mr B. turns so lightly over, viz. 1 Cor. 5. which that wee may aright vnderstand for the present purpose two things must be considred: the one whereof is, what the Apostles scope is, and what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends in that Chap: and the other what persons he interesseth in the busines, about which he deales.</p>
               <p>The Praelates with their obedient clergy, do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>stantly affirm, that the Apostle there reprooves the Corinthi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ns for not complayning to him of the incestuous person, that he might haue censured him, and that he commaunds them (being now judged by him, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the sole authority in his hands) to exequute his sentence vpon
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:1037:120"/>
him; and this exposition Mr Bern. laboureth to confirm, pag. 92. 94. 98.</p>
               <p>Wee on the contrary affirm, that the Apostle in that scripture reproveth the Church of Corinth, or them, to whom he writes, for suffring (as they did) that wicked man uncast out, and that he now wills them to discharge that duty, wherein they had formerly fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in excommunicating him: to which he also gives his consent, going before them, as his duty was, in judging, and withall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouching his presence in spirit, that is in will, and consent, since he could not be bodily present with them. And that this is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles meaning, it is much that any man reading the chapter with an honest heart, should deny. The arguments of proof, are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest in the particulars.</p>
               <p>1. They ought <hi>with sorrow to have put him out.</hi> v. 2. 13.</p>

First, that Cloe complayned of the incestuous man, which was not so: she co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>playned of the <hi>contentions amongst the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>

sufficient for the people, yea or the Ministers eyther to reprove an offender, &amp; so to complayn to the Bishops court of him. 3. That a man is discharged if he seek reformation as he may in his place, whereas it is first required a man have such a place, or be in such a-Church, as is capable of Gods ordinances, and wherein he may vse the meanes for reformation, which Christ hath left: other wise his very place, and standing is not of God, nor may be by him continued. La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>tly, where he sayth, that the incestuous man had not levened the Corinthians bycause Paul sayth, <hi>ye are vnlevened</hi> v. 7. it is an ill collection. For they were unlevened or sweet bread in their persons, that is sanctified by the spirit, but sowred or le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened in the lump of communion, by suffering that wicked man vncensured: and the Apostles desire is, that that wicked man might be cast out of the society; that as they were severally pure, or in their persons, so the whole Church together, or masse might be pure, which before was polluted with his contagion.</p>
               <p>4. The Corinthians had formerly been taught by Paul <hi>not to</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>pany or be <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mingled with fornicators, covetous persons,</hi> &amp;c: that is<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> according to the drift of the whole Chapter, to cast them out, and so haue neyther spirituall, nor civil familiarity with them. ver. 9. &amp; here he reproves them for fayling in that duty.</p>
               <p>5. They to whom Paul writ were <hi>to judg them that were within,</hi> &amp; are charged to use that power <hi>in putting away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> among themselves tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> wicked man. v:</hi> 12. 13.</p>
               <p>And thus the evidence for the first point is clear, that they to whom Paul writ &amp; which were to be gathered together, were to be gathered into the name of Christ, by his power to bynde or deliver to Satan the offender as Math: 18 18<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 19<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 20. were to purge out the old leven, not to be commingled with the ungodly, to judge them that were within, &amp; to put away, &amp; from among themselves the obstinately wicked. And it is most untruly, &amp; unconscionably affirmed by this man Pag: 92. (as I haue formerly observed) that all that can be gathered from this place, is that the censures are to be executed with the publick knowledge of them that are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together.</p>
               <p>Now the 2. consideration is, who those persons are thus to be
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:1037:121"/>
gathered together, upon whose shoulders the Apostle layes this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of delivering to Satan, purging but, puting away, &amp; judging this wicked man.</p>
               <p>And for this, I need no more then M B: own confession in the place before named, pag: 92. where he expresly affirmeth, that by them that there meet together, is meant the body of the Church<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> And though he, and all the world should deny it, yet would the truth of God stand: which I thus manifest.</p>
               <p>1. They <hi>among whom the fornicatour was, out of the middest of whom he was to be put, &amp; which were puffed vp, when they had rather cause of sorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> to them the Apostle writes, them he reproves, they were to be gathered together for the excommunicating, purging out, &amp; jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the offender, v. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. And therefore the duety here enjoyned, as well concorns the brethren as the officers, except we will say, the fornicatour was onely among, and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of the officers, &amp; to put from amongst them, and left amongst the people still, and that the officers onely were puffed vp, when they should have sorrowed, and not the brethren with them.</p>
               <p>2. It concerned the people as well as the Preists in the type, &amp; shadow, <note n="â€ " place="margin">Exo. 12. 15, 8. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>to put away leven out of their houses,</hi> &amp; <hi>to keep the Passeover with unlevened bread:</hi> and so in the truth, and substance, to purge, and put out this leven Paul speaks of, namely the incestuous person. v. 7<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 8.</p>
               <p>3. The Apostle admonisheth them, that were not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with fornicators<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> nor to eat with them: v. 9. 10. 11. &amp; this duety, I hope, as well concerned the brethren as the officers.<note place="margin">2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

14. 1 Tim: 2. 12.</p>
               <p>To these things I will adde in the last place the consideration of a scripture, to wit, a Cor: 2. 6. which M. B: &amp; many others with him, think of force sufficient to dash in peices all that hath been, or can be spoken for the brethrens liberty, &amp; right in the fore-handled busines. But as I have formerly answered the objections, forced from this scripture agaynst the truth I hold, so will I here set down one Argument or two, very pregnant, (except I be deceived) for the confirmation of it, from the same scripture, &amp; the context thereof.</p>
               <p>1. They whom the Apostle <hi>by his letter made sorry,</hi> for their fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling<note place="margin">I.</note> in the casting out of the incestuous man, and that <hi>with a sorrow to repentaunce,</hi> manifesting it self, with great <hi>indignation</hi> &amp; <hi>zeale,</hi> they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> reprove, and censure him, and so did, to his reformation, and their own clearing: which that it was not the case of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers alone, but of the brethren with them, appeares in these scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. 1 Cor. 5. 1. 2. with 2 Cor. 2. 5. 6. &amp; 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12.</p>
               <p>2. Paul writes not onely to the officers, but to the brethren as<note place="margin">II.</note> well as to them, to <hi>forgive</hi> or loose, to <hi>comfort &amp; confirm their love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the same person vpon his repentance. 2 Cor. 2, 7. 8. therein plainly witnessing, that the brethren as well as the officers, had bound, rebuked, and manifested their indignation against the sin, and the person for it.</p>
               <p>Now this point in hand I will conclude with the observation of a practise yet continued, &amp; in use in the Church of England, which is, that persons excommunicated for notorious sinns, before they be absolved, are to do their pennance (as they call it) in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Churches, wherof they are, and there to ask the whole Church forgivenes. Now I would know of you Mr B. whether the church have power to forgive the parties sin, (as men can forgive sin) yea, or no? If you say no, you discover the shame of your Church, thus prophanely to take in vayn the name of God, and to make a mock of Christ ordinances: if you answer affirmatively, then you graunt the power of Christ to forgive, &amp; to loose sinns, &amp; so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reteyn, and binde them, to be in the body of the Church, for which I contend<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> The truth is, there is no such power in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish

               <p>A 2. case of pollution is the neglect of admonition for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation<note place="margin">II.</note> of the offender, according to the order and degrees by Christ himself set down, secret and betwixt the offended, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, if the sin be of secret practise, and nature: privately, &amp; with a witnes, or two, in the second place: publiquely in the last place by complaint made vnto the Church having the power of Christ for excommunication. Lev: 19. 17. Mat. 18. 15. 16. 17.</p>
               <p>There is yet a 3. duty and that is separation, whereof you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<note place="margin">III.</note> Mr B. in sundry cases do admit. pag. 105. and to which the Lord in the scriptures calls his people for the shaming of obstinate rebellious offenders, Rom. 16. 17. 2 Cor. 6. 14. 15. 16. 17. 1 Tim. 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>. the neglect whereof casts both the guilt of the sin, &amp; condemnation of the sinner, vpon him that neglects it. So that a man is not onely bound in his place to do his best for the reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his brother, but to see his place be such as wherein he may orderly discharge the duties of admonition, otherwise both his practise, and place are vnlawfull. And you your self will teach your people this truth in the generall, that the place, or calling absolutely tying a man to the breach of any of Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is vnlawful, and to be forsaken.</p>
               <p>Now this is your very case, and the case of the best in your Ch:, (the Lord open your eyes you may see it, and give you harts to make a right vse of it.) As there are in your parish whom you dare not admonish secretly, much lesse with a witnes, or two, so (which is the last and cheifest remedy) you cannot make complaint to the Church: your Church is not furnished with Christs power to take vengeance vpon disobedience: you are utterly unfurnished of the weapons of this warfare. Great was the slavery of the Israelites un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Philistims, when <note n="â€œ" place="margin">1 Sam. 13 22.</note>
                  <hi>there was not a sword found amongst them, in the day of battel:</hi> far greater, and more to be bewayled, is your spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall slavery under the Philistim, and Aegyptian Lords, the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, which have spoyled you of all, and left you vnarmed, for the Lords battel. You know vvel Mr B. that the Officiall is not the Church &amp; so do thousands in England with you. For all whom, how much better were it, &amp; more agreable to true godlines, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce

such vnsanctifyed places, and standings, wherein they doe in avoydably day, by day, steyn themselves with so many impieties of their brethren (as though their own personall sinnes were too few) by sayling in this most necessary duty, layd by the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self vpon every brother for the reformation of his brother, then to plead, they do the best they can in their places, to reclaym them? It will not be sufficient for men suffering themselves to be tyed short in the chaynes of Antichristian bondage fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the performance of this necessary duty, at the day of the Lord, when men shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to haue perished through their fault, which might haue been gayned by their admonition, Mat. 18. 15. to say they have done what they could within the reach of their chayn. But let all them that fear the Lord, and his righteous judgements, &amp; which have hearts tenderly affected with the conscience of the duety they owe vnto their brethren, and to whom the liberty purchased with the blood of Christ seemeth pretious, break assunder those chaynes of vnrighteousnes, those bonds of Antichrist, and come out of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, and plant their feet in those pleasant pathes of the Lord, wherein they may make streight steppes vnto him, walking in that light, and liberty, which Christ hath so dearly purchased for them.</p>
               <p>But for separation from a Church rightly constituted, or from a true Church (so remayning) I do vtterly disclayme it. For there is but <note n="â€˜â€ " place="margin">Eph. 4. 4. v. 5.</note>
                  <hi>one body,</hi> the Church, and but <hi>one Lord,</hi> or head of that body, Christ: and whosoever separates from the body, the Church, separates from the head, Christ, in that respect.</p>
               <p>But this I hold that if iniquity be committed in the Chruch, and complaint, and proof accordingly made, and that the Church will not reform, or reject the party offending, but will on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary maynteyn presumptuously, &amp; abet such impiety, that then by abetting that party &amp; his sin, she makes it her own by imputation, &amp; enwrapps her self in the same guilt with the sinner. And remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning irreformable, eyther by such members of the same Ch:, as are faithfull, (if there be any) or by other sister Churches, wypeth her self out the Lords Church-rowl, and now ceaseth to be any longer the true Church of Christ.

same, without right vnto them, or promise of blessing vpon them, both the persons and sacrifices are abhominable vnto the Lord. Tit. 1. 16. Prov. 21. 27.</p>
               <p>Now if any object the Church of the Iewes, and the obstinacy thereof in sin, and wickednes, which was a true Church notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: it must be considered, that no Church in the world<note place="margin">I.</note> now, hath that absolute promise of the Lords visible prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce, which that Church then had, till the coming of Christ, Gen. 47. 10. &amp; 17. 7. Exod. 19. 43. 44. 45.<note place="margin">II.</note>
               </p>

But for Ierusalem &amp; the Church there, the case is otherwise. Touching which I desire these two Rules may be born in minde.</p>
               <p>First that ther was that one onely visible Church vpon the face<note place="margin">I.</note> of the earth, tyed to one temple, altar, sacrifice, Preisthood, in one place, &amp; that no man could absolutely separate from that Church, but he must separate from the visible presence, and from all the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn publique worship of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly that the Iewish Church had not that distinct ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall<note place="margin">II.</note> ordinance of excommunication, which we now have, but that the obstinate or presumptuous offender was by bodily death to be cut of from the Lords people, the same persons namely the whole nation being both Church, and common wealth, according to that special dispensation of those times. Wherevpon it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, first, that since absolute separation from the Iewish Church was unlawfull, communion with it was lawfull: and 2. that since the Church had not the power to cast out an offender, it was no pollution vnto them to suffer him amongst them, so they dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, such other duetyes, as were inioyned them, by the Lord. But it is now otherwise: the times are altered and the dispensations of them. Every place where a companie of faithful people are gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Christs name, is mount Syon, &amp; hath the promise of Gods presence: and separation from one Church remayning vncurable may be made into another. And as separation may be from a Church, so may excommunication be of person, obstinately wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. And these two Rules, rightly applyed wil (as I am perswaded) satisfie the scriptures and reasons brought by Mr. B. here and both by him, and others els where, from the old testament, and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polluted
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:1037:125"/>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion of the servants of God in the Iewish Church. The other scriptures I will breifly passe over.</p>
               <p>Tit. 1. 15. shewes, that <hi>all</hi> the creatures of God are <hi>pure to the pure.</hi> I graunt it, and his ordinances also. But ever provided, in their lawfull, and right vse, which in a prophane and vnsanctified com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion they are not. By your exposition Mr Bernard, a godly man might eat the Lords supper with haeretiques, exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municates, yea Turks or Pagans, if they would, and yet all should be pure to him. Of the 2. and 3. chap. in the Revelation, I have spoken formerly, and there proved that the Churches were polluted by the tolleration of wicked persons amongst them, and therefore reproved, neyther is it materiall, if the scriptures do not expresly tax the whole Church for connivency every time they rebuked some persons in it. It is sufficient they do it in some places, and in some Churches: there is the same reason of all, neither hath one Church priviledge above an other, or for one sin, more then an other. And this also may serve for answer to the 2. &amp; 3. of your twenty Reasons in your 2. book. Onely you must take knowledg<note place="margin">pag. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The like ignorance you shew in the 8. Reason, where you demaund why <hi>the fellowship in civil society should not be polluted, as well as religious communion.</hi> As though you had never read that <note n="â€ " place="margin">1 Cor. 7<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 14.</note>

               <p>In the next scripture which is Gal. 5. 10. the Apostle no way acquites the Church of transgression, but speaks vnder hope of their repentance, which they were to manifest by avoyding &amp; cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off such as had troubled, and sedu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Touching 1 Cor. 11. which is the next scripture, I will speak<note place="margin">Mr B.</note> something more largely, bycause Mr B. thinks it <hi>most pregnant for the decyding of the controversy, for that the Apostle speaking purposely of the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the sacrament, bids every man examine himself, and not one an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that vnder peyn of eating damnation to himself, and not to an other, if he come not reverently, notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ding there was much evil in the Church.</hi>

You I hope, are to examine your self, as well as others. And might not your people tell you out of your own book, that you have nought to do to examine them? Might not the meanest of them say vnto you, <hi>examine your self, if I<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> eat and drink vnworthily, it shalbe myne own damnation not yours?</hi> Yea might not any vngodly person thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer eyther officer, or brother, that should reprove him eyther pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blikly, or privately?

It doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that because I am bound to examine my self, therefore not my brother, that is, not to observe him, admonish him, &amp; bring him to repentance for apparant sinne, for of such an examination we onely speak, leaving to a mans self the examination of the hart, and of things secret. You may as well argue thus. We are <hi>to save our selves,</hi> Act. 2. 40. <hi>to speak vnto our selves in psalmes,</hi> &amp;c. Ephe. 5. 19.

Iud. 23. 1 Thes. 4. 18. &amp; 5. 11. 14.</p>
               <p>Furthermore you your self pag. 120. of this book, make (and that truely) the <hi>Lords supper a testimony of that<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> visible communion of love amongst the members.</hi> Except then there be that love, which is there testifyed, the Lords ordinance is prophaned, and his name taken in vayn. Now where admonitions are not for the purging, gayning, humbling, and saving of the the offender, Mat. 18. 15. 1 Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And that true spirituall love required in the members of Christs body should be betwixt the servants of God, &amp; notorious prophane persons, eyther way, passeth both myne vnderstanding, &amp; affections. And to conclude this point, I would but desire you Mr B. to read the marginall note given in your authorized Bible<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> printed at London 1603. vpon the 31. verse of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>And thus you see how <hi>pregnant</hi> this <hi>scripture</hi> is <hi>to decyde the contre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,</hi> and to determine against you, that except reformation of sinne be orderly sought, and seasonably obteyned, there can be no right or lawfull communion in the Lords supper. And Paul in writing as he doth, provokes as every man specially to look to himself, so the whole Church together to see the reformation of the disorders amongst them. ver. 17. 18. 33. 34.</p>
               <p>Lastly for 2 Cor. 12. 11. it must be considered that the case was depending, and in hand concerning <hi>such as had sinned and not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> and as the issue of things should be, so were the godly to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry themselves towards them: if they would be drawn to repentance, by admonition, they were to forgive them as 2 Cor. 2. 7. if not, the Church was bound to judge, and cut them of, whether Paul came, or no. 1 Cor. 5. 11. 12. 13.

Rom. 3. 2. &amp; 9. 4. and that we are as well to look in what fellowship, and communion we receive the holy things of God<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> as what the things are we do receive. And as in the naturall body there must first be a naturall vnion of the parts with the head, and one with an other, before there can be any<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> action of naturall communion eyther between the head, and the members, or one member, and an other: so in this spirituall body<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the Church, the members must first be vnited with Christ the head<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and become one with him, before they can any way partake in his benefits, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>First then, your Church admitteth not of the ordinance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying,<note place="margin">I.</note> or teaching out of office, Rom. 12. 6. 7. which as I have formerly proved to be a perpetuall ordinance for the Church, so how profitable it is, both for the edification of them within, and conversion of them without, we find by experience, and the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures declare<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 1 Cor. 14. 3. 24. 25.</p>
               <p>2. You silence the Lord Iesus in your Church from revealing<note place="margin">II.</note> the whole will of his father. A part of his word is vtterly excluded by your calender, &amp; may not so much as be read in your Church, but is justled out by the Apocrypha writings: a greater part even the most of that which concerns the true gathering, and governing of the visible Church, though it may be read, yet may it not be faithfully taught, much lesse obediently practised: notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any charge of the Prophets, Apostles &amp; Christ himself. Deu. 29. 29. Math. 28. 19. 20. Rom. 16. 25. 26. 2 Tim. 3. 16. 17. so that though you haue the whole will of God in your books, as Papists haue, yet in respect of the doctrine, and obedience of a great part of it, the book is sealed vp, and may not be opened. And to make vp the measure, you have in stead of the canonicall scriptures of the holy Ghost, mens Apocrypha scriptures, the books of homilies, and that of common prayers, your popish canons, and constitutions, (which are as well the doctrine of your

Church, as the canons of the Tridentine councell are the doctrine of the Church of Rome) and (if you will) in stead of Prophets to teach, your significant ceremonies, the cap, surplice, crosse, typpet, which are <hi>neyther dark, nor dumb, but apt to stir vp the dull mind of man to the remembrance of his duty to God, by some notable signification.</hi> Here is drosse for silver, and for the finest wheat, chasse.</p>
               <p>Lastly your Prophets which administer that part of Christs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,<note place="margin">III.</note> or of the scriptures, which may be taught, and practised amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>gst you<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> haue neyther the true office of ministery, which Christ hath prescribed, nor a lawfull calling to that they have: as hath been in part noted from Ephe. 4. and is els where clearly evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>

            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p>But here I must needs observe a few things about two answers given by <note n="â€ " place="margin">Pag. 260. 261.</note> Mr B. in his 2. book to two of Mr Ainsworths obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the matter in hand. To the former being about the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of Christ in the Church, he answereth, that they <hi>have Christs officers appointed to govern; the civil Magistrate, the Kings Maiesty, the</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But you should have considered Mr Bern. that the question<note place="margin">Answ.</note> is not about civill but ecclesiasticall governours. The King in deed is to govern in causes ecclesiasticall, but civilly, not ecclesiastical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vsing the civil sword, not the spirituall for the punishing of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendours. And if the King be a Church officer, then he is, first, a
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:1037:133"/>
King of the Church: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to be called to his office, and so depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from it by the Church, or at least by other ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, by whom alone you will have Church officers made. And lastly, if <hi>the King</hi> be such <hi>a ruling Elder,</hi> as the scriptures speak of, he is inferiour to the teaching Elders, and deserves lesse honour then they. For so the Apostle orders things. Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. 12. 7. 8. 1 Tim. 5. 17.</p>
               <p>Now in making your <hi>Bishops, Pastours, &amp; Doctours,</hi> you are dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble forgetfull of your self, and double injurious vnto them, and which is worse then both the rest, you sin against the Lord, &amp; his truth. For the first, in your former book you made your Bishops <hi>cheif officers in the Church, and the successours of the Apostles, and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,</hi> and here you make them <hi>Pastours, and Teachers,</hi> which are the lowest orders of officers, <hi>that<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Christ gave for the work of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery.</hi> Ephe. 4. 11. 2. if your Bishops be Pastours, and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers by their office, what are you, and the rest of your rank? You and they have not the same office, but you an office vnder them, and so Pastours and Teachers being the lowest order that Christ hath left in his Church, your order must needs be something vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the lowest, and of an others leavings then Christs. 3. in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your Bishops the Pastours &amp; Teachers of the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, or the particular Churches in it, you lay to their charge an accusation, which they will never be able to answer at the day of the Lord, which is, their not feeding of so many thowsand sheep committed vnto them to be fedd, and taught by them. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nothing is more vntrue, and disagreable to the word of God, then that your Provinciall, and Diocesan Bishops are the Pastours, and Teachers given by Christ to his Church. There were no other ordinary officers left or appointed by the Apostles, in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches but such as were fixed to particular congregations, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily called Bishops or Elders, Act. 14. 23. &amp; 20. 17. 28.

And if it can be shewed, that, by the word of God any other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers were left, or appointed in the Church after the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry officers, Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, whose gifts, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vvere extraordinary, besides such Bishops, and Elders, as vvere limited to particular Churches, I vvill yeeld this vvhole cause in the point of the Ministery, and so professe.</p>

               <p>The other of Mr B. answer I mynd, is, about <hi>the power of Christ, against sin, Sathan, Antichrist,</hi> the want whereof, Mr Ainsw: and that truely, objecteth against the English assemblyes. Mr B. defence<note place="margin">Mr B.</note> summarily is, that, <hi>there is in the Church of England, the preaching of the word, which is the power of Christ,</hi> Rom. 1. 18. as also <hi>excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though not in every parrish, yet in the Church of England in which is comprehended all parrishes, and all superiour power over them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For which let the Reader observe these particulars.<note place="margin">Answ.</note>

               <p>First a national Church since Christs death, and the dissolution<note place="margin">I.</note> of the Iewish Church, is amonstrous compound, and savours of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the mayn part of the power of Christ be to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred<note place="margin">II.</note> in a particular congregation, by the ordinary officers thereof<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> namely the preaching of the gospell, why not the inferiour part, the censures also, save that the Byshops to Lord it over all, will keep this rod in their own hands?<note place="margin">III.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Ministers whose judgments &amp; reasons you avouch, both say, and prove, in the latter end of your book, that this power is given to <hi>a particular congregation of faithful people.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, you your self lay it down as a mayn ground against<note place="margin">IIII.</note> popularity, and withal sundry scriptures to prove it, that Christ hath appoynted the same sorts of men in his Church <hi>for preaching,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">pag. 92.</note> 
                  <hi>administration of the sacraments, and government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly it is apparant, that the particular Church of Corinth <note n="â€ " place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 4. 5.</note>

               <p>I proceed. Onely my desire is, that the things which I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted touching Christs kingly office, be the more carefully observed by all the people of God, and servants of Iesus, in respect of that most direct opposition, which in those latter dayes is made against it, and the administration thereof.

               </p>
               <p>We are as farr from denying this order of gathering Churches,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> as you are from enjoying it, Mr B: you needed not to have made three distinct proofs of this, which no man denyes: nor to have brought so many scriptures as you do, for the confirmation of that, which wee graunt with you, and practise without you. But herein you deceive the simple reader in that you separate, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyn those things, which then were, and alwayes should be ioyned together: and they are faith, and repentance. These two ioyntly did <hi>Christ</hi> himself preach, and <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> before him, and <hi>the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> after him: and these two were preached to, and required of every one both man, and woman, which was admitted into the Church, Mat. 3. 2. 6. Mark. 1. 15. Act. 19. 4. Luke 13. 3. 5. &amp; 24. 47. Act. 2. 28. &amp; 8. 37. &amp; 19. 18. But now bycause faith, &amp; repentance are inward graces resydeing in the hart, and known to God alone, which knoweth the hart, and that the profession, and confession of them are the ordinary meanes by which these hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and invisible graces are manifested, &amp; made visible vnto men, there was no cause, but they, which made this profession to men, in sincerity, so far as men could judge, should by men be deemed, and acknowledged for true members of Christ, and fit matter for
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:1037:135"/>
the Lords house. And so if by any other means men manifested themselves to have fayth, and holynes wrought in them (though they made neyther profession of faith, nor confession of sinnes) yet were they, (and so ought to be) intitled, and admitted to the liberties of the Church, as appeareth, Act. 10. 44. 46. 47. And vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this very ground also it is, that the children of the faithfull are of the Church, and baptised, though they make no profession of faith at all, bycause the scriptures declare them to be within the gratious covenant of Gods mercy, and love, and vnder the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the gospel, and so by vs to be reputed holy.

the Iewes back from Idolatry to the true service of God, so might King Edward, and Queen Elizabeth by force, bring back the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of England into covenant with God, to be his true Church, without any such profession of fayth, as in the first planting of Churches, is required.

And it is very like this is one reason, why Mr B. is so much perswaded of the Church of England, as of a true Church, because he thinks Antichrist sitts there in a measure: and it is not impossible, but this may have been some part of the cause, why in former tymes he was so loath to leav that Church, and to ioyn to vs, (when he thought we had the truth) because he perceived we wanted that prerogative of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs seat, which England enioyes. But though this shew the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity of the opinion, yet doth it not answer the obiections. I do then answer the same in effect, which Mr B. makes his fourth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t: namely, that, <hi>Popery, or Antichristianism begun not out of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity but in the Church of God:</hi> where it did also by steppes advance it selfe into the very throne of God, &amp; of Christ: &amp; there did in tyme, and by degrees so vniversally corrupt, and confound both persons and things, as that God could no longer be sayd to dwel there, by his visible presence, and promises, but Antichrist in his stead: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving destroyed the temple of the Lord, the Church, and caryed cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive his people, with the holy vessels into <hi>Babylon</hi> spirituall: as did
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:1037:141"/>
the civil Babylonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s the material temple, carying captive with them into Babylon civil, the holy vessels, and other appurtenances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, together, with a remnant of the Lords people, of which more hereafter. Onely I doe in the mean whyle except against two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in this second Argument. The former is, that <hi>Antichrist sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the temple of God</hi> (viz so remayning) <hi>is that head, with his body.</hi> 2 Th. 2. Antichrist was not in the Apostles tyme, nor in a long tyme after, a perfit man, consisting of the head the Pope, and the body, the Hierarchy ecclesiastical, but was in the seed onely, or as an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brie in the wombe, not perfectly framed, much lesse visibly brought forth, least of all grown to that height, as to iustle with Christ for his throne, yea to dispossesse him of it, as now he doth, and hath done a long season. Secondly it is not truely affirmed, that because there are <hi>some fundamental truthes of God in doctrine, and truthes in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Christ</hi> (as you Mr B. speak) <hi>held there,</hi> that therefore Rome is the true Church. How should Antichrist and the Divil in him, so effectually deceive with the delusion of vanity, and errour, if he did not countenance the same with some truthes? And do you not think it possible Mr B. that any malignant, and fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e Churches, should vsurp some truthes and ordinances of Christ which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyn not vnto them? If your argument be good, the <hi>Greek Churches, the Arians, Anabaptists, Vbiquitaries,</hi> yea and all the assemblyes of hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques and schismatiques in the world, are true Churches of Christ; for they all reteyn many mayn truthes, and ordinances of Christ.<note place="margin">III.</note>

                  <hi>the soul that sinneth shall dy, &amp; that the sonne shal not bear the iniquity of the father,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>The next thing I observe in this argument is, that you affirm <hi>the children of the Apostate Israelites to be the children of God by circumcision, and infants now to be Christs by baptism,</hi> which you say also <hi>consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the Church:</hi> against which Popish, and anabaptistical, errour, I do iustly except. Popish I call it, for that the papists imagine that by baptism their children are made Christian soules, and in signe of that, they have the font ever standing at the Church dore: so do the Anabaptists make baptism the form of the Church, which you call the constitution, as indeed the form of a thing constituteth it, and giveth being vnto it. Wherof if I my self were perswaded, I could not defend the baptism received eyther in Rome, or England, but I must withall iustify both the one, &amp; the other for the true Church of Christ. But against this vnsound opinion both theirs, and yours, I will lay down certayn arguments playnly proving the contrary.</p>
               <p>And first, it is the covenant of God, which makes the Church as you your selfe both affirm, &amp; prove, pag. 277. of your 2<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> book, of<note place="margin">pag. 132.</note> which covenant you also graunt in this place <hi>baptism to be the visible seal,</hi> as was also <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>circumcision</hi> in those tymes; and therefore it is not the covenant it selfe, but is after it in the order both of nature, and tyme.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Lord had his Church before eyther circumcision
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:1037:143"/>
or baptism were appoynted, which is also one, and the same in es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence from the beginning to the end of the world; which it could<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, if eyther circumcision, or baptism, were parts constitutive, or essentiall of it.</p>

               <p>Yet is there in this poynt a further consideration to be had of vs, vnto which both the scriptures, and our own experience do lead vs: namely that, as the Lord hath his people in Babylon, his, I mean, both in respect of election, and of personal sanctification: so hath he for their sakes there preserved (notwithstanding all the apostacy, and confusion, which is found in it) sundry his holy truthes, and ordinances, amongst which baptism is one. But as this his people, being commingled with the Babylonians in one visible communion, cannot be called the true visible Church of God; so neyther can these ordinances, in the administration of them, be called the true visible ordinances of Christ, and of his Church: but as the Lords <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Rev. 18. 4.</note>

Lastly doth it follow, that, because Papists <hi>might be iudged true christians for the truthes they hold, their corruptions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away,</hi> they are therefore such with their corruptions: so the vilest haeretique, Idolater, or other miscreant in the world, take away his haeresy, Idolatry, and mischeif, may be iudged a christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: yea the Divil himself, take but away his corruptions, is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Angel of light.</p>

And I am verily perswaded that Mr B. (how bold so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be in his affirmations) will not say the like of all England, eyther in the beginning, or end of King Edwards, or Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths reign, which the scriptures themselves here, and els where, do testify, of all Iudah: whither we respect the disposition of the people whose hearts vniversally the Lord on his part did thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; or the solemn covenant, which they on theirs, did contract, or rather renue with him. And here I do further also infer, since <hi>all Iudah reioyced at the oath of the covenant, and swore vnto the Lord with all their heart, and sought him with a whole desire:</hi> 2 Chr. 15. 13. and that <hi>the hand of God was in Iudah, so that he gave them one heart to do the commaundement of the King, and of the rulars according to the word of the Lord:</hi> Ch. 30. 12. and so at other tymes, that it is most vntruely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Mr B. how oft soever he repeat it, that the <hi>reformation of Iudah was not voluntary, but of compulsion, and of fear.</hi> True it is, that the Kings of Iudah made compulsive lawes for the reformation of the people, or rather for their continuance in that reformation, to which they had voluntarily submitted; but as Mr B. ignorance is intollerable in that his seditious errour, tending indeed to the disturbance and subversion of all states civil, and ecclesiastical, that â€  <hi>voluntarinesse is taken away by being vnder any government:</hi> that<note place="margin">Pag. 212.</note> 
                  <hi>to be subiect, and ruled is an estate far from fredome:</hi> and that <hi>Christians loose therby christian liberty:</hi> so should he here have observed a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt compulsion active, and passive, as they speak: or more playnly thus, that it is one thing for Kings, or men in authority, to require of their subiects the performance of necessary duties or the forbearance of the contrary, vpon such, and such penaltyes, and another thing for their subiects to obey them herein, for fear, and involuntarily. Many of the Kings lawes do require loyalty of all his subiects towards his maiesty, and do forbid vpon payn of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:1037:150"/>
death al treasons, &amp; rebellions: now wil any man hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> be so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advised, as to affirm, that therfore all the Kings subjects do forbear treasons and rebellions, through compulsion, and fear, and vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly? That godly magistrates are by compulsion to represse pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique, &amp; notable idolatry, as also to provide that the truth of God in his ordinance, be taught, and published in their dominions, I make no doubt; it may be also, it is not vnlawfull for them by some penalty, or other, to provoke their subjects vniversally vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hearing for their instruction, and conversion; yea to graunt they may inflict the same vpon them, if after due teaching, they offer not themselves vnto the Church; but that any King now vpon earth is by the word of God, to draw all the people of his nation into co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Lord, (how much lesse before they be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>veniently taught) and to confirm the same by oath, and to inflict death vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all that refuse it, or remayn wicked<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and vnrepentant, as the Kings of Iudah were to do by the people of that nation, can never be proved by Mr B. or any other man, how oft soever they bring in their practises for presidents. And if the Kings of Engl. should hold it their duty, as the Kings of Israel held it theirs, to <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Ps. 101. 8</note>

To these conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations let this be added, that when <hi>David</hi> the most famous King of Israel had <note n="â€ " place="margin">2 Sam. 5. 1. 2. 3. 5.</note>

Neyther can you shift of the matter, Mr B. by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging that these nations were heathens, and infidels, and such as made no profession of religion, nor were circumcised: for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest over whom David ruled, the <note n="*" place="margin">vr 14.</note>

You speak much of the reformation of your Church after Popery. There was indeed a great reformation of things in your Church, but very little, of the Church, to speak truely, and properly. The people, as I haue sayd, are the Church: and to make a reformed Church, there must be first a reformed people: and so there should haue been with you by the <hi>preaching of repentance from dead works, and faith in Christ:</hi> that the people (as the Lord should haue vouchsafed grace) being first fitted for, &amp; made capable of the sacraments, and other ordinances, might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards have communicated in the pure vse of them: for want of which, in stead of a pure vse, there hath been, and is at this day a most prophane abuse of them, to the great dishonour of Christ, and his gospell, and to the hardening of thowsands in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitencie. Others also indeavouring yet a further reformation, have sued, and do sue to Kings, and Queens, and Parliaments, for the rooting out of the Prelacy, and with it, of such other evill fruits as grow from that bitter root: and on the contrary to have the Ministery, government, and discipline of Christ set over the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes, as they stand: the first fruit of which reformation, (if it were

Is it not strange that men in the reforming of a Church, should almost, or altogether forget the Church which is the people, or that they should labor to crown Christ a King over a people, whose Prophet he hath not first been? or to set him to rule by his law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They after the abolition of Popery, were esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished at the first, whether by a new plantation (new wee mean in respect of the present estate of Rome) or by reformation onely, as you will haue it: and are still continued, and increased by the free, voluntary, and personall profession of faith, and confession of sinnes of such men, and women, as are by the word of God, and the publishing of it, perswaded, and in some measure fore-fitted to joyn vnto them, and walk with them: and all this without any <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion with the fear of Iosiahs sword,</hi> or <hi>Hezechiahs proclamation,</hi> by<note place="margin">pag. 246. 247.</note> which you confesse your Church to have been, in the persons of <hi>King Edward &amp; Queen Elizabeth, brought back from Antichrist to the reformation</hi> wherin now you sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d: for which you peremptorily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, there is <hi>not required any profession of the name of Christ.</hi> Let it then be considered of, and judged by all indifferent men, how it can possibly be that both the reformed Churches abroad, and the vnreformed Church of England, can be truely gathered, after the apostasie of Antichrist: the former being separated from Popety in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to covenant with the Lord, in the particular members, by volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profession of faith without compulsion; and the latter by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion, without profession of faith.

               <p>A solide proof; bycause the Queen did voluntarily imbrace the<note place="margin">Answ.</note> truth in a measure, therfore the whole body of the land, whom she vrged by proclamation, and other inforcements, did voluntarily professe, and imbrace the same.

In adding further, that the <hi>Queens proclamation was a kind of teaching,</hi> you trifle notably: the quaestion is of such a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as was effectuall to make a whole nation of Antichristians the week before, true Christians, and a true Church. It was in deed the onely effectuall means the people had generally: and if the Queen had proclaymed the contrary the next week, it would haue been as effectual to haue turned them to their former vomit again. Your presumption, that <hi>no man can say to the contrary, but that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple yeelded voluntarily</hi> to the truth, vpon the Queens proclamation is vayn, considering what the <note n="â€ " place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>voluntary</hi> yeeling, or <hi>submission vnto the Gospel of Christ</hi> is, which the scriptures commend vnto vs, in the establishing of Churches. The gospel is a supernaturall thing, and cannot possibly be yeelded vnto voluntarily by a naturall man, or perswaded, but by a supernaturall motive, which is onely it self: &amp; that by the operation of the spirit also in some measure, it cannot be vnderstood, and beleeved but by it self published, and proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (as the sun is seen by it own light) much lesse can it be willed, and willingly yeelded vnto: for the will must follow the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, neyther can any man will that he knowes not. Besides, the many treasons<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and great rebellions raysed to reestablish Popery in the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d, the great good liking of the old law (as they term it) which still is found in the multitude, and the apparant hatred and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quution against the true profession of the gospel in any measure, (though there be ten now for one in the beginning of the Queens reign that haue atteyned to some measure of knowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of godlynes) do confirm that which I say, viz: that the yeelding vnto the gospell in the multitude, could not be volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

               <p>And thus at the last am I got back whence I digressed, &amp; will now proceed in the examination of such reasons, as Mr B: brings to prove that profane persons, or to vse his own words, <hi>men of lewd conversation, are not false matter of the Church.</hi> To which purpose, he first distinguisheth <hi>true matter</hi> into <hi>good, and bad;</hi> and so taking that which is bad, &amp; naught vnto himself, for the matter of his Church,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:1037:153"/>
he will yet have it true, and <hi>no false matter.</hi> And this distinction of his, he labours to exemplifie by similitude, and to confirm by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. The similitude he borrowes from a materiall house, and the matter of it, <hi>timber,</hi> &amp; <hi>stone,</hi> which makes eyther nothing to the matter in hand, or if any thing, against himself. If there can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be any false matter of an house, then rotten timber is false matter: and so wicked and vnrepentant sinners dead, and rotting in the grave of sinne, are false matter in proportion: but if there can be no false matter of a materiall house, then he may see how maymed his comparison is, when the termes of the one side are impossible. Howsoever it is evident, that the house of God, the Church is a <note n="â€ " place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5</note>

               <p>Now for the second poynt, nothing can be more vntruely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, then that the Church may cast out any part, or parcel of her true matter. For first, all the true matter of the Church hath vpon it the form of the Church, and so is of the essence, and being of the Church, which for the Church to cast out, were to destroy her own essence, &amp; being. Secondly, the true matter of the Church, and true members of Christ, are the same. As <note n="â€ " place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 11.</note>

And though your Ordinaries Mr B. be oft tymes so liberall of the true members of Christ, as thus to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them to the Divel, yet had the Ministers of Christ rather have their own members torn from their bodies, then thus to dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the blessed body of the Lord Iesus. The heynousnes of this fact shewes the vanity of your distinction, the errour of your opinion, and the falsity of your Church.</p>
               <p>Lastly you do mistake the two scriptures, which you bring to prove, that <hi>a man iustly excommunicate is still called a brother in the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and so to be held by the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apostle in the former place, 2 Th. 3. 15. speaks not of a man excommunicated, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

dislike of it, that he may see it, and be ashamed of it: and this he that reads over the chapter, shall observe (I suppose) to be the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles meaning. In the second place, which is, 1 Cor. 5. 11. his meaning is, not, that Christians beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ming fornicators, covetous, Idolaters, and so continuing obstinate, should still be reputed bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren notwithstanding, but he speaks of a brother there, as Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel speaks of <hi>a righteous man,</hi> chapt. 18. 24. that <hi>turns away from his righteousnes and commits in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Both the Prophet, and Apostle speaks of such persons, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>s were righteous, and brethren reputatively, before they did so bastardly degenerate. And is it possible, that Christ should charge his Ch: to account an obstinate offender, as an heathen and publican, Mat. 18. and that Paul should come after, and direct them to account him a brother? Besides <note n="â€ " place="margin">Math. 23 8.</note> 
                  <hi>all</hi> the members of the Church <hi>are bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:</hi> and to become a member is to become a brother, and so to be excommunicated out of the Church is nothing els but to be cast out of the Churches brotherhood. Lastly, the Apostle, 1 Cor. 5. 11. names <hi>idolatours</hi> amongst the rest; and will you haue idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters your brethren, Mr B? why then did you in the former pag. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Papists,</hi> and pag. 108. <hi>Idolatours</hi> vniversally? A holy brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood it seems you will have, brother idolater, haeretique, and what not?</p>
               <p>The instance you bring of <hi>Symon Magus an hypocrite received by the Apostle,</hi> (by the Evangelist you should say) Act. 8. makes stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against you, if it be well considered, what is written of him. For after he was discovered by Peter <hi>not to have his heart right in the sight of God,</hi> he was pronounced by him to have neyther part, nor fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship in that busines. ver: 21.

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:1037:155"/>
commaundement of Christ, Math. 7. 6. Cease Mr B. to excuse your self by accusing the holy Apostles, and Evangelists of Christ.</p>
               <p>And herevpon I do thus argue.</p>
               <p>They that haue no right to the holy things of God in the Ch: are not to be admitted into it, neyther is the Church gathered of such persons, rightly, and truely gathered.</p>
               <p>But men of lewd conversation have no right to the holy things of God in the Church; and therefore the Church gathered of such persons, is not truely gathered.</p>
               <p>The former propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> is clear, bycause men admitted into the Church, are admitted to the participation, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion of the holy things of God in the Church. The 2. also appeareth, both by the scripture before named, where Peter pronounceth, that, such as have not their hart right with God, (which no lewd persons hav or ever had) haue no part in the holy things of God, as also by Mr Bernards own graunt, namely, that wicked persons are to be cast out of the Church. And what could there be in the world more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, yea or wherein God were more plainly mocked, then to gather a Church of such persons, as are judged fit to be cast out of the Church? And yet for this Church-gathering (being indeed his own) Mr B: pleads both here, and every where, both in this, and his other book.</p>

Of the termes of which compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, and their proportion, wee shall speak by, and by. I do one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the mean while intreat the reader to observ with me these two things. The former, that, <hi>Mr B:</hi> having in the beginning of his book censured vs very severely, and that with <hi>D.

The latter, that speaking of the invisible Church, and the form of it, he brings in sundry scriptures, as so to be expounded, which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly intended of the visible Church: &amp; amongst the rest these three. Ephe. 2. 22. and 4. 4. 1 Cor. 12. 13. the last of which he himself also within a few pages following expounds as meant of<note place="margin">pag. 125.</note> the visible Church, and the properties thereof.

As the invisible, internall, and effectuall v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of God with man, of man with God, and of one man with another is raysed from the invisible, internall, and effectuall work of the spirit, invisible, internall, and effectuall faith, and love, which are onely seen, and known of God, and of the parties themselves, in whom they are; so must the visible, externall, and apparant vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God with man, of man with God, and of one man with an other, arise from the visible, externall, and apparent work of the spirit; visible, externall, and apparant faith, and love, which are seen of men, and made sensible to the ey of charity, which judgeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably of thinges which are not seen, by the things which are seen. For albeit, it be true, which Mr B. hath in his 2. book, that wee<note place="margin">pag. 136.</note> are not therefore a Church of God, bycause men so judge vs, but bycause God hath received vs into covenant with himself; yet it must also be considered, that the Church is not called visible in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of God, but of men, to whom it doth, or may appear, &amp; by whom it is so discerned, and judged probably.</p>

                  <hi>one Church</hi> of Christ, <hi>which is his body, whereof he is the head, and which he hath purchased with his blood:</hi> for Christ hath not purchased two Churches with his blood, but one, neyther is the head of two bodyes, but of one: and according to this purchase of Christ, and ordinance of God, all that are of the visible Church are also of the invisible, and all of the invisible of the visible Church, which are indeed not two, but one Church, in two sundry respects, as I have formerly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I deny not, but that, as it hath been sayd of old, there are <hi>many sheep without, and many wolves within:</hi> many of the visible Church, which are not of the invisible Church, and so answerably, many of the invisible Church, which never come into the visible Church. But this say I, is not according to the revealed will of God, in his word; but by mans default, and sin. It is their sin of ignorance or infirmity, which (being of the invisible Church) do not, (if possibly they can) joyn themselues vnto the visible Church, there to partake in the visible ordinances: it is their sinne of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, and presumption, which not being of the invisible Church; do adjoyn themselves to the visible Church, there to prophane the Lords covenant, &amp; ordinances, to which they have no right. For how can they being wicked, and vnholy, chalendge the LORD to be their GOD, that is, all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, &amp; goodnes, vnto them, which is one part of the covenant.
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:1037:158"/>
or professe themselves to be his people, which is another part? when the Divel is their God, and their lusts; and they his, &amp; their people, and servants, to whom they obey? or what have they to do to meddle with Gods covenant, whom he expresly forbids to take it in their mouthes? It is therefore a vile &amp; profane defence, which you are driven to, Mr B: by pleading, that wicked persons are true matter of the Church, and so admitted into covenant with God, in the 2. book; that <hi>obedience</hi> onely <hi>followes the covenant</hi>
                  <note place="margin">pag. 279.</note> 
                  <hi>as the fruit of it:</hi> and that God requires not actuall obedience, or that wee should be actually good, or holy, before, or when we co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him: but that he should make vs good; and that wee should be good, and perform actuall obedience afterward; which as it is notable Anabaptistry, and in deed the ground of that hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy being applyed to the covenant of the Iewish Church: so being applyed to the covenant of the Church now, it is worse then Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptistry. And consider this man, he makes the sacrament of the Lords supper a ground, and part of the covenant, and yet affirms, that God for mens entering into this covenant, requires not that they should be holy, and good: and so by this deep divinity, it must needs follow, that the Lord requires not that men should be good, or holy for their partaking in the sacrament of the Lords supper.</p>

Even now the profession of faith made the true matter of the Church; and here it must make the true form of the Church: and yet the truth is, that in the forming of your nationall En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Church by a new <hi>covenant</hi> from that wherein it stood <hi>in Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> which was by your own graunt, <hi>with Saints and Angels in stead of God,</hi> &amp;, I adde, with Antichrist, in the stead of Christ, no such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of faith was made, as your self here do both require, and prove necessary for the forming of the visible Church, or her v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting with God. And that I manifest in two particulars. The former is<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that the profession of faith required for a peoples vniting with the Lord their God, must be made both freely, and particularly by the persons themselves so vniting.

For by the same rule of proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I argue thus. As they in whose hearts, sinns, and corruptions reign inwardly, are no true Christians before God, nor actuall members of Christ invisibly: so they in whose lives, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, sinnes and corruptions reign outwardly, are no true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians before men nor members of Christ visibly. And here comes to my mind an other argument much what like this, in Mr B. <hi>2.</hi> book: where he will have <hi>a mixt company of godly, and wicked persons to be called holy, or a company of saynts,</hi> as well as <hi>a person, holy, in whom there is a mixture of the spirit, and flesh.</hi> But the difference is playn. In this mixt body of godly, &amp; wicked, sin reigns in some of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers but in no part of body, or faculty of soul of a person, in whom the spirit is, (though never so much flesh be mingled with it) doth sinne reign. He might as well say, the whole Church so mixt shalbe saved: for the whol man shalbe saved, by faith in Christ, notwithstanding all mixture in him.</p>
               <p>Now the conclusion Mr B. makes, that, their <hi>congregations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse Christ, as is before sayd;</hi> that <hi>God hath given them his holy word, and sacraments: &amp; moved the harts of all of them outwardly to receive both the one, and the other,</hi> is vnproved, and vntrue.</p>
               <p>For first, there is no one congregation in the Land whose par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular members made that holy profession in any measure, by &amp; according to which the Apostles did constitute and vnite visible congregations. Secondly, I deny that the Lord hath given his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments to any congregation in the Land: there are very many
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:1037:160"/>
in the best ordered parishes, which take them without the Lords gift: as being wicked vsurpers of them, vnto which by the revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will of God they have no right. But here I must needs dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Mr Bernards haunt, and the turning, by which in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond book he vsually declines both Mr Ainsworths &amp; Mr Smyths Arguments of this nature: and that is, by telling them, that <hi>all are not wicked amongst them,</hi> that <hi>some,</hi> or <hi>many haue the true knowledge of Gods word:</hi> and that <hi>the fear of God possesseth the hearts of many:</hi> as in<note place="margin">pag. 249. 250. &amp;c.</note> this place, that <hi>God hath moved the hearts of many of the people effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi> and the like: and that therefore we do them wrong in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning all for some:</hi> and in denying the good their right, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers default. To this I answer first that those that can be true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judged to fear God, are thin strewed in the best places: and not many in comparison of the rest, as is pretended, but a very small handfull: and besides, it is but casuall, and accidentall to the congregation, and nothing to the constitution of it, that there is one man truely fearing God in it. The parish must be a true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible constituted Church, as well one as another, and so receive the sacraments together, whether the Lord have had any such work (as is here spoken of) in the hearts of any, or no. And 2. it must be considered, &amp; I pray the teader well to observe it, that the quaestion here betwixt Mr B. and me (and so ordinarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him, and them) is about the congregation (which consists of all the members ioyntly) and not about some particulars co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered severally from the rest, of whom the congregation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists not. I am verily perswaded there are in many congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions many that truely feare God: (and the Lord encrease their number, and graces) and if they were separated from the rest into visible communion, I should not doubt to account them <hi>such co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, as vnto which God had given his sacraments:</hi> but take them as they are even one with the rest, in one ioynt communion, as members of one body, making all together one Church, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, so joyned at the first, and so still remayning, I deny that this Church, or congregation is the Lords people in covenaunt with him: or that he hath given vnto it his sacraments: yea or that those, which truely <hi>fear God, &amp; are accepted of him</hi> in their persons,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:1037:161"/>
have in that communion, the right, and lawfull vse of them in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particulars. They cannot take them for pawnes and pledges of Gods love, and the forgivenes of sinns, to that congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they ioyn in the vse of them: nor as testimonies of true spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall love amongst the persons communicating in them: nor as notes &amp; badges of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vnion of the members with the head, and one with another mutually. Since therefore your congregations, or parish assemblies are (&amp; alwayes have been) so constituted, as that neyther the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of them (being prophane) have any interest in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or can have any right vse of them in their persons, nor yet the rest in their communion: it must needs follow, (except the Lord have given his sacraments to them, which can haue no right vse of them, and to whom they apperteyn not) that <hi>the Lord hath</hi> not <hi>given his holy sacraments to your congregations.</hi> And where you further adde, that <hi>God hath moved the harts of all the people of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations outwardly to receive both the word, and sacraments,</hi> it is one, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest of your bold, but bare affirmations. Are there not many thowsands amongst you that vnderstand not <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>the doctrine of the beginning of Christ,</hi> the very first principles of christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>? And hath God perswaded the harts of these to receive the word &amp; sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts in any sence? The Lord Iesus teacheth vs in the gospel that <note n="â€ " place="margin">Ioh. 3. 20.</note>
                  <hi>every man that doth evill, hateth the light, neyther commeth to light, least his deeds should be reproved.</hi> And yet you will haue vs beleeve, that God hath perswaded the hearts of all the evill-doers amongst you, not onely to come to the light, but also to receive it. Let your own parish Mr B: stand for instance. There were in it (to myne own knowledge) when you wrote this book, that held most blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous errours touching the very Trinity; and there are at this day, (as I am certaynly informed) who are so <hi>moved to receive the word,</hi> as that your Church-wardens are driven to spend a great part of the Lords day in hunting them from the ale-house to the temple. And if this be your case, what is the condition of the most congregations in the Land, to which the word of God
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:1037:161"/>
hath not so much as been offered in any indifferent measure for the moving of their harts to receive it? The truth is, the people are drawn in the most congregations, the most of them, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in all, by compulsive lawes, to <hi>keep their Parish Church, to heare divine service, to communicate at Easter, and to receive the sacraments, and other rites:</hi> as is commaunded in the communion book: but how farre the most are from having their harts thus moved, as is pretended of all, to receive the word of God, appeareth too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in that great contempt, and hatred wherein they have such amongst themselves, as do in any sinceritie eyther preach or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the same. To these things I may further adde, that, since the Lord hath given his word and sacraments to be dispensed to no people, but by the meanes which he hath prescribed in his word<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> except the English Preisthood, and leitourgy were prescribed by the word of God, for these ministrations, even in this respect God cannot be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ayd to have given his word, and sacraments to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations spoken of.</p>
               <p>Now although this which hath been sayd in answer to your grounds, be sufficient to disprove the form of your Church, as you your self Mr B. rayse it, yet for your further conviction, I will adde certayn Arguments to manifest, and make playn, that wicked, and vngodly men, and women are vncapable, by the word of the Lord, of his covenaunt, and of all spirituall visible vnion with him; &amp; so consequently your congregations (gathered of such persons at the first, and of such still consisting generally, with a handfull god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded scattered amongst them) to remayn vnformed, by the Lords holy covenant. The Arguments are,</p>
               <p>First, bycause godly, and wicked men are contraries, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">I.</note> guided, and led by contrary causes, the one sort by <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 5. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>sh,</hi> which <hi>are contrary one unto another.</hi> Now two contraries are not capable of one, and the same form.</p>
               <p>Wicked men, and such as <note n="â€ " place="margin">Psal. 50. 16. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>hate to be reformed</hi> are forbidden, by<note place="margin">II.</note> the revealed will of God, from medling with his <hi>covenant,</hi> or <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances:</hi> and therefore are not by the revealed wil of God received
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:1037:162"/>
into covenant with him, or to the participation of his ordinances<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> which are both one.</p>
               <p>Since wicked men are by the word of God (as you your self<note place="margin">III.</note> graunt) to be excommunicated, that is to be cut off from the visible vnion with Christ and his Church, how can they be sayd by the same word of God, to be capable of this vnion with Christ and his Church? nothing can be eyther more vnreasonably affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or more vngodlily practised.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the scriptures do expressely debarre <hi>men of lewd, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly</hi>
                  <note place="margin">IIII.</note> 
                  <hi>conversation,</hi> of all fellowship, vnion, and communion with God. <hi>If wee say, that we haue fellowship with him, and walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, we ly and do not truely,</hi> sayth the Apostle, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. <hi>Ep:</hi> 1. 6. and <hi>what fellowship</hi> sayth Paul, <hi>hath righteousnes with vnrighteousnes? &amp; what communion hath light with darknes? and what concord hath Christ with Bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The former of these scriptures is so directly against you, as if it were recorded by the holy Ghost with particular respect to your errour. You say that men though of a lewd conversation, that is, walking in darknes, have visible fellowship, vnion, and communion with God, if they professe they beleeve in Christ, or so say; Iohn on the contrary teacheth that they which walk in darknes, have no fellowship with God, though they so say, but are lyars. The other scripture must be further opened, and inforced: considering how you charge vs in your 2. book with the <hi>wretched abuse of it;</hi> and labour by a long discourse<note place="margin">pag. 140.</note> to wring it out of our hands: as being our <hi>speciall weapon</hi> (as you say) <hi>to fight for separation, and to defend the same.</hi> The four heads vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which you reduce all the particulars about it, I will prosequ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And here in our names you frame an obiection, the sum whereof is, that if all <hi>the godly would separate from all the wicked, then there should be no wicked of the Church.</hi> Vnto which you answer sundry things: but how sufficiently will appear in the particulars. First you say, <hi>God commaunds not his to separate wholly from all the wicked: but from Infidels, Gentiles, Idolaters; Iewes, Turks, Papists, whose very societies are to be left as no people of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well then, I perceive, all religious fellowship with Papists is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, and that their societies are no people of God. And how agrees this with your other affirmations, that <hi>Rome is a true Church: Papists true Christians, though under corruptions, as it was true Iob, though vnder soars: baptism there, a true sacrament, and seal of the covenaunt;</hi> &amp; yet here the societies of Papists are no people of God, that is in no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him? Or how doth this <hi>separatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  </hi> thus <hi>wholly</hi> to be made <hi>from Papists</hi> agree with that you write, pag. 91. of <hi>ioyning in prayer</hi> with such <hi>Papists,</hi> as though they be of the Church of Rome, <hi>yet sorrow for the abhominations, and as are come out from it in their soules, the best part,</hi> though not so in their bodyes?</p>
               <p>The distinction you put between Infidels, and idolaters, and men of prophane life, wee shall consider of in due place: &amp; for your speach of <hi>all the Church falling into the estate of infidelity, and so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>dged of the Church,</hi> eyther it is without sense, or I, which vnderstand it not. Now to that you adde of <hi>separating from the private familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the wicked, living in the society of the godly,</hi> and that, <hi>if they will not be reformed, other courses are to be taken with them,</hi> as their <hi>sin of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy deserves,</hi> I answer these things. First, that, as there is a case, wherein private withdrawing from a brother is warrantable, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when his offence is private, and he privately obstinate, &amp; that his sinne eyther cannot be, or is not yet made publick, &amp; publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  </gap>d: so to <hi>separate from men privately,</hi> and that <hi>onely,</hi> for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick offences, is a course without ground either of scripture, or rea son. You say, pag. 144. that <hi>(alvin so expounds</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 11. and therevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> do take an occasion to accuse our <hi>practise</hi> as <hi>Brownisticall,</hi> &amp; vs of <hi>Luciferian schisme,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pharisaicall pride.</hi> As I leave your raylings to be iudged by the Lord, so do I give the reader to vnderstand, how you grossely abuse Calvins authority: who expounds that scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture (as all men know it is meant) of excommunicates, and of mens private cariage towards them: with which, publick separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is also to be joyned: I suppose you your self will not deny it. And where you speak of <hi>an other course to be taken with wicked men, that wil not be reformed,</hi> you should also shew what that course is, and what is to be done, if that course be not taken: but you have thought it a point of your wisdome to be silent in these things least by ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them too particularly, you should discover your own shame.</p>
               <p>The course to be taken is, the censuring of such incorrigible of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders by the particular congregation, whereof they are, being <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in the name of Christ, by the power of Christ;</hi> with which<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.</note> power divine, and heavenly priviledge, he hath furnished his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches every one of them, as well as that one of Corinth; neyther doth any true Church of Christ want this power, or neglect the vse of it without sinne. And if any Church of Christ would neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to vse this power against scandalous sin manifestly proved, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>vinced, &amp; would obstinately continue (notwithstanding all good meanes vsed to the contrary) this sower leaven vnpurged out, the whole lump were levened, and with leven might not the Passeover be eaten. And as the Church, if sin do arise, is first to endeavour the casting out of the sinne by the sinners repentance, and if that will not be, in the last place to cast out the sinne, and sinner toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: so if the Church do wickedly bear out, and boulster iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty amongst themselves, such as are faithfull are first to quit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of that Church-sin by testifying against it, and reproving it, and in the last place to quit themselves of the Church, if it remayn incurable. Now here you bring in certayn <hi>differences,</hi> &amp; distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>of separation,</hi> but without application. The first I omit as being before handled, so much as concerns the present purpose. The 2.

                  <hi>thus much: beleevers are not to be with the wicked in their vnrighteousnes, in the state of their darknes, nor to partake with them in their evils, and so to agree together: which no way helps our separation from light, righteousnes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is true that the particular matter the Apostle findes fault<note place="margin">Answ:</note> with, is, the beleeving Corinthians communicating with the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in the idol feasts: but withall it must be considered, that the Apostle vpon this particular occasion delivers a generall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, then which nothing is more vsuall both in the old, &amp; new testament. The same Apostle in his former Epistle to the same Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians takes occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> from the fornicatour among them, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them the companying, or <hi>commingling</hi> not onely <hi>with fornicators,</hi> but <hi>with covetous persons, Idolaters, raylers, drunkards, extortioners,</hi> &amp; all other wicked men whomsoever, ch. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

More particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: though the Apostle (as you would haue it) did onely forbid <hi>partaking with the wicked in their evils,</hi> yet even therein did he forbid all religious communion with them since their very prayers, and other sacrifices are <hi>their evils:</hi> wherein whylst the godly do commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with them, what do they els but acknowledge their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon right, and interest in those holy things? But that the Apostle in this scripture forbids communion not onely in the evill works of wicked men, but with their persons: and that he commaunds a separation not onely reall, but personall, doth appeare by these Reasons.</p>
               <p>First, bycause the scripture hath reference to the yoaking of the<note place="margin">I,</note> beleevers with the vnbeleevers in mariage, as the occasion of that spirituall Idolatrous mixture, which he reproves.

Ezra. 9. 1. 2. &amp; 10. 2. 3 Nehem. 9. 2. &amp; 10. 28. 30. and that Paul reproves the Corinthians, <hi>Epist.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. for having fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship not in the persons incest, but with the incestuous person: whom therefore they were <hi>to purge out, &amp; to put away from among</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

               <p>Fourthly, the Apostle enjoyns such a separation, as vpon which<note place="margin">IIII.</note> a people is to be reputed <hi>Gods people, the temple of the living God,</hi> &amp; may chalenge his promise <hi>to be their God, to dwell amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>g them, &amp; to walk</hi>

                  <hi>vnto Christ out of the world,</hi> whom alone of all them so given him, he had <hi>lost, that the scripture might be fulfilled.</hi> vers. 6. 12. whence it is evident to all men, that do not blinde their eyes, that Christ here speakes of such a donation, or gift, as was visible, or of such members as were visibly, and in respect of men separated, &amp; sanctified from the world vnto God, and not at all of any invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gift, or members.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Christ speaks of such persons as the <hi>world hated, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi>

                  <hi>they were not of the world:</hi> ver. 14. but the wicked world doth not hate men, as they are elect before God, and invisibly, or inwardly separated, and sanctifyed, but as they are outwardly such, and so separated, whether they be inwardly so, or no.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Christ speakes of such a chusing out of the world, as<note place="margin">III.</note> he doth of a <hi>sending into the world,</hi> ver. 18. which sending as it was visible, and externall, so was the selection, and separation spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. And say not for shame, Mr B. that the visible Church of Christ is to be gathered, or consist of the men of the world visibly. The Church, and world are tvvo distinct, yea two contrary states, and bodyes, though the body of your nationall Church were at the first gathered, and hath over since consisted of the vvorld, and all.</p>
               <p>To conclude, this light man, being pressed by Mr Ainsworth in another place of his book vvith this scripture, both affirms, &amp; <note place="margin">Pag. 254.</note> proves by many reasons, that Christ here speaks of a mixt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, vvhich the elect are not.

               <p>And thus I return to the exposition of 2 Cor. 6. and in it to prove, that the Apostles meaning is to forbid communion, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship not onely with wicked works, but also with the wicked persons themselves that walk in them. For which purpose I do ad this one onely consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>: namely that the Prophet Isaiah (from whom the Apostle borroweth this phrase, <hi>come out from among them,</hi>

The first is, that by this exposition <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s should not be under the covenaunt, bycause the law of God is not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their harts.</hi> But my answer is that hypocrites in respect of God and his secret, invisible, and approving will, and calling, are not of the Church, nor under the covenaunt: but in respect of men, &amp; of the revealed will of God, according to which me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> must judge, all that are outwardly holy, have their sinns forgiven, and the law of God written in their harts. And to your 2. exception, namely, <hi>that the place is not vnderstood barely of a member of the visible Church, but so of it, as withall he be an elect saynt,</hi> I do answer, it is true you say, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But let them be such in any measure, as of whom the Lord in his word
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:1037:170"/>
gives approbation, and whom he entitles to the visible ordinances in his Church, and then they are <hi>not barely visible members,</hi> as you speak, <hi>but elect saynts also,</hi> in the respects formerly mentioned. It is evident that both Ieremy, and the Apostle to the Hebrewes speak of <hi>the new testament,</hi> or covenant of grace, whereof <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour in his own blood;</hi> opposed to the <hi>old testament,</hi> and covenaunt of works <hi>established by Moses in the blood of bulles, and goates:</hi> and of the persons with whom the Lord makes this covenant, and which haue legacies in this will, and testament of Christ, which he hath also confirmed by his death: which do <hi>all know God, and have his law written in their harts, and their sinns pardoned.</hi> And there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more derogatory to the grace of God, and blood of Christ, then that any within the compasse of this covenant of grace, or having a portion in this testament established in Christs blood, should not haue his iniquities forgiven, and his heart sanctifyed by the spirit, truely or in appearance, as he is truely or apparantly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the former graces. And here also appears the vanity of your third exception so oft repeated by you, to wit, that you are <hi>not all without the law of God written in your harts, and without the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of sinnes,</hi> but that <hi>some of you</hi> have obteyned this grace. As though the quaestion were of some few in your Church, &amp; not of the whole Church. If you minded what you had in hand, you should see, that to prove your Church within the covenaunt of the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you were bound to manifest, not that some few, but that all the members of it were (at the least in the constitution) partakers, of those promises, wherein it is established: the reason is bycause not some few severally, but all the members joyntly considered, do make the Church.</p>

His distinction is, that <hi>properties arise from within</hi> the Church, <hi>and priviledges from without:</hi> and my learning fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> his distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> is, that he vndertakes to teach others, where he hath not yet learnt himself. His errour then is in the too streyt acceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of the term <hi>property,</hi> which he should take in a larger sense, as Mr Smyth hath rightly taught him: namely that, whatsoever is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vnto a person, or thing (whether within, or without) and not common to other things, or persons with him, or it, that is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, or property of that person, or thing. And so since all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges wherewith Christ hath endowed his Church, are proper, and peculiar vnto the Church, and not common to her with the world, it is most evident, they are all of them the Churches pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and so to be accounted, though she may for a tyme want the actuall vse of many of them. And even those <hi>priviledges,</hi> which your self bring for <hi>instances,</hi> are true properties of the Church: as <hi>to be called saynts, faithful, elect: to suffer for Christ:</hi> to be <hi>the ark to keep the books of the covenant: to set to the seales: to vse the keyes to open, &amp; to shut heaven:</hi> then which what can be more proper or peculiar vnto the Church? And it is strange that <hi>sayntship, and holynes,</hi> grace <hi>to suffer for Christ,</hi> and the like should not be accounted more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall propertyes of the Church, then a prophane profession of faith and vsurpation of some ordinances of religion by lewd, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly persons.</p>
               <p>But towching the properties of the Church by you layd down, my answer is, that except your nationall Church be that true Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell of God, which he hath admitted joyntly, and severally into the covenant &amp; fellowship of grace, &amp; salvation, and to whom he hath given the promises of that covenant, and to whom by his revealed will the seales, and sacraments for the confirmation of those promises, do apperteyn, the more you meddle with this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant by professing or publishing it, the more you take Gods name in vayn; and the more of the ordinances of God, &amp; his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, you vse, and injoy, the more you abuse, &amp; vsurp: &amp; the longer you continue in so doing, the more dangerous is your estate, &amp; the more to be bewayled.</p>

                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:1037:172"/>And for the things themselves by which you would haue the Ch: of Christ distinguished from all other assemblies, they are such, as may in the outward ceremony, and observation of them, without any sanctifyed vse (which is the point in controversy between me and you) both be performed, and continued in, eyther for feare, or fashion by any accursed conventicle of atheists, murderers, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers or the like; yea by a company of men, and women excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated for these, &amp; the like tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sgressions.

In the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:1037:172"/>
former he endeavoured with good conscience to lay down the grounds of Christian religion: but now considering that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian grounds there layd will not beare the Antichristian confused building, which he is to defend in his latter book, he chuseth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to rase his former Christian foundations, and to lay new, &amp; those contrary, then to leave one stone of Babell vndawbed with his vntempered morter. Now for the point it self let the reader obserue these few particulars.</p>
               <p>First, that <hi>rightly, and truely in preaching, and administration,</hi> are by Mr B. very ignorantly restrayned to <hi>the holy graces of the Church:</hi> for which, right, and lawfull persons by, and to whom these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations are to be made, are required. And are persons gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Mr Bernard?</p>
               <p>2. It is not true you affirm, that all <hi>divines hould</hi> the true word, and true sacraments (though not truely nor rightly administred) the infallible tokens of the Church. I do not remember that ever I read this phrase <hi>the true word</hi> before, in any wryters. Such as write of these things are generally against you, as you are against<note place="margin">Art. 19.</note> the truth. Your own articles of religion condemn you, which make it a property of the Church to haue <hi>the sacraments duely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred.</hi> And since the word, and sacraments are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ordinances instituted by the Lord for certayn ends, and purposes, and determined to circumstances of persons, as by, &amp; to whom they must be administred, it is necessary wee measure, and defyne them by the manner of ministration: otherwise wee make them but as the charmes of wizards, or at the best, as the prayers of Papists, which they account true, if so many words be sayd over by whomsoever, or howsoever. The word of God may be, and oft times is, in a great measure preached, or published vpon a stage; and what if the sacraments should be added to it, were here a true Church marked out? And as the word, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments may be sacrilegiously vsurped by them which are no Church of Christ, nor haue any right at all vnto them, so may the true Church of Christ be for a time without them, though never without spirituall right vnto them; as in the tyme of some great plague, when the Church dare not assemble, or of persequ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But what do I striving with this man, which needs none other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary but himself? As he crosses his first book with his second: so doth he both crosse, and confute his second by his third. In his first, he will haue <hi>the word truely taught, and the sacraments rightly administred</hi> to be the marks of the true Church: in his 2. <hi>the true word preached</hi> though <hi>not truly,</hi> &amp; <hi>the true sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts administred</hi> though <hi>not rightly, are in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the mean while I do desire the reader to observe with me these two things in his writings about this point.</p>
               <p>The former is, that, in labouring thus earnestly to perswade (as here he doth) that the power of excommunication is not of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple necessity, he in effect graunts that, which all men know to be true, namely, that the Churches in England do want this power<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Now if here he answer, as he doth in his "2. book, that, though<note place="margin">pag. 261.</note> the <hi>power of excommunication <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>First that he might thus answer, though one Bishop alone had engrossed into his hands all this power; yea a Papist might answer thus for the Popes sole authority over all the Churches in the world, yea though he should communicate the same with no other person, or persons.</p>
               <p>2. Let this mans shifting be well noted. When both in this, and the other book he pleads for the Ministery in the Church, he passes by the Nationall, Provinciall, and Diocesan Ministery, and speaks onely of the Ministery in some parishes, where some honest zealous preachers are, but now comming to plead for the power of Christ in the Church, he takes the contrary course, and passing by the parishes, takes his flight to the Nationall, Provinciall, and Diocesan Ministery there to find comfort.</p>
               <p>3. the quaestion here as he himself puts it, pag. 125. of this book is about <hi>particular congregations, which,</hi> he sayth, <hi>there are with them, having true matter, true form, and true properties.</hi> whereof excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is one.

               <p>The 2. thing I desire may be noted, is, that Mr B: doth if not<note place="margin">pag. 126.</note> deceiptfully, yet vnfitly comprehend the power of the censures vnder the care for the welfare of the Church: since this power may be full and intire, where the care is eyther very little, or not at all: as it came to passe in the Church of Corinth, which had this power<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.</note> alwayes amongst them, but neglected the vse of it, and therein the care for the welfare of the Church which they should have had, &amp; for which neglect they were reproved by the Apostle.</p>
               <p>Now for the similitude, I do except against it in a double res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect: first for that God doth oft times deprive a man of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power of seing, going, and speaking, by naturall infirmities within, or bodily violence from without: but Christ never deprives his Church of this spirituall power of excommunication, neyther can it be impeached by any outward violence: onely Antichrist <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting himself against all that is called God,</hi> and intruding himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the throne of Christ, doth deprive the Church of God, and of Christ, of this liberty, and power; and so all those Churches, or congregations over whom he thus vsurpeth, receive his mark, &amp; are in that respect subject to his judgement. 2. Mr B: as I have formerly observed, doth most vnaptly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>pare the power of casting out offenders to the faculty of seing, speaking, and the like: it is more fitly resembled to the want of power to void, and purge ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, which is prodigious in nature; &amp; so neyther the naturall, nor spirituall body so constituted can possibly consist, or live. And for the parts of the body, to which he here hath reference, and the like; they do more fitly resemble the officers of the Church, then the ordinance of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munication: the eyes, and mouth the Bishops, and Elders, which are to <hi>oversee, and teach</hi> the Church: the hands, the Deacons, who are to distribute her almes. And a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> there may be a true (though an vnperfit) naturall body without
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:1037:176"/>
these parts, so may there be a true visible Church, or body of Christ, without these officers, though vnperfect, and defective.</p>
               <p>It now remayns I lay down some reasons to prove the power of the censures, &amp; of excommunication, simply necessary vnto the Church of Christ. The Reasons are,</p>
               <p>First, bycause it is simply necessary for the being of a Church,<note place="margin">I.</note> that there be power for true members to joyn together, and so to receive others vnto them: even so consequently must there be power to disioyn, and cut of false members.</p>
               <p>2. Excommunication, and absolution are of the same nature<note place="margin">II.</note> with preaching the gospel: yea the very same, particularly applyed to persons obstinate, and repentant, which preaching is in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. The <note n="â€ " place="margin">Rom. 1. 16.</note>

Now excommunication, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution applyed to a particular person, and occasion, do make the second, or minor proposition thus: <hi>thou beleevest not, or repentest not of this thy sinne, and therefore thou art bound in heaven, and thy sinnes vnpardoned:</hi> and so of absolution, or the loosing of sinns.

There is one and the same reason of both: though Mr B: have more reason for to plead the one then the other, considering his own standing.

               <p>But the mayn point in this place, &amp; about this matter in hand, to be considered of, is, whether ability to preach be a qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so preaching a work, necessarily required in the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Engl: <hi>according to the true meaning of the lawes</hi> ecclesiasticall, &amp; ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, <hi>and the book of ordination.</hi> This Mr B. takes for graunted affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and vpon it as a mayn ground builds his whole treatise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this matter: but I on the contrary do affirm, that this is (&amp; so is known to be to all that mind it, with wisdom, &amp; good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science) cleane otherwise: and that neyther this ability, nor practise of preaching is of necessity required to the true, and naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the English ministery, in the meaning of the lawes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished in that case.</p>
               <p>And for the confirmation of that I affirm against this mans pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous asseveration, these proofs suffice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:1037:178"/>First, the books of Homilies published, and confirmed by law,<note place="margin">I.</note> to be read of such ministers as cannot preach, do evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that ability to preach, is not necessarily required of all, in the true meaning of the law.</p>

It may as wel be
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:1037:178"/>
sayd, it is the meaning of the book, that that every Preist should be ordeyned in the particular congregation, where he is to minister, bycause of the latter words <hi>in this congregation, where thou shalt be so appoynted:</hi> and that he is to <hi>minister the discipline of Christ,</hi> as well as <hi>the doctrine and sacraments,</hi> bycause such words passe betwixt him, and the Bishop in another place of the same book. It is not the least delusion of Sathan, or mistery, that such formes of good wordes are reteyned both in the Romish, &amp; English Church, without any truth eyther of purpose or practise in those which vse them: for by them the eyes of the simple are easily bleared by such deceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble merchants, as right now I spake of: though it be not without a speciall providence of God, that these, &amp; the like forms of words should be vsed, for the more full conviction, and condemnation of them that chuse to be deceived, as I have formerly noted in this book.<note place="margin">pag. 244.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude this poynt. The reading of the service book, in form, and maner, the celebrating of mariage, churching of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, burying of the dead, conformity, and subscription, are more essentiall to your ministery, and more necessarily requyred by the lawes of your Church both civil and ecclesiasticall, then preaching of the gospel is. The wearing of the surplice, and signing with the crosse in baptism are of absolute necessity, without partial dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, yea I may ad violation of oath by the Bishops: whereas preaching of the word is no such necessary, or essentiall duety, but a work casuall, accessory, and supererrogatory, which may be done or vndone, as the minister is able, or willing, without any such ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute necessity, as is here pretended. Herevpon then it followeth, that since the preaching of the gospel is no necessary part, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the office of ministery, in the Church of England, that that ministery cannot be of Christ: as also that the conscionable and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual preaching of some men is no iustification at all of the office, which may, and doth consist essentially without it, and to which it is but casual, &amp; accidentall; but a commendation of the persons, which, besydes the natural, and necessary parts of their office, do so practise and preach. And this consideration alone might suffice for answer vnto all Mr B. proofs for the legitimating of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:1037:179"/>
in the Church of England: yet will I for the further disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of them (considering the confidence wherwith he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds them) descend to the particulars.</p>
               <p>In his former book he layes down, and proves by the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures these three sound, and mayn grounds touching the ministery.<note place="margin">pag. 131.</note> 1. that <hi>the Lord onely ordeyns offices in his Church.</hi> 2. that <hi>he distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them one from another, that one may not intrude into an others office.</hi> 3. that <hi>he onely prescribes the dutyes to be done in every distinct office,</hi> and so in the fourth place he comes to the qualification and gifting of men for their functions, and so proceeds to other particulars. But observe his dealings: when he comes to apply, and compare the ministery of England to, and with these golden rules, and by them generally and truely propounded, to iustify it in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, he passeth them all by in silence, as if he had vtterly forgotten them, and speaks not one word, eyther of the <hi>offices</hi> themselves, or of the <hi>distinction of them one from another,</hi> or <hi>the duties to be done in</hi>

                  <hi>them;</hi> but comes in the very first place to the guifts, and graces of the persons. And in so doing (like the vnrighteous steward) he doth wisely, though nothing lesse then faythfully. He knowes wel, that he cannot fynd in the scriptures the least colour for the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Archbishops, Bishops, Suffragans, Deanes, Arch-deacons, halfe Preists, or Engl: Deacons: nor that the dutyes of celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting marriage, purifying women, burying the dead, reading the service book in manner, and form, are layd vpon the ministers of the gospel, as dutyes to be done in their offices: nor that the Provinciall, and Diocesan officers may intrude into their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which are set over particular congregations, and deprive them of the power of government; nor the Deacons to administer the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts: nor that any of them may intrude into the office of the civil Magistrate (as they all do lesse or more) in medling with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of mariage, divorce, testaments, or with iniuryes, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the body, or outward man, according to your, and other m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Here Mr B. (had he done faithfully) should have cleared our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, by which in sundry treatises published for that purpose, we have proved them in respect of their offices, entrances, &amp; admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s, the Ministers of a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tichrist: but thinking it easyer to strike, then to fence, he passeth by what we have written against them, &amp; layes down certeyn colourable reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s for them: which I have sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily set down in order: and vnto which I return this answer.</p>
               <p>First and generally, that there is one common errour in all his Arguments: namely, that there is no Antichrist, but that great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist the Pope: as though there were no more Divils but <hi>Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub,</hi> because he is <hi>the cheif of the Divils.</hi> I would know of this man, what he thinks of the clergy in King Hen. 8 dayes, that took the oath of supremacy, and taught against the Pope, opposing him, &amp; being opposed by him: or what he thinks of the Lutheran Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, that disclaym the Antichrist of Rome as haereticall, and are disclaymed by him, &amp; yet do abhor from the reformed Churches, and from al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion with them, for the mayn truthes they hold, touching the sacrament, and predestination. The thing then is, that there are degrees of Antichristianism, &amp; orders of Antichrists, that is of such as are adversaries vnto Christ. In Pauls time that <note n="â€œ" place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 3. 4.</note>

                  <hi>many Antichrists were come into the world:</hi> and yet there was then neyther Pope, nor masse preist; no nor Diocesan or Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Prelate neyther. There was in deed <note n="*" place="margin">3 Ioh. 9. 10.</note>

And as there were lesser Antichrists before him, by which he entred: so are there also after him; and those left behind him in the Church of Engl: out of which he is driven. And those are the Lord Arch bishops, and Lordbishops, with their orders, and administrations: vnto whom whilst the inferiour ministers do swear canonicall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, they do <hi>by oath promise obedience vnto Antichrist,</hi> and receive his <hi>mark:</hi> and so ministring, are the marked servants of Antichrist, whom they obey: whom they are also by doctrine to defend, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept their othes, and words disagreed. From whom if any of them do withdraw this their bounden, and sworn obedience, by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing subscription vnto his orders, or conformity vnto his ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, them he silences, suspends, and deprives as schismaticall (if not hereticall), and vtterly vnworthy of their, and their Churches service. And these things the reader may apply to Mr B. 3. first se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Reasons.</p>
               <p>Now to your fourth, and last Argument, viz: that you are <hi>no masse-preists,</hi> my answer is, first that you haue the same office with masse preists though reformed of that massing, and some other impietyes: and this both the practise of your Church, and your doctrine (pleading for succession, and ordination from Rome, &amp; Romish Bishops, do necessarily confirm. All the massepreists or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned in Queen Maries dayes for that end, were vpon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the orders then, continued Ministers in their severall congregations, in Queen Elizabeths dayes, by vertue of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ordination. And so are such masse-preists at this day (though ordeyned at Rome) received and continued amongst you, vpon the aforenamed conditions. Now it is your own constant affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion every where, that ordination makes the minister. Wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it followes, that no new ordination, no new minister, but the old massepreist reformed of such impieties, wherein Rome exceeds England. 2. it is your doctrine in your first book, that <hi>the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry makes the Church, &amp; gives denomination vnto it:</hi> &amp; in your 2. book, that the Church of Rome is a true Church: wherevpon it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth necessarily, that the ministery in the Church of Rome is a
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:1037:180"/>
true Ministery: except a false ministery can make a false Church. And if any order of ministery be, it is that of the parish preists, for they are the likest the Pastours in their severall charges. Whence I do also conclude, that since the Romish preists office is a true of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice though vnder corruptions, as it was <hi>true Iob overshadowed with byles,</hi> eyther the English preists must haue the same office with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, (though with the byles cured) or els they are not the true ministers of Christ. And for the <hi>name preist, at which</hi> (you say) <hi>we catch,</hi> you do idly draw it from the Greeks, since it is most evident, that with the office, the name was tanslated vnto you from the Latine, and Romish Church: their <hi>sacerdos</hi> being your <hi>Priest</hi> in your books of ordination, and common prayer, which you haue from them: otherwise why do you not turn the Greek words <hi>praesbyter, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istamenos,</hi> preists in your English Bibles, which are translated from the originalls.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p>The sum of the 2. Arg. is that <hi>the Ministers of the Church of Engl:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">II.</note> are <hi>Pastours, and Teachers,</hi> that is <hi>good sheepheards, such as do keep,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>If in stead of Pastours, and Teachers, you had put Parsons, &amp; <note place="margin">Answ.</note> Vicars, your writtes of presentation, and institution would haue proved it. But that you are Pastours, and Teachers, such as Paul speaks of Ephe. 4. by holy writ you can never manifest. 2. though the things were true you speak both for your power, and practise, yet except you administred those things by a lawfull calling, in a lawfull office, and to a lawfull assembly, you were not true Pastors, and Teachers. But it is not true you say of your selves that you <hi>play the good sheepheards in feeding,</hi> that is in providing pasture for the sheep, and in governing, &amp; ordering them to, &amp; fro, &amp; at it. Your Prelates govern or rather reign, but teach not: your parish Preists some of them that can, &amp; list, teach so much as they dare for feare of their imperious Lords, but govern not.</p>
            </div>

                  <note place="margin">Mr B.</note> 
                  <hi>of God</hi> you make his <hi>preparing of them with gifts, &amp; graces to be able to exequute in some measure the office, wherevnto he doth appoint them.</hi> But herein you are greatly mistaken: the Lords inabling men<note place="margin">Answ.</note> with gifts is one thing, and his calling them to vse them in such,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:1037:181"/>
and such an order, is another thing: and though the Lord calls none, but he inables them, yet he inables many, he never calls. Many counsellers, judges, lawyers, and others in the land, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry able to discharge the office of ministery, but are not called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto of God; if they be, it is their sin not to obey the heavenly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and to become ministers. And as a man may be qualified with gifts for the ministery, and yet not called of God to vse them, (so being qualified accordingly) he may be a true Minister of the Church, though he be never called of God at all, as we now speak: So was <hi>Iudas,</hi> who was never inwardly called of God, that is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by the work of Gods spirit in his heart, in the zeal of Gods glory and love of the salvation of men, to take vpon him the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of an Apostle. And what true calling of God the Ministers in the Church of England haue to take vpon them their offices, &amp; charges, as they do, appeares in their easy forsaking them vpon a litle persecution, yea before it come near them. Of which more hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now for the calling of the Ministers by the Church, albeit we put of the more full handling of it to the 4. Arg. yet something must be sayd for the present.</p>
               <p>And first, though it were true you say, that the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland were the true Church of Christ, yet were not your Ministers called, and sent by the Church, except a Lordly Prelate be the Ch: of England, for by such a one is every Minister amongst you, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and made. 2. I deny here, (as alwayes) your nationall Ch: to be the true visible Church of Christ: and <hi>that</hi> which in this case, you say, is <hi>largely</hi> proved, I hope is sufficiently refuted.</p>
               <p>But here a demand you make in your answer to Mr Sm: must be satisfied, namely, <hi>why true ministers may not arise as well out of a false</hi>
                  <note place="margin">pag. 313.</note> 
                  <hi>Church, as a false ministery out of a true Ch:?</hi> The latter I agree vnto: for the Church may erre, and through errour or otherwise, chuse a man uncapable of the Ministery by the word of God. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> followes, that the Minister makes not the Church (as you er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneously affirm) for then the Church should in the very instant become a false Church when she sets vp a false Minister. But your inference I deny. For first evil may arise from good, though by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:1037:181"/>
without any externall cause comming between: as sin did from the angels in heaven, and our first parents in paradise: but so cannot good from evil. 2. the officers are 1. of, 2 by, 3. in, and 4 for the Church. 1. of it, as members of the body, and so must be members of a true Church, before they can be true officers. 2. by it, in respect of their calling, as Gal. 1. 1. and therefore except they can eyther be true officers by a false calling, or that a false Church can give a true calling, they cannot be true in it. 3. in it, as the accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts, or adjuncts in the subject, without which being true, they can have no more true existence, then reason can have, without a reasonable soul, or subject. 4. for it, and therefore since the Lord hath appointed no ministery for a false Church, there can by the word of God be no true ministery in it: and this I wish them to consider, which still adhere to the Church of England (though they wholy dislike the constitution) for the ministery in it.</p>
               <p>Now where you adde, that <hi>Luther and other worthy Ministers of Christ were raysed vp out of the Romish Church,</hi> you wrong him &amp; them, and the truth in them, whilst you would gratifie Rome, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. Luthers Ministery from Rome was his Fryardome: and is a Fryar a true minister of Christ by his office, or of Artichrist whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Besides, look what ministery the Church of Rome gave him, it took from him: and lastly if he had been a true officer or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of the Church of Rome, it had been sinne in him to have left his charge. Touching the baptism received in the Romish Church I have formerly spoken; and of our reteyning it, but not our Ministery, I shall speak hereafter.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p>That, which is worthy consideration in the fourth Argument<note place="margin">IIII.</note> is, <hi>the enterance into the ministery: in the substance of which</hi> he tells vs,<note place="margin">Mr B.</note> 
                  <hi>there is nothing wanting by their lawes.</hi> For touching <hi>the ability, and desyre to teach, and other graces he speaks of,</hi> they no more make a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, then <note n="â€ " place="margin">Exod. 18. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>courage, the feare of God, true dealing, and the hatred of of covetousnes</hi> make every man a Magistrate, that is so indowed. Now this <hi>entrance</hi> he layes down in 4. particulars: 1. <hi>presentation.</hi> 2. <hi>election,</hi> 3. <hi>probation,</hi> &amp; 4. <hi>ordination with imposition of hands.</hi> But these in such confusion, and with so many contradictions, as do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently shew what monsters an ill cause, &amp; a vayn spirit meeting
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:1037:182"/>
together, will gender, and bring forth. First, in his former book pag. 136. he places the whole calling, (or as he speakes) <hi>the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a Minister in ordination:</hi> and comprehends vnder it as the 3. parts of it. 1. <hi>examination:</hi> 2. <hi>election:</hi> 3. <hi>admission, with imposition of hands.</hi> In his second book he makes <hi>ordination</hi> but the fourth, and last part of his calling, pag. 295. as in deed it is, and the same with <hi>admission:</hi> The reason why he would thus advance ordination is, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that in Engl: is all in all, being done by a Bishop, yea though it be by the Bishop of Rome. And so they call their book they make ministers by, <hi>the book of ordination</hi> not the book of election, or choise, or calling of Ministers. The Bishops Lordship swallowes vp the peoples liberty: and if he but <hi>lay</hi> his <hi>hands</hi> vpon a man, &amp; bid him <hi>Receive the H. Ghost,</hi> he is a minister of the Church suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ordered.</p>
               <p>2. Where in his former book he puts <hi>examination,</hi> or <hi>probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> before election: in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>. he would haue election first, and the <hi>probation,</hi> or <hi>tryal of the partyes gifts, and graces</hi> to come afterwards: mis-interpreting that, which is written 1 Tim. 3. 10. of <hi>probation</hi> to be made before election. And the Reason of this I conceive to be, bycause the Ministers in England are not onely elected but ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, before any such tryall be taken of them. But I come to the particulars: and first to that which he calls <hi>presentation:</hi> for which he quotes Act. 1. 23 and 6. 6. In which scriptures, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the latter of them, he is much mistaken: the presentation there spoken of not being before, but after <hi>election.</hi> The cause, I suppose, of this his confused wryting, is the confused practise in his Church, wher the Patrone presenteth his clerk both after his chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and ordeyning. But for the thing it self, (vnderstanding by presentation the nomination of the person to be chosen, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered of for choyce) as the officers are in, all other things to goe before the people, so in this ordinarily: provided alwayes the brethrens liberty be not infringed, but that they may present, or nominate others, if any amongst themselves seeme more fit.</p>
               <p>Now for the <hi>examination, and tryall of the partyes gifts, and graces,</hi> as we all know what it is in the Church of England where if a man have the gift of subscription, conformity, &amp; canonical obedience,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:1037:182"/>
though other gift, or grace he have none, he is a tryed minister, and so reputed: which if he want, be his other gifts, and graces never so eminent, he is neyther to enter into, nor being entred, to continue in his Ministery: so do the things, which you write in your <note n="â€ " place="margin">pag. 137. 138.</note> former book, touching this tryall, &amp; examination of men, before they be chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> into the Ministery, notably condemn both the ministery of your Church, which you labour to iustify, and on the contrary iustify sundry practises amongst vs, which els where you condemn for notable errours. The particulars are these. 1. First, that <hi>the gifts of him that is to be chosen, must be examined according to those things, which the place wherein he must be, requireth, and God hath commaunded.</hi> 2. that <hi>the place or office of the Ministery consisteth principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the preaching of the word, administration of the sacraments, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> 3. that <hi>the first,</hi> namely the preaching of the word, <hi>is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the first place, as being first imposed, Math.</hi> 10. 28. 29. <hi>and most necessary both to beget, and preserve a people.

                        <desc>â€¢â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> party to be elected must be examined.</hi> Whereupon these things follow. First, that, by your own graunt, men out of office may <hi>preach, administer the sacraments, and prayer:</hi> and so <hi>exercise their gifts, and graces of knowledge, zeal, &amp; vtterance.</hi> But as there is some difference, in the respect in hand, between the sacraments on the one side, and the word, and prayer on the other: bycause there is no speciall gift required for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of them, as there is for the latter: so is the exercise of prophesying, and prayer out of office (so much impugned by you) vndenyably iustified by this your own position. And as it is a very presumptuous evill to call any man into the office of a teaching Elder, whose gift in teaching hath not been sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tryed out of office, so is it no lesse presumption in a Church to set a man over herself for government, of whose both ability, &amp; faithfulnes in the reproving, &amp; censuring of sinns, and in other publick affaires of the Church, she hath not taken good tryall.</p>
               <p>2. If this be true, that <hi>the office of the Ministery consist principally in the preaching of the word, and administration of the sacraments, &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> how is that true, for which you have so much contended in the former part of your book<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that the <hi>authority to censure offenders, is in the cheif officers, and governers of the Church,</hi> as their speciall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative?<note place="margin">pag. 94.</note>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:1037:183"/>
Can a lesse principall work be the peculiar priveledge of a more principall office? It is against the light of nature, and common reason.</p>
               <p>More particularly: this observation by you truely made, with that also which followeth, namely, that <hi>the preaching of the word is to be praeferred in the first place,</hi> overthrowes the order both of the Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Preisthood of your Church.

                  <hi>Elders, which labour in the word, and doctrine,</hi> should have <hi>speciall honour,</hi> and aboue them, which are imployed in <hi>ruling:</hi> but this order Antichrist hath subverted, as being a course not onely too base, and laborious, but even impossible, for him to honour his Ministers by, as he desired, and hath effected; &amp; hath procured not double, &amp; treble, but an hundred fold greater honour to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to ruling, and government, then to preaching. And this is not the least part of that confusion wherein you stand, and against which wee testify. 2. If the office of Ministery consist principally in preaching, how can your office of Ministery or order of Preisthood, be of Christ, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sists not at all in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, as I haue shewed, but may stand without it, by the Canons &amp; Lawes of your Church: not requiring it necessarily as any essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall property for the being, but onely admitting of it, as a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ornament for the well-being: commending in deed the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that vseth it, but no wayes justifying the office, which requireth it not. Yea most evident it is, that the Ministery of the Church of England, considering it not onely in the state, &amp; cariage of things, but specially in the civil, and ecclesiasticall lawes wherein it is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, consists more principally in the wearing of a surplice, then in

To conclude this point, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of such with you, as are to be ordeyned, by the Bishop, and his Chaplayn, is no triall of their gifts of knowledge, zeal, or vtterance, or that they are <note n="â€ " place="margin">1 Tim. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For, first <hi>Barnabas &amp; Saul</hi> were <hi>Apostles,</hi> as well as <hi>Mathias:</hi> and therefore not to be called to their office <hi>by man</hi> but by <hi>God,</hi> Gal: 1. 1. and so were of <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 13 1 2. &amp; 1. 24. 26.</note> the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> as immediately <hi>separated</hi> by name, as was <hi>Mathias by lot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Mathias</hi> was at that time first called to the office of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stleship,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:1037:184"/>
which before he had not: but Paul, and Barnabas were <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 9. 1 Cor. 9. 1. 2. 6.</note> Apostles long before, and at that tyme designed onely to a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all work, but not called to any office.</p>
               <p>3. It appeareth that Paul, and Barnabas were not separated, &amp; sent by the governours onely, but by the Church with them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>they ministred,</hi> and which joyned with them in <hi>prayer, and fasting,</hi> and so consequently in dismissing, or <hi>letting them go,</hi> ver. 2. 3. though most like the ceremony of imposition of hands was performed onely by the <hi>Teachers, and Prophets,</hi> but with the foregoing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Church, according to the expresse direction of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost. And that, not the governours severally, but the Church with them, separated and sent them, vnder the Lords expresse no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, appears evidently, Act. 14. 27. where vpon their return<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> they made relation, not to the officers, but to the <hi>Church gathered together</hi> for that purpose, what things the Lord had wrought by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, that so not onely the grace of God towards the Gentiles might be taken knowledge of, and magnified, but also that their service, &amp; ministration might be approved to the Church, which sent them.</p>
               <p>And thus all may see how injurious this man is to the right, and liberty of the brethren, as formerly in the censures, so here in the choise of officers: making the <hi>governours</hi> alone <hi>the Church</hi> both in the one, and the other. And being both of them Church matters, and parts of the publique administration of Christs kingdom, the same scriptures which demonstrate the peoples interest in the one, do conclude the same in the other.</p>
               <p>In the beginning, the Lord Iesus, and his Apostles by his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, appointed none other true visible Churches but particular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

To them alone must the complaints of sinns be brought, and they alone must be heard in the reforming of them: and thus must the bottomles gulf of the governours authority svvallovv vp the brethrens liberty in the reproving, and censuring of offenders. They alone are to separate, and chuse the ministers: and of this branch of the povver of Christ amongst the rest, must the body of the Church be stript. And as there is no end of errours, vvhere they once begin, especially of those, vvhich tend to the advancement of <hi>the man of sin</hi> in his Ministers <hi>above all that is called God,</hi> so hath this iniquity prevayled yet further, even to the bereaving of the people of the cup in the Lords supper, and of the very scriptures in their mothers tongue: the Preists alone communicating in both parts of the supper; and inclosing the scriptures themselves vvith in the Romish, or Latine language, vvhich they alone, to speak of<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> vnderstood. Yea, to conclude, so effectuall hath the delusion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan been this vvay, that it hath been vniversally taught, and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that an implicite faith vvas sufficient in the lay people, &amp; that no more vvas required of them then to beleeve, as the Church (that is, the (<hi>guides, and governours of the Church</hi>) beleeved, though they were vtterly ignorant what their fayth was. And what lesse in effect doth M.

Yea doth not this conclusion follow vpon the former ground, that the officers are the Church. Mat. 18. for the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving &amp; censuring of offenders, and for the binding, &amp; loosing of sinns? If the Officers be the Church for one religious, or spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all determination, why not for an other? And if the censures agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon and ministred by the Officers, be by way of representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

the censures of the Church, without the actuall consent of the people; why is not the faith agreed vpon, and published by the officers the fayth of the Church, by way of representation, before the peoples distinct knowledge of it, or actuall consent vnto it? Put the case the officers change their auncient fayth in some mayn point, wherein the body of the Church still abideth, and so diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from them; and that they take occasion to excommunicate some brother, or brethr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then should scarce two severall Churches in the world injoy the same Christian liberty, the one with the other; no nor any one with it self, any long tyme, since one Church differeth from another, yea from it self at divers times, in the measure, &amp; degree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and other graces of God. Besides, if we should wey toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ballances, the Churches of Christ now, and in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles times, the Christian liberty of the people would rather sway the ballance this way, then the other way, and to the people now, then in the Apostles dayes.</p>
               <p>For first there were present with the people in those first times, besides other extraordinary officers extraordinarily indowed, the Apostles themselves, those great <hi>Maister-buylders,</hi> which (if any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the world) might lawfully haue deprived the people of their power in this &amp; the like cases: which notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ding they did not, but on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>trary did faithfully inform, &amp; direct the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> according to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maundement of Christ, in the right, &amp; lawful vse of the same.
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:1037:188"/>
And yet notwithstanding the Bishops of the Romish, and English Church (though not worthy so much as of the name of daubers in the Lords house, in comparison of those other <hi>Maister-buylders</hi>) dare without fear, or shame, engrosse all into their owne hands; and haue their proctours, this man and others, many a one, to plead for them in their vsurpation.</p>
               <p>2. The Churches in the Apostles tyme were newly converted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> Iudaism, and Paganism, and had still cleaving vnto them much ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in many great poynts. And in particular, the disciples, or Church at Ierusalem, after they were both possessed, and had vse of<note place="margin">Act. &amp; 1. 6.</note> this power of chusing officers, were ignorant of no lesse a point then the calling of the Gentiles; of which, or the like mayn ground<note place="margin">Act. 10. 14 15<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And of them which preach how many are there mere men-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, flattering the mighty with vayn, and plausibly words, and strengthening the hands of the wicked; and with prophane, and malicious spirits, reviling, and disgracing all sincerity in all men: adding vnto these evils a wicked conversation, by which they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the destruction of many, but the conversion of none.

It is most evident, that whosoever converteth a man vnto God, that person doth in truth, and in deed minister the word of God, &amp; the spirit by the word: &amp; so may be sayd to be sent of God; but that every one, whom God so honoreth, (though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so ordinarily) should therefore be a true Church officer lawfully called to publique administration (which is the quaestion betwixt Mr B. and me) is most vntrue &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>trary both to many <note n="*" place="margin">Lev. 4. 22 23 27. 28. &amp; 19. 17. mat. 18. 15.

It is the blessing of God vpon the mayn truthes they teach, not vpon their office of Preist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, which converts: which truthes if they taught without their office, eyther before they were called to it, or being deprived of it, would without doubt be as effectuall, as they are, yea, &amp; much more, by the blessing of God; as appears in this, that such amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>gst them, as make least account of their office formally received from the Prelates, are the most profitable instruments amongst the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: where on the contrary, the professed formalists cleaving vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their office, and order canonically, are generally vnprofitable eyther for the conversion, or confirmation of any to, or in holines.</p>
               <p>To conclude then, the turning of men vnto holynes of life, is no iustification of your office of ministery, or calling vnto it, but of such truthes, as are taught amongst you: which all men are bound to hold, and honour, as we also do: though we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claym the order, and power, in and by which they are ministred.</p>

               <p>3. If this mariage were made without the free consent, and choise of the one party, were it not to be disanulled? and this is your case, if you consider it, where the minister is put vpon the people, without their free choise, and election.</p>

               <p>2.

               <p>Whensoever the scriptures do mention <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Act. 14. 23. &amp; 15. 2. 4. 22. &amp; 20 17. 28. 1. Cor. 12. 28.</note>

And to imagine an Elder or Bishop without a Church, is to imagine a Constable without a parrish or hundred; a Maior or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman without a Corporation, or a publique officer without some publique person, or society, whose officer he is. Herevpon also<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 1. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>. 1 5. 1. Pet. 5. 1. 2</note> it followeth, that if the Church be dissolved by death, apostacy or otherwise, the Minister ceaseth to be a Minister, bycause the Church ceaseth; in relation vnto which (vnder Christ) his Ministery consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth: but on the contrary, a baptized person remayns still baptized though the whole Church, yea all the Churches of the world be dissolved, so long as God, &amp; his Christ remayn the same, into whose name he hath been baptized.</p>
               <p>And of the same consideration is it, that a Minister may (for some scandalous sin) be degraded, and deposed from his Ministery, as I have formerly shewed, &amp; as all Churches practise: and so that, which vvas formerly given him, is taken from him, and he no more a Minister, then he was before his caling: yea if he remayn obstinate in his sin, he is to be excommunicated, &amp; so ceasing to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he must needs cease to be a Minister of the Church. But ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do the scriptures mention, neyther did any Church ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the vn-baptizing of a baptized person. And as a man may justly be deposed from his Ministery, so may he in cases lawfully depose himself, and lay it down: as if by the hand of God, he be vtterly disabled from ministring, as it may come to passe, &amp; oft tymes doth: but for a man to lay down his baptism for any such infirmity, were impious, as it were sacrilegious for the Church to deprive him thereof. To these considerations I might also adde, that if a man forfeyt his Ministery, and so be deprived of it, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by deposition, or excommunication, and be afterwards vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his repentance judged capable of it, he must have a new cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or a confirmation at the least, answerable vnto a calling: so must it also be with him, that is translated from an inferiour of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to a superiour; but in baptism there may be no such chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, or repetition. The practise were haereticall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:1037:198"/>Adde vnto these things, that as a man once baptized is alwayes baptized, so is he in all places, and Churches where he comes (as a baptized person) to enjoy the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon benefits of his baptism, &amp; to discharge the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon duties, which depend vpon it. But a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour is not a Pastour in every Church, where he comes vpon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, neither can he require in any other Church, saving that one, over which the H: Ghost hath set him, that obedience, mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and other respect, which is due to the officers from the people; neyther stands he charged with that Ministery, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which is due to the people from the Officers: &amp; if you Mr B. say otherwise, you make every Pastour a Pope, or vniversall Bishop. <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Col. 4. 12.</note>

                  <hi>the Elders of Ephesus,</hi> though they were at <hi>Miletum,</hi> the <hi>Elders of Ephesus</hi> onely, but of none other Church; and charged to <hi>feed the flock over which the holy Ghost had set them,</hi> but none other; for over none other had the holy Ghost set them. And as a Maior out of his Corporation, a Shiriffe out of his County, a Constable out of his Parish, or Hundred, is no Maior, Shiriffe, or Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable, (but in relation to that particular body of which he is) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he perform any proper act of his office without vsurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so neyther is a Bishop, or Elder, a Church Officer, save in his owne particular Church, and charge, and in relation vnto it, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he without ambitious vsurpation perform any proper work of his Office, or MinistÃ¨ry, save in that Church by, and to which, in his ministration, he is designed.</p>
               <p>And thus much to shew the difference betwixt that relative or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the Ministery, and that personall ordinance of Baptism in the Church; as also to prove, that we do lawfully, and with good warrant disclaym, and renounce the Ministery received in Rome, &amp; England, notwithstanding we reteyn the Baptism received both in the one, and the other. To which also, I could adde (if there were need, or vse) both the judgement of the learned at home, &amp; abroad, and the practise of the reformed Churches, where we live, for the continuing of the Baptism in Rome received, but no more of the Masse preists for Ministers, then of the Masse it self, for which they were ordeyned. But it is more then tyme I come to the mayn controversie about succession; which might be layd down summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:1037:199"/>
in these words: <hi>whether the reformed Churches were bound to submit</hi> (notwithstanding their separation from Rome) <hi>vnto such ministers onely, as were ordeyned by the Pope, and his Bishops:</hi> but for the better clearing of things I will enlarge my speach to these three distinct considerations.</p>
               <p>First, whether the Ministery be before the Church, or no.</p>
               <p>2. Whether the delegated power of Christ for the vse of the holy things of God be given primarily, and immediately to the Church, or to the Ministers?</p>
               <p>3. Whether the Lord haue so linked the Ministery in the chayn of succession, that no Minister can be truely called, and ordeyned, or appointed without a praecedent Minister.</p>
               <p>Touching the first of these Mr Ber: affirmeth as in his <note n="â€ " place="margin">pag. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Now for the first entery, I desire the reader to observe with me that the quaestion betwixt Mr Bernard and me is about ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ministers, or officers of the Church, such as were the first Ministers of the reformed Churches, and as Mr B: and I pretend our selves to be: and not about extraordinary Ministers, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily, miraculously, or immediately, raysed vp as were A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, and the Apostles by God, and Christ: whom he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth for examples. Admit the one sort (being called immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and miraculously) may be before the Church: yet cannot the other, which must be called by men, and those eyther the Church, or members of the Church at the least.</p>
               <p>Besides, the word <hi>Minister</hi> extends it self not onely vnto Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ordinary, and extraordinary, but even to any outward means, whether person or thing, by which the revealed will of God is manifested, and made known vnto men for their instruction, and conversion. Yea it reacheth even to God himself: &amp; so far Mr
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:1037:199"/>
B. stretcheth it, where he makes <note n="*" place="margin">First book pag. 144.</note> 
                  <hi>God the first preacher</hi> Gen. 2. 3. As though there were a controversy between him, and me, whither God, or the Church were first. I see not but by the same reason he might avouch, that the Ministers of the Church could not all dy, or be deceived, bycause God is free from these infirmityes. It is true which Mr B. sayth, that <hi>the word is before the Church,</hi> as the seed, <hi>which begetteth</hi> it, and so is that <hi>which brings it,</hi> yea whither it be person, or thing, which may also be called a Minister, and be sayd to be sent of God, as it is an instrument to convey, and means to minister the knowledg of the same word, &amp; will of God vnto any. So if any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man, or woman should be a means to publish, or make known the word of God to a company of Turkes, Iewes, or other Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he or she might truely be sayd to be their Minister, and the Lords <hi>Ambassadour</hi> vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, as you speak. Yea if they came to this knowledg by reading the Bible, or other godly book, that book or bible, as it served to minister the knowledg of Gods wil in his word might truely in a generall sense be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ted as a Minister vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. But what were all this to a Church-officer, about who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> our quaestio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> is? These things Mr B. shuffles together, but the wise reader must distinguish them, &amp; so doing, he shall easily discover his trisling.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <p>The particulars follow. And first he affirmeth, that <hi>God made A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr B.</note> 
                  <hi>a Minister, to whom he gave a wife to begin the Church, and as Adam was before his wife, so is the Ministery at the first before the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Adams wife began the Church, then is your mayn foundation<note place="margin">Answ.</note> overthrown; namely that the ministers make, and denominate the Church, except you will say that Eve was a Minister. Secondly it is not true you say, that <hi>God made Adam a Minister,</hi> before Eve was created. In the same place you make (and truely) <hi>a Minister,</hi> and <hi>Ambassadour which brings the word</hi> all one: &amp; vnto whom could Adam eyther minister the word, or be an Ambassadour to bring it before Eve was formed? There was nothing but bruit beasts, and senceles trees, and to them I suppose he brought it not. The truth is, Adam and Eve were the Ch. not by his, but by her creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, which made a company, or society: &amp; thus we are in the first place to consider of them, and of Adam as a teacher in the second place; the speciall calling here, and ever, following after, and vpon the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>

               <p>Of the same force with your first proof is your 2. which you<note place="margin">Mr B.</note> take from <hi>Ephes. 4. 11. 12.</hi> where <hi>it is sayd,</hi> God <hi>gave some not onely to confirm the Church, but to gather the Saynts to make a Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To let passe your boldnes with the words, I except against your<note place="margin">Answ.</note> exposition, &amp; application of them. The word <hi>gathering</hi> vpon which you insist, is in some bookes turned <hi>repayring,</hi> and is the same in the Greek with that which is <hi>restoring,</hi> Gal. 6. 1. of which I have spoken formerly.</p>
               <p>Againe, Paul in that place speaks not onely of <hi>Apostles,</hi> &amp; other <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>first raysing vp: for the begetting of Churches:</hi> but of <hi>Pastours, and Teachers</hi> which were <hi>taken out of the Church,</hi> and of <hi>the 2. raysing</hi> for the feeding of the flock. You will not deny but the <hi>Apostles and brethren at Ierusalem</hi> were a Church of God, Act. 1. 15. 16. when as yet no Pastours or Teachers were appointed in it: and how then can your doctrine stand, that the Ministers spoken of Ephe. 4. 11. 12. (amongst which were Pastours and Teachers) were before the Church, out of which they were taken, and raysed vp of God to beget a Church? Yea it is evident that the very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Pastour vvas not then heard of in the Church; whereby the falsity of your other affirmation is discovered, to wit, that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of such <hi>Ministers</hi> as are <hi>of the second raysing,</hi> &amp; <hi>which are taken out of the Church,</hi> is before the Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Apostles themselves (howsoever extraordinary of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers immediately called, and sent forth to beget other Churches both of Iewes, and Gentiles) were Christians before they were A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and members of the Church before they were Officers.

Now common sense teacheth men, that, what power, or authority soever the servants, or Ministers of others haue, or vse in their places, that authority and power, they haue first, whose servants and ministers they are: and that therefore the holy things of God are primarily, and immediately the Churches vnder Christ, and in the last place the Officers, as the servants of Christ, and his Church, for execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the order, which Christ hath left.</p>

               <p>The thing I purpose in the next place is, to prosequute cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn Arguments of Mr Smythes, and the rather bycause himself hath in a measure forsaken this truth with others (adding also some others vnto them) to prove, that the ministery (and so other<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the holy things of God,) is not tyed by Christ to the succession of office, or order, but of faith. The Arguments I vvill take vp as Mr Bernard together with their answers layes them downe in his 2. book.<note place="margin">Pag: 186. 187. 188 &amp;c.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Of the first Argument, I have spoken in another place. The 2. is, that if Christs ministeriall power be by succession, to the Pope, Bishops, or Praesbytery, then the Ministery of Rome is a true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Mr Bern: answer is, that he <hi>meanes true succession, which is both personall, and hath with it a true office, true doctrine, true sacraments, and prayer, about which Christs true ministers are exercised:</hi> but for <hi>the Romish Ministery</hi> it <hi>is idolatry, and superstition, and the men appointed there to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned sacrifising Preists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This answer of yours Mr B. puts me in mind of a practise of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who when they have a long while busyed themselves in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the best formes, and figures they can in dust, and ashes, do at the last with one dash of their hand deface all, &amp; vndo, what they haue formerly done. And that this childish dealing you use, no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that considers the quaestion in hand, can be ignorant of.</p>
               <p>The quaestion then between him, &amp; me, is not of such a <hi>succession personall,</hi> as hath joyned with it <hi>successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> in a true office, true doctrine, true sacraments, &amp; prayer,</hi> wherin the minister is in any measure faithfully
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:1037:203"/>
exercised: but generally, whether succession of persons be of such absolute necessity, as that no minister can in any case be made but by a minister, &amp; more specially, whither the first ministers of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Ch:, or of such, as come out of the confusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of Antichrist, must of necessity be ordeyned by the Pope, &amp; his Bishops, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister by vertue of their ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> so received. And that this succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion by, &amp; from the Romish ministery, is that Mr Ber: pleads for, his writings manifest: as first, that, as in <hi>all the Apostles time the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi>

Answerable vnto which, is his other saying (in which, his termes, and meaning do well suit) <hi>that Church-men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ordeyned Ministers, &amp; not the lay people.</hi> To this also let his infere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce be added in another place pag. 311. that, <hi>if we receive, and hold our baptism from Rome, why not our ordination also?</hi> And in his former book<note place="margin">Pag: 144.</note> most clearly condemning our <hi>Ministers</hi> for <hi>being made by such, as are no Ministers: contrary to the constant practise of the Church of God from the dayes of Adam hitherto.</hi> And agayn, that <hi>this custome of ordeyning Ministers did continue in the times following the Apostles tymes</hi> (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it had done) <hi>in all the Churches of Christendom, as ecclesiasticall wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do make mention: and so through pure, &amp; impure Churches<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and that, God in the last reformation of his Church, would not break this order; but choose men, who were Bishops ordeyned even in the Popish Church, so that they might ordeyn fit persons afterwards.</hi> And this he tels the Reader he <hi>speaks of the Church of England,</hi> as in deed he may wel; for other Ch: departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> Rome, would be loath to joyn in his plea.

                  <hi>from Adam to this day,</hi> is, that God hath continued the course of succession in the <hi>Romish Ministery,</hi> and that from, and by it suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively, the Ministery in England hath been, and is at this day, continued. And yet in his answer to Mr Smyth, he is driven to affirm, that he hath no refere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce at all to <hi>the Romish Ministery,</hi> which he accounts <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and superstition: but <hi>meanes such a personal succession, as hath ioyned with it a true office, true</hi> doctrine, and the like.

               <p>But here it wilbe demaunded of me, how <hi>the Lords people comming out of Babylon,</hi> separating from Rome, are to obteyn, and enjoy Ministers. Surely one of these three wayes. Eyther by the extaor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, immediate, or miraculous designation of God; or by suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession; or by the same peoples choise, or appointment, to which they are to minister. To expect ministers by the first meanes were fancy<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and presumption: so that by one of the two other wayes they must come necessarily. The power of the holy things of God, &amp; so specially of erecting the minstery, is eyther tyed to the order of office, &amp; so to the order of to the Popeship, &amp; Praelacy under it, or els to the faith of the people of God forsaking Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, &amp; joyning together in the covenant of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, &amp; fellowship of the gospel. The former of these though Mr B: be drive<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to plead it in the proof of succession, yet in the defence of it, he is forced to disclaym, &amp; disavow: yeelding <hi>the Romish Ministery to be Idolatry, and superstition,</hi> and that he speaks of such a <hi>succession,</hi> as <hi>requires with it a true office, true doctrine, true sacraments, and prayer.</hi> pag. 188. and agayn that he <hi>meanes by succession a continuance of Gods ordinance by persons elected thereto from tyme to tyme, being of spirituall kindred by the fayth of doctrine,</hi>
                  <pb n="408" facs="tcp:1037:205"/>
                  <hi>by which the ordinance is vpheld, and true succession mainteyned.</hi> pag 190. With which graunt of his I might rest, as indeed wherein he yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the whole cause, and cutts off, as it were, with his own hands, the cord of true succession in the Ch: of Rome; making it to fayl, when the truth of doctrine, and of election fayled in the same Ch:. But bycause it is so common a thing with him, to say, and vnsay<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and to say agayn the same things, eyther forgetting himself, or thinking others forgets, or bycause he would say something to every thing, though never so contrary both to the truth, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in another place, I will presse Mr Smythes other Arguments. The third of which is, that by the doctrine of succession men are bound absolutely to sin, in joyning to the sinns of the Minister. <hi>This is</hi> sayth Mr B: <hi>to take vnproved a principle of Brownism to overthrow a truth, namely, that a man cannot receive the holy things of God, but he must needs sin with others.</hi>

               <p>Of the Iewish Church &amp; Preisthood (which Mr Ber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the 4. Argument Mr Ber: deales dishonestly. Mr Smiths inference vpon the doctrine of succession, is, that then the Lord hath made the Ministers Lords over the Church, so that the Church cannot have or enjoy any of the Lords ordinances, or holy things, except they will consent vnto them; for the holy things are in their
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:1037:205"/>
power. Now Mr Ber. onely trifles about the word <hi>Lord,</hi> and passeth by the substance of the inference which is most sound vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the doctrine. For if the Lords ordinances and holy things be tyed to the Ministers, then without their consent there can be no vse of them. And so where Ministers eyther are not, or not willing to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municate them, there can be no Church, no electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of Ministers, no keyes of the kingdom, and so no salvation: as I have formerly manifested vpon Math. 16. 19.</p>
               <p>The sum of Mr Smithes <hi>5.</hi> Argument is, that then the Pope may excommunicate the whole Church vniversall; the Bishops their whole Dioceses, and Provinces: and the Praesbytery the particular Church whereof it is. Your answer Mr Bernard, is, that this were to <hi>do the Pope a great favour to prove him to have an vniversall power,</hi> &amp;c. and 2. that <hi>by this sequell</hi> of Mr Smythes, <hi>this absurdity would follow, that the Bishop might cast out the Church, out of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is you that do the Pope this great favour, though you would not own it. For if the Ministery make the Church, and that Rome be a true Church, then must the ministery of Rome be true, specially of the Pope, from which the other is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as from the head.</p>
               <p>Agayn, if <hi>the ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> by the Bishops in the impure Church of Rome be the Lords order,</hi> as you expresly affirm p. 145. of your former book, then must the Popes vniversall power, by which the Bishops doe vniversally ordeyn, be the power of the Lord which from him he hath received for that purpose. They which hold, that the power of the keyes was given first &amp; immediately to the Apostle Peter, &amp; so to the Popes of Rome his successours, they hold that the Pope may excommunicate the whole Church: so they which hold the Bishop, or his substitute to be meant, where Christ sayth, <hi>tell the Church,</hi> they must necessarily hold, that the Bishop or his substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute may excommunicate his whole Province, or Dioces; and so of them which hold the Praesbytery to be the Ch: there spoken of, for the particular assembly over which it is. The Church there meant may exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municate any brother, or brethren (whom, or how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny soever) that refuse to hear her: as <hi>the Church of Corinth,</hi> to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

                  <pb n="410" facs="tcp:1037:206"/>The substance of the seventh, &amp; last objection, is, (for the 6. hath no weight in it) that the doctrine of succession overthrowes it self, and the Reason is, bycause one POPE doth not make another by ordination whyles he lives, but the Cardinals do by Election make the new Pope after the death of the former. So that the Pope receiving his ministeriall power from the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, cannot give it to them, and so to the rest of the Clergy in Rome, and England, neyther can it descend from Christ through the Apostles, and so through him to the other inferiour ministers, but as in a chayn if the highest link be broken, the rest which hang vpon it must needs fall: So if there be a breach of this chayn of succession from the Apostles to the ministery of Rome, and of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland (which descends of it lineally) in the higest link, the Pope, all the rest of the chayn that hangs vpon it, except it be otherwise vpheld, must needs fall flat vpon the ground. It is true which Mr Ber: answers that election, and succession by ordination may stand together in the ministery, but in this case it cannot, except the Pope should by the election of the Cardinalls, or others, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyn his succession whilest himselfe survived. Now in this last an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer Mr B: challengeth his adversary to be <hi>wilde in wandering,</hi> and to have <hi>lost his quaestion, in concluding that</hi> the doctrine <hi>of succession is a false doctrine, where he should prove that Christs power is not given to the principall members.</hi> But this challenge is both vnjust, &amp; vnadvised. Vnjust, bycause succession from the popish Church, and Clergy is made by M: Ber: in his former book the foundation of the minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of England, and so of the Church: the Church by his affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation being made by the ministers, and <hi>the Ministers by such Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
                  <note place="margin">pag: 145</note> 
                  <hi>as were ordeyned in the popish Church.</hi> Vnadvised bycause these two poynts, do depend ech vpon other necessarily. For if Christs power be tyed to the officers whether principall, or inferiour, then must it come to the ministery, and Church of England by succession: if it come not by succession from, or by the Pope, and his Clergy, then must it come by the same successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of fayth, &amp; doctrine vnto the children of Abraham, two or three, or more faithfull persons joyned together in the covenant, and fellowship of the gospel. And for the quaestion in Mr Bernards own words (remitting the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to such places as prove, that a company of faythfull people in
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:1037:206"/>
the covenant of the gospell, though without officers are a visible Church, that they haue immediate right to the holy things of God; and that the keyes for bynding, and loosing were given to Peters confession) I will adde onely one Argument, and so proceed.</p>

And for this purpose let it be further observed, that no power at all came vnto the Church of the Iewes by the Levites: not the vse of the sacrament of circumcision; no nor of the very sacrifices: which were offered by the first born in the family, and that even after the peoples comming out of Egypt vnder the hand of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, till Levi was called to the Preisthood.

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>I proceed. If the Ministery of the reformed Churches must be by succession, or ordination by Popish Bishops, then must the same office of Ministery be continued from the one Church to the other: as indeed it was withall the Ministers of the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland at the first; who without any new eyther calling, or ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which depends vpon it) continued their office, and place formerly received; there being onely a reformation of some of the grossest evills, like the healing of <hi>Iobs soars,</hi> as Mr B. speaketh: as the office of Iustice-ship, or the like in the common wealth, may be continued the same in the same persons individually, though by edict of Parliament, or other superiour power, there be a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceasing of some mayn act of it.</p>
               <p>Further to ty the Ministery thus to succession, is to ty the Lords sheep to submit to no other sheepheards but such as the wolves haue appointed. And if a company of Gods people in Rome, or Spayn, should <hi>come out of Babylon,</hi> and no consecrated Preist amongst them, they must, by this doctrine, enjoy no Ministers, but such as the Romish wolves will ordeyn, &amp; do, according to their Popish, &amp; prophane order.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:1037:207"/>To these things I might also adde, that look what power any of the Popes Clergy receive from him, the same he takes from them &amp; deprives them of, where they withdrew their obedience, or separate from that Church: as also that the ordinations in Rome, by their own Canons, are very nulli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>yes, and many the the like exceptions pleaded by learned protestants against the Romish preisthood, and this Romish doctrine of succession: but that which hath been spoken is sufficient in the generall, and I hasten to the third and last meanes of the three, by which Gods people after Antichrists defection are to injoy the ministery, and other of Christs ordinances.</p>
               <p>And for our better proceeding herein, I will first consider, what ordination is: and 2. how far the brethren may goe by the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the necessary consequences drawn from them, in this and the like cases, in the first planting of Churches, or in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of them into order,, in or after some generall confusion.

Where the Apostles were sent out by Christ, there was no mention of ordination; their charge was to <note n="â€ " place="margin">Math. 28. 20</note>

Ghost,</hi> and that the <hi>Euangelists</hi> were so ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and so the <hi>Bishops,</hi> or <hi>Elders</hi> in the Churches by the Apostles, and Euangelists, yet read we of no such solemnity performed by Christ upon his Apostles, when he called them; nor by Peter, or the Apostles at the choise of <hi>Mathias,</hi> Act. 1. but being by the people <hi>praesented</hi> with <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and by the Lord singled out by lot, he <hi>was by a common consent counted with the eleven Apostles.</hi> Wherevpon also some reformed Churches haue thought that this solemn ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation<note place="margin">The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in Scotland.</note> by imposition of hands is of no such necessity, but that it might be vsed, or not vsed indifferently, and so have practised.</p>
               <p>But the judgement, and plea (when they deal with vs) of the most forward men in the Land, in this case, I may not omit; which is, that they renounce, &amp; disclaym their ordination by the Prelates, and hold their Ministery by the peoples acceptation. Now if the acceptation of a mixt company vnder the Praelates government, (as is the best parish assembly in the kingdom) wherof the greatest part haue by the revealed will of God, no right to the covenant, ministery, or other holy things, be sufficient to make a minister,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:1037:208"/>
then much more the acceptation of the people with vs, being all of them joyntly, and every one of them severally, by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, capable of the Lords ordinances.</p>
               <p>These things, thus opened, I come in the next, and last place to manifest, what liberty the scriptures, just consequence, &amp; good reason do allow the people for the reducing themselves into the order, and under the Ministery of Christ, after some generall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, such as the Papacy was, and is.</p>
               <p>And for this purpose I entreat the reader to recognize with me the points lately mentioned, and proved in the former part of the book, namely that <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 125. 126.â€”130. 131.</note> 
                  <hi>a company of faithful people in the covenant of the Gospel are a Church, though without officers:</hi> that <hi>this Church hath inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in all the holy things of God within it self, and immediately vnder Christ the head, without any forreyn assistance:</hi> that in cases, <note n="â€ " place="margin">pag. 142. 143. 144.</note> 
                  <hi>a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or brother, in such a Church, may do a necessary work of an officer:</hi> &amp; lastly, that <note n="â€ " place="margin">pag. 149. 150. 151.</note> 
                  <hi>the keyes of the kingdom were given to, and the Church to be built vpon the rock of Peters confession,</hi> Math. 16. And so I come to the point it self.</p>
               <p>I do then acknowledge, that where there are already lawfull officers in a Church, by, and to which, others are called, there the former, vpon that election, are to ordeyn, and appoint the latter. The officers, being the ministers of the Church, are to exequute the determinations, and iudgements of the Church vnder the Lord: the Censures of deposition, and excommunication by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the sentence of iudgment, and by it, as by the sword of the spirit drawn out, cutting of the officer from his office, and the member from the bodie, and all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion with it: So are they to exequute the peoples election by pronouncing the person elect to his office, charging him with the faythfull execution of it, with imposition of hands, and prayer. And indeed ordination, in the calling of the ministers is properly the exequutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>.</p>
               <p>But as in a civil corporation, or City, though the Maior, Baylif, or other cheif officer elect, be at his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="416" facs="tcp:1037:209"/>
his successour entereth, then is this Ceremony and work per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by some other the fittest instrument: neyther need that City borrow an officer of another City: neyther could he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medle there, without vsurpation, though both the Corporations haue the same Charter, vnder the same King: so is it in this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Corporation, and City of God, the Church: the former officers, if there be any in that particular congregation, are to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyn such as succeed: but if none be to be found, this Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not to goe to the next to borrow an officer, or two, but may vse such fit persons, as shee hath, for that service so absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary: neither may the officers of an other Corporation do the acts of their office in that, except they be eyther Apostles, or Evangelists, and have generall charges: or rather except they will make themselues Popes: as indeed this exorbitant, and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving course makes as many vniversall Bishops, in respect of power, &amp; so likewise of exequution, if there be occasion, as there are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in all the Churches. But to come vnto the scriptures, it hath been formerly noted that <hi>the first born</hi> in the family, before the law, did perform the preists office: in whose place the <hi>Levites</hi> were afterwards substituted. Now as <note n="â€ " place="margin">Exod: 29. 1. 2. 3 &amp;.</note> 
                  <hi>the Preists</hi> of the Levites did not enter vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> their office without solemn <hi>consecration,</hi> nor the ministers of the new testament vpon theirs, without solemn <note n="*" place="margin">Act: 6. 6 &amp; 14. 23.</note>

               <p>And as the Lord would have the people to vse this speciall liberty in the first institution, and consecration of the Levites in that Church, (which notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ding they vsed not in the ordinary consecration of such Levites, as followed, when the Ch: was once furnished with officers) so doth the holy Ghost give testimony of the same, or the like liberty vsed by them afterwards vpon a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> and in that general confusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, which fel vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the whole Church, when <hi>the Preists were slayn, and the Ark of God</hi> was <hi>taken by the Philistims.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is then noted 1 Sam: 7. 1. that, vpon the <note n="â€ " place="margin">1 Sam: 6. 20. 21.</note>

               <p>Lastly, the Apostle <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Gal: 1. 1. 2 8. 9</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> writes <hi>to the Churches of Galatia</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as <hi>accursed, such ministers</hi> whomsoever, as should <hi>preach otherwise, then they had already received:</hi> and the same Apostle wrytes <hi>to the Church at Colossus,</hi> to admonish <note n="*" place="margin">Col: 4. 17.</note>

<pb n="418" facs="tcp:1037:210"/>
the officers sin, if they were or should haue been, corrupt, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent) discharge the people of their duety in the things, which concerned them: but they were bound notwithstanding to see the commandements of the Apostles, and of the Lord Iesus by them, exequuted accordingly. And if the people be in cases, and when their officers fayl, thus solemnly to examine, admonish, silence, and suppresse their teachers, being faulty, and vnsound: then are they also by proportion, where officers faile, to elect, appoynt, set vp, and over themselues, such fit persons, as the Lord affoardeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, for their furtherance of fayth, and salvation.</p>
               <p>In the 2. place I do adde the conclusion vnto the praemises lately proved, that since <hi>the people of God going out of Babylon</hi> must come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Lords order, and officers, and may not receive them by succession from the Pope, and his Clergy, nor are to expect them immediatly from heaven, therefore they themselves are to call and appoynt them for the Lords, and their owne service vnder him.</p>
               <p>3. Vpon the former ground, that the Lords people must come out of Babylon, &amp; build a new the Lords temple in Ierusalem, even themselves, their soules, and bodyes, for <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5</note> 
                  <hi>a spirituall house,</hi> and that the Levites, and Preists of the Lord must minister there, it is necessary we consider by the scriptures what course hath been take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> formerly for the furnishing of this house thus newly built, of the Church newly constituted, with officers, where they have wanted.</p>
               <p>Wee do then read, that when that ancient, and mother Church of the Iewes was to be furnished with Officers, <note n="â€ " place="margin">Numb. 5 9. 10. 11.â€”16. 20.</note>

And what hindereth but that the Church, the multitude, the Disciples (call them as you wil) in the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and covenant of the gospell, may be as clearely informed in their duety, and as effectually exhorted to the vse of their liberty by the writings of the Prophets, and Apostles, as by their speaches.

                  <hi>till the Apostles came;</hi> and that <hi>they did not elect</hi> officers <hi>but vpon their exhortation:</hi> yet must it also be considered that Apostles do now come in their writings, as there they did in corporall presence, and that they exhort as fully in them now, as they did in speach then. Besides there are now no Apostles vpon earth, nor other Church officers having <note n="â€ " place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>the care of all the Churches,</hi> in the world as the Apostles had: nor that are extraordinarily and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously endewed with all giftes especially with the gift of all <hi>tongues,</hi> as the Apostles were; nor that have the like generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mision<note place="margin">Act. 2. 1. 3. 4. &amp;c.

The ordinary officers, which the Apostles, and Evangelists left in the Churches, and for the choyse of whom<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> they left order to the worlds end were such <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or Byshops</hi> as were assigned, and fixed to such particular flockes as they were to feed, vnder that cheif <hi>sheepheard,</hi> and <hi>great Bishop Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</hi> Besides, if the Churches, or people should <hi>wayt</hi> now, as M Ber. would have them till the Bishops of Rome, or England
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:1037:211"/>
came to them, as the Apostles did to the Churches in their time, to exhort them to chuse officers, and to ordeyn them for them, they might languish vnder a wan hope, &amp; <hi>wayt</hi> till their eyes fayled in their heads.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon then I do conclude, that if the Church without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers may elect, it may also ordeyn officers<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> if it have the power and commission of Christ for the one, and that the greater, it hath it also for the other, which is the lesse. If it haue officers, it must vse them as hands to put the persons by ordination into that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to which they haue right by election: but if it want officers, it may, and must vse other the fittest instruments it hath: as in the naturall body, if men want hands, or be deprived of the vse of them, they do for their present necessity vse their teeth, or feet, or other fittest parts of the body, for the busynes possible to be done by them.</p>
               <p>Lastly if the Lord should rayse vp in America, or the like place, a company of faythfull men, and women, (which <hi>of stones</hi> should become <hi>children to Abraham</hi>) by the reading of the scriptures, or by some godly mens writings, or (which is most like) by the holy instructions, and exhortations of some merchants, or travay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, how, or by what meanes should they come by Ministers?

But what to do hath the Pope of Rome, or the Bishops in England, or the Praesbytery in Germany, or France to appoynt them in America Ministers? It is evident that such an assembly, as I speak of, having received the gospel, haue received the keyes of the kingdome, and the power of Christ: and being joyned in this fellowship of the gospell, haue the joynt vse of the keyes, &amp; power of Christ: &amp; being within the covenaunt of Abraham, are the Ch: of God: &amp; so haue power to choose, and appoynt their own Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> within themselves. Now because these things wilbe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taken at other mens ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ds, then at ours, yea it may be with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, through praejudice, their very authority wil sway more then our Arguments though never so rightly grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the scriptures, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon reason, I wil therefore here crave leave to bring in a few men of singular note both at home, &amp; abroad, to shew their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:1037:211"/>
in the case in hand.</p>
               <p>And I will first bring in one, of our own nation, of great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count (and that worthily) with al that fear God, how ever he were against vs in our practise. The man is <hi>Mr Perkins.</hi> He then writing about <hi>ordination,</hi> &amp; <hi>succession,</hi> in his <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mentary vpon the Epistle to Gal:</hi> ch: 1. ver: 11. gives this testimony: that, <hi>if in Turky, or America, or elswhere, the gospel should be received of men, by the counsel, &amp; perswasion of private persons, they should not need to send into Europe for consecrated Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, but had power to choose their own Ministers from within themselves:</hi> &amp; the Reasons of this he renders in the same place, <hi>bycause where God gives the word, he gives the power also.</hi> And I do desire especially his Reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> may be observed: which is, that, <hi>where God gives the word, there he gives the power also.</hi> Wherevpon it followes, that any other asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>bly whether in America, or Europe, separating themselves fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> Idolatry, whether Heathenish, or Antichristian, &amp; receiving the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell of Christ, do with the gospel receive the power also: &amp; so may choose their ministers within themselves: &amp; need not send to any other place, no not to the next parish for consecrated Ministers.</p>
               <p>In the 2. place I wil alledg one of greater note, and more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: and that is <hi>Philip Melancton:</hi> who, in his <hi>Answer to the ministers in Bohemia, which taught the incorrupt doctrine of the gospell,</hi> refutes the <hi>praetext of ordination</hi> to be taken from the Bishops, with that of Paul, <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 1. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>if any teach another gospell, let him be an Athema;</hi> adding also that <hi>onely the assembly where true doctrine soundeth is the Church:</hi> and that <hi>in it is the ministery of the gospell: in it are the keyes of</hi> the <hi>kingdom of heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. Wherefore in that very assembly (in eo ipso coetu) there is the right of calling, and ordeyning the ministers of the gospell, bycause we must fly the enemyes of the gospell, as an Anathema. And besides</hi> (sayth he) <hi>if wee should desyre of them the ceremony of ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, they would not giue it, except we would bind ourselves to renounce the true doctrine; &amp; other wicked bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ds would they cast vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> vs. Neyther therefore ought the true Ch: to be without Pastors, without the keyes, without the voyce of the gospell, without forgivenes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And thus much of the Ministery both yours Mr Ber: &amp; ours: and more particularly to prove, that an assembly of faythful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple separating themselves from Heathenish, or Antichristian idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, have right within themselves to call, and appoint their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
               <p>Now from this conclusion thus manifested do arise sundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers worthy the noting down, for the common controversy.</p>
               <p>As first that such an assembly (though without officers) is a true<note place="margin">I.</note> visible <hi>Church, the kingdom of Christ,</hi> &amp; <hi>City of God.</hi> And I suppose it needs no confirmation to any good conscience, that the choise of Church officers is a Church action, a mayn part of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Christs kingdom, and a priviledge of that <hi>spirituall Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the new Ierusalem:</hi> and that such an assembly hath the power of Christ, and from him authority, and commission: without vvhich it were intollerable usurpation to praesume to choose his officers: especially the cheif officers in his kingdom, as are they which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister the word, &amp; sacraments, of whom we principally entreat.</p>
               <p>2. That the people have power to censure offenders: for they that<note place="margin">II.</note> haue power to elect, appoint, &amp; set vp officers, they hav also power (vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> just occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>) to reject, depose, &amp; put them down: &amp; so are part of that Church, where officers are; and the whole Church, where they are not; of which Christ speaketh Math: 18. 17. where he sayth <hi>tell the Church.</hi> Besides, that the calling of officers, and censuring of offenders are the two mayn administrations of the kingdome of Christ, and so both of one nature.</p>
               <p>3. And lastly that the brethren out of office, whether in a Church<note place="margin">III.</note> furnished with officers, or vvithout them, are not mere private persons; as you Mr Ber: and others, would make them, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of prophesy, calling of Ministers, and judging of offenders for scandalous sinns. Considering them in deed severally one by one, or in opposition to the publique officers, they may be called private persons: but take them joyntly, and in these and the like acts of their communion, and they are more then so: and as the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:1037:213"/>
Church is a publique body, so are they members of the body, and parts of the whole, and of the same publique nature with it: and not private parts, or members of the publique body: which were a senseles contradiction, and contrary to the rule in Reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. <hi>The whole, and all the partes ioyntly taken, are the same. When</hi> 
                  <note n="â€ " place="margin">Act: 1.</note> 
                  <hi>the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> made choyce of <hi>Ioseph, and Mathyas</hi> to be <hi>presented:</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the <note n="â€œ" place="margin">ch: 6.</note> 
                  <hi>seven</hi> Deacons: &amp; after that of <note n="*" place="margin">ch: 14.</note> 
                  <hi>the Elders in every Church,</hi> did they make a private choise of publique officers? or could they as private persons merely, make a publique choise? When the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> wrote <hi>to the Church of Corinth</hi> (which you graunt to be the multitude, or <note n="â€ " place="margin">first book Pag: 92.</note> 
                  <hi>body of the Church</hi> about the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring of the incestuous person) did he will them to <hi>judge</hi> and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure him privately for his publique scandalous sin? or could they as persons merely private passe a publique judgement?</p>
               <p>The thing then is, that when the Church is gathered or come together in one for the administration of the word, sacraments, censures and other exercises of religion, &amp; parts of Gods worship, the officers, (if there be any) and brethren with them, are one &amp; the same publique body, to be exercised in one and the same part of their publique communion: and to make the officers publick persons, and the brethren private in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion, is to make a schisme in the Church: and to make the brethren part of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, in the administration of the word, &amp; sacraments, prayer, singing of Psalmes, contribution, calling of officers, censuring of offenders, or other Church action whatsoever, private, and the officers publik is to make it schismatical, &amp; them in it schismatiks.</p>

                  <hi>word</hi> of promise, that makes the sacraments, except then the parish assemblies, joyntly considered in their members, have right unto the spirituall promises of God, the sacraments administred in, and vnto them in that their estate, cannot so be accounted true sacraments.</p>
               <p>For <hi>your prayers,</hi> I observe sundry things out of your own words, which I may not passe over: as first, that you speak not properly, no nor truely in saying you <hi>pray stinted prayers:</hi> for you read them, and who will say reading is praying? you pray to God, but will you say you read to God? or if you so say, and do, is it agreable eyther to his ordinance, or to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon reason? Mistake me not, as though I speak of inward prayer, or of the lifting vp of the hart: for I graunt a man may pray inwardly, or lift vp the heart to God, when he reads, or preaches, or sings, or receives the sacraments: of such prayer we neyther speak, nor can discern, but in our selves: our speach then being of the outward act, &amp; ordinance of prayer, I do affirm, (and so marvayl if all reasonable men concurre not with me) that the ordinance of reading cannot be the ordinance of praying.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="426" facs="tcp:1037:214"/>3. In your division of prayer, wherin you make some <hi>conceived,</hi> and some <hi>set and stinted,</hi> you graunt, that the prayers which are <hi>set, and stinted,</hi> are not <hi>conceived:</hi> wherein you do as much as graunt, that they are not of God, nor according to his will. The Apostle Iude directeth vs alwayes <hi>to</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Iude, 20.</note>

                  <hi>we cannot pray as we ought,</hi> but as <hi>the spirit helpeth vs,</hi> and begetteth in vs <hi>sighs vnutterable:</hi> by the work of which spirit if our prayers be not conceived first in our hearts before they be brought forth in our lips, they are an vnnaturall, bastardly, and prophane byrth.</p>
               <p>Lastly, if your <hi>stinted prayer</hi> be (as you say) <hi>agreable to the prescript forme of prayer taught by our saviour Christ,</hi> then must none other form of prayer be vsed but a stinted or set form: for none other form may be vsd but that which is agreable to the prescript form of Christ: since Christ hath sayd, <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Math. 6. 9.</note> after this manner, pray.</p>
               <p>Where you further add, that <hi>nothing is imposed or done</hi> by you <hi>for the worship of God, but the word read, and preached, and the sacraments, and prayer,</hi> I demaund of your first, in worship, or honour of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> are your holy dayes, bearing the names of S. Michaels, S. Peters, S. Iohns day, and the rest, imposed, and kept? if in the honour of the Saynts &amp; Angels, then are you not cleare (as you make your selves) from the worshipping of false Gods: neyther can you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt your selves from the number of them, which <note n="*" place="margin">Collos. 2. 18<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 23.</note> 
                  <hi>in voluntary religion worship Angels:</hi> if on the other side those dayes be appoynted and so kept holy, in the worship and honour of God, then do you (and that by authority) worship God by, and put holines in, other things, then the word read, &amp; preached, and the sacraments, and prayer; yea and other things, then ever came into the Lords heart to sanctify for his worship. And so <hi>the place</hi> Math. 15. 9. <hi>and other scriptures to that purpose</hi> are truely (though you say, <hi>falsely) alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged against you.</hi>

of the former is preferred in the most solemn assemblyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the canonicall scriptures; and the reading of them, before the reading of the other, which they justle out of their place. And for the homilyes, they are enioyned (and so vsed) in stead of the preaching of the word which is the principall part of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: wherevpon it followeth that the Apocrypha wrytings of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, being preferred before one part of Gods worship, which is the reading of the Canonicall scriptures, and vsed in stead of an other part of Gods worship, yea and that the principall part, as is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, are imposed (and so vsed) as partes of Gods worship. So that it is not without good cause, M Ber: that M <hi>Ainsworth</hi> bids you prove the Apocrypha <hi>scriptures, and books of Homilies the true word of God. Nothing,</hi> you tel vs, <hi>is imposed and vsed amongst you for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of</hi> God, <hi>but the true word of God read, and preached, and the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and prayer:</hi> now these being imposed, and vsed for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, and being neyther the preaching of the word, nor the sacraments, nor prayer, must needs be <hi>the true word of God,</hi> &amp; so you must prove the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, or els the truth of your assertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> is disproved.</p>
               <p>Touching your discourse of the order of Gods worship before, in, and after the Apostles tyme, I observe (to let passe other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars) your errour, in making the particular <hi>Synagogues</hi> of the Iewes, <hi>as the</hi> particular <hi>Churches</hi> are <hi>now.</hi> The Synagogues were not entyre Churches of themselves, but partes, or members of the nationall Ch: neyther could they haue vse of the most solemn parts of Gods worship, as were then the sacrifices: neyther could the cheif Ministers in the Church execute their office in them: but as they depended vpon the temple in Ierusalem, so were the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<note place="margin">Deut. 12. 1 Chro. 22.</note> to cary their offerings thither, and there to enjoy these mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations. But particular congregations now do stand in no such dependancy; they may enjoy within themselves the word, sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and prayer, which are the most solemn services in the Ch: now, and so by consequence, all the rest. In deed it is with your parrish assemblyes, somewhat as it was with the Synagogues: they cannot enjoy the Ministers by, and from within themselves, nor have the vse of ecclesiasticall government, but must depend vpon their Ierusalems, the Bishops Chappels, and Consistories, for these their most solemn, and peculiar administrations.</p>

               <p>An other man would have comprehended these three reasons in<note place="margin">Answ:</note> one: and so might Mr Ber. have done well enough, considering his confirmation of them: wherein he brings not so much as one scripture, or reason from scripture, to prove their prescript leyturgy by man devised, and imposed (of which our mayn quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st on is) to be <hi>according to the word of God:</hi> &amp;c. onely in the 3. Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he toucheth an obiection, which he calles a <hi>conceyt</hi> of ours, viz: that <hi>it quencheth the spirit:</hi> to which he gives a double answer.

               <p>To the former, of them touching <hi>known experience,</hi> I do reply two things: first that the experience of supposed good in a course, or by meanes, not warrantable by the written word of God, is of all godly wise men to be suspected. 2<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> though the experience of good be certayn, yet must men take heed they honour not one thing for an other, as the means of that good: but they must put difference between that which is good, and that which is evill, in the same compound action.

               <p>And that these stinted and devised forms do <hi>quench the spirit</hi> of prayer, appears in that they deprive the Church, &amp; minister of that liberty of the spirit of prayer, which God would haue the vse: stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Minister, yea all the Ministers in the kingdom, to the same measure of the spirit, not onely one with an other, but all of them with him, that is dead and rotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>: and so stinting the spirit, which the Lord gives his Ministers, for his Church: and that so strictly, as till the stint be out, it may not suggest one thought or word otherwise; or when it is out, one more, then is praescribed.</p>

               <p>Now for M Ber: 2 Answ: namely that <hi>this conceipt</hi> of ours, <hi>saying</hi> that set prayer <q>
                     <hi>quencheth the spirit, is the groundwork of Mr Smithes casting of reading the scriptures in the assemblyes:</hi>
                  </q> first, he wrongeth M. Smyth, who doth not deny the reading of the scriptures in the assembly, but that the reading of them is properly a part of Gods worship. 2. Not our conceipt, but his own ill collection is the groundwork of his errour. Let the indifferent reader iudge, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this consequence be good or no. Bycause <hi>the reading of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrypha Prayers of the Bishops of Rome or of England, or their Chapleyns, for prayer, quencheth the spirit, or is not the true manner of prayer, which Christ hath left;</hi> therefore <hi>the reading of the Canonicall scriptures penned by the Prophets, and Apostles, for reading, quencheth the spirit, and is no part of Gods worship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Other observations M Ber: hath in his Answer, some nothing to the purpose, and others against himself: as for example: <hi>The Iewes in the ould Testament</hi> did <hi>meet together at set times commaunded by</hi>

               <p>The first of them is, that <hi>their congregations, as they stand, are all, and every one of them vncapable before God to chuse them Ministers, though</hi>

               <p>2. If they be capable of this liberty, why do they not vse it? There is no congregation in the Land, which as a Church, choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth their Minister: the Patron, and Bishop have seazed this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, &amp; at their courtesie doth the congregation stand to receive eyther a preacher, or dumb preist: eyther a man of some consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or without all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But what is this to that spirituall

               <p>3. I deny that any congregation in the Land desires the means of salvation. I speak of the congregation, which is the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of the parts joyntly considered. The best parish hath too many in it that <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Ioh. 3. 19</note>

And what right hath such an assembly to chuse a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, which hath no right to his ministrations of the sacraments, &amp; other holy things? Because the Lord Iesus hath given his power, and charter to his subjects for the choise of their officers whether many, or few, doth it therefore follow that the subjects of sinne, &amp; Satan, professed traytours vnto his Majesty, have the same liberty? or can his subjects combine with them that are, and allwayes have been such, in the vse, or rather in the vsurpation of that divine priviledge?

And this generall defence I do apply vnto the particulars, and first to the first: answering, that the <hi>Scribes, and Pharisees</hi> did neyther mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister to any but the Lords people, the Israell of God, nor in an vnlawfull place, nor by an vnlawfull enterance, how corruptly so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ministred: &amp; for corrupt administrations, besides the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

<pb n="434" facs="tcp:1037:218"/>
in the true Church, we do not think the Ministers are ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suddeynly, or vnorderly to be forsaken. To which I do ad fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, first, that the words do <hi>sit</hi> in Moses chayr, and whatsoever they <hi>bid</hi> you do, may more strictly after the Greek be turned <hi>have sit in MOSES chayre,</hi> and <hi>have bidden you observe,</hi> that is, what you have heard of them formerly according to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that do, and observe. But let the words be as they are, and that Christ speakes of the time to come, yet I see not how in them, the LORD eyther commaunds, or approves of his disciples hearing the Scribes, &amp; Pharisees in their publique, and solemn ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations: but if he speak of them, then he may onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his DISCIPLES in respect of their weaknes, and being (for the present) too much addicted vnto them, so to hear them: or otherwise Christ may speak of such occasionall meetings and conferences, as passed ordinarily between the Pharisees, and his disciples: wherin what was of Moses, he willes them to receive from them, without praejudice of their persons: and so we do also will, and exhort the people with vs to receive, and reteyn whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of God they hear from you, or any others vpon the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.

                  <hi>the Lord onely praescribes the dutyes to be done in every distinct office</hi> of ministery in the Church. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle<note place="margin">2 Tim: 3. 16. 17</note> testifieth that <hi>the scriptures, being divinely inspired, do make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and fully furnished, the man of God,</hi> or minister, <hi>to every good work</hi> of his calling. Now I suppose M. B: will not be so ill advised, as to goe about to prove that the celebration of mariage, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryall of the dead, are duetyes praescribed by the Lord Iesus to be done in the Pastours office, or that the scriptures lay this furniture vpon the man of God for the proper workes of his office. They are then other spiritual Lordes then the Lord Christ, that prescribe these duties to be done by their men, furnished by other scriptures then the divine scriptures, the Bishops scriptures, their Canons, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>stitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s: wherby they ar fully furnished indeed, with ring, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, service-book, and other preistly implements for the busines.</p>
               <p>The Apostle Paul Eph: 4. 8. 11. 12. teacheth, that <hi>when Christ ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on high, he gave vnto men</hi> such <hi>gifts,</hi> that is, such ministeryes of the Church as should serve for <hi>the repayring of the saynts, and aedification of his body,</hi> till the work of grace were perfected in all his: and so he makes <hi>the work of the ministery, and the aedification of the body of Christ</hi> all one. Now who will say that the celebration of mariage, or bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryall of the dead are in themselves matters of aedification, or
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:1037:220"/>
which further the vnity of fayth.

               <p>The Church is a religious society, and so the ministery which is given to the Church is a religious calling, and so the proper works of the ministery must needes be workes of religion: which if mariage or burying the dead were, then were it vnlawfull for a faythful husband to communicate with his wife being an infidell, or excommunicate, in the dutyes of mariage: or for a brother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a faythful person to ioyn with his brother being an infidell, or excommunicate, in the buryall of their dead father (for with such persons religious communion may not be kept) whereas the scriptures do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mend vnto vs these duties so performed, both as lawfull, and necessary, Gen. 25. 9. &amp; 35. 29. 1 Cor. 7. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14.

               <p>Of like truth with the former is that which followeth, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Paganism was wholly without the Church, but that Antichrist sits in the Church of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For first, admit it be true of Paganism in the land of Canaan, before the Israelites entred into it, yet afterwards it was otherwise,<note place="margin">Psal: 106. 35. 36. 37. 38.</note> as the scriptures testify: and got too great footing in the Church, in that place as it had done before in all places. 2. it is not true you say that <hi>Antichrist sits in the Church of God:</hi> he sits in his own Church, into which the Church of God is degenerated: though there remayn vsurped sundry things still, which are of God. It is a great vntruth to affirm that the Popish Synagogue in the present state is the true visible Church of God, vnto which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised his presence, &amp; given his power.

Or was their worship simple Paganism? I see not but, as the religion of the Papists, in the opposition it hath to Christianity, is rightly called Antichristianism, so the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of the ten Tribes, in the oppositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> it had to the law given by Moses, may fitly be called Anti-Iudaism.

               <p>Now howsoever the difference put by M.

Now for the 2. reason, who is ignorant how many thowsands in the land are most dangerously nourished in their erroneous, &amp; superstitious perswasions by the howses themselves (to let passe the particular both memorials of, and incitements vnto Idolatry stil appearing in some places more, &amp; in some lesse) knowing none other Church, to which God hath promised his speciall praesence, and wherein he wilbe glorified, save in that of lime, and stone: &amp; putting holynes in the very place: And how well your Church provides for this, appeares in sundry things; as in whyting the walls of the houses, where you silenced the preachers: in bynding the people absolutely to the places, though litle care be taken, what eyther they, or the ministers, to whom they come, do there, so they deale not too faythfully in the Lords buesines: in tying Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> buriall absolutely to the Church,

               <p>First, it is a very presumptuous thing for these ministers, yea or for any men or angels thus peremptorily to determine how much knowledg a man must have to be saved: that if he have iust so much,<note place="margin">I.</note> then he may be, or is it the state of salvation: if he want any of that, he cannot be saved.

As on the contrary, the Lord rejects many with greater knowledg, for their vnfaythfulnes, both in not practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the things they know, and in neglecting to know more, least they should learne that truth, which they have no mynde to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise for feare, or in other corrupt regards.</p>
               <p>And howsoever I do acknowledge a difference of truthes, and that some are more, and some lesse principall, yet do I wish more conscience in the application of this distinction. For whereas the ministers are by the lawes, and penaltyes, Civill, and Ecclesiastical, limited in their doctrine; and both the ministers, and people in their obedience of, and to the truth of the gospel, and ordinances of the new testament, this is made a salve for every sore, that they have <hi>the substance of the gospell; the doctrine of fayth: all fundamentall truthes:</hi> and <hi>whatsoever is necessary to salvation.</hi> In which defence (as it is made) there are these evills.</p>
               <p>First, in it men not onely endeavour (which is too much) <hi>the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Babell,</hi> but iudeed to make Babell beleeve shee stands in no great need of curing<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and that her wounds are neyther deadly, nor daungerous.</p>
               <p>2. It tends to vilify, and make of small moment many of the Lords truthes, &amp; ordinances, howsoever these <note n="*" place="margin">Pag: 173 174.</note> ministers wil not heare of it. And this will appeare, if the end be considered of these
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:1037:225"/>
distinctions, and qualifications: which is, that men should setle themselves, without pressing further in the disobedience, and want of sundry of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maundements, and ordinances of Christ Iesus, till with bodily peace, and leave of the magistrate, they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the same. And if <note n="â€ " place="margin">Math. 15. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>the Scribes and Pharisees</hi> were reproved of Christ for <hi>making the commaundements, of God of none authority by their tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> do not they make the commaundements of God, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Christ of small moment, who for the traditions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of men (yea of <hi>that man of sin</hi>) though supported by the arme of flesh, haue forborn and do forbear (and, so purpose to go on) the obedience of the fame? which whether it be not the very estate of these ministers in forbearing to preach (that I may let passe other matters) for the refusall of subscription, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, let their own consciences judge. And mark their defence.<note place="margin">pag. 174.</note> They <hi>beleiv, and teach that there is no part of the holy scripture, which every Christian is not necessarily bound to seek, and desire the knowledge of, so far forth, as in him lyeth.</hi> Here is a great charge layd vpon <hi>every Christian to seek the knowledge of every part of holy scripture:</hi> but no word of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto every part of it: as if <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Mat. 28. 19 20. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ</hi> had not <hi>sent out his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> to <hi>teach men to observ, to the worlds end,</hi> but to know, <hi>what he had commaunded them:</hi> and as if <note n="â€ " place="margin">Psal. 119. 105.</note> 
                  <hi>the word</hi> of God were onely <hi>a light and lanthorn</hi> vnto mens eyes, that they might see the wayes of God, and not to their <hi>feet,</hi> and <hi>pathes,</hi> that they might walk in them. The same Prophet in the same Psalm entreats the <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>teach him the way of his statutes,</hi> that <hi>he might keep it vnto the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ver. 33. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>end:</hi> &amp; that he would <hi>give him vnderstanding, that he might keep his law:</hi> professing also in the same place, that he was comforted in GOD against all that <hi>confusion,</hi> which his enemyes would have brought vpon him, that he had <hi>respect to all GODS commaundements:</hi> and this respect was not of bare knowledge, but of observation, and obedience, as appears in all the five verses before going. Neyther therefore can the ministers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse themselves from <hi>making some parts of the holy scriptures of small moment, and needles,</hi> as Mr Barrow chargeth them, bycause they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise the people to <hi>desire the knowledge</hi> of them, except with their<note place="margin">ver. 6.</note> knowledge they joyned obedience; neyther ought the people to rest in that vnsound advise, considering that, <note n="*" place="margin">Ia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>: 4. 17.</note>

               <p>3. This pleading by the ministers, that they <hi>hould, and enioy every fundamentall truth, and whatsoever is of necessity to salvation,</hi> (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sidering the end of it, which is, the stopping of the people from pressing vnto further obedience, and profession of the will of God, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Christ) is injurious both to the growth, and sincerity of the obedience of Gods people. For whereas they ought to be <note n="â€ " place="margin">Heb. 6. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>led forward vnto perfection,</hi> this teacheth them to stay in the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if it were sufficient for the building of the house, that the foundation were layd: &amp; secondly, it insinuates, that it is sufficient, if, men so serue God, as they can obteyn salvation, though with disobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce of a great part of the revealed wil of God: occasioning them thereby to serve him onely, or chiefly for wages as hypocrites do. As if a child should be taught so far to honour, and please his father as he might get his inheritance, but not much to trouble himself about giving or doing him any further honour, or service.</p>

               </p>
               <p>3. I deny, that <hi>the whole Church of England: hath received, and doth hold, and professe this fundamentall, truth:</hi> how boldly soever these <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> affirme it. They <hi>graunt there are many Atheists in the land,</hi> (they<note place="margin">pag. 166.</note> might say in the Church, for Atheists are, and ever wilbe of the Kings, &amp; states religion) &amp; <hi>many ignorant, and wicked men besides, who make not so clear, and holy a profession of the true fayth, as they should.</hi> And do these <hi>Atheists hold, and professe the true fayth, and every article of Gods holy truth, which is fundamentall?</hi> Are there not many thowsands in the nationall Church ignorant of the very first rudiments, &amp; foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 1. 2.</note> of religion, as the Apostle noteth them down: and can they hold, and professe that whereof they are ignorant? Yea how can any wicked men hold, that CHRIST is their saviour, but they hold an apparantly in the eyes of all men? for which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding these Ministers wil have them reputed true members of Christs body. I ad, that since the body of that Church or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:1037:226"/>
consists of mere naturall men, and that naturall men are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists in the case of justification, and look to be saved by their good meaning, and well doings, it is most vntruly affirmed by those ministers, that their Church <hi>accounts none her members, but such as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse salvation by Christ onely.</hi> They hold otherwise and so professe, if an account of their fayth be demaunded, as I have shewed by the testimony of Mr. Nichols, and could do by the testimony of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if all men did not see it too evidently. And yet see what these men affirme and that <hi>confidently,</hi> and without fear, for their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: as that their <hi>whole Church makes profession of the true fayth;</hi> that it <hi>holds, and maintayns every article fundamentall of Gods holy truth:</hi> and particularly that <hi>Iesus Christ the sonne of God</hi>  and lastly that <hi>they that receive this truth, are the people of God, and in the state of salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it must follow, that their whole nationall Church is in the state of salvation. And surely so had it need be (in the judgment of men) having the promises and seales of the covenant of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion applyed, and ministered vnto it, and to every member of it.</p>
               <p>Lastly, though the whole Church of England, and every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<note place="margin">IIII.</note> in it, did personally professe the true fayth in holines, as all the true members of the Church do (which are therefore called both <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Eph: 1. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>saynts, and faythfull</hi>) and that we had do just exception agaynst that prophane, and implicite profession, for which both Mr. Ber. and the ministers plead, yet could nor this make it or them a true Church. The bare profession of fayth makes not a true Church, except the persons so professing be vnited in the Covenant, and fellowship of the gospel into particular congregations, having the entyre power of Christ within themselves. As hewed stones are fit for an house, but not an howse nor any part of it, till they be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly layd, and couched together: so are men professing fayth, and holines fit for the Church, but not a Church, nor of it, before their orderly combination into a particular assembly having in it the power of Christ for the ministery, government, censures, and other ordinances. A company of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municates put out of the Churches order, may professe the same fayth they did formerly: so may a sect of schismatiques putting themselves causelesly out of the Churches order: so may many particular persons, never ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themselve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I do answer that if Christ have so sayd to the particular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>grega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> who hath sayd it to the Praelates &amp; their substitutes, or to any officer, or officers, excluding the body of the Congregation? Even none but he, whose work it is to gainsay Christ, &amp; to subvert his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? 2. If any of your parishes be such congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s, why do not you as faythful Ministers exhort the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to, &amp; guide them in the vse of this power of binding, &amp; loosing, which Christ hath given them? Or are not you content to suffer them to go on, and your selves to go before them in the losse of this liberty, yea in a most vile subjection to their and your, spirituall Lords, which have vsurped it? And for the Argument it is of no force: for neyther hath any one Church in the world that power over an other, nor all the Churches in the world over any one, which the meanest Church hath over any her member, or members whomsoever. One Church may forsake an other, but juditially to censure, or excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it, may it not. The same answer for substance may serve for that which is objected from 1 Cor. 14. 32. Besides, no Church can so fully discern of the estate of an other Church, as it can of the proper members apperteyning vnto it. Yea I ad, that in this respect, <hi>wee are better able to iudge</hi> of the Church of Engl: then are any forreyn Churches, (notwithstanding our weaknes) bycause they do not in any measure know the estate of it, as we do.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p>Lastly, as that saying of the Ministers must have a very favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note place="margin">VIII.</note> interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, <hi>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>that he is in the estate of salvation,</hi> so is their other affirmation, that <hi>the discerning of the spirits, and doctrine of such teachers, as arise in the Church, is such a gift, as the true Ch: never wanted,</hi> as popish an errour,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> as ever was broched in Rome. For how then can the Church erre? or how can it be deceived by false teachers? or how could Rome come to that estate of apostasie wherein she now standeth? Or may
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:1037:229"/>
not a Papist plead thus with these men? Rome was a true Church of God. Now <hi>the true Church never wants the gift of discerning spirits &amp; doctrines,</hi> therefore Rome neyther hath wanted, nor doth, nor ever shall want this gift: and so by consequence cannot be faln from the truth, as is praetended against her.</p>
               <p>To conclude, it is not truely sayd of these men, that this judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one Church by another is a matter <hi>of salvation.</hi> The Ch:<note place="margin">Act. 10. 14 15. 34. 35. with 11. 2. 3. 4. 5.</note> of Ierusalem was ignorant of the calling of the Churches of the Gentiles, as the scriptures testify. And I would know what the Church of England judgeth of the Lutheran Churches, as they are called. It accounteth of them, as of true Churches. So do not they of their Churches, whom they call Calvinists, but on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary repute them as haereticall. Wherevpon it followeth, that eyther a true Church may erre in judging of an other Church, or els that eyther the Church of England, or the Lutheran Churches, or both, are not true Churches. Howsoever therefore we do not <hi>make light account of the testimony, and iudgement of other Churches,</hi> as these Ministers accuse vs, yet dare wee not make idols of them as they seem to do: who wanting both the word of God, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of other Churches for their warrant, seek commendation by the testimony which some haue given of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> in respect of certeyn generall heads of doctrine, in which wee our selves also do for the most part concur with them.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the Ministers Arguments. Now follow their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to two mayn <hi>obiections</hi> made by vs <hi>against the whole body of their Church, and their Parish assemblies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first is, that <hi>it was not gathered by such means, as God in his word hath ordeyned, and sanctifyed for the gathering of his Church.</hi> The 2. that <hi>they communicate together in a false and idolatrous outward worship of God, which is polluted with the writings of men, vidz, with read stinted prayers, homilyes, catechismes, and such like.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These objections have been els where prosequuted, and the exceptions taken by the Ministers agaynst them, particularly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered by Mr Ainsworth, and therein their both corrupt, &amp; weak dealing manifested. I will briefly adde a few things.</p>
               <p>Against the former objection they take five exceptions.</p>

               <p>Belike then wee must beleeve that the Church of Engl: was<note place="margin">Answ:</note> gathered miraculously, as Christ came by miracle into the place where his disciples were assembled.

               <p>As then it is not true, that the body of the land, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Queen Elizabeths reigne, did joyne vnto the secret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations (so remayning) in Queen Maryes dayes: but on the contrary, these congregations did dissolve, and joyne themselves with the vnhallowed rowt in the popish, &amp; profane parishes vnder their late (masse, &amp; their du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>b) priests for the most part: so neyther matters it which ioyned u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>to which since the vnhallowed, &amp; grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les multitude neither could by the word of God ioyn vnto others, nor be ioyned to by them in the covenant of grace and of the gospell, with the seales and other the ordinances thereof, to which they had, or have no right. Vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the same grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d also I infer, that it is not materiall, though <hi>the people</hi> were <hi>not compelled to the profission of the gospell</hi> before <hi>the midsomer after the Queen came to the crown:</hi> if they were compelled to professe the gospel, of, and vnto which, they were apparantly, and notoriously ignorant, and disobedient, as they were. They knew what they were to look for: and so being, for the most part, of no religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, they set themselves to conform, as the tymes were, to that, which they discerned the Queen to be of.</p>
               <p>And for the <hi>Preachers, and Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>missioners, which were sent</hi> before this set day, for the catholik fayth of all the Queens subjects, as I think it was well, so was it not sufficient to make the whole land, or to prepare them to be a true Church: besides that the people were of the Church all this while: the same nationall, provinciall, dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan, and parochiall Church, &amp; Churches consisting of the same persons generally, still continuing vnder the same government, &amp; ministery, &amp; in the same will-worship, though in a measure refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as before in Queen Maryes dayes.</p>
               <p>Now for the Preachers you name, as <hi>Mr Knoxe, Lever;</hi> &amp;c. which <hi>exercised their Ministery in some of the best reformed Churches, during Q. Maryes reign,</hi> as the good they did to some few. (in comparison) by the truthes they taught, could not make all the Queens sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:1037:232"/>
a true nationall Church, so do we all know how hardly they were suffered in the begi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ning of the Queens reign, &amp; that contrary to the publick Church-government, &amp; ministery: as also that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they, nor any others, could or can be admitted to any Church by any ministery received in the reformed Churches, but onely by the ordination of a popish Praelate whether English, or Romish, it matters not: by which also it is apparant to all men vpon what string the English ministery hangeth.</p>
               <p>Lastly where these men say that <hi>many are dayly added</hi> to <hi>the Church by the ministery of the word preached,</hi> I marvayl how this can be, and from whence they are added. Addition is a motion, and in every motion, there must be the terms, or bounds, from and to which it is made. All they to whom they preach, are of the Church already: for recusant Papists come not to their Church; and besides the number of them encreaseth dayly. It seemes then they are added from the Church to the same Church. Bycause this practise of <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> men <hi>to the Church</hi> by the preaching of the gospell was in vse in the primative Churches, and this phrase vsed in the scriptures: therefore these ministers think they may abuse the phrase, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the thing: and so feed their simple readers with words of the winde.</p>
               <p>Of the ministers 4 exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, viz: of <hi>the vniting of the Queens subiects</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Minist:</note> 
                  <hi>vnto those professours, whose fellowship</hi> in popery <hi>they had forsaken:</hi> and of <hi>the course taken</hi> for that purpose by the example of the godly Kings<note place="margin">Answ:</note> of <hi>Iudah</hi> I have formerly spoken: of the former part even now: and of the latter els where, declaring. 1. first that <hi>the English nation, and all the people of the kingdom never was admitted into the LORDS covenant, by the rules of the new testament, to become a nationall CHURCH, vnder nationall government, as was IUDAH, and all the people in it vnder the old.</hi> If this can be proved I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my self in many great errours: if not it is vanity, and errour, thus to instance in IVDAH, and indeed to revive Iudaism, and the old testament.</p>
               <p>2. That <hi>though England had been somtimes a true nationall Church, as was Iudah, yet that it did not so remayn in the deep Apostacy of</hi>
                  <pb n="463" facs="tcp:1037:232"/>
                  <hi>Antichrist but was divorced in Rome her mother: whereas Iudah on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, (into what transgression soever she sell) was never divorced by the Lord, but still remayned his (though vnfaythfull) wife: the L. ever &amp; anon, stirring vp some extraordinary instrument or other for her reformation, &amp; the renovation of her covenant: with which also the Lord so effectually wrought, as the things are wonderfull which are written of all the people, and such, as never shalbe found in any whole kingdom to the worlds end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That <hi>the reformation by King Edward, and Queen Elizabeth (though great in it self, and they in it vnder GOD greatly to he honoured) was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing comparable to that which was made in Iudah, by Iehosaphat, Iosiah, Asa, Ezechiah, and Nehemiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These poynts I have proved at large <note n="*" place="margin">Page 276. 277. 278. 279. &amp;c: to 304</note> else where, and do refer the reader thither for answer, onely I will note some particular oversights of the ministers in this fourth exception: as first, where they say they have <hi>proved there was a true Church in the land before Queen Elizabeths reign;</hi> they should have proved, that the Land was a true Church: for so was Iudah. 2. Where they say, that <hi>the noble men were sent by Iehosaphat</hi> onely <hi>to accompany, &amp; assist the Levites, &amp; to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chr: 17. 7</note> 
                  <hi>countenance their ministery,</hi> where the scriptures affirme they were <hi>sent</hi> even <hi>to teach.</hi> You will have no teaching but by Church officers: therfore you so put the scripture of. 3. That they say, <hi>Iosiah compelled</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See pag 295. 296. 297. 298.</note> 
                  <hi>his subiects to the service of the true God:</hi> taking compulsion as they do; where it is evident the people did it freely: though I acknowledge he made compulsive lawes. 4 Speaking of the authority of magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates over their subjects they bring in <hi>Ezechias proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>,</hi> as they call it, <hi>sent to Israell:</hi> wheras the ten tribes were not his subiects, nor he their King. And lastly, that <hi>the Ismaelites were separated from the Church of God:</hi> therein acknowledging that IVDAH was alwayes the true Church of God: which I suppose they will not say of Engl: alwayes, or of Rome: if they do, it is their sin to separate from the true Church.</p>
               <p>The fifth, and last exception of the ministers is, that Mr<note place="margin">Minist:</note> BARROVV &amp; Mr GREENVVOOD <hi>required that the people in the begi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ning of the Queens reign should by solemn oth, &amp; covenant, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Idolatry, &amp; have professed fayth, &amp; obedience to the gospel, after the example of Asaes reformation.</hi> To which their answer is, first that <hi>such</hi>
                  <pb n="464" facs="tcp:1037:233"/>
                  <hi>a covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ting by oath is not absolutely necessary, as appeares in Iehosaphats, &amp; Iosiahs reformation.</hi> 2. That <hi>the people was before that oath, &amp; covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, Gods true Church: which their people also may be.</hi> 3. That <hi>sundry congregations as in Coventry, and Northampton did publiquely professe repentance for their Idolatry, and promised to obey the truth established.</hi> 4. They <hi>doubt not to affirm that the whole land in the first Parliament did enter a solemn covenant with the Lord for renouncing of Popery, and receiving the gospell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Mr Barr. and Green: should requyre, that the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant<note place="margin">Answ:</note> into which the Church entereth, should be by oth necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, is more then I know: or then we practise. But that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that <hi>the people,</hi> that is, the whole nation, should so have passed a solemn oth, and covenant, I know is most vntrue. All men know they thought the ignorant prophane, popish multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude vncapable of the Lords covenant, and the seales of it: &amp; to have requyred of them an oth for such a purpose had been to have requyred of them the taking of Gods name in vayn. Where it is sayd in the 2. place that <hi>the people of Iudah were Gods true Church, before the tyme of that oth, and Covenant,</hi> it is true, and agaynst you. And I would demaund of you whether your people were Gods true Church, when Popery reigned. Your answer is, <hi>so may our people bee.</hi> You dare not say they were; for then you should acknowledge the Romish Synagogue the true Church of GOD, and that you had sinfully, schismed from it, as Mr Bern. proves agaynst you, and himselfe: you will not say, they were not: for that would make against you in the poynt in hand: and would manifest, (as in deed it doth) that the course ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with Iudah (being the true Church) for her reformation, cannot agree with Rome, or Engl: as a member of the Romish Church for her reformation.</p>
               <p>To that which is added in the 3. place of <hi>Coventry, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton,</hi> and <hi>some other congregations,</hi> my reply is, first that this is not likely to have been the deed of the congregations, but of some two or three forward ministers, (a few of the people it may be approving of it) which their successours were as like to reverse. 2. They did not repent of their publique idolatry nor purpose to obey the truth in sincerity: of their prophane mixture,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:1037:233"/>
Romish hierarchy, and ministery, popish leyturgy, and constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (according to which all things are administred amongst them) they repented not: and besides they knew right well many truthes, which they purposed not to imbrace. 3. graunt it were (as they pretend) with these few parishes, what must be sayd of the rest which did not so practise? with whom they make, and alwayes have done one entyre nationall Church, or what is this to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and formall state of the Church of England agaynst which we deale. The truth is, these men thus practising, were reputed, (and truely) schismatiques in the formall constitution of the Church: and by which this their dealing hath no warrant at all. If we should object vnto you the Papists doctrines and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, of two or three ministers amongst you, not warrantable by law, you would not admit of our exception agaynst the formall established estate of your Church: so neyther may we admit of yours, for the practise of two or three, disliking the present state of things, and seeking for reformation of them.</p>
               <p>Lastly, wee see indeed that those <hi>Ministers doubt not to affirme, that the whole land</hi> (Papists, and Atheists and all) <hi>did in the first Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of the Queen enter a solemn covenant for renouncing of Popery, and receiving the gospel:</hi> but we would see first, how all these swarmes of wicked Atheists, and most flagitious persons were by the revealed will of God capable of the covenant of the new testament, and the seales, and other rites, and priviledges of it. Otherwise this haling them into covenant with the Lord agaynst his expresse will, was a prophane, &amp; presumptuous enterprise in it self, though I doubt not arising from a godly intent in the Queen, &amp; her cheif connsellers being mislead by them, whom they too much trus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. 2. We would see what warrant there is in the new testament for this nationall covenant, or that all the people in a Land (since the Land of Canaan was prophaned) should unite into a nationall Church, vnder a nationall government, and ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. 3. That which wee answered in the 2. place to the former branch of this exception, must here agayn be remembred. 4. this vndoubted <hi>affirmation</hi> of the ministers touching the <hi>whole lands covenanting in the Parliament,</hi> first inferreth that the enacting of civil
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:1037:234"/>
lawes, and penall statutes by Kings, and States, doth gather CHVRCHES: for none other covenant was there in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2. It confirmeth the popish doctrine of implicite fayth:<note place="margin">see pag: 302 303. 304.</note> &amp; that men may receive, and professe a fayth whereof they are ignorant, yea which they dislike and hate, so farre as they know it: for so was it with the body of your nation, the greatest part by farr being mere <note n="â€ " place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>naturall men,</hi> and so <hi>not knowing</hi> the gospel: yea <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Ioh. 3. 20</note> 
                  <hi>evil doers,</hi> which <hi>hate the light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our 2. objection touching the <hi>outward worship wherein the Ch: of England communicateth,</hi> comes now to be enforced. In the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of which the Ministers do (to speak on) insist onely vpon their <hi>stinted, &amp; set formes of prayer:</hi> for the justification of which<note place="margin">Minist.</note> they bring sundry scriptures as Numb: 6. 2. 3. 24. Deut. 26. 3. 15. Psal. 22. 1. &amp; 92. Luk. 11. 2. Now for our more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly proceeding, I will reduce the things they say to three<note place="margin">Answ.</note> generall heads (vnder which I will consider of the particulars) shewing how in all, and every of them they are mistaken.</p>
               <p>First, in that they do confound, and make all one ordinance, <hi>Blessings, Psalmes, and Prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. In misinterpreting the scriptures they bring to prove a <hi>set, and stinted form of words</hi> to be imposed in prayer.</p>
               <p>3. In concluding (as they do) that if Moses, and Christ might appoynt, and impose a certayn form of words to be vsed for prayer, that then the Bishops in England or others, may vse the same power, and appoint an other form of words so to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Of these three in order.</p>
               <p>And first, it is evident, that, howsoever some kinde of <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi> and <hi>prayer</hi> be all one, and so may be confounded, yet that solemn kinde of blessing spoken of Numb: 6. and which the PATRIARKS, and PREISTS did vse in their places, was<note place="margin">I.</note> cleane of an other nature. In prayer the MINISTER stands in place of the PEOPLE, and in their name offers<note place="margin">II.</note> vp petitions, and thanksgiving to GOD: But in blessing, the Minister stands in the place of God, and in his name pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth a blessing, or mercy vpon the people. 2. Whereas this due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of prayer may be performed by one equall to another, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to a superiour, yea by a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to himself: that other of blessing
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:1037:234"/>
is alwayes from the greater to the lesser: and therefore the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to shew that the Preisthood of <hi>Melchi-sedek</hi> was<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 17.</note> more excellent then that of <hi>Levi</hi> proves it by this, that <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec blessed Abraham;</hi> taking this for granted <hi>without all contradiction,</hi> that <hi>the lesse is blessed of the greater.</hi> 3. Mr Ber: himself in this book<note place="margin">III.</note> makes prayer one thing, and the <hi>blessing pronounced vpon the people,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">pag. 148.</note> 
                  <hi>when they departed,</hi> another thing: as he also makes singing of <hi>psalmes</hi> a third distinct thing from them both: as there is cause he should.</p>
               <p>For first, the Apostle writing to the Corinthians of the divers<note place="margin">I.</note> giftes, and administrations in the Church, speaketh thus. <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 14. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>I wil pray with the spirit, but I will pray with the vnderstanding also: I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing with the vnderstanding also.</hi> Answerable vnto which is that in <note n="â€ " place="margin">Ch. 5. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Iames, Is any among you afflicted? let him pray; is any merry? let him sing:</hi> both the one, and other Apostle making singing, and praying distinct exercises. Ad vnto this, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as<note place="margin">II.</note> in praying we are to speak onely vnto God, it is otherwise in singing, where we are taught to <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Ephe. 5. 19. Col. 3. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>speak vnto our selves in psalmes,</hi> and to <hi>teach, and admonish our selves in Psalmes, and himnes, and spirituall songs.</hi> What greater difference? In prayers wee speak onely to God: in psalmes to our selves mutually, or one to another. Neyther had Mr Giffard any adva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tage in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, where wee are taught to <hi>sing with a grace in our harts to the Lord:</hi> for by <hi>singing with a grace</hi> is meant such singing as <hi>ministreth grace vnto the hearers,</hi> contrary to that <hi>corrupt,</hi> or rotten <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> Eph. 4. 29. And in this, as in all other things, we must propound the glory, and honour of God vnto our selves.</p>
               <p>3. There are very many both of Davids, and others Psalmes,<note place="margin">III.</note> wherein there is no title of prayer: but they are merely to be sung for doctrine, instruction, and meditation, as Psal. 1. 2. and many<note place="margin">Minist: pag. 192. 593.</note> more. The <hi>Ministers</hi> write, that <hi>the most Psalmes</hi> that <hi>David made, were sung not onely as meditations, and doctrines, for the instructions of the Ch: but as prayers to God: bycause they are sayd to be sung vnto the Lord:</hi> for which purpose they insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce in one onely, which is Psal. 66. 2. 3.</p>
               <p>Well, not to fall to reckoning with them (wherein they and<note place="margin">Answ:</note> I should not agree: for I would except against their picked insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce: Ps. 66. 2. 3. which all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> may see was not sung for prayer, nor vnto the Lord, as they mean, but for instruction, and provocation of
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:1037:235"/>
the Church to prayse God) if they consider it, they should have proved, not that some, but that all psalmes are prayers; otherwise they may not be confounded, &amp; made one ordinance, as by them they are. But to come to that which is specially to be observed: even those Psalmes, whose matter is prayer, are not prayers: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the singing of them, the outward ordinance, and exercise of praying, And this is the very state of the controversy<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Which that it may be vnderstood the better, it must be considered, that the very same matter of prayer may be vsed diversly, and so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into divers externall ordinances. It may be read, preached, heard, written, sung, or prayed. Now who is so simple, as to say herevpon that reading, preaching, hearing, writing, singing, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are all one? If a man read Davids prayer, that <note n="*" place="margin">2 Sam. 15 31.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lord</hi> would <hi>turn the counsayl of Ahitophel into foolishnes:</hi> or eyther read, or sing the 6. Psalm where in his prayer, he professeth, that he <hi>causeth his bed</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v: 6.</note> 
                  <hi>every night to swim, and waters his couch with teares:</hi> or Psalm. 42. that he <hi>remembers God fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the Land of Iorden</hi> &amp;c. doth that man therefore<note place="margin">ver: 6.</note> pray to God, that he would <hi>turn into foolishnes the counsel of Ahitophel?</hi> or doth he professe, that he <hi>waters his couch with teares every night,</hi> &amp; <hi>remembers God from the Land of Iorden?</hi> or is it not evident he reads, and sings those prayers onely for instruction of himself, &amp; others? And so wee read in the inscription of the last named psalm that it was <hi>committed to the sonnes of Corah</hi> (not to pray it, which they could not do without folly) but <hi>for instruction.</hi> And as truely may it be sayd, that the reading of <hi>Noahs</hi> curse, or <hi>Schemies,</hi> is cursing,<note place="margin">Gen. 9. 25. 2 Sam. 16. 5.</note> as that the reading, or singing (for singing is, but a reading in tune) of <hi>Davids</hi> prayers, is praying.</p>
               <p>But it will here be asked, is it not then lawfull for a man in the singing of Davids psalmes (consisting of prayer) to lift vp his hart, and to have it affected accordingly, as he can apply the matter in them to his present state, &amp; occasions? yes certaynly, it is both lawfull, and godly: but withall it must be remembred, that the quaestion here is not about the inward affection of the heart, but about the outward ordinance: and 2. that a man may so lift vp his heart, and have the affection of prayer, and thanksgiving, in preaching, hearing, writing, reading: and yet not perform the outward exercise, and outward ordinance of prayer, of which our
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:1037:235"/>
quaestion is.</p>
               <p>Lastly, in psalmes there is of necessity required a certayn known form of words, that two or more may sing together: according to the nature of the ordinance, wherein many joyning vocally, do make a concent or harmony. But who will say there is such simple necessity of a set form of words for prayer? wherein one is to utter a voyce, according to the suggestions of the spirit in his heart, and the rest to consent by silence, with saying <hi>Amen.</hi> By which it appeareth how vnadvisedly these ministers and others, do thus agayn and agayn vrge set formes of psalmes to prove set formes of prayer.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the first head; the second followeth, in which such scriptures are to be considered of, as are brought to prove a set, &amp; stinted form of words to be imposed for prayer. The principal scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures for this purpose, and vnto which the rest may be reduced, are Numb. 6. 23. 24. Math. 6. 9. Luk. 11. 2.</p>
               <p>It is a troublesome thing that that these Ministers thus vrge the letter of the scriptures: as if the quaestion were not about their sense, and interpretation: which they should prove to be for their stinted service: as they should also disprove our reasons to the contrary. But herein they are vtterly silent, and think it suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to inculcate the words, <hi>Thus shall ye blesse the children of Israel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 6. 23. Mat. 6. 9. Luk. 11. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>and say vnto them</hi> &amp;c: &amp;, <hi>when you pray, say thus, Our father</hi> &amp;c. even as the Papists vrge these words <hi>this is my body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First then wee do acknowledge these words to be in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by them cited: 2. wee hold it lawfull to vse those very words in our-prayers, all, or any part of them, if wee be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto guided by <note n="*" place="margin">Iude, 20. Rom. 8. 26. 27.</note>
                  <hi>the Holy Ghost</hi> in whom we must alwayes <hi>pray,</hi> and by whose <hi>help</hi> we must <hi>make our requests</hi> vnto God. But the quaestio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> is, whether Moses tyed, and stinted the Preists to that form of words in blessing the people: and whether Christ tyed, and stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his disciples to that very form of words for prayer, so to be vsed by the one, and other, without alteration, addition, or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution.</p>
               <p>And that this is not the meaning of the holy Ghost, I do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by these Reasons.</p>
               <p>First, these particles <hi>thus,</hi> or <hi>on this manner,</hi> &amp; <hi>say,</hi> do not vsually<note place="margin">I.</note>
                  <pb n="470" facs="tcp:1037:236"/>
in the scriptures designe, or note out the form of words, but the substance of the thing spoken of. Take an instance, or two. When the Lord sent <hi>Moses</hi> vnto <note n="â€œ" place="margin">Ex: 4. 22. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Pharaoh King of Aegypt,</hi> it was vnder these terms. <hi>Thou shalt say to Pharaoh, thus sayth the Lord, Israel my sonne, my first born: wherefore I say to thee, let my sonne go, that he may serve me:</hi> &amp;c. But when Moses came to deliver his message in the next chapt: ver. 1. 2. he doth not ty himself to the self same words, nor vseth them. He did not vnderstand, thou shalt <hi>say</hi> to Pharaoh, &amp; <hi>thus sayth</hi> the Lord, of the form of words, but of the substance of the thing. The same in effect may be sayd of <note n="â€ " place="margin">Gen: 24. 12. with 42. &amp;c</note> 
                  <hi>Abrahams ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> going about <hi>a wife for Isaak,</hi> who, relating to Laban the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he made for direction in the buesines, doth not vse the same words, when he tels him what he <hi>sayd</hi> in his prayer. It seems in his vnderstanding, a man might <hi>say</hi> thus, &amp; thus, in prayer, though he vsed not the same words if he spake to the same purpose.</p>
               <p>Many more scriptures might I bring, as others have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, to prove, that these words, and particles, (upon which these men vvould recken the words of their prayers do no way en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn any such stint of words, and sillables, but onely a similitude of matter, and are for direction therein.<note place="margin">II.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is evident in the scriptures, that neyther Moses, nor the Preists, or other holy men stinted themselves to these words. 1 Sam. 1. 17. and 2. 20. Deut. 33. 1. 2. &amp;c. 2 Chron. 6. 3. 4. &amp;c.<note place="margin">III.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, why do not the ministers now ty themselves to this form of words in blessing the people: they being <note n="*" place="margin">Isa: 66. 21. Gal: 6. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lords Preists, and Levites,</hi> &amp; the Ch:, the <hi>Israel of God?</hi> This blessing was no ceremony, or shadow to be abolished, but moral, &amp; perpetual.</p>
               <p>4. If the Lord Iesus in directing his disciples to pray, praescribe<note place="margin">IIII.</note> them a <hi>certayn form of words,</hi> to be vsed, when he bids them <hi>pray thus,</hi> or <hi>after this manner:</hi> &amp; <hi>when</hi> they <hi>pray, say,</hi> then eyther Mathew, or Luke misse in Christs intendement<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> for they (as all may see) record not the same <hi>certayn form of words.</hi> If defence be made, that they speak of two severall tymes, wherein Christ gave this direction, I answer such a man, that if that be graunted, it makes against him: for Christ inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ded the same thing in both places, &amp; at both times: wherevpon it followes that the vse of a certayne form of words, was no part of Christs intendement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="471" facs="tcp:1037:236"/>It is evident that these words of Christ, <hi>pray thus,</hi> and <hi>when you pray, say,</hi> are a commandement, binding his Church to the worlds end, in all places, and at all tymes: and that <hi>when</hi> you pray, say, is<note place="margin">V.</note> as much as<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

Chap. 14. 26. is as much as, when or at what tyme soever, <hi>they deliver you;</hi> when soever <hi>one sayth, I am Pauls:</hi> whensoever <hi>yee come together.</hi> And to let passe all other scriptures, in the 6 of Mathew where Christ delivers this form, &amp; speaks of this, and the like matters, <hi>when thou givest thine almes,</hi> v: 2. <hi>when thou prayest,</hi> v: 5. <hi>when ye fast,</hi> v: 16. that is, whensoever <hi>thou givest almes, fastest, or prayest.</hi> Wherevpon it followeth necessarily, that, if Christ the Lord intended a set form of words, when he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his disciples to pray, and bad them, <hi>when ye pray, say,</hi> then, whensoever we pray, we must vse that very form of words, &amp; none other. For the words of Christ are not a <hi>permission,</hi> as the Ministers insinuate, but an absolute commaundement: neyther is the quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, as they vntruely lay it down, whether it be <hi>lawfull to vse these very words in prayer,</hi> but whether it be necessary, and that <hi>when,</hi> or whensoever <hi>we pray:</hi> for that which Christ intends, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: and what he commaunds, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maunds to be done, when, or whensoever, wee pray. And these things considered, it is no <hi>absurd obiection,</hi> (as these Ministers make it) that <hi>we never read the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles did use this prescript form of words in prayer.</hi> For reading of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny formes of prayer they vsed, and never of this, wee are assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that Christ did not stint them to this form of words, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund them when they prayed to vse them: for then they had sinned, when they prayed, and vsed them not.</p>

                  <hi>they fast, they should annoynt their head, and wash their face.</hi> Now who is so ignorant as to affirm, that Christs purpose here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is to bind them to these ceremonies? and why not as well, as to ty them to these very words? He sayth as well, <hi>when thou fastest, annoynt thine head, and wash thy face,</hi> as when thou prayest, say, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. yea touching prayer it self, he as well directs, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth his disciples what, or how to do, as what, or how to speak.
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:1037:237"/>
He sayth as well, <q>

               <p>Lastly, as wee are commaunded to pray <hi>the Lords prayer,</hi> (as it<note place="margin">VII.</note> is called) so are we to <hi>preach the word of God.</hi> But as if a man take<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Indeed in preaching we must ever make the scriptures our text, and groundwork, and must speak accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto them: and may take a verse, two, or more, &amp; vse them, even word for word, as they fit our occasion, and may be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our purpose: so in praying we must make this praescript e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (as it were) the text, and groundwork of our prayer, &amp; must pray according vnto it: and may vse a petition, two, or more, or all in, or of it, even word, for word, if so the holy Ghost (by whose immediate teachings, and suggestions all our requaests must be put vp) do direct vs, and that wee can apply the same words to our present occasions, and needs. The same which I have sayd touching the preaching of the word, may be added in respect of the administration of the sacraments.</p>
               <p>The Apostle writing to the Corinthians about the Lords sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, advertiseth them, that <note n="â€ " place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>he received of the Lord, that which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered vnto them.</hi> Now he that looks into the 3. Evangelists, that mention this institution, and compares eyther one of them with<note place="margin">Math. 27. 26. Mark. 14. 22. Luk 23. 19.</note> another, or Paul with any of them, he shall finde, that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance stands not at all in the prescript form of words, wherein they all differ ech from others. It is evident that the Lord admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred this supper but once: &amp; that in a certayn form of words.
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:1037:237"/>
And that which the Lord delivered vnto his disciples, these four pen-men of the Holy Ghost delivered to the Churches. Now the great liberty, which they vse in respect of forms of words<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they differ ech from others) shewes, how litle this institution<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and ordinance stands vpon such stints: as also how far it is from the meaning of Christ, that the Churches should be thus short ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the vse of them. The same may be sayd of the ordinance of prayer, by Christ given to his Church: wherein the two Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, that mention it, do vse the same liberty: as most likely would the other two also have done, in respect of forms of words, had they made mention of it.</p>
               <p>But graunt, that the words of Christ, <hi>pray after this manner, &amp; when you pray, say,</hi> are to be interpreted, as these men would have it, yet do I except agaynst their service-book in a double respect. The first is, that the reading of prayers vpon a book hath no justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from them. If it be sayd, that to commit a certayn form of words to the memory, and from it to vtter them, and to read the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> vpon a book, are all one, I deny the consequence: and though I approve not of the former, yet is the latter far the worse. For (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that he, that readeth, hath an other speaking to him (as it were) even he, whose wryting he reades, and himselfe speaks not to God, but to the people, to whom he reads) in the former, there is a kynde of vse, though not lawfull of the gift of memory: where in the other book-praying there is no vse of that, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gift.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it followes not, that bycause the Lord Iesus might impose a set forme of words to be vsed for prayer, that therefore the Lord Bbs of England may impose an other set form so to be vsed. The consequence is notably both erroneous, and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. So bold indeed are they, and so high do they advance themselves in their ordinances, and impositions. Bycause the Lord hath separated one day from the rest, and made it holy, therefore they wil also make other holy dayes: bycause Christ hath set down canons, and constitutions for the government of his Church, therefore they also will have their canons, and constitutions: bycause he hath appointed a form of administring the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts, therefore they may appoynt another form, yea and that such a
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:1037:238"/>
one as altereth, and inovateth the very nature of the words of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. For where Christ would have the words of institution published, and preached, <hi>this is my body which is given for you,</hi> they<note place="margin">Luke 22. 19. 1 Cor: 11. 24.</note> turn this preaching into a prayer, <hi>the body of our Lord Iesus Christ, was given for the, preserv thy body and soul into eternall life</hi> &amp;c. repeating the same also to every severall communicant: which Christ would have pronounced once for all, according to the nature of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. And thus they will <note n="â€ " place="margin">Ezech: 43. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>set their thresholds</hi> by the Lords <hi>thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shouldes,</hi> and <hi>their postes by his postes:</hi> and rather then they will want rowm for their own, they wil pare of part his, yea wholy dimolish them. If the Lord Iesus appoynt one ordinance for his Church, they will appoynt an other; and surely, so they may lawfully: if they be, as they are reputed, &amp; protend themselves, Lord Bishops, and Arch Bishops of the Church, and spirituall Lords, over Gods heritage.</p>
               <p>To these things I will adde a few reasons agaynst this read stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted service, and so conclude both the matter, and the book.</p>
               <p>And first it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>not be an ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce of Christ, bycause the Church<note place="margin">I.</note> may perfectly, and entyrely worship God, without it, with all the parts of holy and spirituall worship; as did the Apostolick Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for many years before any such leiturgy was devised, &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed: and as do many Churches now: and as appeares by that which is done before &amp; after sermons, where no such stint is read of, what may be done at all times, and in all places, where able &amp; lawfull ministers of the new testament, are.<note place="margin">II.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As the administrations of the publique prayers of the Church is a principall duty of the minister, for which a speciall gift and<note place="margin">Isa: 56. 7. Math: 21. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>3. Act. 6. 4</note> qualification is required, so cannot the reading of a service book be that administration, bycause no speciall, or ministeriall gift is required for it.<note place="margin">III.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The two feet vpon which the dumb ministery stands, like <hi>Nae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchad-nezzars Image vpon the feet of iron, and clay,</hi> are the book of<note place="margin">Dan: 2.</note> common prayer, and of homilyes: the reading of the former (which is the right foot) serving them for prayer, &amp; of the other for preaching: which feet, if they were smitten as were the other, <hi>with the stone cut without hands,</hi> the whole Idol-preisthood would fall, and be broken a peices, as that other image was. And here I
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:1037:238"/>
would intreat them, that have written, and are perswaded so much agaynst the reading of the Apocrypha books of the <hi>Machabies,</hi> &amp; those which follow them, in the congregation, especially them, which have so sufficiently dealt against <hi>Mr Hutton,</hi> &amp; his fellowes, to turn the face of their Arguments generall agaynst the Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall service book; and they will silence that book, as well, and as much, as the rest (like <hi>women in the Church</hi>) as they speak.</p>
               <p>As it were a ridiculous thing for a child, when he would aske<note place="margin">IIII.</note> of his father <hi>bread, fish,</hi> or any other thing he wanted, to read it to him out of a paper: so is it for the children of God (especially for the ministers of the gospell in their publique ministrations) to read vnto God their requests, for their own, and the Churches wants, out of a service book, wherin they are also stinted to words and sillables: by which also they, and the people with them, are<note place="margin">Ezech: 4. 16.</note> vnder a greater death, then if they <hi>ate bread by weight, &amp; drank water by measure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly if this vse of the service-book be sanctified of God for the publique, and solemn prayers of the Church, &amp; so deemed by these ministers, and others the forward people in the kingdom, what is the reason why they so seldom, yea or rather never, vse the same, or any other of the like nature in their familyes, but do on the contrary lay aside all books save that of the spirit, by whose alone, and immediate direction they are taught, and according to whose suggestio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s, they do put vp their supplicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s vnto God? Do we not all know, that the more forward sort of proffessours would be ashamed of any such book prayers in their families. And hath the Lord sanctified that for his house which is not holy, and good enough for their houses? will they worship God with that worship publiquely, whereof they are ashamed privately? can private men bring forth the conceptions of the spirit without the help of any such service book, and do the lawfull ministers of the gospell stand in need of it for the manifestatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of the spirit of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er given them, for the vse, and comfort of the Church? <note n="*" place="margin">Mal: 1. 14.</note>
