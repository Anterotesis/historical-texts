            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS
UPON
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> MORE's
APOLOGIE
FOR
His Mysterie of GODLINESS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y chief purpose being to shew the Invalidity of
the D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Apologie</hi> touching the Ten Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
made against his Mysterie; I shall trouble
the Reader only with some few brief Notes
upon what the Luxuriant Author hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
before his particular Answers to those Objections.</p>
            <p>First then, in his Preface to his Reader, he saies <q>[No in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
person will think the Repute of the Proposers any
thing diminished by this just, but necessary Recovery of mine
own: though I have so fully cleared the Objections, and
that out of the very Treatise they are raised. For the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Parts and Judgement of the Proposers are so confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
eminent to all that know them, that nothing but
want of leisure of reading my whole Treatise, and comparing
one place with another, could have put them in a capacity
of mis-understanding those passages they have objected.]</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here he confidently pretends to have cleared all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections;
and kindly speaks a good word to save the Objectors
credit. His Confidence concerning his Performance, will
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57586:3"/>
soon appear ridiculous enough; and his Courtesie to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors,
no less insolent. For before he has fairly acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he falls to apologize for them: and whats that Apologie,
but under pretence of Courtesie, to brand them for busie
medlers, in taxing an innocent Author before they have duely
considered his book? But by this trick he would at once slily
evade the whole Business, and make his Reader believe, that
the Question in controversie is, what is the Result of his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
upon <hi>Comparing</hi> the several Parts of his Book one with
another. Whereas the Objector only challengeth him for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
false Doctrines in the places cited in the Objections.
If he has different Doctrines in other places, let him answer
for enterfering with himself. In the mean while, the Objector
knew not which of such repugnant Doctrines Dr. <hi>More</hi> did
in his heart allow: but this he knew, that false Doctrines
broached in any part of his Book, were truly scandalous, and
deserved to be Objected against. However, I make no great
doubt, but the Doctor will finde by this following Assertion
of the Objections, That the Proposer of them had both <hi>leisure
to read his whole Treatise, and to compare one place with another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for his Intimation [by which he vainly affects to make
his Apologies Conquest the greater] That the Objectors
were many, and eminent for Parts, Learning and Judgement:
in both those Particulars he abuses his Reader, for the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were drawn up and framed by one Person, not by divers,
and that one [I can assure him] very far from eminence in
Learning, Parts, or Judgement: yet as mean as he is, he
hopes to make it appear that the Doctor doth nothing less
then <hi>Clear those Objections</hi> by this Apologie.</p>
            <p>But did he in earnest account his supposed Objectors, to be
Eminent for Learning, Parts and Judgement? how then
could he think, that Men eminently learned and judicious,
could have charged him with writing Doctrines seditious, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
and heretical, in the Book wherein [as he vaunts in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57586:3"/>
this Preface] <hi>there is nothing but sound and true?</hi> for, his excuse
he makes for them, will neither serve his turn, nor theirs;
seeing Men <hi>confessedly eminent for Learning, Parts and Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
cannot be supposed to pass such a Censure, before they
had <hi>fully read,</hi> and particularly <hi>Compared</hi> the parts of his
Book.</p>
            <p>He adds <q>[Wherefore Reader, whilst thou perusest the
ten ensuing Objections with my Answers thereto, thou art
not to phansie thy self a spectator of a Battel betwixt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Enemies, but of an amicable Concertation betwixt
such as are real friends, as well one to another as for Truth
her self: They of the one part shewing nothing but a due
zeal and commendable jealousie touching the Doctrines in
my <hi>Mystery</hi> of <hi>Godliness,</hi> that it may appear to all that
there are none other there delivered but such as are sound and
true; and my self on the other part as diligently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating
that I have committed no errour in what I have
written, and that the places objected against, have nothing
in them contrary to Scripture, Reason, or the acknowledged
Faith of the Catholick Church.]</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Objector is indeed no professed enemy to Dr. <hi>More;</hi>
but to his gross and dangerous errours, he is as hearty an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
as the Dr. can imagine: and accordingly he was well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that a friend should privately acquaint him with the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
and christianly admonish him to retract, and satisfie
the University [where his Book was conceived to have done
the most mischief] by renouncing his erroneous Doctrines;
which might have been done in a few ingenuous words: and
more then so, would not have been required. But the Dr.
would needs draw these private Objections to the publick
stage; and here in his very entrance you see how he struts,
quite forgetting humane frailty and common modesty. What
he has got by it may appear in these ensuing Observations.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Concertation</hi> which he proposes to his Reader betwixt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57586:4"/>
the Objectors and himself, is wonderous pretty: namely that
they on the one part zealously indeavour to make it appear,
that he has deliver'd no Doctrines but <hi>such as are sound and
true:</hi> and that he on the other part, diligently demonstrates
that <hi>he has committed no errour in what he has written:</hi> that
is, Both he and they are doing one and the same thing, and
proving Dr. <hi>More</hi> to be perfectly Orthodox. Does not this
look like a conflict betwixt two Parties? yet for such, his
Reader must account it, and withall he must be content to
swallow it for true, that the Objectors zeal aimed at no other
end then what the Doctor here assignes. But I (who best knew
my own intent) can assure him of the contrary: for being
clearly satisfied that the Doctors book swarm'd with dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
errours; my Zeal was kindled to object against it; and I
doubt not but he will find by what follows, that I never meant
(whatsoever he is pleased to tell his Reader) to endeavour the
proving that there are no Doctrines in his Book but sound
and true.</p>
            <p>Yet in his jolly conclusion of his Preface, he tells us, that
the Result of this Collision is <hi>A farther recommendation to the
World of the Usefulness of the above said Treatise:</hi> so resolvedly
fond is he of that Book; though as to a considerable part of it,
the onely usefulness that any sober Reader can discover, is
such as S. <hi>Paul</hi> intimates, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 19. There must be Heresies
among you, that they which are approved, may be made manifest
among you.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Upon CHAP. I. and II.</head>
               <p>IN his first Chapter he propounds certain Rules, by which
he would have us believe that he govern'd himself in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of the Truth of our Religion: though it be hugely
suspicious, that those Rules were not minted till he hammerd
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57586:4"/>
this Apologie. However, I wonder the less at his wilde way
of Writing, if he be so unlucky in his very Rules of Direction
concerning it, as I find him in his first, which is this:
<q>[1. He must be sure not to deny any thing which he whom
he would convince, doth hold and alledge upon clear and
solid Reasons: 2. And especially he must be tender of
denying it as repugnant to the Christiam Faith; 3. Unless
it be plainly and really contrary to the infallible Oracles of
holy Writ.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here he supposeth, That a Man may have <hi>clear and Solid
Reason</hi> for what he holds; and yet that his Tenet may be
<hi>plainly and really contrary to the infallible Oracles of holy
Writ.</hi> The Scripture then may be contrary to Reason which
is <hi>clear and solid:</hi> And if so; the Doctor can have small
hopes of prevailing upon his <hi>Men of a rational genius,</hi> unless
he grants them, that Scripture is not Infallible. Yet he adds,
in his assertory Exposition of this Rule, That <q>[such Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
as is really repugnant to the Oracles of Divine Writ,
is not true Reason; nor those Interpretations of Scripture
true, that are thus repugnant to Reason.]</q> And whats this,
but Contradiction? <hi>viz.</hi> Clear and Solid Reason may be
plainly and really contrary to Scriptures; and yet, That Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that is truely repugnant to Scripture, is not true Reason.
Why also, may not those Interpretations of Scripture be
True, which are repugnant to True Reason, if clear and
solid [that is, true] Reason may be plainly and really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the infallible Oracles of holy Writ?</p>
               <p>In the sixt Section, he affirms it to be <hi>demonstrable,</hi> out
of <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 6. That the Firmament reaches but to the <hi>upper
Waters, that is, the Clouds:</hi> and that because the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was made in the midst of the Waters to divide them.
I am so well acquainted with the Doctors Logick, that I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
suspect his Discourse to be impertinent, where he talks
loudest of Demonstration. How can he Demonstrate, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57586:5"/>
by the <hi>upper Waters,</hi> is meant <hi>the Clouds?</hi> Is't not more
likely to be Demonstrable, That as yet [namely on the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
day] there were no Clouds, the Sun being not then cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated?
Nay is it not said <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 5. that there was then no
Rain, but a Mist ascended from the Earth to water it? had
there been Clouds on the second Day, what needed this Mist
[be it what it will] afterwards to rise out of the Earth and
perform the Office of Rain in watering the ground?</p>
               <p>In the same Section, he defines the object of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
Story in <hi>Genesis,</hi> to be, not <hi>Mundus Philosophorum,</hi>
but <hi>Plebeiorum;</hi> only suted to the <hi>sense and imagination of
the ruder People.</hi> I make bold therefore to ask this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Philosopher, Whether it be sutable to the sense or
Imagination of the ruder People, that Fowles, as well as
Fish, should be the Offspring of the water, <hi>V.</hi> 20. especially
seeing many Fowls cannot live either in the water, or upon it?
Also, That Day should be created with Evening and Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>V.</hi> 5. and that there should be three such days before
the Sun was made <hi>to divide the day from the night,</hi> Ver. 14,
15, 16? yet these Narrations are part of that Story. But
who knows not Dr. <hi>More?</hi> and that this Fancy serves but to
countenance his Cabbalistick Imaginations touching the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation?</p>
               <p>And yet, what if the ancient Masters of the <hi>Iews</hi> were of
a quite contrary Opinion concerning this story; and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it written, not for silly Plebeians to read, but for men of
acute and mature judgement? will their Authority bear no
sway with the Doctor? That they so accounted, sure I am,
S. <hi>Ierome</hi> [in the Proem to his Commentaries upon <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi>]
doth abundantly witness: his words are [<hi>Aggrediar</hi>
Ezechielem <hi>Prophetam, cujus Difficultatem, Hebraeorum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat

interpose between the Sun and us; whether he beleeves not
that the Sun is above the Clouds? If he beleeves this, (and

               <p>His second Chapter, is an Account concerning his bringing
<hi>Pre-existence</hi> into play in this Age. As also, a Vindication
of <hi>a certain Passage</hi> (for he would have the Reader think there
was but One, though indeed there were divers) in his Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bala
from the suspicion of <hi>Anthropomorphitisme;</hi> as he calls it.
Now though Objections were ready framed concerning these
Points also; yet they not hapning to be any of those Ten
which were delivered to him out of my List: I shall at present
forbear to examine this part of his Defence, and the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it; and choose rather to hasten to those Ten which are
the chief subject of his Apologie, and with which he begins his
third Chapter.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>THese Objections (says he) were sent me from an able
hand, digested into that Number, Order and
Words, which I shall set them down in. They are
in number Ten, and all taken out of my <hi>Mystery of
Godliness.</hi>]</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:57586:7"/>
To profess that 'twas <hi>an able Hand</hi> that sent them: is no
more than he had signified in his Preface; but he must needs
be at it again: partly for the magnifying of his own Victory
aforehand; and partly, under pretence of commending his
Antagonist, to expose him (as he hopes) to the greater scorn.
For, if all be true which he alledges in his following Apologie,
the Objector can never escape being accounted the most piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Fellow that ever perused a Book. 'Tis fit therefore, that
this be referred to the Readers judgment between us.</p>
               <p>His solemn saying, <hi>They are in Number Ten;</hi> is to those
who know the story, sufficiently ridiculous; for these Ten
were not sent him as the whole Number, but onely as a part or
specimen of the Objections. Many Tens were then in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
collected out of his <hi>Mystery of Godliness:</hi> but 'twas
thought fit by a few, and those hapned to be Ten, to try
what he meant to do; it being friendly signified to him by
that Person who delivered them, that many other Particulars
were prepared to be Objected. And indeed had I foreseen
that Dr. <hi>More</hi> would presently hasten to Print those Ten, I
should have drawn them up in form more suitable for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
View, and have pressed them something closer than I
have done. Yet let him enjoy that advantage; as they are,
it will appear that I had just ground for the Objections; and
he none at all for his confidently pretended Justification. Thus
much is evident already, that the Doctor would have the world
imagine, that these Ten were all that could be picked out
of his whole Book. He will finde it much otherwise when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
serves.</p>
               <p>The first Objection he sets down thus: [<hi>L. 5. C. 3. Sect.</hi> 1.
He says, <q>It cannot be conceived, but that Christs Body
assimilated it self to the Regions through which it passed in
his Ascension, and became at last perfectly Celestial and
Aetherial, Organized Light, not Flesh and Bones.</q>
                  <hi>C. 4. Sect.</hi> 1.]</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:57586:8"/>
In Answer to this, he says, <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <q>[If the Objector
understand <hi>Terrestrial flesh and bones;</hi> is it a fault to deny
it?]</q> The question here ought to have been, What
Dr. <hi>More,</hi> not what the Objector means by <hi>flesh and bones?</hi>
The Objector knows there are Bodies Terrestrial, and Bodies
Celestial: but he denys that Christs Body, though now
Celestial, consists not of true flesh and bones. He denies
that it is now turned to <hi>Organized Light.</hi> But the Doctor
will needs be proving what was not denyed, namely, That
Glorified Bodies cannot be Terrestrial Flesh and Bones. And
thus he argues, in relation to his Philosophers, for whom
he mightily pretends to fish.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>[How harsh will it seem to them that are for the Prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maick
Hypothesis, that a Body of Terrestrial Flesh and
Bones should bore its way through the sphears more hard
than Crystal, for many myriads of miles together, till at
last it may ascend above all Heavens, and sit at the right
Hand of God? And for them that are <hi>Copernicans</hi> or <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesians,</hi>
and hold the Heavens all of them of a fluid sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
substance, how incongruous must it needs seem to them
also, that an <hi>heavy Terrestrial</hi> Body of Flesh and Bones
should inhabit and live in so subtile and piercing an Element,
whenas the Air upon the top of some Mountains is too
thin for our Lungs, and that the purer Heavens are so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
that they would nimbly take apieces and consume to
Atoms any such Terrestrial consistency of Flesh and Blood
as is here spoke of? To say nothing of the incongruity of
so earthy and heavy a Body, having no proportionable
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to walk upon.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Is not this very goodly Argumentation, especially in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
of Theologie? Could Dr. <hi>More</hi> forget, that both the
Resurrection, and Ascension and residence of Bodies in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
are not atchieved by any natural ways or means, but
solely by the supernatural Power of God? Let the Heavens
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57586:8"/>
then be solid or fluid, this can be no barr or hinderance to
what God is pleased to effect. Nor can his Philosopher,
whether Ptolomaick or Copernican, count it <hi>Harsh,</hi> unless he
thinks it rational to question Gods Omnipotencie. Which if
he doth, the Doctor may fish long enough before he will catch
him into the Belief of any of these Points.</p>
               <p>But by the way: Is the Doctor sure that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> did ever
assert the sphears to <hi>be more hard than Chrystal?</hi> Or must
<hi>Copernicus</hi> or <hi>Cartesius</hi> be counted the Fathers of the Opinion
concerning the <hi>fluidity of the Heavens;</hi> which was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
not onely before <hi>Cartesius,</hi> but before <hi>Copernicus</hi> was
born? Again, How came the Doctor so well acquainted
with the fierceness of the subtile Heavens, as to affirm that
it will so nimbly take apieces and consume to Atoms a Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial
Body; since St. <hi>Paul</hi> knew not whether 'twere in the
Body or out of the Body, that he was rap'd into the third
Heavens? which by the Doctors Philosophy he might have
known: for had he been rap'd in the Body, his Body must
have been turned to Atoms. Lastly, If Christ living here
in his Terrestrial Body, found the Water a proportional
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, why might he not by the same divine Power finde the
liquid Heavens a proportional <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> also?</p>
               <p>This third Section he concludes thus: <q>[I thought fit,
according to my first Rule, not needlesly to deny any thing
rationally solid in my Antagonist, but to grant that the
Body of Christ in Heaven is not Terrestrial Flesh and Bones,
but of a more refined nature. For the Apostle saith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
1 <hi>Cor. 15. That Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the
Kingdom of God.</hi>]</q> And what's all this to the Objection?
Doth that charge him with saying, That Christs Body now
in Heaven is <hi>Terrestrial Flesh and Bones?</hi> No, but that he
says, 'Tis <hi>not Flesh and Bones,</hi> but <hi>Organized Light.</hi> He
might have dealt with his Antagonist according to the Rule
he talks of, though he had not denyed Christs Body to be still
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57586:9"/>
Flesh and Bones, or affirmed it to be Organized Light.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, those words of his are slye, (the Body of
Christ in Heaven is not Terrestrial Flesh and Bones, but of
a more refined nature.) Why saith he not (but Celestial
Flesh and Bones?) Even because he would not retract his
Errour charged in the Objection: So that I cannot believe he
means any thing else by (<hi>a more refined nature)</hi> than <hi>Organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
Light.</hi> Hereupon he concludes with that of the Apostle:
<hi>Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But had he added the next words, which are part of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
sentence, (<hi>Neither doth corruption inherit incorruption)</hi> he
had betrayed how little S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> favours his design. For by Gods
Power the Terrestrial Body shall of <hi>corruptible</hi> be made <hi>incorru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible,</hi>
and then it may inherit the Kingdom of God. For corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible
flesh and blood cannot inherit, (and such is our flesh and
blood before the Resurrection) there being no proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Corruption and Incorruption: But (as he adds <hi>V.</hi> 53.) this
Corruptible must put on Incorruption, and this Mortal must put
on Immortality. Whence 'tis evident, by the Apostles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
that the same Flesh and Blood which before was Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible,
and at the Resurrection, or final Change, is made Incorru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible,
shall reside in Heaven. For he says not, This Corruptible
shall vanish, or perish; but, It shall put on Incorruption: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
therefore still it must. So that the Doctor needed not
to have amused his Reader with a tedious Discourse (as he
doth in the following part of this Chapter) to prove, That
Glorified Bodies are <hi>Angelical, Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Celestial;</hi> for
still they may nevertheless be the same Flesh and Bones they
were here in this life, though never so much Refined, Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talized,
and Beautified by the Power of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. <q>[Christ argues thus, <hi>Luk. 20. 36. They cannot
dye, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> for they are equal to the Angels,</hi> which
would be scarce an Illustration, much less a Proof and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Illation, unless it be understood in the sense I above
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57586:9"/>
intimated. For it would be but a Languid kinde of reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and of small satisfaction, to conclude the <hi>sons of the
Resurrection</hi> immortal, because they are immortal, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
are immortal; that looks like the proving <hi>idem per idem.</hi>
And yet this would be all, if they were equal to the Angels
onely in that thing.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Be it granted, that Christ compares not the sons of the
Resurrection to Angels, onely in respect of Immortality;
for the comparison stands also in perpetual celibate; which
alone is mentioned S. <hi>Matt.</hi> 22. 30. Yet still, by this acute
Doctors leave, 'tis no languid Reasoning, nor looks it like
the proving <hi>idem per idem,</hi> to argue that the sons of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
<hi>cannot die,</hi> that is, are Immortal, by asserting them
to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; for seeing Angels are Immortal: These also
must needs be Immortal, who in reference to their Duration
(for the text in S. <hi>Luke,</hi> which the Doctor hath chosen, instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in this, as well as in celibate) are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Christ argues not
that they are therefore Immortal, <hi>because they are Immortal as
Angels are Immortal</hi> (this is the Doctors saucy and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
detortion of our Lords Argument,) but, that they are
Immortal because they are exalted to that condition of life
which Angels enjoy; and which doubtless is Immortal. To
say, that such a thing cannot sink, for 'tis just like a cork; such
a thing cannot rot, for 'tis equal to an Adamant: would be
no <hi>languid reasoning,</hi> nor <hi>proving idem per idem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which the Doctor drives at in this 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> section is to
prove that humane Bodies after the resurrection shall become
equal to the Bodies of Angels: and he saies expresly <q>[Nor
can the condition of their Bodies be left out, as touching the
<hi>nature</hi> and glory of them, but a Son of the Resurrection and
an Angel must be in every such regard all one.]</q> Now if it
be granted him that mens bodies shall become of the same
<hi>Nature</hi> with those of Angels, he presumes that they cannot
be flesh and bones. But first I must ask him who talks so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57586:10"/>
of Angels Bodies, where he findes in Scripture that
they have any proper and natural bodies of their own: that
they assume bodies in which they appear to Men, and that
their actions or offices are represented to us by corporal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions;
is in condescent to our weakness, whose apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
depend so much upon sense. But if this would prove
Angels to be naturally clothed with Bodies; the like may be
concluded of God himself, to whom scripture (in compliance
with our Infirmity) attributes corporeal parts. Again, if the
Doctor will fix upon the Bodies of Angels, mentioned in
Scripture, upon the account I have intimated: he may do well to
remember that in those descriptions Angels are generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
with wings; and some of them with 4. some with
6. wings apiece; That <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> ch. 10. affirms, that the living
Creatures which he saw by the river of <hi>Chebar,</hi> were Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims;
which Cherubims had the soles of their feet like those
of Calves, their hands under their wings like those of a Man;
and for their faces, each of them had 4. one of a Man, one of
a Lyon, one of an Ox, one of an Eagle. Now to which of
the Angels will the Doctor have the sons of the Resurrection
be like? to those who wear one pair of wings; or, to those
who wear two; or, to those who have quadruple faces? But
if he fancies for the Angels any other shapes, or vehicles, then
what he findes mentioned in Scripture: why must we believe
that he does not dote? or what reason have we to build any
thing upon his Imagination of matters so far above his reach?</p>
               <p>But all this while he forces the Text in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
which is plainly restrained in the Evangelists, to celibate and
Immortality. Nor does the word it self require the sense he
pins upon it; for men in heaven may be <hi>Equal to the Angels,</hi>
though not in all respects: and we know that Christ is Equal
to the Father touching his Godhead; yet inferiour to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
touching his Manhood: that when the labourers S. <hi>Matt.</hi>
20. 12. tell their Master (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, thou hast made
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57586:10"/>
them <hi>equal</hi> to us) they meant no more then Equal in Wages.
Besides; if (as the Doctor affirms) the <hi>nature</hi> of humane
bodies in heaven must be <hi>all one</hi> with that of Angels; it will be
hard for him to shew that he leaves any distinction between
Angels and Men hereafter. Nay it will follow, that, though
Christ at his Incarnation took not on him the Nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
but the seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> yet that distinction is now out
of date, and instead of the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> he is joyn'd to the
race of Angels, wearing no longer the body derived from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
but one of the same nature with those of the Angels:
Which seems to me a new Transubstantiation, and (for ought
I have yet heard) first minted by Dr. <hi>Henry More.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet (after much needless talk about the <hi>Lucidity</hi> and
<hi>Angelicalness</hi> of Christs glorified Body) in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Section,
he seems in good part to have forgot what he wrote in the
4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> for he saies <q>[<hi>Calvin</hi> seems to be afraid of the Opinion
of the Body being spiritual, as imploying a substantial change,
or, as the schools speak, a specifical one: which would
most certainly clash with our Saviours having the same Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
Body he suffer'd in. But according to the truth of
Philosophy, there is no <hi>specifical</hi> change in the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Modifications of Matter imaginable, but <hi>onely Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And what then means all this long stir, about <hi>Terrestrial
flesh and bones?</hi> If the change be not <hi>specifical;</hi> then the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of humane Bodies is not changed to the Nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick
Bodies: And if the change be <hi>onely accidental,</hi> then the
glorified Bodies of Men in Heaven, are, and must be the very
same Flesh and Bones they were on earth, onely enriched with
nobler Accidents: then is Christs Body the same Flesh
and Bones which it was in this life. Indeed the Doctor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<hi>Sect.</hi> 8. grants (upon what ground, let himself look)
that <hi>The Body which is now truely Earthy may, if God will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
in a moment as perfectly and physically Heavenly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57586:11"/>
still the same Numerical Body.</hi> If it so <hi>remain,</hi> it must
remain Flesh and Bones, and the same Flesh and Bones, it
was before.</p>
               <p>One would now expect, that what he hath here granted,
should perswade him to acknowledge his rashness in saying (as
was objected) Christs Body in heaven to be <hi>Organized Light
not Flesh and Bones.</hi> Yet <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. where he comes to solve (as
he saies) the Objection, his words are <q>[What harshness is
there to call that Body <hi>Light, that is to say, a Luminous or
Lucid Body;</hi> which for its brightness exceeds the Sun it self,
according to testimony of holy Writ? Or what <hi>Incongruity</hi>
to say it is <hi>Organized,</hi> it being so according to the common
consent of the whole Church, and the meaning of the
Scripture?]</q>
               </p>
               <p>You see the Doctor will needs maintain, that 'twas not <hi>Harsh</hi>
to call Christs Body <hi>Light; that is to say, a Lucid or Luminous
Body.</hi> So that in his Dictionary, <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Lucid</hi> or <hi>Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Body,</hi> are one and the same thing; and they must signifie
accordingly in an high Point of Religion, rather then he
should seem to have spoken so much as <hi>Harshly.</hi> Christs Body
is granted to be Lucid and Splendid: but it is not therefore
Light, or splendor. Dr. <hi>More</hi> is philosophical: but no man
(especially if he reads this passage) will yield that he is Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
it self. Yet admit it were not Harsh meerly to call Christs
Body, Light: that's not the case here: for the Doctor not
onely calls it <hi>Organized Light;</hi> but affirms also that it is <hi>not
flesh and Bones.</hi> Which in effect, is to affirm, that instead of
Flesh and Bones, it is now nothing else but <hi>Organized Light.</hi>
And whether this sounds not <hi>Harsh,</hi> let Christian Ears judge.</p>
               <p>To say, That Christs Body is <hi>Organized,</hi> is indeed, as the
Doctor pleads, <hi>no Incongruity</hi> at all. But with fine Legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
he would make his Reader think that this was part of
the Question. Wherefore he very gravely vouches it by the
<hi>Common consent of the whole Church,</hi> and by the <hi>Meaning of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57586:11"/>
Scriptures.</hi> Whereas the Question is, whether if Christs Body
be <hi>Light,</hi> it can be <hi>Organized?</hi> for Light is a similary thing;
but an <hi>Organized Body</hi> must consist of parts Dissimilary: nor
can the Doctor with all his cunning, make out (though he
attempts it afterward in this Chapter) how Christs Body can
consist of Flesh and Bones, with other corporeal Ingredients,
and be furnished with humane Organs; if his whole Bodies
mass be <hi>Light.</hi> Luminous and splendid it is: but that this
Brightness swallows up the proper distinctions of his Parts and
Members which he had here on Earth; and Organizes him
anew in Heaven; this I deny.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> his Bush, when all of a flame, continued the same Bush
with all its several branches and twigs. When <hi>Moses</hi> his own
face shined, it was not become <hi>Light,</hi> but onely <hi>Lucid;</hi> still
the distinct parts of it remained as really and truly the same as
before. In Christs Transfiguration on the Mount, <hi>his face did
shine as the Sun, and his Rayment was white as the Light;</hi>
S. <hi>Matt.</hi> 17. 2 But still it was his face, both of the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and Organized in the same manner as before; though
it so shined as not before. For if it were turned to Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
Light, was not his Rayment turned to Light also? and
will the Doctor venture to say that this Rayment was not at
that time, of the very same substance and matter, and of the
very same distinct parts it was of before? But in short, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of Christs glorified Body taken out of Apoc. 1. 13.
(which the Doctor cites as for his own purpose Sect. 6.) men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth
his Head and Hair to be white as wooll or snow; his
Eyes as a flame of fire; his Feet as burning brass; his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
as the sun shining in his strength. What mean these
several Comparisons of divers parts of his Body to such seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things, if all his Body had been nothing but Light? Wooll,
Snow, yea and burning Brass, are far short of the Sun shining
in his strength: but, supposing all his Body to be Light, his
Head, Hair and Feet must have shined like the meridian Sun,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57586:12"/>
no less then his Countenance. However, the Doctor cannot
deny but here remained Christs Head, Face, Feet, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
his other Parts, wherefore all these, in Him who was
then also truly Man, must needs be of humane substance Flesh
and Bones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. Upon a fancy of his own he thus proceeds: <q>[It
never came into my minde to imagine that his Body melted
into mere Air; but that it being terrestrially modified and
organized, kept the exact shape still and feature, but that
all cloggings of the terrestrial modification were quel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and abolished.]</q> The Objection was, that he made Christs
Body, <hi>Organized Light,</hi> as that is opposed to Flesh and Bones
and being now well warm in his Apologie touching this Point,
he professes that he did not make it <hi>mere Air.</hi> Is not this
mightily pertinent! Yet indeed I must confess that he who
puts <hi>Organized Light,</hi> for a <hi>Luminous Organized Substance;</hi>
may as well be allowed to put <hi>mere Air,</hi> for <hi>pure Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. touching his having denyed Christs Body to
be Flesh and Bones, he thus apologizes (Where I oppose a
Body of Flesh and Bones, to that lucid Body of our Saviour,
I understand <hi>Natural</hi> flesh and bones, not <hi>Glorified:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I doe not deny that there is <hi>Glorified flesh and bones</hi> in this
illustrious Body of Christ) Thus (he saies) he understands
now: But did he so when he wrote his Mystery? If he did:
ought he not to have expressed that this was his sense? espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
seeing his Words on which the Objection is founded,
carry a sense quite contrary? Might he not here with more
credit, have acknowledged Rashness, or Indiscretion, in that
expression touching <hi>Organized Light, not flesh and bones?</hi> But
notwithstanding this Interpretation of himself, the truth
is, he is far enough from a just defence of what he wrote in his
Mystery: for though he would now seem to grant Christs
Body to be <hi>glorified flesh and bones;</hi> yet this proves not that
Body to be <hi>Organized Light:</hi> and if he will needs stick still (as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57586:12"/>
he does) to that phrase of <hi>Organized Light;</hi> he destroys what
he grants: for that which is <hi>Light,</hi> cannot be <hi>flesh and bones.</hi>
Besides, how little the Doctor gets by his distinction of <hi>Natural</hi>
flesh and bones, and <hi>Glorified</hi> flesh and bones, in this case;
does readily appear: seeing <hi>not flesh and bones,</hi> and <hi>Glorified
flesh and bones,</hi> are still a contradiction after all is said.</p>
               <p>Indeed, in his very next words he plainly discredits (so fickle
is his judgement) what just before he pretended to profess;
for he adds <q>[I demand by what <hi>Creed</hi> that hath the assent of
the Universal Church, we are <hi>required to believe</hi> that the
glorified Body of Christ consists of Flesh Blood and Bones,
it seeming at the first sight so contradictious to the express
words of the Apostle, as well as unsutable to the nature of
the Heavens, which Philosophers now a days conclude to be
universaly <hi>Fluid:</hi> and if they were not, the Incongruity would
seem to them still more harsh, as I noted at first? Here the
Objector is silent.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>That the Creeds are the Comprehensions of the Points of
Faith to be believed, and not the Laws or Canons which <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
us to believe;</hi> is known even to the <hi>Mundus Plebeiorum:</hi>
though the Doctor here supposes otherwise: but I urge not
this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. What thinks he of the Apostles Creed? hath
not that the assent of the Catholick Church? There 'tis said,
that he whas <hi>Born of the Virgin Mary,</hi> (and born, surely with
flesh, blood and bones) that he was <hi>Crucified dead and buried,
and rose again:</hi> nor will the Doctor deny but he rose with
the same flesh, blood and bones: but He that rose, <hi>Ascended
into Heaven:</hi> He that ascended into Heaven, <hi>sitteth on the
right hand of God:</hi> There therefore (according to the Creed)
He sitteth with Flesh Blood and Bones; else he that sitteth
there, is not the same who was Born, Crucified, Buried, Rose
again, and Ascended. It follows then, in the plain and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
sense of the Creed, that the glorified Body of Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
of Flesh Blood and Bones. And let the Doctor when he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57586:13"/>
hath better consider'd it, tell me whether he will grant, or can
deny this. I need not add, that both the Nicene and Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasian
Creeds exactly follow that of the Apostles in these
particulars. Nor did I make account it was any ways requisite
for me to signifie thus much in the Objection; or that the
Doctor would ever have propounded any such Demand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Creeds: Which makes me something wonder at
his triumphant conclusion <hi>(Here the Objector is silent.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Christs glorified Body consists of Flesh, Blood and
Bones, seems (saies the Doctor) at first fight <hi>contradictious to
the express words of the Apostle.</hi> He must here mean the words
he cited sect. 4. namely (flesh and blood cannot inherit the
kingdom of God) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 5 c. But if he takes in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words (neither doth Corruption inherit Incorruption)
and those ver. 53. (this Corruptible must put on Incorruption,
and this Mortal must put on Immortality) it will be so far from
seeming Contradictious to the Apostles Doctrine, that it will
appear to be by that very Doctrine clearly confirmed. As for
his other pretence, that it seems <hi>unsutable to the nature of the
heavens:</hi> I have noted the Vanity of it already, in the former
part of this chapter.</p>
               <p>Immediately after his crowing over the Objectors silence, he
thus proceeds: <q>[Nor can I well divine where the stress of
this opposition will be fixed, unless upon the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of
our English Church, which yet he (viz. the Objector) hath
prudently declined, as of doubtfull Interpretation.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Doctor is mistaken: I declined not the Article at all
(much less as judging it to be of doubtfull interpretation) no
more then I declined the Creeds, though I urged them not
in the Objection. But that Dr. <hi>More</hi> can make any thing
(though never so clear) to be of doubtfull Interpretation, if
he may but be the authorized Interpreter, will appear by the
Colours he puts upon this Article: which runs thus:</p>
               <p>Christ did truly Rise again from death, and took again
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57586:13"/>
his Body, with flesh and bones, and all things appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the perfection of Mans Nature <hi>wherewith he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
into heaven,</hi> and there sitteth untill he return
to judge all men at the last day.</p>
               <p>And the Doctors descant upon it, is this, sect. 14. <q>[That
this Article may make any thing for the inferring or affirming
that the Glorified Body of Christ hath flesh blood and bones,
it must imply that Christ from his first Ascension into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to the last day, doth sit there with a Body of flesh and
bones. But this is but <hi>one sense</hi> of the Article: for it may
<hi>onely signifie</hi> that, &amp;c.]</q> I cannot but note here by the way,
the wildness and repugnancy of this Doctors discourse. He
grants the premised sense to be <hi>one sense</hi> of the Article; and
yet immediately adds, that the Article <hi>may onely signifie</hi> what
he is now about to tell us. If it <hi>may onely signifie</hi> this; how is
the premised Interpretation <hi>one sense</hi> of it? But he proceeds;
<q>[For it may onely signifie, that Christ did indeed, as is most
certain, take again his Body with flesh and bones, as appears
in that experiment of <hi>Thomas,</hi> and that he did Ascend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
into Heaven: But the Article doth not say that <hi>He doth
sit therewith,</hi> that is, with a Body of flesh and bones, untill he
return to judge all men at the last day. And if it do not say
this, it does not gainsay but that the Body of Christ which
shone so radiantly about S. <hi>Paul</hi> when he went to <hi>Damascus,</hi>
had neither flesh nor bones <hi>properly so called.</hi> Wherefore
the sense of the Article not determined by any Authority,
leaves us <hi>free in this point:</hi> nor do I think that the Penmen
thereof, observing how cautious and considerate they are in
that Restriction of (all things that appertain to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Mans Nature) did ever intend that the Belief of
flesh and bones in the now glorified Body of Christ, should
be an essential part of this Article. Nor does Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi>
number it in the Propositions which he lays out as comprised
in the same.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:57586:14"/>
These last words concerning Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> are so extravagant
and impertinent, as nothing can be more, for who ever believed
Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> his Analyse of the Church Articles, to be authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
or owned by the Church? Besides, will Dr. <hi>More</hi> himself
own and profess all that Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> delivers in his exposition
of the Articles? But the spite is, in this very Particular Mr.
<hi>Rogers</hi> makes against him: for the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Proposition he draws
from the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article, is this (Christ is ascended into Heaven)
which having named, his very next words are (In saying how
Christ <hi>with his Body</hi> is ascended into Heaven, and <hi>there sitteth
and abideth,</hi> we do agree with the Prophets, Evangelists, &amp;c.)
the evident meaning whereof is, that Christ with the same
Body with which he ascended into heaven, doth sit and abide
there. And this Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> presumed to be the sense of the
Article, though he formed it not into a Proposition by it
self.</p>
               <p>But for the Doctors Comment upon the Article; what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
man will not straight conclude it to be most unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably forced? for,
What Body of Christ now sits in heaven,
but that which Ascended into Heaven? and the Body that
Ascended thither, the Doctor himself grants to be flesh and
bones, by the experiment of <hi>Thomas.</hi> If he fancies that this
Body was changed into Organized Light, after its Ascension,
(as here he must do to make good this Interpretation) he
then clashes with his own professed. Tenet, that <hi>Christs Body
assimilated it self to the Regions it passed in his Ascension.</hi> That
which was changed after his Ascension, was not changed in his
Ascension. But though contradictions are no news in the
Doctors Theology, he might have dealt more mannerly with
the Church Article, then I shall now shew he hath.</p>
               <p>He pleads that the Article <hi>doth not say</hi> that Christ sitteth in
Heaven with a Body of flesh and bones till he return to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
This first is a slander: for the Article having said,
that Christ rising truly from the dead, took again his <hi>flesh
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57586:14"/>
and bones,</hi> (yea and <hi>all things</hi> else, whether blood or spirits, or
any other parts, <hi>appertaining to the perfection of Mans nature)</hi>
it adds, <hi>Wherewith</hi> he ascended into heaven, <hi>and there sitteth
untill he return to judge all men at the last day.</hi> This one would
think were plain enough.</p>
               <p>But see how the Doctor infers <q>[And if it do not say
this, it does not gainsay but that the Body of Christ that
shone so radiantly about S. <hi>Paul</hi> when he went to <hi>Damascus,</hi>
had neither <hi>flesh nor bones properly so called.)</hi> 
                  </q> The best of it is,
the Article, God be thanked, does say what the Doctor says it
does not say. But admit it had not in express terms said it: yet
still in sense, and by necessary consequence, it might have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
that Christs Body which shone about S. <hi>Paul,</hi> had neither
<hi>flesh nor bones properly so called.</hi> besides, if Glorified flesh and
bones, be not <hi>properly</hi> flesh and bones; what are they then? are
they properly any thing else; and yet still flesh and bones, But
if they be <hi>properly flesh and bones,</hi> why may they not <hi>properly</hi> be
so <hi>called?</hi> Would the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> speak out, there is small question to be
made, but he would still affirm that Body of Christ, not to be a
Body of flesh and bones consisting; seeing he ventures to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that the Article <hi>leavs us free in this point:</hi> and that the
Penmen of it, never intended the belief of flesh and bones in
Christs glorified Body, to be an essential part of this Article:
of which Conclusions, the former appears already to be grosly
calumnious; and I shall by and by shew the latter to be little
better. Mean while, I little doubt but if this liberty of wresting
and publickly perverting the Church Articles, be permitted to
this Doctor; there are few Heresies which his sceptical Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
may not finde a way to patronize; and that under colour
still of fair and plausible Consent to those very Articles.</p>
               <p>The Reason he intimates for his saying that the Penmen of
the Article intended not the belief of flesh and bones in
Christs glorified Body as an essential part of it, is that <hi>cautious
and considerate Restriction</hi> of (all things that appertain to the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57586:15"/>
perfection of mans nature) But if this were a just argument so
to perswade him, there should be contained in that Restriction
something to fignifie that there was no such Intent in those
Penmen but neither is there any such thing there contained;
nor indeed could there be: for first, in that General <hi>(All things
pertaining to the perfection of Mans nature)</hi> the Particulars of
flesh and bones, had they not been premised, would naturally
have been included: and therefore 'twere very strange to
Imagine them shut out by those Words: but secondly, the
Penmen had in the former part of the Article most expressly
by name professed that Christ at his Resurrection reassumed
his Body <hi>with flesh and bones; Wherewith,</hi> they after say, he
<hi>Ascended</hi> and <hi>sits in heaven.</hi> Wherefore it is impossible that
the Restriction should prove that they intended not the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of flesh and bones in Christs glorified Body should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the essence of the Article. It is plain, their intent
was, to deliver here the Doctrine of Christs Resurrection, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension,
and session in Heaven: and as plain that they meant
to determine with what Body Christ Rose, Ascended and
sits in heaven: and this Body they tell us, was his Body of
flesh and bones. Unless therefore we believe Christs glorified
Body now in Heaven to be flesh and bones; we believe not
that with his Body of flesh and bones he Rose, Ascended, and
sate down in Heaven: If we believe not this, certainly we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not something that is essential in the Article. And now,
whether the Penmen intended this point, of Christs glorified
Bodies being flesh and bones, as essential to this Article, or no;
let the Reader judge.</p>
               <p>But all this while the Doctor abuses us, or rather the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
by calling that clause (all things appertaining to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Mans nature) a <hi>Restriction</hi> for the Article, having
named, <hi>Body with flesh and bones,</hi> it immediately subjoyns (and
all things appertaining, &amp;c.) which surely in common sense is
rather an Ampliation then a Restriction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:57586:15"/>
Having thus mocked the Church Article; he would in the
next, the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Section,</hi> seem pretty good friends with it; for
he saith, <q>[But suppose the intent of the Article was to take
in this also, That the Glorified Body of Christ had not
onely in its Ascension, but still hath, and ever will have,
till he return to judgement, a body of flesh and bones; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they be Celestial and Spiritual flesh and bones, (as it is
without Controversie a Spiritual and Celestial body,) that
would break no squares with my Apprehensions and
Concessions. For I do in the very Text of my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
acknowledge this Glorified Body of Christ to be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized
Light.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>But this is in truth onely a new Mockery of the Article, to
say, That because <hi>he acknowledges</hi> (a well-favoured word, that:
as if the Thing had been propounded to him, or any body else
had held that Opinion; when indeed 'tis a Whimsey of his
own.) <hi>Christs Body to be Organized Light,</hi> therefore it sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that this Body hath bones and flesh. If it be Light, let
the Doctors fancy organize it as he pleaseth, he can never
prove it to be flesh and bones.</p>
               <p>And yet immediately after his saying, that he Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
it to be Organized Light; he adds, as an exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Organized Light, <q> [<hi>That is to say,</hi> Though at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
Christ be surrounded with gleams and rays of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible
Light and Glory, which invelops his Body, as
an Atmosphear of perspired Vapours are rightly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to surround the body of every man, especially being
a little more then ordinary warmed; yet if any Mortal
could get within this so refulgent Photosphear (as I may
so call it) or Orb of Glory and Brightness, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
so near as to see the frame and feature of so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
a Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</q> What's this but to overthrow, in
effect, what he acknowledged before; by making <hi>a Body of
Organized Light,</hi> to be a Body incompassed at a distance with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57586:16"/>
with an Orb of Light and Glory. A stock or a stone may
be surrounded at distance with an Orb of Light; but that
stock or stone is not therefore a body of Organized Light.
Wherefore this kinde of Talk argues the Doctor to be at
a loss what to say pertinetly, and therefore he flutters about
in repugnant expressions; being onely resolved not to say
what he ought, that is, Never to acknowledge that he hath
spoken amiss.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Sixteenth,</hi> which is his last Section; after a most
needless pudder, to shew, that there is a Spiritual or Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Flesh, as well as Natural, (which who denies?)
he adds <q>[For my part I must confess, I do not know
but the Celestial and Spiritual Flesh (according to a
known Aphorisme of the Hermetick Philosophy) <hi>is more
truely</hi> flesh, then that we wear in this life.]</q> Let the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
grant it to be but <hi>as truely</hi> flesh, and I am content,
But then he must grant, That his calling it <hi>Organized
Light, not flesh and bones,</hi> is inconsistent with this or any
Concession, which is an Affirmation, That 'tis <hi>truely fiesh;</hi>
much more, that 'tis <hi>more truely</hi> flesh then that we wear in
this life. For whatsoever is <hi>truely flesh,</hi> is <hi>truely flesh;</hi> and
therefore cannot be <hi>truely</hi> said to be <hi>Light;</hi> or to be
<hi>Not flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One thing more I must observe, namely, That the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
upon every Page of this long Chapter, sets this in
Front as the Title of it, <hi>(His Answer touching the Lucidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Christs Body after his Ascension.]</hi> But was that Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity
the Point in question? Doth the Objection charge
him with delivering that as an Errour? No such matter
in the least: The Objector is as forward to profess Christs
Body to be Lucid, as the Doctor. 'Tis pretty sport then, that
he should so solemnly proclaim all the way, That he Answers
what was never Objected.</p>
               <p>And now to conclude; It appears touching this First of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57586:16"/>
the Ten Objections, 1. That the Doctor admits the words
charged upon him, to be his own. 2. That in his Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them, he runs deeper into the mire, and plunges into
several Absurdities and Contradictions. 3. That he shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
perverts the Article of our Church concerning the
Point in Controversie. 4. That though he would seem
to allow Christs Glorified Body to have flesh and bones,
(which he expresly denyed in his <hi>Mysterie;</hi> as is noted in
the Objection,) yet still he overthrows what he so allows,
by adhering to his beloved Fancy of <hi>Organized Light.</hi>
Nevertheless he stoutly rubs his Fore-head, and doubts
not to Conclude, That his Apprehensions concerning the
nature of a Glorified body, are <hi>in every regard Unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable;</hi>
and that he hath <hi>sufficiently cleared</hi> this first
Objection. Wherefore he marcheth Victoriously to the
Second.</p>

The drift and scope of which Chapters, he

               <p>We shall, saith he, at the last day, be revived into <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and corporeal Personality,</hi> and feel our selves to be the
<hi>self same men,</hi> &amp;c. This he saith here in his <hi>Apologie;</hi>
but he said it not in his <hi>Mysterie;</hi> and therefore it answers
not the Objection. But this is not all, for, having affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
this to be the <hi>onely sense</hi> which is evidently compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in any of the Creeds of the Church, or any Articles
of them. He adds, That in the mean time he <hi>denies not</hi>
that 'tis the same Numerical body that rises again, <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the nicest Notions</hi> of the Schools. He pleads that
he <hi>denies not this;</hi> and that's all: but even in this his <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi>
he is carefull not to profess it; though the Objection pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him to do it. Nay he plainly distinguisheth the sense of
the Schools, from the sense evidently comprised in any of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57586:17"/>
Creeds. Thus therefore I argue; The Notions, yea, the
nicest Notions of the Schools, in the Article of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
cannot amount to more then this: That the very same
Numerical body that dyed, shall really, truely, and perfectly
rise again. Now if this Notion or Sense of the Resurrection
(which he cunningly would appropriate to the Schoolmen,
and that as a superlative Nicety) be plainly and necessarily col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
from the Creeds; then 'tis evidently enough compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in them. that it is so collected, I prove thus: The
Apostles Creed (and so the rest) avows the Resurrection of
the body: but the body riseth not again, if it be not the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same Numerical body that dyed; take <hi>Numerical</hi> in the
strictest sense it is capable of, for the body that dies, is really,
truely, and perfectly a Numerical body: And how can the
<hi>same body</hi> rise again, (as here the Doctors own words acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it doth,) unless it be really, truely, and perfectly the
same Numerical body which dyed? So that what he craftily
terms the <hi>sense of the Schools,</hi> must unavoydably be the <hi>sense
of the Creed;</hi> and therefore is unreasonably (that I say no
worse) by the Doctor distinguished from it. The truth is,
the bare word, <hi>Resurrection,</hi> in the Creed, doth naturally and
irrefragably import the perfect and absolute Numerical Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the body that riseth: which if the Doctors Theologie
cannot digest, he had best mend the Creed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of those words, (I believe <hi>The Resurrection of the
body,)</hi> put in (I believe the Resurrection of some part
of the body, or, in some respects,) or what else he
fancies.</p>
               <p>Indeed in his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> of this Chapter, he pretends to
prove that <hi>Resurrectio</hi> hath no such necessary importance:
his words are, <q>[The Atheist makes a fresh assault from the
sense of the word <hi>Resurrectio;</hi> as if it implyed the rising
again of the very same Numerical body in the strictest Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastick
sense. To which is answered, First, That <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:57586:18"/>
in Latin implies no such thing necessarily; but that as a
City or Temple, suppose, being rased to the ground, and
from the very foundation if you will, is truely said to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built,
and so is deemed and called the same Temple and
City again, though not a stone were used of the former
Structure; provided onely, that they be rebuilt upon the
same ground according to exactest Ichnography; <hi>That being
a stable character of their Identity, that they are built upon
the same lines they were before.</hi> So though the same Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
matter were not congested together, to make the same
body at the Resurrection, yet the <hi>stable Personality being in
the Soul,</hi> this body that is united with her, and built as it
were upon that stable unchanging ground, doth <hi>ipso facto</hi>
become the <hi>same body as before;</hi> as it was said to be the
Temple or City, that is rebuilt upon the same plot of
ground again, and in the same lines as before. Which is
consonant to the generous Assertion of that learned Knight
S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> who I well remember, somewhere in his
Writings speaks to this sense: That the soul being once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
of her present body, if she had afterwards a body
made out of one of the remotest Rocks of <hi>Africk</hi> or <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica;</hi>
this body upon vital union with the soul, would be
the <hi>same Numerical body</hi> she had before. Which is also
agreeable to the sense of several considerable Philosophers
and Schoolmen, <hi>Avenroes, Durandus, Avicenna</hi> and
others; who contend, That <hi>Individuation is from the Form
onely,</hi> and that the Matter and <hi>suppositum</hi> is individuated
from it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Doth not this look like the Discourse of one who clearly
believes the sense of the Catholick Church concerning the
Resurrection? I shall make bold a little to scan it. What he
saith of the Latin <hi>Resurgere,</hi> I deny not; <hi>Eversaque Troja re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surges,</hi>
is <hi>Ovids</hi> words; and <hi>Res Romanae resurgent, Livies,</hi>
but are such Resurrections, proper or figurative? if proper,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57586:18"/>
they must needs import the restitution of the same Numerical
things; and not of things like them, or things in their stead.
I demand therefore: Are the words in the Creed, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
figuratively, or properly? I hope not figuratively:
This would let the <hi>Latitudinarians</hi> loose to make rare sport
with all the Articles of our Faith; but if properly, then doth
<hi>Resurrectio</hi> necessarily signifie what I before affirmed. Suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
whereunto is that of <hi>Tertullian (adv. Mar. l. 5.) Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectionis
vocabulum non aliam rem vindicat, quàm quae cecidit.</hi>
Wherefore to the Doctors Comparisons of a City or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
rebuilt upon the same lines, but of other Materials; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
Such a City or Temple is properly and more truly said
<hi>not to be the same</hi> (but another City or Temple in their rooms)
then <hi>to be the same.</hi> And if another body be raised again (for
thus repugnantly must I speak to follow the Doctor) instead
of that which dyed, it may more truly be said <hi>not to be,</hi> then
<hi>to be the same body.</hi> Suppose the second Temple at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
were erected upon the very same lines with the first; can
it properly and truly be said to be <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, and not
rather another in its stead? Suppose Aelia to have been built
upon the same Ichnography where <hi>Ierusalem</hi> formerly stood;
<hi>Hadrian</hi> the Emperour (who named it <hi>Aelia)</hi> would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have been convinced by the Doctors discourse to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that this City was properly and truly <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and
not <hi>Aelia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Whereas he saith, <hi>The stable Personality is in the Soul:</hi>
'tis most true that it could not be the same Person after the
Resurrection, without the same soul, but the Question is not
concerning the sameness of the soul, but of the body; and if
the Person who dyed, consisted of two essential parts, <hi>viz.</hi>
soul and body; it cannot be the same Person after the
Resurrection, unless it consists of the same two essential
Parts.</p>
               <p>3. To say that a new body (not of the same Materials with
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57586:19"/>
the old, but quite other,) doth, by being at the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
united to the soul, become <hi>ipso facto the same body as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;</hi>
is in all common sense and reason an evident Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction:
for it makes it to be <hi>the same,</hi> and yet <hi>not
the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Whether S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Kenelm Digby</hi> ever wrote what the Doctor
affirms of him, I know not. He cites not the place, but
leaves us to trust his memory: which I should the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglyer
do, did I not know how apt the Doctor is to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
himself.</p>
               <p>5. In making this fancy of his, consonant to the sense of
great Philosophers and Schoolmen; he abuseth both them
and his Reader. For the reason he alledgeth, is, because
they contend, That <hi>Individuation is from the Form onely,</hi> and
that the <hi>Matter and Suppositum is</hi> individuated by it: But this
is far enough from proving what he pretends; For, the soul
being the principal part of the <hi>suppositum,</hi> it may justly be said
to Individuate it; and if we should grant, that the soul is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
at the Resurrection with a body new and of quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Materials from that which dyed, there were no doubt in
that case, but the Individuation were from the soul. But it
follows not, that because it Individuates that body into which
it is then put, that therefore it makes it the same Numerical
body with that into which it is not then put. Upon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
hypothesis of Another (which yet he thinks he hath
here found a trick to make the same) bodies being united to
the soul at the Resurrection, there is no doubt but there
emerges an <hi>Individuum,</hi> and that by vertue of the soul thus
united; but is it the very same <hi>Individuum</hi> it was before?
that's the Point in Question now. If it be the very same, it
must consist of the same essentials, the same body and soul,
it did before it dyed: but that it doth not; for the soul is
supposed to Individuate another body, and not that which dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
This Fancy therefore is a meer Sophism, and would with
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57586:19"/>
indignation have been exploded even the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> School
it self: for what had their <hi>Metempsychosis</hi> signified, if upon
the souls change of bodies, the same <hi>Individuum</hi> had remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
or how could <hi>Pythagoras</hi> have said,</p>
               <q>
                  <l>—Trojani tempore belli,</l>
                  <l>Panthoides Euphorbus eram?—</l>
               </q>
               <p>But the Doctor annexes a second Interpretation of Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and will have it signifie <hi>onely Vivification,</hi> or <hi>Re-vivifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
and thereupon without any more ado pronounces, That
the Objection from the word <hi>Resurrectio,</hi> is <hi>utterly defeated.</hi>
No haste Sir; it is so far from being utterly defeated, that
'tis plainly confirmed by this your Interpretation. What I
pray, is that which is <hi>Revived</hi> at the Resurrection? Is it the
soul, or the body? Not the soul, I hope: and if the body
be <hi>revived,</hi> it must be that body which dyed: unless you will
have us believe, that another body is revived which never
dyed; and that whatsoever dyed of the body, never lives
again. But you will scarce ever prevail with men in their
right wits to profess, That the old body is revived, because
a new body exactly like it is substituted in its room, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the soul of that old body which is the Principle of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect. 6.</hi> He produceth certain passages out of his <hi>Mysterie,</hi>
to prove that he contradicts not nor <hi>decrys the more curious and
nice Opinion of the Schools,</hi> in the Numerical Identity of the
body. His first is, the Description of the Scholastick state of
the Resurrection, namely, <q>[That we shall have the same
Numerical bodies in which we lived here on earth, and that
these very bodies, the molds being turned aside, shall start
out of the grave.] To which saith he, I presently subjoyn,
This Doctrine the Atheist very dearly hugs as a pledge, in
his bold conceit, of the falseness and vanity of all the other
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57586:20"/>
Articles of Religion.] Then he concludes [Wherein 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
by my inserting <hi>in his bold conceit,</hi> that I am so far from
denying the Doctrine of the Schools, that I check the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist
for doing so.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yes, marvellously manifest! surely those inserted words
(in his bold conceit) may by very easie and natural constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
refer to them which follow (of the falseness and vanity
of all other Articles of Religion,) for 'tis a bold Conceit in the
Atheist, to think all other parts of Religion vain, though he
should esteem this Doctrine of the Schools so to be. But how
heartily the Doctor checks his Atheist here for his bold Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
against the Schoolmen, may be guessed by those words
of his in the Eighth Section of this Chapter, <q>[I decline the
averring it to be the same Numerical body, in the ordinary
sense of Numerical according to the more rigid sort of
School Divines.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>To his next passage he proceeds thus, <q>[Again <hi>Sect.</hi> 7.
where speaking of this more punctual Position of the
Schools, I write thus: These and such like are the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of those that would overthrow Religion upon this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
as they deem it: and something they drive at
that seems to tend to a perswasion of some kind of Incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
and Incredibility in the matter, but it will not all amount
to an utter Impossibility.] Here again I am so far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
or condemning the Opinion of the Schools from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
altogether untenable, that I intimate, that the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
that the Opposers have is not so great and down-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in it self, as in their esteem and conceit; for I say,
(upon this advantage, as they deem it.) Besides that I sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest,
that all the force of their Argument against this Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is but a <hi>Tendency,</hi> and that <hi>a seeming one, toward a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion</hi>
of but <hi>some kinde</hi> of Incongruity and Incredibility;
but I flatly deny, that it will at all amount to <hi>a real Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility</hi>
of the thing. And what is at all possible with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57586:20"/>
God, is with him easie, for as much as he is infinitely
Omnipotent.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Result of all this, doth onely afford us another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against the Doctor; for if the Opinion of the Schools
hath in it <hi>no real impossibility;</hi> If the advantage the Atheist
takes from it be onely imaginary and built on his own <hi>Conceit:</hi>
If all the force of his Arguments against it amount but to a
<hi>Tendency,</hi> (and that <hi>a seeming,</hi> not real Tendency,) towards a
perswasion of <hi>but some kinde</hi> of Incongruity and Incredibility:
Then 'tis evident that the Doctor hath no just ground to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
it, unless he can produce something against it out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:
for what could be pretended from Reason, is presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be in the Objections he makes the Atheist propound;
and they, by his own confession, come in effect to just no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
But had he been provided of any thing out of Scripture
for this purpose, I doubt not but we should have heard of it
from him in <hi>tono tertio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he proceeds, <q>[And again in the very last clause of this
Chapter, I express a special care of reserving the Notion of
the Schools <hi>untouched</hi> and intire, in these words (But what
I answer, I would be understood to direct to the Atheist and
Infidel, <hi>permitting</hi> them that already believe the <hi>substance,</hi>
which I have righty stated above, to vary their fancies with
what <hi>circumstances</hi> they please.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Truly I believe, that in some sense he hath special care to
leave to the Notion of the Schools <hi>Untouched.</hi> Indeed he
professeth (as I have noted already) to <hi>Decline it.</hi> But
whether this be out of Tenderness, or out of Dislike, 'tis easie
to discover. Onely he would seem wonderous kinde, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerously
gives us leave, provided we believe the substance,
to vary our fancies as we please about the Circumstances.
And what if he had not vouchsafed thus to <hi>Permit</hi> us? did our
Liberty depend upon his Permission? when that appears, we
will thank him for it. Mean while, I must be bold to note
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57586:21"/>
here a piece of the Doctors fraudulent Art: The Point in
hand is, Whether the same body riseth again; I mean, Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically
the same in the sense of the Schools; the very same
it was before it dyed and was consumed in the earth, air, water
or elsewhere. Now the Doctor makes this Point no part of
the <hi>substance</hi> of the Article touching the Resurrection, but
onely <hi>a Circumstance.</hi> So that a man may rightly believe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is substantially and indispensably the sense of that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
though his faith be not determined in this (as the Doctor
would have it esteem'd) Circumstantial Particular. For though
in the Account he gave us of the Articles substance, <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.
he seems to say, That we shall at the Resurrection have really
the self-same bodies which we had in this life: yet in the Fourth
Section touching the word <hi>Resurrectio,</hi> he blurted out what he
truly means by any such Expressions; namely <q>[That though
the <hi>same Numerical matter</hi> be not congested to make the same
body at the Resurrection; the stable Personality being in the
soul, this body that is united with her, doth <hi>ipso facto</hi> become
<hi>the same body as before.</hi>]</q> Wherefore let a man but believe
that at the last day the soul shall be united to a body of the same
form and fashion with that which dyed; and by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi>'s The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie,
he believes all the substance of the Article concerning
the Resurrection: for he believes that the <hi>same body</hi> riseth again,
because this new body by being joyned to the soul, becomes
<hi>ipso facto</hi> the very same body which was joyned to it in this
life. And let such a man never scruple that this new body is
not of the same Numerical matter or substance with the
Old; for that's onely Circumstance, and no substantial Part
of the Article of the Creed. Let but the Doctor have a
Patent thus to Interpret the Creed; and I see not but he may
soon Interpret away the whole Truth and Substance of the
Christian Faith.</p>
               <p>Yet in his Conclusion of this 6 section he doubts not to say
<q>[This is enough to clear me from all suspicion of Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxness
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57586:21"/>
in point of the Resurrection: and it would be but
superfluous farther to alledge how expressly I declare (chap.
7. sect. 2.) that I do not deny the possibility of the same nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
body, no not in the most strict though <hi>needless mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of the Schools.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>I believe the ingenuous Reader will scarce be of his opinion,
that what he hath hitherto said, is enough to clear him. But
why do I call it an Opinion? when in the style of it, it is a
definitive sentence passed by himself for his own justification;
and that (which is the sport of it) before he hath so much as set
down the Objection made against his Heterodoxness in this
Point; much less applied his Answer to it, for this he does not
till he comes to his 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> section of this chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if the Doctor be not heterodox in this Point; how
shall we maintain the holy Fathers of the Church to be Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox?

preceding, in the close of the first section are these: <q>[We
having plainly shewed, that the Mystery (of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)
implies nothing more then this, That the same indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57586:22"/>
Persons shall be revivificated body and soul, and
made <hi>happy with eternal life.</hi> But the <hi>same individual Person,</hi>
does not involve any <hi>necessity</hi> of the <hi>same numerical Body;</hi> as
hath been shewn at large.]</q> By which it is not difficult to
discover what his judgement is concerning the Resurrection of
the same numerical Body; that is, as I and any man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands,
One and the same Body. You see he here professeth
that the same <hi>individual Person</hi> involves <hi>no necessity</hi> of the
same <hi>numerical Body;</hi> and in the forementioned passage he
terms the meaning of the schools, a <hi>Needless Meaning;</hi> if it
be with him, as he affirms first and last, <hi>needless</hi> and of <hi>no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,</hi>
then he affirms that it is not, nor ought to be held any
point of faith, That one and the same Body shall rise again.
Touching his saying that the Resurrection implies that Body
and Soul shall be <hi>made happy with eternal life:</hi> I must minde him
that he makes very bold with Christ, who teaches us that the
Resurrection is the way to Misery, as well as to Happiness, S.
<hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 28, 29. <hi>All that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
and shall come forth, they that have done good, unto the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Life, and they that have done evil, unto the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Condemnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Doctor hath made this long prefacing flourish, he
now at length is pleased to set down the second Objection,
which is this: He faith, <q>[That it cannot be proved out of
scripture, that the same Body shall rise again from the grave.
This takes away the Resurrection of the Body: for this
cannot be, except the same Body rise again] Then he adds
The Quotation of the place from whence this Objection is
taken, is here omitted: but I question not but that it aims
at that passage chap. 4. sect. 3. book. 6. which runs thus:
I answer farther as concerning Scripture it self, that I dare
challenge him to produce any place of scripture, out of which
he can make it appear, that the Mystery of the Resurrection,
implies the Resuscitation of the same Numerical Body. The
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57586:23"/>
most pregnant of all, is <hi>Iob</hi> 19. which later interpreters are
now so wise as not to understand at all of the Resurrection.
The 1 Cor. 15. that Chapter is so far from asserting <hi>this
curiosity,</hi> that it plainly saith, it is not the same body, but that
as God gives to the blades of Corn grain quite distinct from
that which was sown, so at the Resurrection he will give the
Soul a Body quite different from that which was buried; as
different as a spiritual Body is from a natural Body or an
Heavenly from an Earthly.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>First I desire the Reader to take notice that this last clause
(as different as a Spiritual Body is from a Natural Body, or an
Heavenly from an Earthly) is not in his <hi>Mystery,</hi> but here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murely
thrust in by the Doctor; he knows why. Touching
the Place in <hi>Iob,</hi> and the wise Interpreters who understand it
not at all of the Resurrection; he confesses sect. 9. That <hi>in
that speech he had an Eye to</hi> Hugo Grotius <hi>his gloss upon the text.</hi>
He is all the Interpreters he is pleased to mention: yet that
very <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> is the Man, whom in his Interpretation of
the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the <hi>Apocalpys,</hi> the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> (in his late Book of
Antichristianism) (extremely vilifies: for example, <hi>lib. 2. cap.
3 sect.</hi> 1. he saith <q>[That <hi>Grotius</hi> his expositions of these
chapters, are harsh and unapplicable; and that he hath <hi>left
the plain road,</hi> and rushed through hedge and ditch, and pull'd
up all fences, to gather a nosegay of flours that both
smell ill, and immediately wither in his hand in the very ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of them.]</q> Yet though <hi>Grotius</hi> be an Interpreter that
can <hi>leave the plain road</hi> (as indeed he does upon this place of
<hi>Iob)</hi> yea and behave himself in his Comments like a man
right down frantick: the Doctor to serve his own turn, and
bolster up his own innovating fancy, can put him in the balance
against all ancient Interpreters.</p>
               <p>Now against <hi>Grotius</hi> his authority in this Point, I offer not
onely the Ancients (for example <hi>S. Ierom,</hi> who in his Epistle to
<hi>Paulinus</hi> speaks thus of <hi>Iob, Resurrectionem corporum sic pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetat,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57586:23"/>
ut nullus de eâ vel manifestius vel cautius scripserit.
Scio, inquit quod Redemptor meus vivit &amp; in novissimo die, &amp;c.</hi>
where he repeats this whole place. Also in his Epistle to <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machius</hi>
having set down the Text, he subjoyns: <hi>Quid hâc
prophetiâ manifestius? nullus tam apertè post Christum, quàm
ille ante Christum de Resurrectione loquitur.</hi> Also S. <hi>August.
de Civit. Dei.</hi> l. 22. c. 29. <hi>Ruffinus in Symbolum;</hi> with <hi>Origen,
Philippus Presbyter,</hi> S. <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, <hi>&amp; venerab. Bede,</hi>
upon the place: but after them. <hi>Aquinas, Lyra, Hugo Card.
Munsterus, Castalio, Clarius, Codurcus, Dionys. Carthusianus,
Borrhaeus, Oecolampadius, Brentius, Pellicanus, Osiander;</hi> and,
that I tell them not by the clock, one for all the moderns,
the most learned and judicious Bp. of <hi>Winchester</hi> Bp. <hi>Andrews.</hi>
Nay <hi>Mercerus</hi> himself, though he open'd <hi>Grotius</hi> the way to
his Opinion, yet honestly confesses in his Comment upon <hi>Iob,</hi>
that <hi>Nostri fere omnestam veteres quàm recentiores hunc ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siculum
cum duobus sequentibus ad resurrectionem referunt, quam
hoc loco Iob astruit.</hi> Heres almost all, both old and new, of
the Christian Commentatours granted us. Besides, the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> in her office of Burial, useth those words of <hi>Iob,</hi>
as meant of the Resurrection: though the Doctor in his 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
section endeavours to evade her Authority, by making those
expressions bear onely a Type and similitude of our Rising
again: not considering that they who thus divert this famous
Text from the antient Interpretation to their own new fancies,
not onely take from our Church one of the most ancient and
venerable proofs of the Resurrection, but also of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers
Incarnation, whom <hi>Iob</hi> saith he shall see with his eyes,
and not another. For matter of Authority then we have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
enough against what the Doctor produces.</p>
               <p>Consider we therefore <hi>Grotius</hi> his Reasons for his Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as the Doctor cites him <q>[His gloss upon the Text
<hi>Scio quod Redemptermeus vivit, &amp;c.</hi> is this: <hi>Haec verba, &amp;
quae sequuntur, Iudaei nunquam ad Resurrectionem retulere,</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:57586:24"/>
cùm tamen omnia rimentur quae aliquaam in speciem eò trahi pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunt.]</q>
This is first but a Negative Argument; if it were
true: that it is not true, may appear by <hi>Mercerus</hi> (whom in this
question me thinks the Doctor might trust) who upon the
place saith thus: <hi>(Quòd side Resurrectione futurâ hic loqueretur

25, 26, 27. verses (which is the whole place in controversie
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57586:24"/>
be examined, and it will appear a close and exact Translation:
and yet by that version of his, the place may very aptly be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of the Resurrection: so little need they who thus
understand it, be <hi>Coacti</hi> (as <hi>Grotius</hi> would have us believe) <hi>in
versionibus suis multum ab Hebraeo discedere.</hi> Lastly, <hi>Grotius</hi> his
interposition of several words, which certainly are not in the
Hebrew, to make out his sense; look back something un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsomely
upon his premised words, <hi>Hebraea sic sonant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. the Doctor affirms it to be far from
asserting this <hi>Curiosity.</hi> The point was, The rising of the
<hi>same body:</hi> this he gravely calls a <hi>Curiosity:</hi> and thereby again
prompts us to conjecture what is his bosom sense of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of the Resurrection. Nay he pronounces it to be <hi>so far</hi>
from Asserting it; that it <hi>plainly saith it is not the same body.</hi> If
S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith so, and saith it <hi>plainly;</hi> how dares the Doctor say
plainly (as he often doth, though in a fraudulent sense) (that <hi>It
is the same body?</hi> But his saying so, is in other places: and he
can take the liberty to say one thing in one place, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
in another. In this place he makes the Apostle say that
<hi>God will give the Soul a Body quite different from that which was
buried, as he gives the blades of Corn, grains quite different from
that which was sown.</hi> And hereby he makes S. <hi>Paul</hi> compare
not onely the Body to the Grain, but also the Soul to the Blade.
Yet bate him this ridiculous boldness with the Apost'e: his
whole comment upon the Text, forceth the comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the due bounds: the words are these sect. 37.</p>
               <p>[That which thou sowest, thou sowest <hi>not that body that
shall be,</hi> but bare grain, &amp;c.] If this be strictly to be taken, it
will necessarily follow, that the Body of Man sown in the earth,
<hi>shall not be,</hi> that is, shall not rise again: but this cannot be the
Apostles meaning; for this he saith sect. 44. [It is sown a
natural body, <hi>it is raised</hi> a spiritual body] <hi>Raised</hi> therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
it is. His scope evidently is this: to make the <hi>Corinths</hi>
understand that by virtue of the Resurrection our bodys shall
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57586:25"/>
of Animal become spiritual; of corruptible and mortal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible
and immortal: for this cleerly appears by the
sequel of his discourse. To facilitate this, he premises a simile,
and tells them, that in sowing of grain, they sow not the body
that shall be, but, for example <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>bare grain</hi> of wheat
or other corn, this seed comes not up again <hi>bare corn</hi> (for
there lies the stress of the simile) but in another condition,
clothed by God with all the furniture and ornament of the
spica. Yet the Apostle adds that it hath still <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; God
gives it its own body; wheat comes up wheat, and rie, rie.
Semblably when Mans body is buried, 'tis not the body that
shall be; for 'tis sown an animal, corruptible, mortal body:
but at the Resurrection God makes it a spiritual, incorruptible,
immortal body; and gives to every Man <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> still, <hi>his
own body;</hi> his own, though refined and spiritualized. And
thus far the simile fairly holds, and being but a simile, must
not be pressed in all respects as if it were a mathematical Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel.
For if the Doctor will thus urge it, he must make it
appear, how corn is sown in Corruption, and comes up in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption:
for <hi>so also is the Resurrection of the dead,</hi> V. 42,
which <hi>also,</hi> will force him to grant, that corn comes up In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible,
supposing the simile were strictly to be pressed
in every particular. All therefore that can be proved from
hence, is, that Mans body at the Resurrection is not the same
in condition and Qualities that it was when it dyed, though it
be numerically the same in kinde and substance.</p>
               <p>Besides, the Doctor makes bold to affirm, in the Apostles
name, that, of the body of Man (viz. <hi>it is not the same body:</hi>
(he should have said, <hi>It is not that body that shall be)</hi> which the
Apostle speaks of the body of Grain: and which he brings not
as a perfect parallel, to demonstrate, but as a simile to illustrate;
according as I have noted above.</p>
               <p>Now therefore I return to his challenge, which was this:
<q>[I dare challenge him to produce any place of scripture, out
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57586:25"/>
of which he can make it appear, that the Mysterie of the
Resurrection implies the Resuscitation of the same Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
body.]</q> The Challenge, as daring as it is, I lay hold
of, though not made to me: and (besides what I have said
already in asserting the place in <hi>Iob,</hi>) could well and safely
enough Answer it in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Ieroms</hi> words, in his <hi>Comment</hi> upon
<hi>Ezekiel, Chap. 37.</hi> where speaking of the Resurrection of the
body (and he understood the same Numerical body) he saith:
(<hi>Scimus Testimonia in quibus nulla sit dubitatio, in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturis
sanctis reperiri. Ut est illud</hi> Jobi, <hi>suscitabis pellem meam
quae ista sustinet. Et in</hi> Daniele, <hi>Multi qui dermiunt in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae
pulvere resurgent, isti in vitam aeternam, &amp; isti in
opprobrium &amp; confusionem aeternam. Et in Evangelio:
Nolite timere eos qui corpus interficiunt, animam autem
non possunt occidere; timete autem eum magis qui potest &amp;
animam &amp; corpus perdere in gehennam. Et Apostolus</hi> Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus:
<hi>Qui suscitavit Iesum Christum à mortuis, vivificabit
mortalia vestra Corpora propter inhabitantem Spiritum ejus in
vobis. Et multa alia.</hi>) So far S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Ierom,</hi> and far enough to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
our confident Doctor.</p>
               <p>I might add that signal place (which I have formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned)
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Io. 5. 28, 29. (<hi>All that are in the Graves shall
hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done
good, to the Resurrection of life, and they that have done
evil, to the Resurrection of condemnation.</hi>) Is not this Text
plain? or can the Doctor tell us what can be plainer?
if all who <hi>are in their graves,</hi> shall <hi>come forth</hi> at the last
day; then doth the Mysterie of the Resurrection imply
the Resuscitation of the same Numerical bodies: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
of those very bodies which were interred in those
Graves:</p>
               <p>But I will rather insist upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. that very Chapter,
which, if you will credit the Doctor, plainly saith, <hi>It is not
the same body:</hi> Consider therefore the 53. <hi>V. (This corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57586:26"/>
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
this mortal must put on immortality.)</hi> Those words, <hi>this
corruptible,</hi> and <hi>this mortal,</hi> (for the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in both places, makes
them Determinative and Emphatical,) must be meant of that
Individual Numerical body which shall dye, or be changed.
But this Numerical body shall <hi>put on incorruption</hi> and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality;
that is, shall be invested with those Modifications,
instead of corruption and mortality. Therefore this Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
body, after the Resurrection or change, must needs be
the same Numerical body that it was before. Else <hi>this
corruptible,</hi> and <hi>this mortal,</hi> cannot truly be said to <hi>put on</hi>
incorruption and immortality, if the body it self in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
substance be <hi>another</hi> as well as the array.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. he saith, <q>[Wherefore to this Objection, I now
briefly and particularly answer;</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>First, that <hi>it is not of faith to believe</hi> (a pretty phrase if
you mark it: but I guess his meaning) that every body that
is said to rise at the last day, should rise out of the Grave;
since all bodies had not burial.]</q> Will the Doctor yield,
concerning such bodies as had burial? if not, what is this
Answer but an Impertinency? Indeed he was conscious,
and therefore presently waves it himself; and thus proceeds:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>[Secondly therefore I say, that I do not affirm, that it
cannot be proved out of Scripture, that the same body shall
rise again, but the <hi>same Numerical body:</hi> for I acknowledge
that would take away the Resurrection indeed, if the body
that is said to rise, were not in a very due sense the same.
And I think it is very duly the same, if it be acknowledged
as much the same with the body that was buryed, as <hi>that
body was with it self during this terrestrial life.</hi> Which
I do freely acknowledge it to be, though I decline the aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it to be the same Numerical body, in the ordinary sense
of Numerical, according to the more rigid sort of School
Divines.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:57586:26"/>
This is his main answer. Now it had been but fair, if men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
the Schoolmens Notion of <hi>Numerical body,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it his Fence so often as he doth, he would at length have
told us, what that Notion is, and how the rigider and the sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sort of School Divines differ about it. But he was shie of
exposing himself more openly to the lash. That Notion, (as
I have noted already) cannot amount to more then this: That
one and the self same body that dyed, shall really and truly
rise again; and if it doth not so rise, I have proved that there
cannot truly be a Resurrection of the dead. It is therefore a
vain Doff to pretend, that he onely declines the rigid sense of
the Schools.</p>
               <p>Yea, but he grants the body shall be <hi>as much the same, as
it was with it self during this terrestrial life.</hi> And what
would you more? so much more, as would amount to plain
and ingenuous Dealing: for I question not but this is a trick,
and a ready out-let when need shall require; by the help of
which he may comfort his Proselytes, and tell them, they
need not boggle or be troubled at this his seeming Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which he meant but as a blinde, wherewith to fool such
rigid men as the Objector; for they must remember, that the
body in this life is often changed, and between daily spending
and repairing, is no more the same in a few years, then that
Ship which was so often mended and patched, that none of
her first Materials were left. Wherefore to grant, that the
body at the Resurrection is as much the same with that which
dyed, as that was with it self in this life: is in effect, to grant
no sameness at all.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to drive him from this starting hole, first I
demand of him, Whether his own body be Numerically one
and the same to day, that it was yesterday? I easily imagine
he will not affirm that he hath every day a new body Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically
distinct from the former. How many weeks then, or
moneths, or years is it since he had not the very same body
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57586:27"/>
which he now wears? I suppose his Answer will be, That the
change was made by such insensible degrees, that the precise
time when it was finished cannot be named; yet nevertheless,
sure he is, that in the decurse of time, his body is so changed,
that it remains not Numerically the same it was before. Here
therefore it will be convenient, to consider the condition of a
still-decaying still-renewing body, and what is the true Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Identity of it.</p>
               <p>Some things naturally persist in their beings without capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of decay, and therefore need not the help of any Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
such we suppose Angels, and the souls of men to be.
Other things are made by the Creatour, in a condition subject
to spending and wasting, so as it is requisite to their Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
that they be supplyed and maintained by nutriment.
Whence, as the nature of Angels and souls of men is Perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
so the nature of these things is fluent; and it is truly
said of man in respect of his body, that <hi>he never continues in
one stay:</hi> for this mutability is sutable to his very nature.
Hereupon it follows, That the Identity of the body may in
this corruptible estate well consist with, nay, doth properly
include in it this fluency; no less then the Identity of the soul
includes in it constant Permanency. Nor can the body cast
off this corruptibility or mutability, till by the Resurrection it
puts on incorruption as well as immortality, and becomes fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in an undecaying Consistence. For any one therefore to
infer, that the body continueth not the very same all the life
long, because all the life long it spends and is anew repaired;
is to infer, that it is not the very same body, because it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fists
in a condition proper to its nature, whilst a natural and not
yet a spiritual body. If then it be the same fluent Creature all
the life long; it must be Numerically the same: seeing the
Identity of any singular thing can be no other then Numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;
but it is all the life long the same fluent Creature, and
the individual body of one and the same man: whereby it is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57586:27"/>
apparent, that during this terrestrail life (as the Doctor speaks)
it is the same, yea, and Numerically the same with it self. But I
argue further.</p>
               <p>In what age, condition or stature the body shall at the last
day be raised, I pretend not to define. But certain it is, that
it must be raised in some one age, condition and stature, as it
shall seem good to God Almighty. Let the Doctor now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously
tell us, Whether he believes that the body so rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
shall be at the Resurrection, as much the same body that
dyed, as that body was the same with it self in this life,
whilst it was actually in that very age, condition and stature
in which the raised body appears. For example, suppose the
Doctors body at the Resurrection be just such (bating imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of distempers, and the like) as it was at his age of
30 years; shall that revived body be as much the same with
that which the Doctor wore at his age of 30 years, as the body
which at that time he wore was then the same with it self?
Surely it was then Numerically the same with it self, in the
strictest School sense of <hi>Numerical</hi> which is imaginable.
Wherefore the Doctors specious acknowledging it to be <hi>as
much the same body,</hi> as that body was the same <hi>with it self,
during this Terrestrial life;</hi> is pitifully vain, if he denys the
body to be truly and Numerically the same body all this life
long: and much more, if he denys the raised body to be most
perfectly and Numerically the same (accidental imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
corruptibility, and mortality excepted,) with that
which the body was in this life at that age, and in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and stature in which that raised body shall happen to be
restored.</p>
               <p>But all this while, what he hath alledged in this his Second
Answer, is new; nor doth he pretend those words to have
been in his <hi>Mysterie,</hi> as they ought to have been, if they must
serve for his <hi>Apologie.</hi> In the progress therefore of this 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
he would have us think, that he had written in his <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57586:28"/>
sterie</hi> what is tantamount; and this it is: <q>[ That the same
men that <hi>dye and are buryed,</hi> shall as truly appear <hi>in their own
persons</hi> at the day of Judgement, <hi>as if</hi> those bodies that
were interred should be presently actuated by their souls
again, and should start out of their Graves. And to give
an Instance, they shall be as truly the same persons, <hi>as
Lazarus</hi> when he rose body and soul out of the Grave
after he had lien there Four daies together. And I
think <hi>Lazarus</hi> was <hi>sufficiently the same</hi> both soul and
body.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yes he was so; and Numerically the same: which I pray
good Doctor take notice of; and withall, of your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction:
You will not grant, That the bodies at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
shall in the Schools strict sense, be Numerically the
same with those in this life: Yet you affirm, That the same
persons shall as truly rise as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when he rose body and
soul: and that was in as strict a sense Numerically the same, as
the Schoolmen can possibly imagine.</p>
               <p>But now I consider it again, I doubt not but the Doctor
smiles at my charging him here with Contradiction: though
I think most Readers would have done the same. The truth
is, <hi>antiquum obtinet;</hi> his Concession which at first blush seems
frank and ingenuous, is but a demure piece of fraud.</p>
               <p>First, He instances here, not in all that dyed, but in <hi>all that
dye and are buryed.</hi> This was the very thing he cavilled at
in his first Answer: but here it is for his purpose to use it;
that his pretence of holding that men shall be as truly the
same persons at the Resurrection, as was <hi>Lazarus</hi> when raised
body and soul from the Grave; might be glibly swallowed,
and thereupon he be thought to have granted sufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Resurrection of the same body.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He saith (those men shall as truly appear in their
own persons at the day of Judgement.) He saith not <hi>In their
own bodies.</hi> Nay he intimates the contrary, by adding (as if
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57586:28"/>
those bodies that were interred, should presently be actuated
by their souls again, and should start out of their Graves.) <hi>As
if they should,</hi> is in plain English, that <hi>they shall not;</hi> For to
say, Those men shall as truly appear in their own persons, as
if those bodies that were interred, should be reactuated with
their souls, &amp;c. doth not acknowledge (but rather deny) that
those bodies which were interred, shall either presently, or
ever at all, be actuated by their souls again in the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
What is his meaning then, you will say, in affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they shall appear <hi>in their own persons?</hi> I will tell
you; and I must thank himself, for giving me the scent by
which I smell it out, in what he delivered before, in his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
There he informs us, That <q>[though the same Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
matter were not congested together to make the
same body at the Resurrection; the <hi>stable personality</hi> being
in the soul, this body that is united with her, and built as it
were upon that stable and unchanging ground, doth <hi>ipso
facto</hi> become the same body as before.]</q> Thus you see how
in the Doctors Theologie, men may at the Resurrection be
the same persons, and as truly consisting of the same body
and soul as was <hi>Lazarus</hi> when raised from his Grave; and yet
they may have other bodies united to their souls, then those
which dyed and were buryed; because those other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
by vertue of their union to the souls (in which is the
stable Personality) <hi>ipso facto</hi> become the same bodies as
before.</p>
               <p>In his 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> he finally pleads thus for what he wrote in
his <hi>Mystery,</hi> 
                  <q>[It was necessary for my designe, who to the
Philosopher avow my Religion to be Rational, not to
make my self look like a fool to him to whom I pretend my
self so rigid an Adherer to Reason, by swallowing down
needlesly such things, as I can finde neither faith nor reason
to require of me.]</q> I should be glad to hear (for as yet I
cannot) of any one Philosopher whom this Doctor hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57586:29"/>
but that he hath perverted many Christians, is too
true, or he is grosly slandered. Suppose that what he saith,
were necessary for his designe in that Book of his <hi>Mysterie:</hi> yet
I cannot see what necessity he had in this Apologie (which he
makes not to unbelieving Philosophers, but to Catholick
Christians) to contradict the Belief of the Catholick Church;
and to profess (touching the perfect Numerical Identity of the
body at the Resurrection) that it is needless to swallow it; and
that <hi>neither faith nor reason require it of him.</hi> Not <hi>faith:</hi> so he
denies what I noted and proved above, That this Point is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
included in the Creed. Not <hi>Reason;</hi> though it be a
Contradiction to say, That the same singular body (for of such
is the Question) riseth again, and yet not the body most truly
and Numerically the same that dyed.</p>
               <p>The truth is, there was all the reason in the world, that even
in dealing with his Philosopher, he should plainly have owned
and asserted this Point: for no Philosopher who enjoys the use
of his Reason, can ever imagine the Resurrection of the dead
body to be possible; unless the body raised, be supposed to be
one and the very same with that which dyed. Yet the Doctor
(if you will believe him) had he not done as he did, thinks he
should have made himself look like a fool to his Philosopher.
What he hath now made himself look like, both to Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
and Christians who shall consider these passages, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to say; and shall rather advise him (seeing he is so jealous
in this Point, of making himself seem a fool to Philosophers)
to remember, That the foolishness of the Christian Faith, is
wiser then the gravest Philosophy; and that it will be found
at last, that all Innovations in any Belief of any Article of our
Creed, is the short reasoning of unreasonable men.</p>
               <p>But his very last words are these: <q>[For my own part I
doubt not, according to my <hi>private thoughts,</hi> but there will
be a Recollection of as much of all that corporeal substance
we wore in this life, <hi>as will be requisite</hi> to make our bodies
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57586:29"/>
again the same.]</q> And what is this to the Objection? what
are his private thoughts he tells us of now, to what he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
delivered in his <hi>Mysterie</hi> some years since? Is there any
such thing there, as he seems to profess here? If so, then these
were not his <hi>private thoughts</hi> at the Writing of his <hi>Apologie,</hi>
but published to the world with his <hi>Mysterie:</hi> if not, his Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
here is insignificant, unless he maintains and makes good
what he wrote there, (which he neither hath, nor can,) or else
Retract both that there, and a good confident word in his
Preface here, namely, that he doth <hi>Demonstrate</hi> in his <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
That he hath committed no errour in what he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>
before.</p>
               <p>Indeed this his last Concession bears a shew of much more
then he hath hitherto granted; and may perhaps by some be
thought a sufficient Profession. But if it be sincerely said,
and be sound and Catholick, why without more ado had we it
not at first? Why spared he not those prolix needless Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
in this Chapter, to assert the integrity of his belief in
this Point? <hi>For my part, according to my private thoughts,</hi> I
doubt all is not right. <hi>Latet anguìs in herba:</hi> and I am the
rather inclined to this jealousie, because upon narrower Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the Words, I finde them truly capable of such a
sense, as shall not in the least signifie what in their outside
they may seem to carry, namely, That of the corporeal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
we wore in this life, there shall be a Recollection suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to make our bodies again the same they were before they
dyed: but on the contrary, shall import, that not any parts
at all of our former corporeal substance, shall need to be recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
at the Resurrection. For the wary Doctor hath in this
specious Concession contrived a Trap-door by which he may
at his pleasure give us the slip; and satisfie his Disciples, that
he hath said nothing here, but what is consistent enough with
the Principle they wot of.</p>
               <p>That Trap-door lies in those words, <hi>(as will be requisite,)</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:57586:30"/>
for it is evident by what I have noted above, that the Doctors
Opinion is, That no Recollection of the corporeal substance
(or any parts of it) which we wore about us in this life, is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite</hi>
to make our bodies again the same: seeing <hi>stable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonality</hi>
proceeds from the soul, and (to use his own words,
<hi>Sect.</hi> 4.) though the same Numerical Matter be not conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
together to make the same body at the Resurrection,
yet the body that is united with her, doth <hi>ipso facto</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the same body as before. Whereas therefore he
grants, That as much of the corporeal substance <hi>as will be
requisite</hi> to make our bodies again the same, shall be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected:
he grants nothing at all to the purpose, since
his declared Judgement in this very Chapter is, That no
such recollected substance will be Requisite. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
in the front of the next Chapter he bravely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth,
<q>[We have, I hope, by this time produced
more then enough, in satisfaction to the Second Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.]</q>
                  <hi>More then enough</hi> indeed; but whether <hi>satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorily</hi>
to the Objection, the Doctor must not be Judge;
no more will I; but leave it to the Reader.</p>

               <p>WIthout any Preface (and we are much beholden

<q>Object. 3.</q>
                  <hi>He makes Episcopacy a Faction, and so against Gods word,</hi>
Praef. Sect. 19.</p>
               <p>To this he Answers, first <q>[It is a short Objection, but a
very smart one (were it true) and plainly contradictious to
several passages in my Preface.]</q> Suppose that several pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
in his Preface did contradict this; yet that argues not but
what is here objected may be true: for Contradictions are no
News in this Doctors Writings: as hath, and shall farther ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
But he proceeds:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>[For in the 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> I write thus: That Episcopacy
simply in it self, is not Antichristian.]</q> Excellent! The
Doctor hath Notions of Antichristianism by himself, as may
appear by his <hi>Mysterie of Iniquity.</hi> And in what sense he will
here have <hi>Antichristianism</hi> understood, if he be put to a pinch,
is uncertain. However, by the way, Episcopacy is very
much beholden to him for pronouncing it to be <hi>not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian;</hi>
nay, <hi>Not simply and in it self Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi>
And because he hath pronounced a difficult point, and
of great consequence, he goeth on to prove it. The summe
of his Proof is: <q>[Because it was in use in the most pure
times of the Church, when she was most pure and exactly
Symmetral.]</q> By which Argument he ought positively
to have pronounced it to be <hi>simply and in its self Christian.</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:57586:31"/>
But this would have proved a trouble some block in the way of
what follows in that Preface, and is here repeated by him as a
second step of his Answer, <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>[That upon an Account of Reason, and of the nature
of the thing it self, Episcopacy joyned with Presbytery,
is better then Presbytery alone.]</q> Why saith he not,
That Episcopacy alone, is better then Presbytery alone;
and better then Presbytery joyned with Episcopacy: if
he would not be by some understood to prefer Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
Besides, who ever heard of that Hodgpodge which
the Doctor here commends: Namely, The Government
Episcopal, and the Government Presbyterian, (which are
repugnant the one to the other) jumbled into one Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Yet this Thesis concerning his Chimaera, to wit,
That (Episcopacy joyned with Presbytery, is better then
Presbytery alone,) he goes on to prove at large in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face;
and right tediously repeats it here in his <hi>Apologie.</hi>
Which done, he crows thus, <q>[If any one hath any thing
to say more material for Episcopacy, then this, let him
speak.]</q> So that if you will believe Doctor <hi>More,</hi> he
presumes, That no mortal man can produce any thing more
material for Episcopacy, then to prove, First, That it is
<hi>Not simply and in it self Antichristian.</hi> Secondly, That
<hi>If joyned with Presbytery, it is better then Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His third step is in these words, <q>[Lastly, At the close
of <hi>Sect.</hi> 22. I do expresly declare, That there is not
any effectualler means imaginable, to make the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in good earnest, that Religion is worth the look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after, then to finde themselves looked after so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and affectionately in reference to Religion, by
persons of so honourable Rank and Quality.]</q> In that
Section of his Preface, he speaks of the <hi>ample and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Revenues</hi> of a Bishop; and then gives a large Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57586:31"/>
of high personal sanctity in him: after which, he
closeth with those words before cited. But the Doctor
may please to know, that this Discourse comes not home
to Episcopacy, I mean, to the Order and Government it
self. For Episcopacy is Episcopacy, though it be not
adorned with <hi>ample honours and Revenues;</hi> yea, though
those who are admitted into it, happen to be persons no
waies admirable for vertue and holiness of Life. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he asserts and magnifies a Bishop, onely as he is a
person of honour and of vertue; he will not be seen at all
to acknowledge any single Reverence due to his Office,
and him, as he is a Bishop, which is very wisely done.
Besides, suppose Presbytery erected and publickly profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
may not many of the Elders be persons of honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Rank and Quality, and of ample Estates? And would
not the People be highly affected, to finde themselves ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
care for in reference to Religion, by the chief Burgers,
the Justice, the Lord of the Manour, the Knight, the good
Lord or Earl? Wherefore the Doctors arguing for Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
upon such accounts as those, will but make Presbyterians
smile.</p>
               <p>Well, but for all this, he will needs conclude this first
Section of this Chapter, with this Affirmation, <q>[All
which passages (<hi>viz.</hi> the three I have noted) are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
Contradictious, to the Charge this third Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
lays against me.]</q> 
                  <hi>Contradictious!</hi> and <hi>perfectly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictious!</hi>
Is it not strange, a man who trades so much
in Contradictions, should mistake other Commodities for
that Ware; and no better understand what passages are
<hi>perfectly Contradictious?</hi> The words in the Objection
are, <hi>(He makes Episcopacy a Faction.)</hi> Of his three pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
the summe of the first is, <hi>(Episcopacy simply is it
self is not Antichristian.)</hi> Doth this contradict, and that
perfectly the words of the Objection? If so, then by no
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57586:32"/>
means they can be both true. But I am of opinion, that the
Doctor will grant me, That Episcopacy may be a <hi>faction,</hi>
though it be <hi>not simply and in it self Antichristian.</hi> What
thinks he of Calvinism, Arminianism, Presbytery? are none
of these <hi>Factions?</hi> if any one of them be (and that all of them
are so, I can force the Doctor out of his own Writings to
confess.) I demand, Whether it be <hi>simply and in it self
Antichristian?</hi> If he dares affirm this, how comes it to
pass, that he discovered not the Mystery of Antichristia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism
(against-which he thunders in his late Book) in that
Faction?</p>
               <p>His second passage is (That Episcopacy joyned with
Presbytery, is better then Presbytery alone.) Compare this
with the Objection, (he makes Episcopacy a Faction:) are
these two <hi>perfectly contradictious?</hi> Though the joyning
Episcopacy with Presbytery, should make it better then Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery
alone. Still for all this, (if nothing else hinders) it may
be a Faction, namely, One Faction made up of two. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Presbytery joyned with Independency (which are as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being jumbled together, as Episcopacy and Presbytery,)
be better then Independency alone; that Presbytery will still
be but an augmented Faction.</p>
               <p>His third passage is so far from being Contradictious to the
Objection, that all the Horses in the Town cannot draw it
near being so. For it respects not Episcopacy it self, but such
a particular Bishop as the Doctor Characters; and such an one
as perhaps can no where be found.</p>
               <p>But after all this, I must minde him, That though these
his passages had indeed been perfectly contradictious to the
Objection; yet had they not been any Answer to it, for
the Objection was not founded upon them, (as he well
knows) but upon another passage, which shall presently
come in play. And though I should grant him, that he speaks
right in one part of his Book; yet that justifies not what he
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57586:32"/>
speaks wrong in another, but onely manifests his own contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.</p>
               <p>In his 2 Sect. he proceeds to the place out of which the
Objection was raised: which having propounded with more
Appertinences then needed, he makes this jolly challenge
<q>[Now let any one judge whether I call Episcopacy a Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or no]</q> Content Doctor; let any one judge, provided he
hath but the use of common sense and reason. These are your
words, in the Preface to your <hi>Mystery,</hi> upon which the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was built: <q>[<hi>Every faction</hi> will be content to be Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenists
(a pretty piece of presumption by the way, that all the
parties he afterward recites, will swallow his Millenian opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion)
upon condition that Christ may reign after their way
or mode: that is, in Calvinism, in Arminianism, in Papism,
in Anabaptism, in Quakerism, in Presbytery, in <hi>Episcopacy,</hi>
in Independency, and the like]</q> Is it not plain, that having
named <hi>Faction</hi> as the General, he descends to enumerate Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;
and among them, counts Episcopacy? If this be not
to call Episcopacy a Faction what is? Indeed he offers at an
evasion; which yet amounts onely to <hi>Dignum patellâ opercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</hi>
First he saith <q>[He propounds not all those ways as false
and illegitimate]</q> the more shame his: for if he counts them
not all <hi>Illegitimate,</hi> why did he muster them all under the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of faction? for whatsoever is faction, is doubtless <hi>Illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</hi>
Besides, the Objection was, that he called Episcopacy
a faction: and whether he counts <hi>all those ways</hi> false and illegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,
the Objector regards not: it's Episcopacy onely on
which he pitched.</p>
               <p>But that he did not propound all these ways, as such, he
would thus prove <q>[Since those that do so apparently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
one another, as Calvinism and Arminianism, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy,
Presbytery and Independency; some of them must
be true. As either Calvinism or Arminianism, in such points
as they contradict one another, must be true. And so of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57586:33"/>
these ways of government, some of them must be Right: for
it is intolerable wrong to have the Church destitute of all
Government]</q> If some of them must be <hi>Right,</hi> I demand
again, what made him presume to brand them all with the
name of <hi>Faction?</hi> But his way of arguing here, is wretchedly
fallacious: for it follows not, that some of these ways which
apparently contradict one another, must therefore be <hi>True</hi> or
<hi>Right.</hi> Do not Independency and Presbytery apparently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
one another in the point of Government. Is therefore
one of them True and Right? Had he reckoned up all sorts of
Government, he might plausibly have urged, that some one
of them must be Right and True: but he knows his Enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is not complete; and therefore he closeth up his list
with those words <hi>[and the like.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor will his next clause (As either Calvinism or Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,
in such points as they contradict one another, must be
true] serve his turn. For 1. though some points in one of
those parties may be true; yet others may be false: and so
that party, in the complex, not be true. 2. The Doctor, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his wont, slips from the Question: for the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is not of any particular Points of Doctrine in this or that
sect; but of the whole sect it self, and that chiefly in
Relation to Discipline and Government: and this he must needs
grant me, or else recall his last clause (for it is intolerable wrong
to have the Church destitute of all Government.) Now he
that enumerates sundry kinds of Government, must not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for so doing (especially when into the bargain he terms
them factions) be thought to hold any one of them to be
Right; because it's possible that all that he reckons up, may be
wrong. Nor, in case any one of them so enumerated, happen to
be indeed the Right; does it follow that he appears to believe
it so to be; unless, having made his enumeration, he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
declares his Judgement about that particular: which how
far D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi> was from doing, let the place in question speak.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:57586:33"/>
It is true in the beginning of the next (the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>) Section, he
saith (he hath already affirmed Episcopacy to be in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of good things) but where did he affirm this? In his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to his <hi>Mystery?</hi> why then does he not give us some ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the place? I confess in his <hi>Apology,</hi> in the foregoing
Section, something he saith whence it may be collected that
he there supposes Episcopacy to be a good thing: but he
knows the Objection was never made against his Apology.</p>
               <p>To come therefore to his next pretence; which follows in the
3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Section and runs thus <q>[This is all that can be elicited out
of this Paragraph (he means the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Section of his Preface, to
which the Objection relates) touching Episcopacy; <hi>not that
it is a faction,</hi> but that it may be factiously and partially ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged;
<hi>that is,</hi> unmeasurably, and disproportionably prized,
(as this Paragraph imports) as if the whole Millenian hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
consisted in Episcopacy: <hi>that is to say,</hi> That People
may so dote upon one good thing, that they may be dead
to, and careless of the flourishing of all the rest, and set up
their staff in that one. Which though it were Episcopacy
it self, it would be a factious and partial affection, and would
fall short of the end of the Gospel, which does equally aim at
the cherishing of all things that are essentially and indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably
Christian, such as I have enumerated in this Paragraph
in my description of the happy ages to come.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thy patience good Reader, whilst I survey these extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
impertinent lines. Still the Doctor is at his old trick, his
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and slinks from the Point in hand. The
Question is not, whether out of that Paragraph it may be eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
that Episcopacy <hi>Is a Faction:</hi> but whether the Doctor
<hi>calls it so</hi> or no, in that Paragraph; and this, by his favour,
may be elicited out of it.</p>
               <p>2. Episcopacy, <hi>as such,</hi> denotes nothing less then <hi>Partial
or factious management:</hi> but the Doctor in that Paragraph
speaks of Episcopacy, <hi>As such,</hi> namely, as different from Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57586:34"/>
Independency, &amp;c. How then can he here pretend,
that he meant onely the <hi>factious management</hi> of it? Besides;
is it not worthily said, and Doctor like, that the <hi>factious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of Episcopacy,</hi> is <hi>Episcopacy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That he saith It may be <hi>immeasurably and disproportionally
prized;</hi> that is, in his language, <hi>factiously;</hi> would be well
considered: for <hi>peribit sorex indicio suo.</hi> If you will trust him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for his meaning, it's this [that people may so dote upon
one good thing, that they may be dead and careless of the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
of all the rest, &amp;c.] as is before cited. And what, in
Gods name, is all this <hi>ad Rem?</hi> He is here speaking of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy
as a government of the Church; and he would have
us think that he believes now, and did believe when he wrote
that Preface, That this is the Right and true Government;
and that therefore though in his Preface it stands in the List of
<hi>Factions,</hi> yet he meant thereby no more, then that it may be
<hi>factiously managed,</hi> that is, <hi>immeasurably prized.</hi> Excellent!
<hi>It may be factiously managed,</hi> therefore it is to be rank'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the grossest <hi>Factions.</hi> But what <hi>may be, may not be:</hi>
Episcopacy may not be factiously managed; and in the essence
of that Government there is nothing factious, but signally
the contrary. It would pose the Doctor to shew any time
wherein it was factiously managed: the very constitution of
it being the properest Antidote against faction. Nay to give
him his own interpretation of <hi>factiously,</hi> let him shew if he can
when or where it was <hi>Immeasurably prized</hi> by the People. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
I demand, was it so prized, and factiously managed
at the time when he wrote his Preface? he cannot, sure have
the face to affirm this. Why doth he then obtrude this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
for his Apologie? Yea but though it were not then so
overprized, haply it may be hereafter. May it so? God
giant say I, that it ever be prized so much as it ought to be!
But I deny, that it can ever be <hi>Immeasurably prized:</hi> for the
highest value that can be set upon it, is to esteem it <hi>The most
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57586:34"/>
incomparably excellent Church-government, and of divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</hi>
Now this estimation of it is no more then due and
just; as will upon Occasion be verified <hi>malgrè</hi> all that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  <hi>More</hi> can muster up to the contrary. Nor will this estimation
render People <hi>dead and careless</hi> (as he slanderously intimates)
<hi>of the flourishing of all</hi> or any of the rest of the things that are
<hi>essentially and indispensably Christian.</hi> For the due esteem of a
Divine Institution, is no hinderance to Faith, Devotion, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Innocency, Faithfulness, Charity, Obedience, mutual
Condescention, unspotted Righteousness, Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
are the Duties he mentions in his description of the happy
Ages to come. People therefore may <hi>set up their staff in this
one,</hi> without any danger: for the Question here, is of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government:
and if People imbrace that which is <hi>incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
the best,</hi> they may and ought to set up their staff in that,
and in that alone, notwithstanding any of his Arguments to
deter them from it.</p>
               <p>For as for his Cavil in the former Section, drawn from <hi>1 Cor.
1. 12, One saith I am of Paul, another I am of Apollos</hi> and
therefore <hi>A good thing may be factiously followed:</hi> it's but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his wonted Cheats. 1. He makes <hi>following of Persons,</hi>
in that Text, to be <hi>following of things.</hi> 2. He substitutes
that for the Corinths fault, which was not. They were not
to blame for following <hi>Paul, Apollo, Cephas,</hi> or <hi>Christ;</hi> but
that some of them followed some one of these in contradistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from the rest. Now to follow <hi>Paul</hi> in opposition of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo;
Apollo,</hi> in opposition to <hi>Cephas;</hi> yea or <hi>Christ</hi> himself
in opposition to his Apostles; is plain faction. For as God
sent Christ, so Christ sent his Apostles; and the Church is
built upon Christ as the corner stone, and on his Apostles, as
foundation stones laid next to him. Wherefore he that holds
not Communion both with Christ, and his Apostles, but
picks out some one of them to adhere to, in Contradistinction
to the rest, is guilty of faction. Now Bishops succeeding Christ
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57586:35"/>
and his Apostles; if any shall adhere to this or that Bishop in
contradistinction to the rest, it is faction, but to adhere to Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy,
in contradistinction to any other Church-government;
or to prize it as the most excellent above all other; is so far
from being factious, that it is perfectly the contrary.</p>
               <p>If the Doctor will still reply, that some men may so far
<hi>Dote upon Episcopacy,</hi> as to think that their magnifying this
onely Government will serve their turn as to Religion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Faith, Hope, or Charity. I must retort, that I am not
to answer for Doaters: and as for men in their wits, they can
never think so. I have heard of some who fancied that Faith
alone would save them: but never of any who dreamt they
should be saved merely for preferring and adhering to Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
before any other Church-government. Sure I am, that
the noblest examples of Piety in all ages of the Church, have
been those who were Honourers of Episcopacy: and if some
Episcopal men (as they call them) be now vitious, it springs
from some other root, then their <hi>being Episcopal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, I observe that all this part of the Doctors Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
runs upon the Peoples immeasurable prizing of Episcopacy:
and this he will have to be the partial or factious <hi>Management
of Episcopacy. Risum teneatis!</hi> I for my part thought, that
the management (whether good or bad) of Episcopacy, had
been by the Bishops: but D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi> informs me that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
manage it.</p>
               <p>In his 5. Sect. I presume he found himself at very good lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
for he gives us good store of verses out of <hi>Spencer,</hi>
wherein he saith, he describes the effect of the extirpation of
Episcopacy, upon the Presbyters themselves. And I care not if
I be so idle upon this Opportunity of thrusting some verses also
upon the Reader: which D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi> I hope will not take amiss,
seeing I borrow them out of his own Poem intituled <hi>The Life
of the Soul,</hi> and printed <hi>A. D.</hi> 1647. There in his 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Canto
he thus describes the <hi>Kings Chappel,</hi> representing the Altar,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57586:35"/>
by a green Turf, <hi>Stanza</hi> 58. the Tapers, by Torchwort, and
the Pulpit and Cushion by an hollow Oak and moss. <hi>Stanza</hi> 59.
The Choristers on either side, and Boreas for the Organ above,
<hi>Stanza</hi> 60. the Eagle, or <hi>King</hi> in his lofty Cabinet at the west
end. <hi>Stanza</hi> 61. Then that he may not seem to forget the
Bishops, he brings in one of them, for the Preacher, in these
lines:</p>
               <lg n="1">
                  <head>62</head>
                  <l>After a song loud chanted by that Quire</l>

                  <l>Comes out a <hi>gay Pie</hi> in his rich attire:</l>

                  <l>As if some Deity he did adore,</l>
                  <l>And seemly gestures make courting the Heavenly Power.</l>

                  <l>With eyes on the square sod devoutly bent.</l>
                  <l>Then with short flight up to the Oak he springs,</l>
                  <l>Where he thrice congied after his ascent</l>
                  <l>With posture chang'd from th' East to th' Occident;</l>
                  <l>Thrice bow'd he down, and eas'ly thrice he rose:</l>
                  <l>Bow'd down so low, as if't had been's intent</l>
                  <l>On the green Moss to wipe his swarthy Nose</l>

               </lg>
               <p>By this stuff, there will be no great question made, but the
Doctor, was in reference to Episcopacy, the very same in verse
<hi>An.</hi> 1647. which he is in prose in that Section of his Preface
<hi>An.</hi> 1660. But now <hi>he hastens</hi> as he saith, to the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Objection,
and I will be at his heels.

Objection. 4.</q>
[He affirms, that Church-discipline should comprehend
onely the generally acknowledged Articles of the Christian
faith, and plain indispensable duties of life. Which overthrows
all authority concerning things Indifferent. Pref. pag. 18. 19.]</p>
               <p>To this he answers <q>[All that those passages contain which

in this paragraph: That the main end of Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Discipline, is the countenancing and promoting
the Christian life, and an holy observation of <hi>such precepts
of Christ as do not make men obnoxious to the secular Power by
transgressing them;</hi> to keep out also Idolatry and every
Errour and superstitious Practise that tends to the supplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or defeating the power of the Gospel; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>we ought</hi> rather to be solicitous about <hi>managing</hi> this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
to the right end, then to disturb the peace of the
Church by an <hi>overscrupulous</hi> examination of the exteriour
frame thereof.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Before I follow him farther, I must needs set a note upon
what he begins to broach here. The Churches power, he saith,
is mainly intended to countenance and promote the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of (such of Christs Precepts, as do not make men obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the secular power by transgressing them) Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that such precepts, even of Christ himself, as do make
men obnoxious to the secular power by transgressing them;
are no part of those precepts whose observation the Church
is chiefly to countenance and promote by her power and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.
In case therefore the Civil Magistrate, being a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
and Godly Prince, laies his strict commands on his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
to be diligent observers of both Tables, and chiefly of
the weightiest matters therein; injoyning them to live in all
Godliness, Temperance, Justice, Charity, Peaceableness, and
Obedience to that Government both civil and ecclesiastical;
with addition of sanctions of severe punishments on all profane
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57586:36"/>
drunken, riotous, filthy, seditious, factious livers; Because
these precepts of Christ (for that so they are, I hope the
Doctor will grant) must in this case always make men <hi>obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the secular power by transgressing them;</hi> therefore the
<hi>countenancing and promoting</hi> of an holy observation of such
Godly Temperance, Justice, Charity, Peaceableness and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to Governours ecclesiastical and civil, is no part of
the <hi>main end</hi> of Church-government and Discipline. What
a strange discipline pleaseth this Man! How much the more is
the Church-discipline bound to countenance and promote the
observation of those such Precepts of Christ, which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
knowing to be the chief, makes it his chief care also;
although by transgressing them, the transgressours will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to the secular power? Besides; why in promoting
the observation of Christs Precept of fleeing, and keeping
out Idolatry (which the Doctor in the next word instances as
a part of the main end of Church-government) may not (by
his leave) that very Precept (under Godly and religious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
make men obnoxious to the secular Power, by transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it? And so he would, and would not, almost in the same
breath, have that a part of the main care of Church-gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.
And now I will attend him in his Dance.</p>
               <p>He adds <q>[To keep out also all Idolatry and every Errour
and superstitious practise that tends to the supplanting or
defeating the power of the Gospel.]</q> Be it so: grant this
a main end of Church-government. I hereupon demand,
whether that Errour that infers Schisms, Distractions, and the
greatest uncharitableness; be not a principal way of <hi>defeating
the power of the Gospel?</hi> If it be, then those Governours who
manage the Church-government so as to oppose strictly, and
stoutly suppress that Errour that infers schisms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
it sutably to a main end thereof. But the Errour of the
Brethren who winch and kick against Church-government,
most sadly hath of late, and always will in some degree here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57586:37"/>
after, infer Schisms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore strictly to oppose and
stoutly to suppress that Errour, sutes a main end of the
Church-government. How miserably impertinent then are
the Doctors last words <q>[Therefore <hi>we ought</hi> rather to be
solicitous about managing the Government to the <hi>right
end,</hi> then <hi>disturb the peace of the Church</hi> by an <hi>overscrupulous</hi>
examination of the outward form thereof.]</q> The <hi>Right End</hi>
of Church-government, is, the preservation of unity in the
Church: and is Unity, or the Peace of the Church, <hi>disturbed</hi>
by any, though the exactest examination, even of the outward
form thereof? Let the Doctor examine it, as much as he
will; the more the better; for had he duly examin'd it, he
would have shewed more manners towards it.</p>
               <p>But the sport is: the Doctor here supposes himself to be
one of those that manage the Church-government. <q>[<hi>We
ought,</hi> saith he, rather to be solicitous about <hi>Managing the
Government</hi> to the right end, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ]</q> and therefore whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
blame he casts upon the management; he casts upon
himself. 'Tis true, when he is in his Tub, he thinks himself
fit to direct the whole Christian Church; and sutably inscribes
the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book of his <hi>Mystery, Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the Guides of Christendom:</hi> but though he be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
God be thanked he is not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> none of those
whom it concerns to manage the Government; for this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Bishops, not to him, or to the People. Which
being notorious and clear; doth the Doctor fear that these
Governours themselves will so <hi>overscrupulously examine</hi> the
outward form of the Government, as to disturb thereby the
Peace of the Church? <hi>Logi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He proceeds [And again in the same page at the end, in
this parag. reaching also into the following page, <q>[That
the <hi>first and chief point is,</hi> to make a right choice of the
Object of this Church-discipline: which is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
nothing but what is sound and purely Apostolical,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57586:37"/>
that is, The indisputable Truths of our Religion, such as
we are sure to be the minde of Christ and his Apostles;
namely, <hi>The generally acknowledged Articles of the Christian
faith, and plain and indispensable Duties of life.</hi> For these
are such as deserve to be held up with all possible care and
strictness: Other things <hi>so gently recommended</hi> that no
conscientious Man may <hi>be pinched</hi> thereby.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>If the Reader here ask, <hi>The first and chief point</hi> of what? he
may guess if he can: for the Doctor tells him not, either here,
or in his Preface. He cannot reasonably mean, The first and
chief point <hi>of Church-discipline;</hi> for the Object of that Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
must be made choise of and fixed by the Authour of that
Discipline, before the Discipline it self can be exercised: and
is therefore in the nature of the thing, precedent to the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
it self. Yet what else he should mean who can divine?</p>
               <p>But what if he asks also, <hi>Who should make the right choise of the
object of Church-discipline?</hi> I see not upon the Doctors grounds,
what possible Answer he could give, without first supposing
That the Church was for some time without Government and
Discipline, and in that time was to deliberate what Object to
choose: for till she had an Object of Government resolved
on, she could have no Government. Indeed by the obvious
sense of the Doctors words, one would think that when he
wrote them, the choise of this Object was not made, or not
made aright. But whether the Doctor knows, or will know,
so much or no; the Christian Church never stood at a gaze
or muse, touching the Object, and the right Object, of her
Government and Discipline.</p>
               <p>Yet let us hear from this Oracle, what that Object must be,
he saith <q>[It must comprehend nothing but what is sound
and purely, <hi>&amp;c. i. e.</hi> The generally acknowledged Articles
of the Christian Faith, and plain indispensable Duties of
life.]</q> What he means by Articles of Faith <hi>generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,</hi>
who can tell? If he means, such as were received by
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57586:38"/>
all Churches and Councils, reputed sound Members of the
Church Catholick; he should have done well to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
it. But he hath so ordered his words, that if it may
serve his turn at a pinch hereafter, he can notwithstanding
what he writes here, wave or deny any such Articles when the
Church shall require his Assent; because some Hereticks or
other have opposed them, and so they were not <hi>Generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>indispensable duties of life,</hi> (which is the second part
of his object,) it is but just to <hi>ask him,</hi> what are such? or how
there can be any such? for if (as he lays for a Principle) the
main End of Church-Government and Discipline, be the
countenancing and promoting the Christian Life, in an holy
Observation of <hi>such Precepts of Christ, as do not make men ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to the secular Power by transgressing them:</hi> Then, in
case a secular Princes Laws shall lay hold of a Christian, by
reason of any one, or of all Christs Precepts; the main end
of the Church-Governours Office, makes it not their duty to
countenance and promote the Observation of any such of
Christs Precepts. And is not this in effect to make all the
Precepts of Christ dispensable upon occasion? Could the
prime Visier now perswade the Emperors Subjects to imbrace
this Doctrine, it would much easier bring the grand Signiours
designe to pass, then all his Armies. Now I can devise no
imaginable Evasion for the Doctor, but in that word <hi>(the
main end.)</hi> Whence perhaps he will pretend, that one end,
though not the main, of Church-Government, is to promote
the Observation of Christs Precepts, whether they make men
obnoxious to the secular Power, or no. But will he dare to
stick to this? Will he profess, that to promote the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christs Precepts, is a petty end of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and by the by? If he doth, yet even this fetch will not
clearly carry him off, For,</p>
               <p>First, He makes a distinction of such of Christs Precepts
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57586:38"/>
as render men obnoxious to the secular Power, from such
as do not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In respect of the later sort of Precepts, he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that it is the main end of Church-Government, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
their Observation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Therefore he necessarily leaves the former sort in
a looser condition, and dispensable by the Governours. For
certainly what is indispensable, belongs to the main end of
their Government; But if they may take their liberty, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those costly and dangerous Precepts of Christ, and be not
indispensably bound to promote and press their Observation,
(and that so they are not bound, the Doctor signifies by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction)
it follows, that they may in this case dispense, and
leave the people to save their skins or purses, by making bold
with Christs Precepts.</p>
               <p>Well but however, the Doctor grants the ground of the
Objection to be truly alledged: onely he would perswade us
that this <hi>overthrows not all Authority in things Indifferent.</hi>
For, <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. he saith, <q>[The premised passages administer
matter for a due solution.]</q> And then he adds, That in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(the object of Church-Discipline, is to comprehend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but what is sound and purely Apostolical: <hi>viz.</hi> the
generally acknowledged Articles of the Christian Faith, and
plain indispensable Duties of Life.) His meaning is, <q>[That
we should not make the lesser things and the more dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable,
and such as are but of humane Institution and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
the main object upon which Church-Discipline
is exercised; but the general acknowledged Articles of the
Christian Faith, and plain and indispensable Duties of Life,
such as we are exhorted to by Christ and his Apostles.
For this is really for the Glory of the Gospel, the security
of mens souls, in the conduct of them to Heaven; and also
for their comfortable abode here upon earth.]</q> Is not this
pretty? His Position was, That the Object of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57586:39"/>
                  <hi>must comprehend nothing but</hi> the generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
Articles of Faith, and indispensable Duties of
Life. Doth not this apparently exclude all things else?
Yet he professeth here, that he meant onely, That those
should be the <hi>Principal and main Object.</hi> So, he said
One thing; and, if you will believe him, he meant
Another.</p>
               <p>But that he meant not thus, is evident enough by the
words he added in that former Paragraph, <hi>viz. (Other things</hi>
(suppose the <hi>lesser</hi> and <hi>more dispensable,</hi> as being of humane
Institution) <hi>are to be so gently recommended, that no consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious
man may be pinched thereby.)</hi> Now if all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
Articles of Faith and indispensable Duties of Life, must
onely be <hi>Recommended;</hi> then must they not be <hi>Commanded;</hi>
and so they will prove no object of the Churches Discipline.
Nay the Doctor will have them Recommended, yet but
<hi>Gently,</hi> (doth not this look like an Act of Discipline?) and
<hi>so as not to pinch conscientious men.</hi> I know who will
owe him immortal thanks for this Doctrine: which (if it
be sound) any Non-conformist may pretend <hi>Conscience,</hi>
and cry out of being <hi>Pinched,</hi> and then he ought to have his
liberty.</p>
               <p>But the Doctor forgets not to interpret this passage also,
and in effect he tells us, that by <hi>Gently Recommended;</hi> his
meaning was, <hi>Commanded.</hi> For thus he expounds these
words, <q>[Other things so gently recommended, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious
men may not be pinched thereby; that is to say,
That the <hi>like severity</hi> is not to be used in things that are not
of so indispensable a nature.]</q> And who doubts of this?
but to <hi>Recommend,</hi> and <hi>Gently,</hi> and so gently as no man may
<hi>be pinched;</hi> is, I take it, <hi>No severity at all,</hi> (nay no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline
at all) so far is it from being a <hi>like degree of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
to that which is used in points indispensable. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
by <hi>Gently Recommending;</hi> the Doctor meant, a less
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57586:39"/>
degree of severe Discipline. He hath most aenigmatick
meanings.</p>
               <p>Nor can I pass by those other words of his without a note,
<q>[For this <hi>(viz.</hi> that the Articles of Faith and indispensable
Duties of Life, should be the object of Discipline) is really
for the glory of the Gospel, the security of mens souls, in
the conduct of them to Heaven, and also for their comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
abode here on earth.]</q> It seems then, in the Doctors
Judgement, That the due observance of Ecclesiastick Laws
in things indifferent, <hi>is not really for the glory of the Gospel,</hi>
nor for <hi>security of mens souls in the way to Heaven.</hi> Tell the
people this; and with what better Argument for Schism and
Faction, can you furnish them? for why should they trouble
themselves to submit to that which <hi>is not really</hi> for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels
glory, nor their safe passage to Heaven? D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them (if they will but have wit enough to understand him
right) that their Disobedience to the Churches Laws, is no
<hi>real</hi> impediment of their salvation, or of the Gospels glory.
Nay this is not all: Do the people desire <hi>a comfortable abode
on earth?</hi> the same Doctor hath kindly signified to them,
that the like Disobedience is <hi>no real</hi> impediment to this
neither.</p>
               <p>And let him not pretend, that I here wrest his words
to an odious sense: for if there be any sense at all in that
part of his Argumentation, I have done him no wrong.
If obedience to the Churches Laws, be <hi>really</hi> for the Gospels
glory, the promotion of our salvation, and our comfortable
abode upon earth; as in truth it is. Then ought it to be <hi>held
up with all possible care and strictness,</hi> and to be a part of the
main object of the Churches Discipline. But the Doctor ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,
That the Articles of Faith and indispensable Duties of
Life, are onely that <hi>main object; For this (viz.</hi> that they
onely should be the main object) is, saith he, <hi>really</hi> for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Gospel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Reason of his, is no Reason, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57586:40"/>
less he means, That the other is <hi>not really so:</hi> seeing if it were
<hi>really so,</hi> it might by his own very Reason, be part of that main
object.</p>
               <p>In the same 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> he thus proceeds: <q>[I think it is
<hi>pretty plain</hi> already, that I do not affirm, that Church-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline
should comprehend onely the generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
Articles of the Christian Faith, and plain indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
Duties of Life.]</q> His words were, That <hi>it is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
Nothing but them.</hi> These words are more then <hi>pretty
plain;</hi> and he cannot deny that so he wrote. How <hi>pretty
plain</hi> then is it which he saith here, let any one judge who is
capable of understanding a Contradiction.</p>
               <p>But still he is confident, that he did in his former Book,
establish and leave intire Church-Authority in things Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
Which saith he, (<hi>Sect.</hi> 8.) <q>[No man could make
any question of, did he but compare one part of my Preface
with another; as that which occurs <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. at the close,
&amp;c.]</q> Had it been true, That in some part of his Preface he
doth establish that Authority, or leave it intire, (which he will
hardly prove,) yet the Objection was justly made: for why
may he in any part of his Book undermine or deny this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?
I could weary the Reader with instances where this
Doctor writes repugnantly to himself. Is it therefore justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in him to write what he lists in one place against the
Church, because in another place he doth or may seem to
write for her? What is this, but to give his Mother a Bit
and a Knock? But in these Repugnancies, his Proselytes
know well enough which is indeed his meaning: They are not
to seek where he speaks what he would have them believe; and
where he speaks what may preserve him from being <hi>obnoxious
to the secular Power.</hi> Or if any of them be so dull as not to
discover this, and therefore may take offence; the Doctor
may full as rationally Apologize for himself to his offended
Brethren, out of one sort of passages in his Writings; as he
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57586:40"/>
doth to his Reader here out of the other sort.</p>
               <p>But let us see, what he would have us here <hi>compare</hi> in his
Preface, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>[That which occurs <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. at the close
thereof: (There shall be nothing held essential or funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,
but the indispensable Law of the Christian Life,
and that Doctrine that depends not upon the fallible Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of men, but is plainly set down in the Scripture;
other things being left to the free Commendation of the
Church, ensnaring no mans Conscience, nor Lording it
over the Flock of Christ) and still holding on in the next
<hi>Section</hi> (which certainly they do, that call those things An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian
that are not, and thereby make more Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
then Christ and his Apostles. Which Errour is the very
effence and substance of Antichristianism, and of that grand
Apostacy of the Church.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having said this, he falls into his wonted fit; for he adds,
<q>[Can there be any thing more express and pertinent for the
Vindication of the Power and Liberty of the Church, in
appointing things Indifferent then this?]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yes surely, good Doctor, there may. All that you leave
here to the Church touching things Indifferent, is, <hi>to Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
them.</hi> It had been more express and pertinent, if you
had left her Power <hi>to Command them.</hi> But to see the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckiness
of it; The Doctor here makes the Doctrine touching
the Churches Authority in things Indifferent, to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinct
from those <hi>Doctrines which are plainly set down in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:</hi>
Whereas Scripture Commands in several places, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to our spiritual Governours; which Obedience necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
includes in the object of it things Indifferent; unless the
Doctor can shew us, where such Commands are limited and
restrained to things Essential and Fundamental. And in
truth, that is most properly said to be Obedience to our
spiritual Governours, which is done in things Indifferent
for things Necessary, are the express Commands of God;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57586:41"/>
to which we owe Obedience whether our Governours urge
them upon us or no.</p>
               <p>The next passage he would have us compare, is in the close
of the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 
                  <q>[But it is manifest, that all the zealous
Corrivals, &amp;c. ]</q> What is here, to prove the Churches
Power in Indifferent things? he blames those who <hi>decry
things for Antichristian, which of themselves are innocent
and of an indifferent nature: and those also, who obtrude
Opinions that are worse then Indifferent.</hi> Where by the way
you may observe, That this exact Doctor first speaks kindly
of things Indifferent; for he vouchsafeth to stile them <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent:</hi>
yet in the next Line, talks of Opinions <hi>worse then
Indifferent,</hi> that is, <hi>worse then Innocent.</hi> But his blaming
either the one or the other, either the Decryers or the
Obtruders; makes nothing for asserting the Power of the
Church in things Indifferent; seeing either of those sorts of
men may be blameable, whether the Church hath any such
Power, or no.</p>
               <p>Lastly he adds, <q>[And at the close of the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> where
having first suggested, that nothing can so well secure the
peace of the Clergy, and make them impregnable, as the
using of their Power, and the exercising of their Discipline,
in the behalf of such Truths and Rites as are plainly and
confessedly Apostolical; and the being more facil and easie in
additional Circumstances, and quite cutting off all useless
and intangling Opinions; I at last add, Which one plain
and generous Rule of Government, is the most effectual
means imaginable of making the world good, &amp;c.—) which
Clause cannot be made good, unless there be in the Church
a Power of appointing and determining the Modes and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of publick Worship Which sith they may be
various, and yet all sorts of them decent, and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
which to choose; it is assuredly left to Authority to
determine the choice, and others ought to submit thereto.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57586:41"/>
                     <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order.</hi> So abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
evident it is, That it never came into my minde to
take away that Right of Commanding things Indifferent,
from publick authority. And thus I think I have fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
this 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Objection.</hi>]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Art thou not satisfied Reader; and fully, touching the
4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Objection?</hi> The Doctor would have the Church <hi>facil and
easie in additional Circumstances:</hi> therefore he asserts her
Power in determining things before Indifferent. Nay he
would have her <hi>quite cut off useless and intangling Opinions:</hi>
and is not this also, To exercise Power in Indifferent things?
As for the Clause he speaks of, it may be made good, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
granting any such Power in the Church.</p>
               <p>For 1. Useless and intangling Opinions, are not in the
class of things Indifferent, but plainly condemned by Scripture:
wherefore to cut off these, supposeth not such a Power touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Indifferent Points.</p>
               <p>2. The facility and easiness of the Church in additional Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances;
argues not any such Power, but rather implies the
contrary: namely, that she hath no right strictly to Command,
but onely gently to Recommend.</p>
               <p>But all this while, the Doctor onely manageth a slie jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
and pretending to compare the places of his Preface, he
gives us instead of a faithfull honest Citation, a mangled and
adulterate one. Here you see his words run thus [—cutting
off all useless and intangling Opinions, I at last add, which one
plain and generous Rule, &amp;c.] But in his Preface, next after
<hi>intangling Opinions,</hi> and immediately before, <hi>which plain and
generous rule,</hi> &amp;c. he hath these Lines: <q>[For hereby will
their Opposers manifestly be found to fight against God and
his Christ, while they contest with his Ministers, who <hi>urge
nothing</hi> upon the people, but what was <hi>plainly taught and
practised by himself and his Apostles, whose ways and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
are so sacred, that they ought to be kept up with all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57586:42"/>
severity.</hi>
                  </q> The Doctor knew this passage would but ill-favouredly
grin upon the Bravado he meant to conclude with;
wherefore he wondrous wisely omitted it. For if Church-Governours
are to urge nothing upon the people, but what
was plainly taught and practised by Christ and his Apostles;
then are they not to urge things in themselves Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
and if they may not urge them, what doth their power
signifie?
<q>Object. 5.</q>
(<hi>He terms Christs Divine Nature, that Passive contemptible Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
which lodged in him,</hi> lib. 5. c. 1. sect. 5.)</p>
               <p>The Doctors own words were, <hi>That passive contemptible
Divinity which lodged in him.</hi> Upon these the Objection was
founded. His Answer here in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> is, That by Christs
<hi>Divinity,</hi> he means Christs <hi>deiform Humanity.</hi> And that this
was his meaning, he first appeals to his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Book,</hi> 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Chap.
Sect. 3.</hi> Now though he had spoke soberly in his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Book,</hi>
this cannot justifie him for speaking wildly in his 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Book.</hi>
However let us hear his words, and see whether they will
be his sufficient Compurgators. <q>[How should it ever come
into the minde of a meer natural man, to think of an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
passive, soul-melting, self-afflicting and self-resigning
Divinity lodging in any person: or if it did, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] then he
adds, [Can it come into the minde of any man to think, that
I understand this humble, passive, self-afflicting and self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resigning
Divinity, of the second Hypostasis of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the eternal and immaterial logos? but I compare here
the Character of Christ with that of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> who affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a kinde of Divinity: and <hi>philostratus</hi> indeavoured to set
him out accordingly.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Objector never charged him, That he spake those
words, of the eternal logos; nor did it come into his minde,
so to think. This clamour therefore of the Doctor [<hi>Can it
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57586:42"/>
come into the minde of any man,</hi> &amp;c.] is impertinent. But I
must be bold to tell him, That though in the next (the
10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Section</hi>) he expounds those words of <hi>(that most lovely
and amiable Divine Spirit lodging in our Saviour)</hi> yet to term
that <hi>Divine Spirit,</hi> by the name of <hi>Divinity,</hi> ill sutes with
the Theological Dialect: and besides, may be very scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to his Philosophers, at whose Conversion he pretends
that Book doth very much aim. Nor will it less scandalize
them, that he calls <hi>Divinity, deiform Humanity;</hi> or <hi>deiform
Humanity, Divinity.</hi> Such Notions and Phrases, are very
likely to startle his rational <hi>Monsieurs;</hi> and perhaps cause the
enemies of the Lord, not onely to mock, but to blaspheme,
when they hear a grave Professor of Theologie, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
<hi>Divinity</hi> to be <hi>Humanity,</hi> though with any annexed
Epithete.</p>
               <p>Next he repeats (in his 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Sect.</hi>) the whole <hi>Section</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Objector; vouching it to have no other <hi>Meaning</hi>
then what he declared touching the former place in his
4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Book.</hi> I will not swear for D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi>'s <hi>Meaning,</hi> of all the
men I know living. Look we therefore to the words, <q>[He
whom they numbred amongst the Transgressours, and took
to be the vilest of men, because he was not recommended
by any thing that the Animal life likes and applauds, (as
nobleness of birth, the power of popular Eloquence,
Honour, Wealth, Authority, high Education, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Courtship, Pleasantness of Conversation, and the
like.</q>)</p>
               <p>Stay stay Doctor, you must not run away with this. What
was not Christ recommended by <hi>Nobleness of Birth,</hi> who was
descended of the noblest stock in all the Nation where he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?
Not by the <hi>Power of popular Eloquence,</hi> I mean, such
Eloquence, as mightily, even to admiration, prevailed upon
the people, though the Gospel notes that the people pressed
to hear him, S. <hi>Luc. 5. 1.</hi> that <hi>the common people heard him
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57586:43"/>
gladly,</hi> S. <hi>Marc.</hi> 12. 37. that the Pharisees Officers sent to
apprehend him, were so ravished with his discourse, that they
durst not seize him, but acknowledged to their Masters, <hi>That

though <hi>he taught as one that had authority, and not as the
Scribes.</hi> S. <hi>Marc.</hi> 1. 22. Yea though he commanded and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
tempests and devils to obey him? Not by <hi>Beauty;</hi> who
(though <hi>despectus &amp; ignobilis quando pendebat in Cruce,</hi> as
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Ierom</hi> notes upon that in <hi>Esay</hi> 53. 2. yet) was <hi>fairer then
the children of men,</hi> Psal. 45. 2? Not by <hi>pleasantness of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation:</hi>

                  <hi>Matt. 11. v.</hi> 18, 19? Nay more,
<hi>Lib. 5. C.</hi> 11. S. 9. he denies, that Christ had the knowledge
of Philosophy. It is strange how the Doctor should slump
into this ugly humour of impudent vilifying our blessed
Lord, even where he pretends to magnifie him! but now lets
hear the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>[He is I say, notwithstanding this general contempt from
men, very highly prized by him who is the infallible Judge,
<hi>whose waies are not as our waies, nor his thoughts as our
thoughts;</hi> but that he might conform our apprehensions to
his own, raised Jesus from the dead, bringing <hi>that passive
contemptible Divinity that lodged in him,</hi> into a deserved vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
and triumph.]</q> If by Divinity here, he means (as
before he affirms he doth) Christs <hi>deiform Humanity:</hi> besides
the wilde uncoothness, and unsavoury scandalousness of the
Expression. I demand how <hi>Christs Humanity</hi> (dressed with
the Epithete <hi>Deiform,</hi> or what else you will) can be <hi>lodged in
Christ?</hi> for he saith this Divinity, that is, his Humanity was
<hi>lodged in him.</hi> As the Soul and Body are one Man; so the
Divinity and Humanity are one Christ. Now is it good
sense to say, the body of such a man, is lodged in that
man? yet just the same sense is that in the Doctors ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:57586:43"/>
But the entire <hi>Section</hi> considered, he presumes that many
passages in it will evince, That he could not mean the
divine nature of Christ, by his Divinity: and if so, the
Objection chargeth him unjustly. I answer, The Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
expresly chargeth him, not with what he meant, but
what he said. He said, the Divinity lodged in Christ,
was passive and contemptible: Now neither the Objector,
nor any sound Catholick Christian knows of any <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
any Divinity in Christ, but his divine Nature. I grant,
Christs Humanity abounded with divine Virtues; and that
it was anointed (as the Doctor in his Reply mentions)
with the Oyl of Gladness more eminently then his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:
Yet still it was but his Humanity, and not to be
styled by that name which signifies his Nature as he is
God. Again, I grant, that by these Virtues and this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
he was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as he was man; yet that
participation of the divine nature, is no ground to call his
Manhood, Divinity. For imagine D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi> never so vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
and thereby (in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> phrase) <hi>Partaker of
the Divine Nature;</hi> were it tolerable therefore to say,
That he hath <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> lodged in him? or that his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(which is Humanity) may therefore be styled
Divinity?</p>
               <p>Lastly, Concerning his calling the Divinity which was
lodged in Christ, <hi>Contemptible;</hi> he answers, <q>[That he
doth not term it, in the other sense, Contemptible,
but condemn others for accounting it so.]</q> What is that
<hi>other sense?</hi> he hath not yet mentioned two senses of
<hi>Contemptible;</hi> thither then it cannot be referred. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it must be the other sense of <hi>Divine Nature in
Christ:</hi> and so I conceive his meaning is, That he called
not the divine nature of Christ (or his Divinity) that is,
his deiform Humanity, Contemptible. Now what is this,
but plainly to deny, what he plainly said? for let him
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57586:44"/>
understand it in what sense he will, <hi>Contemptible</hi> was one of
the Epithets which he clapped upon it. Had he said, <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi>
who would have quarrelled with him? for our Lords
enemies did most notoriously contemn him: but their
crime was, that they Contemned him who was not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.
The Scripture tells us of some who despised
God: will the Doctor therefore call God <hi>Despicable?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, The Doctor cannot deny the words which
the Objection charges him with, to be in the place cited by
the Objector. Nor did the Objector make any Comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or inference from those words; but barely represented them,
upon supposal that Christs Divinity, was Christs divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Whether the Doctor hath made all whole, by expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and denying; <hi>viz.</hi> by expounding Divinity to signifie
deiform Humanity, and by denying that he called it Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
though he did so call it, is not difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>

What ayls the man then to abuse his Reader with stuff which

               </p>
               <p>Surely had he intended an honest and punctual account, his

his Heresie was, in that he held <hi>No real and physical

the Doctor is: As if it were some question whether he might

speaks in his Creed [As the reasonable Soul and Flesh is one
man, so God and man is one Christ] and what is this but a
<hi>real and physical Union, such as is betwixt the Body and the Soul?</hi>
the reason of this shiness, will appear hereafter.</p>
               <p>Mean while, suppose <hi>Nestorius</hi> held no real and physical
Union of Christs 2 Natures, such as is of our Body and Soul;
<hi>i. e.</hi> an union into one Person. Yet he professes, in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned

upon examination, whether what the Doctor writes in his
<hi>Mystery,</hi> will amount to any nearer Union then that which
<hi>Nestorius</hi> himself pleads to have acknowledged. He adds
other Citations, 1. Out of <hi>Photius.</hi> 2. Out of the Collection

that I will spare my self the trouble of searching whether
he hath faithfully produced them or no; and be content to
take them upon his word.</p>
               <p>For by the Doctors leave, these passages affirm not that
<hi>Nestorius</hi> held <hi>two separate Hypostases</hi> in Christ, though the
Doctor would pin that sense upon them. All that may seem
to favour his Assertion, is in the first Citation; which saith,
That <hi>Nestorius</hi> cut and divided Christ <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>into two
Hypostases:</hi> but it saith not, <hi>Into two separate Hypostases.</hi> Nor
could it truly say so, seeing it appears by <hi>Nestorius</hi> his own
words (which I have alledged above) that he professed a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
of the two Hypostases: and where there is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> there
may be <hi>distinction</hi> indeed, but not <hi>separation.</hi> Wherefore
those following words in the Citation out of <hi>Photius,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>)
must signifie onely distinction, and by no means <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi>
(namely, that God and man were not united in one
Hypostasis, though otherwise they did most closely cohere,)
unless <hi>Photius</hi> understood <hi>Nestorius</hi> his minde, better then <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius</hi>
himself.</p>
               <p>In the next place, <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. for perfectly quitting himself
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57586:45"/>
of <hi>Nestorianism,</hi> (which heresie he falsly presumes that he
hath truly stated,) he brings several passages, opposite (as he
saith) thereunto, out of the 1 <hi>Book</hi> of his <hi>Mysterie, cap. 5. &amp;
Book 5. cap. 17. &amp; Book 10. cap. 6.</hi> But what is all this to the
6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Objection</hi> founded upon <hi>Book 6. cap. 15?</hi> If he happens to
speak Catholickly in some places, is that a justification for
his speaking the contrary in others? Let us therefore now
see what he saith, (after this long Proem) to the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it self; which is this, as he sets it down in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> of
this <hi>Chapter.</hi>
                  <q>Object. 6.</q>
(<hi>He brings in an humane person of Christ,</hi> lib. 6. c. 15. sect. 1.
p. 258. <hi>and afterwards, without any mincing, calls it so ten
times in that Chapter, and several times afterwards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Doctor having produced this <hi>Objection,</hi> falls upon a
piece of ingenuity; which being a rarity, I will do him so
much right as to note it: For he saith, <q>[I will also add,
what was hinted to me at second hand out of <hi>Book 9. Ch. 2.
Sect. 6.</hi> where I declare, How that the Humanity of
Christ, and the eternal Word, may be Hypostatically uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
without any contradiction to humane Reason unsophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticated
with the Fopperies of the Schools, and both their
Hypostases remain still entire. And afterward in the same
<hi>Sect.</hi> I bring in Christ, as made up (if one may so speak) of the
second Hypostasis of the Trinity, and of that Humane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that conversed at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Where by the way, I must minde him, That in this inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,
he also betrays a piece of boldness, which I know not
how he can answer: Namely in his Magisterial stamping up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Schoolmens Writings the name of <hi>Fopperies,</hi> and such
as sophisticate humane Reason. For though those Authours
were men who could have answered for themselves with more
acute and solid Reason, then the Doctor could oppose them:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57586:46"/>
yet that is not all. King <hi>Iames</hi> of blessed Memory (a Prince
of as great judgement, surely as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi>) hath recommended
and enjoyned the Reading of the Schoolmen to our Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The same injunction was renewed by the glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
K. <hi>Charles</hi> the First: and also by our present Sovereign
K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Second. Which makes me much wonder,
with what face this Doctor could tax the Schoolmen with
Fopperies, and sophisticating of humane Reason, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the hypostatical union of the Word and Humanity of
Christ. For be it, will he say, in the matter of Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
and Worship of Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they have sophistica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
Yet to turn off every thing (when he wants a starting
hole) as <hi>the same Numerical body raised again, and in Christ
but one Person, not two Persons,</hi> under the Notion of School
Fopperies; is as good as to leave nothing wherein these three
Kings could well recommend them to our studies. Who
knows not that there is an allowance or abatement to be made
for humane Errours, in most humane Authours recommended
to us? And though our University Statutes order <hi>Platos,
Aristotles</hi> and <hi>Plinies</hi> Books to be publickly taught; yet they
suppose them not to be in all parts free from Errours. We un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
therefore, that those sacred Kings commended the
Schoolmen to our studies, so far as they clash not with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of ours and the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>But in his next (the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Section,</hi>) he undertakes to shew
all these passages to be blameless; but saith he must first settle
the true Notion of <hi>Persona</hi> and <hi>Hypostasis.</hi> To do this, he
first defines <hi>Suppositum</hi> to be <q>[A singular, individual sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
compleatly existing by it self, but not incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably,
though incommunicately, <hi>i.</hi> as yet not actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
as a potential principle to the making up of <hi>Eni
unum per se.</hi>]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Truly he takes a fair liberty, to make definitions of his
own, and then examine his Doctrines by them. And here he
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57586:46"/>
hath minted a very pretty one, witness those words (not <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
concurring as a potential Principle,</hi>) but let him have it. He
proceeds:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>[I need onely add, That <hi>Hypostasis</hi> in the concrete sense,
is the same that <hi>Suppositum;</hi> in the abstract, <hi>subsistentia:</hi>
and that <hi>subsistere</hi> is sometimes in the very language of the
Schools, said of an individual substance, although it exist
dependently upon another <hi>Suppositum,</hi> as in the Humane
Nature of Christ. And lastly, for <hi>Persona,</hi> it is nothing
but <hi>Suppositum Rationale.</hi>]</q> Let him have all this too, to
please him.</p>
               <p>Now he answers to the Objection, <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. thus: <q>[I
do not bring in an Humane Person of Christ, <hi>without any
mincing of the matter.</hi> For at the very first naming of the
terms, I both modestly and cautiously ask leave in these
words: Now that the Humane Person of Christ, (as I may
so call it) is not to be laid aside, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</q> Most acutely! The
Objector saith not, that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi> brought in the Humane
Person of Christ without any mincing of the matter, <hi>at the
first naming of the terms;</hi> but expresly saith, That he so
brings it in <hi>Afterwards.</hi> Now the Doctor proves, that he
did not so bring it in, because at his very first naming of the
terms, he inserts this Parenthesis (as I may so call it.) Is not this
Answer direct and apposite?</p>
               <p>But he would perswade us, that by this Parenthesis, he <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly
and cautiously asked leave.</hi> How <hi>modest</hi> a Creature this
Doctor is, appears, as by the general strein of his Writings,
so by his particular censure of the Schoolmen, and impudent
reflection upon three Kings at once, which I noted but now:
And how <hi>cautious,</hi> is too too legible in those foul and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Opinions into which he hath plunged himself, no man
forcing him thereunto. Nay, to see the unluckiness of it,
in this very particular, where he boasts of both, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>modesty</hi> nor <hi>caution.</hi> He saith <hi>he ask'd leave;</hi> but of whom
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57586:47"/>
did he ask it? or did he Modestly and Cautiously stay for an
Answer, to know whether such leave would or might be
granted him? suppose I should here say, That D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More is (as
I may so call him) a Nestorian Heretick:</hi> you will easily think
the Doctor would be offended, though I should plead that.
<hi>modestly and cautiously ask'd leave,</hi> in those words <hi>(as I may so
call him)</hi> But the Doctor should have known, that it was not
lawfull for him, or any other Christian, to use any expressions
which are of an heretical import, especially in such high points:
And for so doing no leave can modestly be asked; seeing it is
Impudence to desire Liberty of speaking what is Heresie, or
what may vehemently and justly be suspected thereof. Nor
can any such leave justly be given, though it be asked.</p>
               <p>He proceeds <q>[I interserted those words (<hi>viz.</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis
mentioned) as being well assured in my own
judgement, that whatsoever might otherwise be a <hi>supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
of it self, if it once concur as a Potential Principle with
some other <hi>Hypostasis</hi> for the making up one <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> it
loseth then the proper Nature and Definition of an <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasis;</hi>
it being then not actually such, but potentially, and
in that sense onely it can be called an <hi>Hypostasis:</hi> and there
is the same reason of <hi>Persona.</hi>]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, would you know the Doctors Drift in these words?
It is to prepare you to swallow what he saith <hi>Sect. 14. viz.</hi>
                  <q>[That though he names 2 Hypostases in Christ, yet he
understands the Humane Hypostasis to be but <hi>improperly</hi>
so termed]</q> to wit, Because <hi>it concurs as a potential Principle</hi>
with the Divine Hypostasis, for the making up one Hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis.
A quaint Fetch! the Doctor frequently named the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Person of Christ:</hi> and now we must believe that he
meant it <hi>improperly:</hi> yea though by his own confession he
declared, in the forecited place Book 9. ch. 2. Sect. 6. that
both the Hypostases in Christ <hi>remain still intire.</hi> Intire, and
yet Improperly? But still, the very ground of his Fetch, fails
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57586:47"/>
him: For first it supposes, 2 Hypostases <hi>actually</hi> such; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this point, the Divine actual Hypostasis, and the Humane
actual Hypostasis: for upon their Concurrence into one, he
saith that they <hi>lose the proper nature and Definition of an Hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis.</hi>
But they cannot lose what they had not; and if they had
<hi>the proper Nature and Definition of an Hypostasis,</hi> they must
needs be <hi>Actual Hypostases.</hi> Secondly he supposes these two
Actual Hypostases to concur into one third Hypostasis; and
that hereupon either of the two which did thus concur, though
they cease to be <hi>actually</hi> two Hypostases, yet <hi>Potentially</hi> they
continue such; and in that sense <hi>(i. e. improperly)</hi> may still
be termed Hypostases. Now let the Doctor shew us, How
Christs Humanity was once a complete intire Hypostasis by it
self, and afterward concurrent with his Divinity to make up
the Hypostasis of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by which Concurrence it lost
the proper Nature and Definition of an Hypostasis, it being
then not actually such, but potentially: otherwise his premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Devise will stand him in no stead.</p>
               <p>His second Answer is, that he was necessitated to use this
Term, because of the Familists with whom he disputed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
This necessity, if such, was made by himself: for who neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated
him to dispute with the Familists? But the Doctor
can never perswade sober men that there is no disputing with
Hereticks, unless the Disputer makes bold to speak like an
Heretick himself. If the Familists would, as he here pretends,
have <hi>melted</hi> the Catholick expression into a <hi>Mystical meaning;</hi>
it concerned him, not therefore to change that Catholick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
but so to fortifie it, that the Familists might not
have been able justly and rationally to have avoided it. Yet
this is not all: I must have leave plainly to tell him that his
dispute with the Familists was not the thing that necessitated
him to call it the Humane Person of Christ; and that this
is both a frivolous and ridiculous excuse: for his dispute with
them is in his 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book, from the 12. chap. to the end of that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57586:48"/>
Book: but in his 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book, Chap. 2. Sect. 6. he again calls
it the Humane Person of Christ, though he meddles not there
with the Familists. Wherefore, for his using that phrase, there
was some other motive, which I doubt not but himself well
wots of.</p>
               <p>His third Answer (in the same 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Sect.) runs thus: <q>[It
brings nothing of Nestorianism in with it, because though
I name the Humane Person of Christ alone, yet I do no
more <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, then he that names
the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> of Christ alone, doth <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
which if they were cut asunder, would most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
dissolve the Hypostatical Union also.]</q> The ground
of this Answer is <hi>Photius</hi> his saying that <hi>Nestorius</hi> did <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
but the meaning of those
words, is onely this: That <hi>Nestorius</hi> acknowledged not the
two Natures, Divine and Humane, united in one Person; but
made them two <hi>Distinct</hi> Persons: <hi>Distinct,</hi> I say; not <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;</hi>
as I have noted above: for <hi>Nestorius</hi> professed a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,</hi>
though not a <hi>Personal Union;</hi> and if the Doctor
stands strictly upon <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as if <hi>Nestorius</hi> had cut
the whole, and rendred one part here and another there; he
obtrudes upon him what he never thought of. Besides,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Hesychius</hi> tells us; and this
<hi>Nestorius</hi> did, though he did not separate them: and this D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi>
seems to do, in his Answer to the Objector, if he justifies (as
he doth justifie all in his Preface) what he saith he wrote <hi>lib. 9.
cap.</hi> 2. [<hi>I bring in</hi> (saith he there) <hi>Christ as made up (if one
may so speak) of the second Hypostasis of the Trinity, and of the
humane Person that conversed at Ierusalem.] If one may so speak,</hi>
is but a necessary mollifying of the foregoing word <hi>(made up
of)</hi> not of what follows without any mollifying <hi>(of the second
Hypostasis of the Trinity, and of the humane Person that conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
at Ierusaelem.</hi> Now whosoever distinguisheth really
(though he do not separate) the second Hypostasis, <hi>i. e.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57586:48"/>
of the Trinity, from the Humane Person that conversed
at <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> speaks that which is Heresie: and if after <hi>ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous</hi>
admonition he doth defend (and say he demonstrates)
that he hath therein writ no Errour, may be judged an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick;
though he do add, that Christ is made up of these two
(but as one may so speak) for <hi>Nestorius</hi> himself would have
forwardly concurred in such a modification: <hi>Made up of them
(but as one may so speak.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Doctor pretends that in <hi>naming the humane Person
of Christ alone,</hi> he doth no more divide Christ into two Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postases,
then he that names Christs Humane Nature alone,
doth divide him into two Natures; which were it done, that
is, were his two natures cut asunder, it would most certainly
dissolve the Hypostatical Union. I cannot say whether this
Plea be more <hi>bold</hi> or <hi>vain.</hi> Most <hi>bold</hi> it is to dally in such
great Points, and childishly to argue from the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> used about Christs Person; as if they imported
such a cutting asunder as is made by a knife when it divides
a stick into two pieces. And most <hi>vain</hi> it is: for first, Christs
two natures though united in one Person, are still two really
distinct Natures; wherefore he who names one of them alone,
doth not thereby cut asunder the Personal Union of both;
no more then he who names D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mores</hi> Body alone, or his
Soul alone, cuts asunder the Union of his Body and Soul in one
Person: but he who names an Humane Person of Christ alone,
in distinction from a Divine Person of Christ (as the Doctor
here doth) most undenyably divides Christ into two persons,
and infers (as much as lies in him) the dissolution of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postatical
Union of two natures in one person. And should
any Man so far dote, as to speak of the Person of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mores</hi>
Body, and the Person of his Soul; who doubts but such words
would import a dissolution of that one Person which results
from the Union of the Doctors Soul and Body?</p>
               <p>Sect. 14. he adds <q>[Though I say that the Hypostases
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57586:49"/>
remain intire: yet my so expressly affirming them Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statically
united, shews plainly that they do <hi>not remain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
separately,</hi> but <hi>united unconfoundedly.</hi>]</q> And doth not
<hi>Nestorius</hi> himself acknowledge that there is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
an <hi>Unconfounded Conjunction</hi> of the two Natures? How dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
this from the Doctors conclusion, that the two Hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
remain not <hi>Intire separately,</hi> but <hi>united unconfoundedly?
Nestorius</hi> was as far from <hi>separating</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> from the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More.</hi> Nor can the Doctors affirming
that <hi>the two Hypostases are hypostatically united,</hi> though those
<hi>two Hypostases remain Intire;</hi> be any excuse for him, unless he
will bring an impossibility for his Apologie: for, to be <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statically
united,</hi> is to become <hi>One Hypostasis;</hi> but if the two
Hypostases remain Intire, they are certainly two <hi>Hypostases,</hi>
and not onely <hi>One:</hi> unless the Doctor hath any trick to prove
that two, in the very same Notion can be one; and one two.</p>
               <p>Sect. 15. he concludes with this jolly vaunt <q>[I have not
departed from the very language and sense of the <hi>Councils,</hi>
and <hi>Athanasius his Creed,</hi> in adventuring to say, that the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Person of Christ Jesus concurs with the Divine Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasis,
which confessedly all men will grant to be well ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
here the Divine Person for the making up one Christ]</q>
Truly to use the language of the Councils and S. <hi>Athanasius</hi>
his Creed was no such high valour in a Doctor of Divinity
that he should term it an <hi>Adventure.</hi> But to prove his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonance
with the Councils, he shews that the Greek Church
calls the <hi>three Hypostases,</hi> as well <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Hence he infers, that the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
allows a concurse of the Divine and Humane Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stases,
for the making that one Person which is called Christ.
The Councils words he cites, are (<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>To this I answer: though some Greek writers be granted

                     </gap>,
or less.]</q> O impregnable Doctor!</p>
               <p>First I note that he builds here upon the Greek of the <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasian</hi>
Creed, and if that ground be sufficient, I could furnish
him out of it (as it is Printed in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Athanas.</hi> his Works <hi>A. D.</hi>
1627. at <hi>Paris,)</hi> with a place more express for his purpose then
this he hath pitched on. For where the Latine reads it, <hi>Unus
omnino, non confusione substantiae, sed Unitate Personae:</hi> the
Greek runs thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
by <hi>unity of Persons,</hi> or <hi>Hypostases,</hi> in the plural. But <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
ad An. Christi</hi> 340. will tell him, That S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Athanasius</hi> wrote
this Creed originally in the Latine, not in the Greek language.
Let him therefore who put it into Greek, answer it, if he differs
from the Latine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whereas in the Latine it is <hi>Perfectus homo, ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>anima
rationali &amp; humana carne subsistens:</hi> the word <hi>subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens</hi>
cannot properly or improperly be understood for <hi>Hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
or <hi>Persona;</hi> but must onely signifie what we mean in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57586:50"/>
by <hi>Being</hi> or <hi>Consisting,</hi> though in our <hi>Liturgie</hi> it be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>subsisting.</hi> For it follows in the Creed <hi>(Unus non confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sione
substantiae, sed Unitate Personae,)</hi> which is spoken of
Christ, as he is God and Man. Wherefore S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Athanasius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
in this clause the Divine and Humane Natures of
Christ to be <hi>one Person;</hi> he cannot be imagined in those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
words <hi>(ex anima rationali &amp; humanâ carne subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens)</hi>
spoken of the Humane Nature, to have any ways meant
that Humane Nature to be <hi>Persona,</hi> unless we should fancy him
to write Repugnancies in his Creed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If the Doctor would justifie his calling Christs
Humanity, the <hi>Humane Person of Christ,</hi> by this Creed; he
should shew us where the Creed calls it so. Had he onely said
that Christs Humanity is <hi>of a reasonable soul and humane flesh
subsisting:</hi> who would have quarrelled with him for that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression?
for, that <hi>Subsistere</hi> in the Primitive Churches La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
did often signifie no more then <hi>Esse,</hi> appears by <hi>Iob</hi>
7. 21. <hi>Lam. 4. 17. Esa. 17. 14. Ierem. 10. 20. Iob</hi> 8.
22. &amp; 3. 16. &amp; 7. 8. (to add no more) in the Vulgar
Translation.</p>
               <p>Thus the Doctor hath by his Apologie much mended the
matter. Had not the better way been, to have honestly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
his Unadvisedness and Errour in calling it the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Person of Christ? and to have imitated Him who inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously
said, <hi>Errare possum, Haereticus esse nolo?</hi> But this would

               <head type="sub">Touching Gods conveying a false Perswasion into the
minde of his Creature.</head>
               <p>HERE the Doctor paves his way by certain Aphorisms
of his own forging; and if he hath not made them
home to his own purpose, it is pitty but he should hear of it.
His first Aphorism is this, <q>[That nothing but Conviction
of Conscience in a soul that is sincere, can be properly the
Promulgation of any Law, Will, or Command of Gods
to that soul.]</q> And the reason he gives, is <q>[Because he that
is sincere, is willing and ready to know and do any thing that
is the minde of God he should do, and doth his best endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to know it and do it.—Whenas on the contrary, he
that is not sincere, but false to the present light he hath,
and knowingly and wittingly sins against his own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
such a man may justly be likened to one that stops his
ears and will not hear the Law of his Prince: which it being
in his power notwithstanding to hear, the Law is justly deem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
to be promulgated to him.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Because a sincere man is ready to know and do Gods W<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
and Law, is therefore that Will and Law not promulgate<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
to that man, till his Conscience is convinced? A very strang<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>Reason!</hi> How, in Gods Name, can any mans Conscience be
convinced of Gods Law, before the Law be promulgated and
made known to that man? Can he be convinced of he knows
not what? If then he must first know it, before he can be
convinced of it, then must it first be Promulgated. And it <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
must first be Promulgated, then his conviction of Conscience
(which ensues thereupon) cannot <hi>properly</hi> be (as the Doctor
affirms) the Promulgation of it. How else could the Doctor
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57586:51"/>
say, That the Law is justly deemed to be Promulgated to the
<hi>Unsincere</hi> man, though he stops his ears and hardens his heart
against it? for if to receive, and in conscience yield to the Law,
be the <hi>proper Promulgation</hi> of it to any man; it must be so
to every man: and the Doctor deals but hardly with his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincere
man, if he gives him not leave to plead, That because
he is not convinced in his Conscience, therefore the Law was
never Promulgated to him. Nor can the Doctor evade this,
by his comparing the unsincere man to one who stops his ears,
and so doth not actually hear the Kings Law Proclaimed,
though he be present at the Proclamation. For first, did the
Doctor ever know any man come to a Proclamation, and stop
his ears when he is come? Secondly, Suppose him so vain
and wilfull as to stop his ears; yet by that very act he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
the Proclamation, and that the Law is Promulgated
to him that he might hear it if he would. Thirdly, Though
his ears were open, yet his heart mean while may be shut;
and he may actually hear the Proclamation, and yet not count
himself in conscience bound to obey the Law Proclaimed, as
the Kings Law. This Law in that case is undoubtedly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated
to that man, though his conscience be not convinced:
Indeed the Doctor grants as much himself in the close of the
forecited words.</p>
               <p>Wherefore that he may not be thought to overthrow his
own Aphorism, he adds <q>[It is <hi>peculiar</hi> to the sincere and
unfeignedly conscientious, that no Law or Command of
God be deemed as promulgated to them, unless their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
be convinced. As a man cannot in nature conceive,
that any speech or voice came to any mans ear, who, though
listning and expecting, yet could not hear the least whisper
thereof.]</q> Is this <hi>peculiar</hi> to the sincere? for what reason?
Nay there you must pardon the Doctor, if you will be content
to take a simile in lieu of a reason, he is for you. Well then,
be it granted, That the voice came not to that mans ear, who
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57586:52"/>
listning for it, could not hear the least whisper of it. Apply
this to the case in hand, and what will result? namely, That
the Voice or Command of God came not to the sincere mans
ear, because though he listned for it, yet he heard no whisper
of it. And what then? why just so (by the Doctors infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence)
it is <hi>peculiar</hi> to the sincere man that no Command of
God be deemed as Promulgated to him, unless his Conscience
be convinced.</p>
               <p>Reader you may laugh if you please; but the Doctor is still
confident, and concludes <q>[This principle me-thinks is so
clear, that no man should doubt of it.]</q> What, not doubt
of it? no; though it makes conviction of Conscience, which
is naturally subsequent to the Promulgation; to be <hi>properly</hi> the
Promulgation it self?</p>
               <p>His 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Aphorism is, <q>[That where there is no Law Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated,
it is no sin or transgression to act or profess the
contrary.]</q> He restrains not this to his <hi>sincere</hi> person, as he
doth the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> and 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Aphorisms. But if by <hi>Promulgation,</hi> he
means such a conviction of Conscience as renders a man ready
to obey; his Aphorism is false: For by this Rule, no obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Kicker at Gods declared Law, should be a sinner. He
would be asked also, What is the sense of those words, <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>act or profess the contrary.)</hi> The contrary to what? <hi>to a La<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
not Promulgated?</hi> for that onely was premised to his Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism.
Now a Law not Promulgated; is, as to us, no Law;
and in this case, just nothing: here therefore the Doctors
<hi>contrary,</hi> is, <hi>contrary to that which is not;</hi> or, <hi>contrary to
nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>Aph.</hi> 
                  <q>[That a full and firm conviction of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in a soul that is sincere, is the Promulgation of a Law
or Command from God to that soul.]</q> Sure the Doctor hath
huge delight in multiplying Aphorisms. He had told us in
his first, That nothing but conviction of Conscience in a
sincere soul, can be the Promulgation of Gods Law to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57586:52"/>
that soul. And here he erects a new Aphorism, to assure us,
That this <hi>Conviction,</hi> is that <hi>Promulgation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His subjoyned Reason also, <hi>viz. [That Conscience is the ear
of the soul,]</hi> he had annexed to his first Aphorism: but it
seems, not home enough; wherefore having there said, that
it is <hi>As it were</hi> the ear of the soul; here he calls it the <hi>very
Ear</hi> of the soul: and then adds, <q>[That the soul cannot
receive a Command from God any otherwise, then by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fully and firmly convinced, that this or that is his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
This is as it were the Kings Broad Seal, by which she is
warranted to act.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Let us suppose Conscience to be the souls ear; and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the case by Analogie: When the ear receives a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
that command must first be spoken or Promulgated to
the ear; else how can the ear imbibe it? wherefore the ears
receiving it, cannot be the speaking or Promulgating of it.
Semblably, if the Conscience receives a Command of God
(which it doth, faith the Doctor, by being convinced that it
is his Command,) that Command must upon necessity be
some way or other Promulgated and signified to the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
before it can so receive it; for this ear of the soul cannot
possibly hear that Command, before it be spoken. It follows
then, That the Consciences conviction, or reception of it as
the Command of God cannot be the Promulgation of it.
The Promulgation is one thing, and precedent; the Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
another thing, and subsequent. The Command is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged
that the Conscience may be convinced: not the
Conscience convinced, that the Command may be Promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
At high-noon it is not day, because this man opens
his eyes, and sees and is convinced that it is so: Nor night,
because that man shuts his eyes, and perceives nothing but
darkness. The Sun beams are displayed, though both of
them should shut their eyes: and that one of them sees and is
convinced that it is day light; onely argues, That the Suns
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57586:53"/>
Rays are diffused, but it is not the very diffusion of those
Rays.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Whereas he saith, that this conviction is <hi>as it were
the Kings broad Seal,</hi> by which the soul is warranted to act:
He saith, but what doth <hi>As it were</hi> confute himself; for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
conviction is something within us: but the Kings broad
Seal which warrants a man to act, is certainly something with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him.</p>
               <p>His fourth Aphorism, <q>[That nothing that hath any real
Turpitude or Immorality in it, can justly be pretended to
be the Voice or Command of God; or that which is really
and confessedly Moral, not to be his Command, either to
the sincere or unsincere.]</q> To prove this, he adds, <q>[For the
Light and Law of Nature, and of eternal immutable Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
cries louder in the soul of the sincere, then that it should
admit of any such foul Motions; much less as from God;
or be ignorant of what is so plainly Moral, as this Aphorism
imports. And for the unsincere, sith he stops his ears
against that most holy and evident Law, his false delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and obduracy in wickedness, are most justly imputed to
himself.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>First, I see not why the Doctor here supposeth the unsin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
man to stop his ears against Gods most holy and evident
Law; seeing the Law he speaks of, is (by his own confession)
<hi>the Light and Law of Nature:</hi> which Law the unsincere,
though he obeys not, yet cannot but be convinced of, as truly
as the sincere. Though he holds the truth in unrighteousness,
yet still he holds it; because that which may be known of
God, is manifest in him, for God hath shewed it to him,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. Seeing it is the Law of Nature, and Light of Nature,
it must be graved and displayed upon his Nature; and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ignorant of it, or avoid it by stopping his ears; but is,
as the Apostle speaks, <hi>without excuse</hi> (not because he forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
himself, and left no passage for the Law to enter at; but)
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57586:53"/>
                  <hi>because when he knew God, he glorified him not as God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the Doctors Principle being, that it is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with Gods Nature to convey into man false perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
least he should be urged with the horrid consequences
of that Tenet, he indeavours here to prevent it by telling us
in this 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Aphorism, That nothing that hath in it any real Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitude
or Immorality, can justly be pretended to be Gods
command: and therefore he hopes that we cannot charge him
with making God the Authour of Sin in man by reason of any
such <hi>false perswasions</hi> conveyed by him into mans minde.
But alas, this shift will not serve: for, it God may be the
Authour of what is not true, who can be assured that what all
the World hath hitherto counted <hi>real Turpitude</hi> and <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality;</hi>
is so indeed? the Rule by which the World judges
of Turpitude and Immorality, is the Light of Nature and
the Moral Law; and who is the Authour of this Rule, but
God? how then shall the World certainly know that this is
a True Rule? not because God made it; for, by the Doctors
new Divinity, God may be the Authour of that which is not
<hi>True:</hi> Nor by the assistance of any creature, for doubtless it is
as possible for the creatures to deceive us, as for the Creatour;
nor can they inform us of any thing more then their Creatour
(who may deceive them also) is pleased to let them know.
Talk not then of <hi>Real Turpitude;</hi> all Turpitude will prove but
Imaginary, and founded onely upon supposition, <hi>That God,
who might have made the Moral Law a false Rule, did make it a
true one:</hi> but how to evince that supposition to be an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Truth, is perfectly impossible upon the Doctors Principle:
of which Principle, the consequents are full of such portentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
universal confusion, as excuses the whole rabble of former
Heresies; and indeed affrights and amazes my Meditation.</p>
               <p>Sect. 3. He propounds this by way of question <q>[Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a full and firm conviction of conscience in the sincere,
touching a Religion in which some things are incorporated
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57586:54"/>
that be false, but <hi>without any moral</hi> Turpitude, and of that
nature that no moral sincerity may be able to discover the
the falseness of them, can be rightly said to be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God to that Soul, whether for tryal or Punishment]</q>
Then, after a sally from it in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Sect. he saith in the
6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <q>[That this Question will necessarily put as upon these
three Disquisitions. 1. Whether it be competible to the
nature of God, to convey a false perswasion into the minde
of his creature. 2. Whether it be competible to him, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
a false perswasion as may oblige the perswaded to act
or profess according to this perswasion, Religiously and
Conscientiously: (this will come up very close to the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
Objection to be propounded.) 3. Whether this false Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
or Perswasion, may rightly be called the Command
of God to such a person thus perswaded.]</q> Of these three
why might not the Doctor have spared the third, which seems
plainly enough included in the second? for if such a false per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
conveyed by God, <hi>obliges</hi> man to act accordingly; it
must needs be the Law or Command of God to that man.
But the multiplying of disquisitions, makes but the mist the
thicker which he studies to cast about the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Objection. And
yet the truth is, his question is lyable to some other Disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
which he was not willing to discover.</p>
               <p>For first, I ask why he supposes such falsities in a Religion,
as no moral sincerity may be able to finde out? Moral sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
is able to ask, seek and knock: and they who ask, shall
have; they who seek shall finde; to them who knock it
shall be opened. And divine wisdom saith <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 17. (<hi>Those
that seek me early shall finde me)</hi> 2. Why he supposes that
God may convey a false perswasion into the sincere Soul, and
that either for Tryal, or Punishment? for why should God
Try, or punish by falsehood, when he may as well do it by
Truth? And of all men why should he thus try, (I mean by
falshood) or why thus should he punish him whom he knows
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57586:54"/>
to be sincere already? These supposals are little to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Divine Majesty: nor could they possibly be made
but by such a Theologue as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I now follow whether he leads me. Against the first of
his 3 Disquisitions, he grants 2 considerable Arguments: the
the first <q>[That it is repugnant to Gods veracity: the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
that it is destructive of our belief of God in all things,
if we once admit that he will convey a false perswasion to
us in any thing.]</q> In order to answer these Arguments, he
first produces several Texts of Scripture touching this point,
with expositors opinions of them: he begins with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 32.
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But how doth
this concern Gods conveying a false perswasion into mens Souls?
Let the end or intent of this Act of God, interpret the act it self,
the end is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>that he might have mercy upon all:</hi>
and doth God convey a false perswasion into them that he may
have mercy upon them, especially that false perswasion being
in points of Religion? whatsoever then is meant by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
, it cannot be a conveying into them falsity of religion.</p>
               <p>But he adds <q>[Upon which Text, <hi>Vatablus, sub imperio</hi>
saith he, &amp; <hi>potestate Incredulitatis sinit esse, &amp; facit ut ad
tempus repugnemus gratiae, ut rubore tandem perfusi sitiamus
ejus misericordiam.</hi> The Apostle here treats of the Jews in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity
touching Jesus his being the <hi>Messias.</hi>]</q> It seems he
liketh this comment, which onely of all others he produces:
and yet he confutes it by what he annexes of his own to it:
for <hi>Vatablus</hi> restrains not the words (as he ought, and the
Doctor doth, to the incredulous Jews. <hi>Ut sitiamus</hi> includes
himself and other Christians. Secondly if God <hi>facit ut repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnemus
gratiae,</hi> God is the Authour of sin; unless the Doctor
dares say, that it is no sin to resist Grace. Thirdly, to resist
Grace, cannot be the way (as <hi>Vatablus</hi> pretends) to make us
<hi>thirst after mercy,</hi> but quite the contrary. Hath not this Text,
and comment, done the Doctor good service?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:57586:55"/>
His next Text is, S. <hi>Iohn. 12. 39. 40. Therefore they could
not believe, because that Esay had said, He hath blinded their
eyes and hardned their hearts, that they should not see with their
eyes, nor understand with their hearts, and be converted, and I
should heal them.</hi> Here he falls upon the same impertinency
as in his former Text: for these words are spoken, not of <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
persons:</hi> who are propounded in his <hi>Question,</hi> but of the
unsincere and wicked Jews. Besides, was there no Moral
Turpitude in these mens obstinate resisting the means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?
if there were, it is not pertinent to his Question.
Lastly, there needs no other Answer but <hi>Clarius</hi> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
added here by the Doctor himself, <hi>significat illos non
potuisse credere, ob excoecatam mentem &amp; obstinatum animum;
idque Deum suo ipsorum vitio &amp; culpâ permisisse.</hi> Doth this
infer, that God conveyed into them a false perswasion, and
that so as to make it his command, and oblige them to act
sutably thereto?</p>
               <p>Then he saith <q>[It is not <hi>altogether impertinent</hi> to add the
example of Gods assisting <hi>Elisha, 2 Kings</hi> 6. 18.]</q> It seems
his conscience told him that it was <hi>something impertinent,</hi>
though not <hi>altogether.</hi> Let the Reader consider the place,
and he will soon find it <hi>so much impertinent</hi> to this question,
as not to deserve an answer.</p>
               <p>Next he comes to what he calls <hi>a more eximious instance</hi>
(and so it may soon be) 1 Kings 22. touching Ahabs going up
to <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi> v. 19. <hi>And Michaia said, hear thou,</hi> &amp;c. to
the end of the 22 Sect. <q>This saith the Doctor is a very nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
example of what is declared in a more general way by
the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> chap. 14. 9.</q> 
                  <hi>And if the Prophet be
deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the Lord have deceived
that Prophet.</hi> Upon the back of this he heaps a large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Cornelius a Lapide;</hi> which concludes thus <hi>Aliter ergo
permittit mala Deus, aliter Homo; Homo Negative, Deus
positivè.</hi> But I must pray the Doctor to excuse me, if I trouble
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57586:55"/>
not my Reader with answering that which concludes in terms
apparently contradictious. However, sure I am, that S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stins</hi>
credit is better then <hi>Lapide</hi>'s and he saith, <hi>lib de grat. &amp; lib.
Arb. cap. 23. Quando auditis dicentem Dominum, Ego Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
seduxi prophetam illum; &amp; quod ait Apostolus, Cujus vult
miseretur, &amp; quem vult, obdurat: In eo quem seduci Permittit
vel obdurari, mala cjus merita credite: in eò verò cujus mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur,
gratiam Dei, &amp;c.</hi> Whatsoever false perswasion was in
<hi>Ahab,</hi> or in a false Prophet, God was not the Authour or
conveyer of it into them, but the <hi>Iust Permitter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet since the Doctor makes this such an eximious Instance,
I will add something farther concerning it. First, was <hi>Ahab</hi> a
<hi>sincere</hi> person? If not; how is his example pertinent to this
Question? the like may be urged touching <hi>Ezechiels</hi> false
prophets. Secondly, what was <hi>Ahabs</hi> perswasion of kin to
any point of Religion? Thirdly. how could that perswasion
be a command of God binding him religiously and conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiously
to go up to <hi>Ramoth Gilead;</hi> when God sent <hi>Michaia</hi>
a true Prophet, to assure him that if he went up, he should not
return in Peace? I much suspect, that this Instance is <hi>eximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
in a sense different from what the Doctor pretends, and
that it will appear eximiously Impertinent.</p>
               <p>The Description of the whole business from v. 19. to the
22. is in a theatrical form suted to humane apprehension; and
must not be literally urged: the main drift being to shew that
<hi>Ahabs</hi> Prophets were deceived by a lying spirit, upon Gods
permission: and that as certainly, as if the transaction had
been managed in such a manner and with such circumstances,
as the Text represents it in, for the better complying with the
capacity of them whom it concerned. Nevertheless, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the Doctor, I will put it upon the issue of the very literal
sense of this story, whether God conveyed a false perswasion
into <hi>Ahab,</hi> or no.</p>
               <p>God being seated in his Throne, and his Court standing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57586:56"/>
about him, he asks thus: [Who shall perswade <hi>Ahab</hi> that
he may go up and fall at <hi>Ramoth Gilead?</hi>] Here it is plain, that
God meant not to convey that perswasion into <hi>Ahab</hi> himself:
for he inquires for some else to do it. After several spirits had
delivered their opinions, <hi>one on this manner and another on
that;</hi> forth comes one who undertook the business. God
asks him <hi>wherewith</hi> he would perswade <hi>Ahab?</hi> he answers,
[I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all
his prophets] here he plainly takes the whole Action upon
himself: but yet he had no power to execute it, till God gave
him leave: whereupon God replies [Thou shalt perswade him,
and prevail also: Go forth and do so.] Thus the lying spirit
offering his readiness (that is, if God hindred not) and God
declares that he will permit it, and foretells the event. <hi>Ahab</hi>
might have been perswaded by Truths; therefore God first
propounded, <hi>who will goe and perswade Ahab, &amp;c.</hi> But <hi>Ahab</hi>
also might be perswaded by a lie, and that God permits,
leaving a wicked spirit, to his own wickedness; and by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
that, resolving to punish <hi>Ahabs</hi> wickedness with his
Ruine. Nothing appears in all this transaction which proves
<hi>Ahabs</hi> false perswasion to have been conveyed into him by
God; but that it was solely performed by that lying spirit,
who did but his kinde in deceiving. And seeing <hi>Ahab</hi> had for
a long time despised Gods true Prophets, and hearkned to
false ones, it was the decorum of divine Justice to suffer his
Ruine to proceed from false prophets inspired by that lying
spirit. Yet still at the same time God sent his true prophet
<hi>Michaia,</hi> who informed <hi>Ahab</hi> of the false prophets lie; that
it might appear (to the shame of all such as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi>) That
as the Devil indeavours to convey false perswasions; so God
interesses his spirit onely in the conveyance of true. And I
presume the Doctor will grant, that Gods spirit was in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaia;</hi>
that if <hi>Ahab</hi> had hearkned to him and been perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by him, this perswasion had been conveyed by God;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57586:56"/>
That however, <hi>Michaia's</hi> prophecy was to him in the nature
of a command from God not to go up to <hi>Ramoth Gilead:</hi> And
if so; then the perswasion conveyed into him by the lying
prophets, could be no perswasion or command of God: unless
we dream that God at the same time, concerning the same
thing, and to the same person, can be the authour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer
of perswasions or commands, expressly contrary to one
another. Sutable to what I have said touching the carriage of
this business, is the account <hi>Theodoret</hi> gives of it: <hi>Haec est Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopopaeia
quae docet divinam permissionem: non enim verus Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus
&amp; veritatis Magister jussit ut deciperetur Ahab: per haec
docuit Propheta quod spiritus Deceptionis impiis hominibus utens
tanquam instrumentis, falso promittit Victoriam: hoc autem fit
Deo permittente: nam cum prohibere potuit, non prohibuit quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam
indignus erat Ahab cujus curam gereret.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the forementioned place in <hi>Ezech. 14. 9. If the
Prophet be deceived when he hath spoken, I the Lord have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that Prophet]</hi> Though it appertains not to the Doctors
Question, (as I hinted before) yet concerning the scruple it
may seem to afford, I answer: Take it in the strictest sense
the words will truly bear, it follows not that God did any
more, deceive this prophet in <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> then he did those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
of <hi>Ahab;</hi> namely by giving leave to a lying spirit to
deceive them. It was his Justice upon that wicked Prophet,
to leave him to be inspired and acted by the Devil. In brief,
hear what <hi>Theodoret</hi> saith upon the place, <hi>At non est justi judicis
proprium, &amp; decipere prophetam, &amp; errantem punire: non ergo
secundum efficaciam ait se prophetam in errorem inducturum, sed
secundum permissionem: i. e. Cum possim statim illius mendacium
redarguere, sustineo, &amp; divinâ lenitate usus permitto ut dolo
utatur, quem voluntate non necessitate exercet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Doctors last instance, is that of Gods hardning <hi>Pharaohs
heart</hi> 
                  <q>[Who, (saith he) was so intoxicated with a false per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
that his Gods and his Magicians would be able to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57586:57"/>
stand it out with the God of the Hebrews <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> God having
given him up to this Delusion] I take him at his last words:
God <hi>gave up Pharaoh to this Delusion. Pharaoh</hi> obstinately hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his heart against God; and therefore God is said after that
to harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart. How? by conveying into him that
false perswasion? No: but, as the Doctor here himself ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges,
by <hi>giving him up to this delusion.</hi> I grant, our
English chap. 7. 13. seems to say that God first hardned <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rohs</hi>
heart: but rhe Doctor is not ignorant, that in the LXX
it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and that the original <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boravit
se,</hi> or <hi>Roboratum est:</hi> which word occurrs again v. 22.
and is there rendred by our Interpreters, not, <hi>He hardned</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs
heart; but, <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart <hi>was hardned:</hi> Which version
is nearer to the Original. So also it is, <hi>cap.</hi> 8. 19. &amp; 9. 35. The
Doctor therefore might have spared the long adoe he makes
about this word: especially seeing, let this <hi>Hardning</hi> be how it
will, yet <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was no <hi>sincere person,</hi> and to such alone the
question is by him restrained.</p>
               <p>After all this, as the result of his premised Citations and
considerations, he thus concludes in his 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Section <q>[God
may, and sometimes doth, convey a false perswasion into
the minde of man, certainly and effectually though permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively,
which was the first Disquisition conteined in the
main Question.]</q> I wonder not that the Doctor thinks it
lawfull for him to convey a false perswasion into the Readers
minde, when he holds that it well enough becomes God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so to do. That the Doctor indeavours thus to convey
it, will appear if the Reader will but look back and mark whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this were (as here he affirms) his first Disquisition. He
propounded it in his 6. Sect. in these very words whether it be
competible to the nature of God, to convey a false perswasion
into the minde of his Creature) Compare now and you will
finde, first the former words of the Disquisition changed, and
instead of <hi>(it is competible to the Nature of God) i. e.</hi> God may
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57586:57"/>
do it) these words <hi>(God may, and sometimes doth it.)</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
you will find all those words, <hi>(certainly and effectually,
though permissively,)</hi> thrust in here, of which there was not
one syllable there. And yet he doubts not to say, that this
<hi>was the first Disquisition.</hi> If he makes no bones of right down
affirming what is false, I shall look how I build upon his
words hereafter.</p>
               <p>But the sense of this intruded Piece, is against all sense: for
doth God operate that himself, which he doth not operate
himself, but leaves to be operated by others? Though upon
Gods <hi>Permission,</hi> the effect <hi>certainly</hi> follows, by the diligence
of wicked Agents let loose; Yet to say therefore, That this
is an effect operated by God himself, will fetch in God to be
certainly the Authour of all the Sins in the world: Seeing no
Sins are perpetrated but what God permits; and upon his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
or leaving the Devil and wicked men to their own
swinge, all Sins that are, do certainly and effectually come to
pass. This Consequence of his Doctrine the Doctor may do
well to think on at his leisure.</p>
               <p>Lastly, I must agian minde him, That all his Examples
produced out of Scripture, whether of the obstinate <hi>Iews,</hi> or
the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Army, or <hi>Ahab,</hi> or the lying Prophets, or <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh;</hi>
are concerning men who were <hi>not Sincere.</hi> Yet his main
Question was touching conviction of Conscience in <hi>the sincere:</hi>
So that had these Examples indeed proved, That God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys
a false Perswasion into the <hi>Unsincere;</hi> yet they had been
far enough from making for the Doctors purpose.</p>
               <p>In his 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Section</hi> he proceeds to <q>[The Objections
against this Conclusion, as if it were repugnant with Gods
<hi>Veracity,</hi> and destructive of our Trust and Belief in him.]</q> To
Answer this, he is put to his Reserve of Jugling, and strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
casts about. I must have patience to Transcribe his Tricks;
which are these, <q>[As Gods exercising sometimes his Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
sometimes his Mercy, which are two opposite Modes
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57586:58"/>
of the divine Justice, bears no repugnancy at all with either
Attribute; it being upon several Occasions and Subjects:
So for God to make use sometimes of his <hi>Veracity,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of that <hi>Policy</hi> which his practical Wisedom (whereby
he Acts in the Administration of the affairs of the world)
thinks convenient, and which clashes not either with his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
or Goodness, is not at all harsh or incongruous, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it be upon distinct Occasions and Objects. For indeed
the Occasion and Object altering, the Exercise of the Mode
of this or that Virtue must change; or else it will hardly
prove any Mode of Virtue at all. As if severity should be
used upon one who was a fit Object of Mercy. If any Judge
should act after this sort, it would loose the title of severity,
and take on the face of Cruelty: So if <hi>Veracity</hi> should be
used in such a case as required due <hi>Policy</hi> conformable to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Goodness; it would loose the appellation of <hi>Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi>
and deserve the stile of <hi>Unpolitickness.</hi> As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
if a man was throughly assured that such an one with his
company came with a murderous intention to his house to
kill an innocent Person, it may be his native Prince, that
had made an escape from the murderers; and <hi>that he could
not any way secure him</hi> from those barbarous Pursuers, but
by making them by some device or other, to believe he was
gone from the house; if instead of this necessary Artifice he
should in plain terms tell him he was there, were this that
virtue of <hi>Veracity,</hi> or not rather, at the best, an instance of
most dangerous and mischievous folly. For it seems a strange
Virtue that is devoyd of all Goodness, and that must needs
be the Handmaid of the greatest Injustice, of Murder; yea,
of the most execrable Parricide. Wherefore <hi>in such cases as
this,</hi> it doth not clash with the Virtue of <hi>Veracity, not to
speak the truth,</hi> since <hi>Veracity</hi> hath no due Object here, and
so would prove no due moral Action. Nor can he hold his
tongue (we will suppose) but <hi>by exposing his own life,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57586:58"/>
and betraying the life of his Prince.</hi>]</q>
               </p>
               <p>First, He makes <hi>Severity</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> two opposite Modes
of Gods <hi>Iustice.</hi> This is odd, for the Office of Justice is to
do right to All, and give them what they truly deserve: If
Severity doth no more nor less then thus, it is the same with
Justice; if it doth more or less, it becomes Injustice. And for
Mercy, how is that a Mode of Justice! for Mercy deals not
with All as they deserve, but more kindly then they deserve.
Those whom Justice would and must Condemn, Mercy finds
a way to Save.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He saith that Gods exercising sometimes his
Severity, sometimes his Mercy (the Objects being distinct)
bears no repugnancy at all with either <hi>Attribute.</hi> I suppose
his meaning is, That thereby Gods Severity and Mercy are
not mutually repugnant. And what then? Why then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
in like manner, saith the Doctor, That his exercising
sometimes his <hi>Veracity</hi> sometimes his <hi>Policy</hi> (provided it clash
not with his Justice or Goodness) is not at all harsh or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous,
the Objects being distinct. Why observes he not the
due manner of the Apodosis in his Comparison, which should
have run in this manner, <hi>[So for God to exercise sometime his
Veracity, sometime his Policy, bears no repugnance with either
Attribute,]</hi> but slips into those words, <hi>[It is not at all harsh or
incongruous]</hi> I can at present imagine no Reason but this:
He had intimated that <hi>Veracity</hi> and <hi>Policy</hi> are two of Gods At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
by naming Mercy and Severity to be so; for to them,
as to this Point, he compares Gods <hi>Veracity</hi> and <hi>Policy,</hi> and
with this he would slily have run away; wherefore he forbears
expresly to term these later by the name of <hi>Attributes;</hi> least
it should too much startle, and probably scandalize his Reader.
For though we readily grant <hi>Veracity,</hi> yet we as readily deny
<hi>Policy</hi> to be an Attribute of God. No true Christian, but
adores God as <hi>Supremely Wise;</hi> but to call him a <hi>Politick God,</hi>
he counts it a profane diminution. And D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More,</hi> in making
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57586:59"/>
his God a <hi>Politician,</hi> will give some men occasion to suspect,
that all his Religion is but <hi>Policy.</hi> Who knows not, that <hi>Craft</hi>
or <hi>Policy</hi> is onely usefull to supply the defect of <hi>Power?</hi> for he
who hath <hi>Power</hi> sufficient to effect whatsoever he pleaseth;
needs no help of <hi>Policy</hi> to compass his <hi>Designs.</hi> Wherefore
though to men it may seem usefull; yet it cannot be so to
God, whom we believe to be Omnipotent. What we weak
mortals want of the Lion, the Fox often supplies; but
the Lion of <hi>Iudah</hi> cannot without blasphemous derogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be affirmed to need any such shift; and if he needs
it not, why doth the Doctor obtrude upon him a needless
<hi>Attribute?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Having made Mercy and Severity two oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
Modes of Gods Justice, and brought in as a parallei
to them <hi>Veracity</hi> and <hi>Policy;</hi> he should have done but
honestly to have told us, of what Vertue in God this <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity</hi>
and <hi>Policy</hi> are the two opposite Modes: But here he
leaves us to seek.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Though Gods Mercy and Severity (as to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
objects) be not repugnant, but may well consist in the
same God: yet <hi>Veracity</hi> and <hi>Fallacity</hi> (for the <hi>Policy</hi> the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
fastens upon God, is neither better nor worse, would he
speak it out, them down right <hi>Fallacity)</hi> can by no means be
consistent in him. And the Reason is this; God exerciseth
his Mercy, by forbearing to exercise his Severity or Justice;
which forbearance infers no repugnancy: But he doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
<hi>Fallacity</hi> by forbearing to exercise <hi>Veracity,</hi> if he deceives
any one, he doth an act positively and essentially repugnant
to his <hi>Veracity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Question here was, Whether it be repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to Gods <hi>Veracity</hi> to convey a false perswasion into his
Creature. As an argument that it is not repugnant, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
tells us that <hi>Policy</hi> is not repugnant to his <hi>Veracity;</hi> and
what is this <hi>Policy,</hi> but his conveying of a false perswasion? So
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57586:59"/>
he very profoundly proves <hi>idem per idem:</hi> Namely, That to
convey a false perswasion, is not repugnant to Gods <hi>Veracity,</hi>
because it is not repugnant to Gods <hi>Veracity,</hi> to convey a false
perswasion.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, He supposeth that in some cases, there may not
be a due object for Gods <hi>Veracity,</hi> and therefore it were unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litickness
in God, if he should exercise his <hi>Veracity</hi> there. Yet
in his main Question, which occasioned this disquisition, the
object is the <hi>sincere person;</hi> and it is strange that such a person,
of all others, should not be a due object for God to deal <hi>Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously</hi>
with.</p>
               <p>Lastly, His comparison of a man harbouring his Prince
when persecuted by bloudy Rebels; is most miserably imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
in this Question concerning the most Wise and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God; unless he will also suppose, that this God can
be put to such straits, as he supposeth that man to be: which
supposal includes such impudent Blasphemy as I tremble to
think on. Surely were that man in Gods condition; were he
Omnipotent, he could not be straitned by any necessity either
of lying or speaking a lye, thereby to secure the life of his Prince
lurking in his house.</p>
               <p>After this, he distinguisheth between speaking a lye, and
speaking what is false, and counts this the best distinction for
salving their Credits, <q>[Who from the example of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Midwives, whom God rewarded for the fair story they
told the Infant-murdering <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> have concluded it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in some cases to lye.]</q> But how will he prove that God
rewarded them for that story? The text is this, <hi>Exod. 1. v.
21, 21. (Therefore God dealt well with the Midwives; and the
people multiplyed and waxed very mighty. And it came to pass,
because the Midwives feared God, that he made them houses.)
Moses</hi> having <hi>Vers.</hi> 20. told us that God did <hi>therefore</hi> deal well
with them: least we should presently fancy, that it was for
telling that fained story; he gives us the true reason, <hi>Vers.</hi> 21.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57586:60"/>
namely, <hi>Because they feared God.</hi> The fear of God made
them forbear from murdering the innocent Infants; and this
Piety God crowned with a correspondent reward; for he built
them houses, that is, raised and established their Families, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they conscientiously refused to destroy the Families of
the <hi>Israelites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He adds <q>[Simply to speak what is false, hath no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality
in it at all: otherwise, no man might dispute or
pronounce a false Axiom. And if an Axiom spoken that
hath neither any conformity with the minde of him that
speaks, nor with the thing it pronounces of, is not morally
evil; that Incongruity betwixt enuntiated falsity and the
minde and the thing, hath no moral evil in it. What mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
evil then can it have in it, when it is enuntiated for a
good end, and in very congruous Circumstances?]</q> Still
extravagant. The Point in hand, is not concerning the meer
simple pronouncing of what is false, but pronouncing it <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
decipiendi,</hi> on purpose to convey a false perswasion into
the hearer, and making him believe that to be true, which
is not true; and this I trow, hath some Immorality in it: nor
can the specious pretence of a <hi>good end,</hi> excuse what is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
evil.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>[Wherefore, as it is said of unity, (which yet is one of
the divine Attributes,) <hi>Nibil Boni est in Unitate, nist Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
sit in Bono:</hi> So I say of Veracity, <hi>Nibil boni est in Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racitate,
nisi Veracitas sit in Bonum.</hi>]</q> I pray Doctor, was
it ever said of that Unity which is one of the divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
that <hi>Nihil boni est in Unitate, nisi Unitas sit in bono?</hi>
That <hi>Nisi</hi> supposeth it possible, that the Unity spoken of,
may happen not to be <hi>In Bono:</hi> but is this possible touching
the Unity of the divine Nature? You might therefore more
wisely and mannerly too, have spared your ill-looking Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis.
Besides would you have imitated that sentence, as
you pretend, you ought to have said, <hi>Nihil Boni est in Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57586:60"/>
nisi Veracit as sit in Bono.</hi> But you were aware that there
would have been but small sense in those words, and nothing at
all to your purpose: therefore notwithstanding your premised
<hi>(so I say)</hi> you do not say so, but quite another thing, namely,
<hi>In Bonum,</hi> for <hi>In Bono.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>[And that goodness is the measure of all moral perfection
in man, as it is certainly the most sovereign Attribute in
God, and the measure of all what we may by way of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,
call moral Attributes in him. Neither can any thing
be rightly termed an act of Severity, Mercy, Policy, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity
or the like, unless it participate of his Goodness, and
involve not in it more evil then good; so that in what ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
or occasions that would happen, the goodness of God
would not fail to make use of such a Mode of his Justice or
Wisedom, as were opposite to that which would create so
much Inconvenience.]</q> How marvelously little makes this
discourse of Gods Goodness, to the Doctors purpose! unless
he supposeth, that the Divine Goodness may suffer, if we
hold that God cannot convey a false perswasion into mans
minde. But is God any thing the less good, because he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deceive man? If Gods <hi>Veracity</hi> be alwaies strictly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,
and no <hi>Policy</hi> admitted in his Actions, what evil or
inconvenience could hence ensue; seeing he is, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
still Almighty, and can by no Exigence be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to stand in need of Craft or Fallacity to maintain his
Goodness?</p>
               <p>Now at length, having cleared the field, (just as you have
seen) the Doctor victoriously concludes, That what he hath
said <q>[If duly considered is <hi>more then enough,</hi> for the prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Gods conveying a false perswasion into the minde
of his Creature, <hi>Permissione certâ &amp; efficaci,</hi> may not clash
at all with the Divine <hi>Veracity.</hi>]</q> But first, Those words,
<hi>Permissione certâ &amp; efficaci,</hi> were not in the Question pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
but jugled in here, he knows why. This is his
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57586:61"/>
old trick, but so pitifull an one, as will onely make him <hi>debere
ludibrium pueris.</hi> Secondly, If they had been in the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Question, they had onely made the Question ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
by supposing that to be Gods <hi>Act,</hi> which is but his
Permission; for the appendent Epithets <hi>Certâ &amp; Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caci,</hi>
will no way mend the matter; as I have proved
already.</p>
               <p>In his 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> he advanceth against the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>Objection,</hi> and
saith, <q>[As for the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                     <hi>Objection,</hi> as if this supposition were
destructive of our faith and trust in God; as if this once
admitted, we could never know when he spoke truth, or
were in earnest with us, <hi>i.</hi> whether the Religion we are at
present perswaded of be true; the Answer thereunto <hi>is not
far to seek.</hi> I say therefore, that though a false Religion
were the Command of God, it is <hi>no lett or hinderance to the
sinding of the True:</hi> For though it be his Command, yet it
is not with <hi>those circumstances</hi> that his <hi>absolute and enuntia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Command is.</hi> Such as the superlative Holiness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable
Miracles of the true Prophet, express voices from
Heaven giving testimony to him; his rising from the dead,
and his visible ascending into those mansions of Glory; and
finally, the perfect congruity of the whole Religion to the
exactest Reason, and its having nothing in it repugnant
thereto; the being attested to by illustrious Prophesies, both
many and at great distances from the event, with the like ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
which <hi>no permissive Command of God can be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiated
with.</hi>]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed such Answers as this, need not <hi>be far to seek:</hi> for
the Point is this; Whether, admitting a false Religion to be
the Command of God, we can know when God speaks truth,
and whether the Religion we are at present perswaded of, be
true. He saith, <hi>The admitting this, is no lett or hinderance to
the finding the true Religion:</hi> And why? <hi>Because such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
is not so circumstantiated as his absolute enuntiative Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57586:61"/>
is.</hi> Here I first demand, Why he thus distinguisheth
Gods Commands? for the Command in Question, is by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
supposed to be a full and firm conviction of Conscience
conveyed by God into the minde; this cannot be, unless the
Command be given and signified to the minde, that is, unless
it be some way or other enuntiated; and indeed it cannot be
convinced how God can give a Command, if it be not <hi>enuntia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi>
Then for <hi>absolute,</hi> this Command is such also. For the
Doctor supposeth it to be a Command touching Religion, nay
to be Religion it self; and will he have it not <hi>absolute,</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional?
If he will, yet this cannot serve his turn; for he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
<hi>Sect.</hi> 15. that this false perswasion conveyed by God
(which is the Command) doth necessarily oblige the party per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
to act conscientiously thereupon; and if it doth so it
must be <hi>absolute.</hi> The Doctors distinction therefore is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to his own Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is easily evincible out of the Doctors own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions,
that the admitting of this Principle must needs be a
<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ett or hinderance to the finding the true Religion: for let this
Command or false Perswasion be circumstantiated as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
pleaseth, yet still it is a Command conveyed into the
minde of man, and with such circumstances, that even in a
sincere soul, it begets full conviction of Conscience, that it is
indeed Gods Command. Now the Conscience being thus
convinced, no Circumstances of any other Religion, can ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
upon such a soul, to believe it to be true: and the reason
of this is plain, for the soul is already satisfied, that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
she hath embraced, is Gods Command; she cannot
therefore (especially if she be <hi>sincere)</hi> listen to any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the Religion she hath already entertained. For all
Circumstances of that other Religion, cannot possibly mount
higher then to prove it to be of God, and to be his Command
strictly obliging the Conscience: But this soul being convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
that her present Religion is such, she can have no just rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57586:62"/>
to change it; and may well and honestly suspect, that
the pretence which another Religion makes of proceeding
from God, though never so full and specious, is yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
but fallacious, and a Train fairly laid to deceive her.
And is this no lett or hinderance to the finding of the
true Religion! for my part, I have been considering it, and
must profess, that I am not able to fancy any hinderance
so great.</p>
               <p>As for the particular Circumstances which he mentioneth of
the Christian Religion, (viz. <hi>The superlative Holiness,</hi> &amp;c.)
we may suppose the whole History of them known to an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
moral <hi>Iew.</hi> Now if this <hi>Iews</hi> Religion may be granted
to be conveyed into his minde by God, and thereby be Gods
Command to him; well may he neglect those Circumstances,
and rest securely upon what is Gods Command, <hi>viz.</hi> his own
Religion as it is opposite to the Christian: for why should he
believe or regard any thing contrary to what he is convinced in
his Conscience to proceed from God? If it be replyed, That
in case this <hi>Iew</hi> would but hear such Reasons and Arguments
as may be drawn from those mighty Circumstances, they
would prove to him that he is in an Errour, and ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
his erroneous Conscience: He may by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi>'s Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
readily Answer, That though his Religion could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
an Errour, yet still it may be the Command of God; and
that for his part, he is convinced that so it is: wherefore whilst
Gods Command sounds in his soul, he holds it impudent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
to disobey it. As for Reasons and Arguments, they
can signifie nothing to him; for a perswasion conveyed by
God himself, may include falsity; much more may any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and Arguments which men can muster up to perswade
him. For it is demonstrable, that if God may convey a false
perswasion, then may any thing made by God, whether An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
or Man, whether Reason or Sense, make a false Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation.
Thus except it be granted, that God be of immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57586:62"/>
Veracity, and can neither deceive nor be deceived, there
neither is nor can be any stable grounding upon any thing in
the world as true. I might here minde the Reader, of the
Doctors varying the terms of this Objection: but I hasten to
follow him, for he immediately adds, That <q>[<hi>By purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our mindes, perfecting holiness in the fear of God,</hi> and
by <hi>free and unprejudiced</hi> Reason, a man shall <hi>(with Gods
assistance)</hi> be fully able to distinguish the <hi>Permissive</hi>
Command of God, from his <hi>absolute or enunciative;</hi> and
know at last that the former was for trial or Punishment,
but that <hi>now he is under his most perfect and absolute Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
indeed.</hi>]</q>
               </p>
               <p>The vanity of his distinction between Gods permissive, and
his absolute or enuntiative Command, I have noted already.
Now it was well the Doctor forgot not here to put in <hi>(with
Gods assistance)</hi> else he who by his own industrious wit disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
a falsity in the perswasion introduced by God, might be
thought cunninger then God the Authour of it; but if God
must help him to do it, the case is altered. And yet perhaps
the Policy of that God might notwithstanding be questioned,
who contrives and conveys a false perswasion, and then assists
men in discovering his own deceit.</p>
               <p>But now the means which he prescribes for attaining the
knowledge of the true Religion is such, as is not within the
sphear of the Party concerned: for this Party is one in a false
Religion, and conscientiously Convinced that it is true. Can
he <hi>purifie his minde and perfect holiness?</hi> Can he attain to
complete sanctity in a false Religion? If he can, then it is
most certain that <hi>unprejudiced Reason</hi> (though indeed it be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
to suppose, as the Doctor doth, that such a mans
Reason should remain unprejudiced whilst he conscientiously
holds a false Religion,) will rather perswade him to set up his
rest in that Religion which he is already convinced to be Gods
Command, then to seek another contrary to it. For what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57586:63"/>
can move him to imagine, that a Religion conveyed to him
by God, and such as by it he <hi>perfects holiness in the sight of
God,</hi> is not that Gods <hi>absolute,</hi> but as the Doctor will needs have
it, his <hi>permissive Command?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, What is the sense of Gods <hi>permissive Command</hi>
in this case? is it that God effectually permits a lying spirit to
instill that false perswasion into man? Even this will not
amount to make it Gods Command, unless we grant every
sin which the tempter perswades us to, to be Gods Command
also. But if it be, (as the Doctor in the first Question pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
it) competible to the Nature of God, to convey a
false perswasion; then may God do this immediately by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
and how then is such a perswasion his <hi>permissive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand?</hi>
Doth God <hi>permit</hi> himself to <hi>Command?</hi> Or doth he
<hi>Command permissively?</hi> Or is that Command which obliges
the Conscience religiously to act (for so the Doctor affirms this
to do) onely a <hi>permission,</hi> or a <hi>Commanding permission;</hi> or what
in Gods name is it?</p>
               <p>Well, the Doctor nevertheless concludes, in the close of
this 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 
                  <q>[That this his supposition is no prejudice at
all, but a mighty advantage to Christianity: for were but
mankinde perswaded that for ought they know, the present
Religion they are under, may be but a permissive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
imposed upon them for punishment or trial, it would
ingage them not to immerse themselves so much into the
world, but to live holily, and meditate seriously on divine
Matters; to Pray servently, and seek diligently what is the
true Religion indeed, which undoubtedly would confirme
the Christian more strongly in his Religion, (truth the
more it is tryed, gaining the greater Empire upon the minds
of men) and were the next way to turn all men that made se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
use of this Principle unto Christianity. Thus have I
fully cleared the first particular disquisition comprised in the
main Question from the chief Objections made against it.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:57586:63"/>
Here the Doctor speaks of <hi>mankinde,</hi> Christians and not
Christians; and affirms it advantageous to Christianity if they
were all perswaded that for ought they know, their present
Religion may be but Gods permissive command, <hi>i. e.</hi> not the
true Religion: this prompts all the world to be <hi>Cartesians</hi> in
Religion, and suspect all Principles which they had before
believed, yea though Christian Principles for the doing of
which, could the Doctor prevail with them, he doubts not
but it would ingage them to abandon secularity, to live holily,
to meditate seriously on divine matters, to pray servently and
seek diligently what is the true Religion indeed. But how
knows the Doctor that this effect will follow? his credit is
not so good as that we take his word for a warrant: and doth
not sad experience tell us that many Christians (seduced by
such Leaders as the Doctor) growing thus disquisitive as to
doubt that the principles of their Religion may be false, have
instead of growing unsecular and holy, turn'd grossly carnal,
prophane, and little less then atheistical: instead of serious
meditation, fervent prayer, and diligent search for the true
Religion; made a mock of Devotion, and sacrificed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to idleness, pleasure and vanity?</p>
               <p>It is true, we are to <hi>Try all things:</hi> but that is before we
receive them, not after. He who turns from any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to the Christian, ought to try and be fairly satisfied
concerning the Christian, before he ingages in it: but having
so ingaged, then he is not to unravel all again by doubting of
what he had upon just grounds imbraced; unless he means to
be a perpetual weathercock. As for those who are educated in
the Christian Religion, and never were ingaged in any other;
it is very usefull to exhort them to so much meditation and
study in it, as to inable them to give a reason of the hope that
is in them, and to stop the mouths of gain-sayers: but to tell
them that it is for their advantage to be perswaded that for
ought they know their Religion may be false, is a certain
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57586:64"/>
way to make them for a while to believe no Religion; and a
probable way to render them secure and perfect Atheists: for,
upon such a perswasion, they are so far from being ingaged
to live holily, to pray fervently, to wean themselves from the
world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as the Doctor would pretend) that they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ingaged in the quite contrary. And my reason is: because
all these and such like parts of piety, are parts of that very
Christian Religion which such men are perswaded may for
ought they know, be not Gods Absolute, but his Permissive
Command, that is, not True but False.</p>
               <p>If it be replyed, that such duties as those, are taught us
rather as we are Men, then as we are Christians; I mean by
the law of Nature and right reason; and that therefore our
suspending our Belief of our Religion properly as Christian
suspends not our Belief of being obliged to those Duties: I
answer: First, those Duties are all incorporated in the Gospel
and more expressly taught us in Christs Law, then in the l<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
of Nature. 2. As I suspend my Belief of the truth of Christs
Law, so I may suspend my Belief of the truth of Natures
Law, and suppose that this as well as that, is but Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive
command. 3. <hi>Not to be immersed in the world,</hi> is to
be <hi>mortified:</hi> to <hi>live holily,</hi> or as he expressed it before, to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
holiness in the fear of God,</hi> is to be intirely <hi>spiritualized:</hi>
And these are properly Christian Virtues.</p>
               <p>Now touching them who are not Christians, the Doctor
affirms that the serious use of this his Principle [<hi>viz.</hi> That
for ought they know, their Religion is false, <hi>i. e.</hi> onely Gods
permissive command] is the next way to turn all men to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</p>
               <p>Indeed to perswade them, that for ought they know their
present Religion may be false, is a fair step towards their i<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
quiring after the true. But to perswade them so upon D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi>
principle [<hi>viz.</hi> That their Religion may be false, though it
be Gods command, and though their consciences be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57586:64"/>
that it is his Command] is not the way to Christianity,
but to Atheism, or at least to an indifferency in Religion little
better then Atheism. For, grant the Infidel this ground; and
by what arguments will you press him to turn Christian? the
best which D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi> can suggest are I guess, those which
he hinted in this Section, <hi>i. e.</hi> The superlative holiness and
unimitable miracles of Christ: voices from heaven giving
testimony to him; his Resurrection, his Ascension, his being
attested by prophesies at great distance. To these or any the
like, the Infidels answer is ready, <hi>viz.</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi> hath assured
me that God may be the conveyer of a false perswasion: why
then should I not conclude that all these strange stories you
tell me of Christ, may also be false? for why may not you,
or any men whatsoever, deceive me, as well as God?</p>
               <p>Yea but if you will <hi>purifie</hi> your self, and <hi>perfect holiness</hi> in
the fear of God, and use <hi>free and unprejudiced reason,</hi> you shall
by <hi>Gods assistance</hi> find those stories to be true. To this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
his answer is at hand: How know I that all you now say,
is not a train to convey a false perswasion into me? I cannot
in any reason be more assured of your Veracity, then I am of
Gods: and your pretended Veracity here, may be nothing else
but Policy. But whereas you tell me I shall discover the truth
<hi>by Gods assistance:</hi> what am I the nearer, or how can I trust to
that staff, if God himself may be the Authour of a false per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion;
and if he, no less then you, may in this case, for
ought I know, exercise his policy, and not his veracity?</p>
               <p>The second Argument therefore (which I also take from
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More,</hi> in the mentioned place) must be this: That Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion holds <hi>perfect congruity to the exactest reason,
and hath nothing in it repugnant thereto.</hi> To this the Infidel
may thus reply: if God may deceive me, exactest reason may
deceive me. Or if your God can deceive, and reason not;
then shall reason be my God: onely I would desire you to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
me where exact reason dwells, and how I may come
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57586:65"/>
acquainted wit it. If it be that which cannot deceive, I am
sure it dwells not in me, for I dare not think my self priviledged
with that veracity which you deny to God: and how you can
prove that it dwells in you, is past my imagination. Had you
told me that God cannot deceive, and that he hath set up the
candle of reason in mans soul; I should have counted the
dictates of this reason to be infallible: but seeing you teach
me that God the prime fountain of all things whatsoever,
may convey into mans minde that which is false, you leave
me no certain bottom to build upon: And therefore I had
best even at a venture be content with the Religion I have
hapned to be in, whether right or wrong; and not trouble
my self about the needless entertaining of a new one, which
for ought I know (or you either, upon this your ground) may
prove a false perswasion.</p>
               <p>And thus the oraculous Doctor hath <hi>cleared, yea and fully
cleared</hi> (but we want some new Dictionary to teach us what
<hi>clearing</hi> signifies) his first particular Disquisition. Sect. 15.
he thus proceeds <q>[The second was, whether it be compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
to the nature of God to convey a false perswasion in
things practical, and which religiously and conscientiously
oblige the party thus perswaded, to act accordingly, or abstain
from acting.]</q> 
                  <hi>This he decides affirmatively: for he adds, that</hi>
                  <q>[<hi>Ahab</hi> was thus deceived by Gods effectual permission of that
lying spirit that profer'd his service in that affair: for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of that sure success which he thought was promised him
from God, was plainly of that nature as to oblige his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to fight the Lords battels against the uncircumcised.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon supposal of his former conclusion, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible
to Gods nature to convey a false perswasion into the
the minde of his Creature, (which conclusion I hope I have
made appear to be shamefully false) I will grant him, that
such a perswasion doth conscientiously oblige the party per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
to act, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I have already proved that this was
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57586:65"/>
not <hi>Ahabs</hi> case, and that it was not God but the Divel who
deceived <hi>Ahab:</hi> he must therefore give us some other instance:
and that he doth in the very next words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>[Moreover that example of Gods conveying that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
into <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would have him to sacrifice
his son, is <hi>beyond all exception:</hi> for it is manifest that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
was so perswaded, by both what he did in the history,
and what is said of him <hi>Heb. 11. 17. By faith Abraham when
he was tryed, offer'd up Isaac, accounting that God was able to
raise him up even from the dead, from whence he also received
him in a figure.</hi> And if he had not been perswaded that he
was indeed to sacrifice him, it had been no tryal of his faith:
but God never intended he should sacrifice him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this perswasion he conveyed into him was false, but
did most indispensably oblige his conscience to act, for the
giving of a proof of his wonderfull faith in God.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Doctor may exercise his wonted confidence; but for
all that, I must tell him, he is much mistaken, (as confident
men use to be) and that this example is not <hi>beyond all excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
First he argues that <hi>Abraham</hi> was perswaded that he
was to sacrifice his son, because unless this be granted, it was
no <hi>tryall of his faith.</hi> I ask, of what faith? the Doctor would
have us think, it was that faith, by which <hi>Abraham</hi> believed
this to be Gods command: and was this such a singular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit
of faith, as to render <hi>Abraham</hi> so eminently famous?
what is more frequent then for saints to believe that to be
the command of God, which God commands them? the
<hi>strangeness</hi> of the thing commanded alters not the case: it
may perhaps stagger the person commanded in reference to
the performance of it; but it obstructs not his belief that it is
God indeed who gives such a command, unless the thing
commanded be apparently repugnant to some known law of
God. Here I easily imagine the Doctor will greedily reply,
that this command was such, as being inconsistent with Gods
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57586:66"/>
Law against Murder. Now therefore I see I must tell the
Doctor some news; and this it is.</p>
               <p>That this command of God was not contrary to his Law
against murder: nor had <hi>Abraham</hi> murdered <hi>Isaac,</hi> though he
had actually sacrificed him: for, God had expressly promised
him before, that in <hi>Isaac</hi> should his seed be called. <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 12.
This promise <hi>Abraham</hi> firmly believed, and doubted not but
<hi>Isaac</hi> should infallibly propagate his seed: wherefore, chap. 22.
upon Gods command (though most strange and unexpected)
to sacrifice <hi>Isaac, Abraham</hi> in most noble confidence of Gods
Veracity, makes no demurrs, but prepares to offer him; not
having the least scruple but God could and would make good
his word; for he fully accounted that he was able to recall
his son from his ashes, and to raise him up even from the dead,
as it is <hi>Heb. 11. 19. To Murder</hi> (which Gods Law forbade) is
to take away mans life without just Authority, and so to take
it away, as utterly to destroy it: but <hi>Abraham</hi> now had Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
given him by the Lord of all; and he knew and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
by virtue of Gods promise, that though he sacrificed
<hi>Isaac,</hi> yet he neither should nor could finally destroy his life.
Certain he was, that this sacrificing of him, was not quite
to make an end of him, but onely to open a way to Gods
miraculous asserting his former Promise. And this, this was
the signal tryal of <hi>Abrahams</hi> most steady and glorious faith:
Not the trying whether he believed that command of sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<hi>Isaac,</hi> to be the command of God; but whether he firmly
believed the former promise, that in <hi>Isaac</hi> should his seed be
called. And indeed thus much is clearly enough legible in the
mentioned, 11 <hi>Heb.</hi> where the Apostle first sets this note
upon <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith <hi>he that had received the promises, offer'd
up his onely begotten son of whom it was said, that in Isaac shall
thy seed be called,</hi> v. 17, 18. and then he adds in what his faith
consisted <hi>Accounting that God was able to raise</hi> him <hi>up even
from the dead,</hi> v. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:57586:66"/>
Secondly though the Doctor offers no other proof, that
<hi>Abraham</hi> was to sacrifice his son; yet I freely grant it him. But
was this a false perswasion? He believed that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him thus to do, and that it was his duty to obey. Is
there any falsity in this? I, but the Doctor urges that <hi>God
intended not</hi> he should sacrifice his son actually; yet had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
into him a perswasion, that he did intend he should
actually sacrifice him: and this perswasion of Gods intent
was false.</p>
               <p>I answer, 1. <hi>Abraham</hi> was perswaded that God commanded
him so: and what reason had he to look any farther. 2. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he were expressly perswaded that God <hi>intended</hi> he should
actually sacrifice his son; which yet God intended not: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
he knew and was perswaded also, that if God stopped
him in the Act of sacrificing by a countermand; then he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
no more but that he should with unfeigned obedience
willingly and readily offer himself to slay his son. Wherefore
his first perswasion (<hi>viz.</hi> that God intended he should actually
slay his son) was conditional; namely, provided that God
himself did not interpose in the Act by a new command, and
so accept the sincere will, for the deed. Now this conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
perswasion, had not the least falsity in it; nor was <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
any ways Deceived by it. God did not deceive <hi>Abraham;</hi>
but D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi> deceives himself.</p>
               <p>Nay father; what if <hi>Abraham</hi> did actually offer up his
son? what if God acknowledges, the scripture attests, that
he did so? what then becomes of this false perswasion so
eagerly pressed by the Doctor? But God saith to <hi>Abraham
Gen. 22. 9. seeing thou hast not with held thy son, thine onely
son, from me,</hi> and the Apostle saith expressly <hi>Heb. 11. 17.
By faith Abraham offer'd up Isaac; and he who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the promises offer'd up his onely begotten son:</hi> not <hi>(pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to offer)</hi> but <hi>(did offer)</hi> that is actually: and this is
here twice for fail affirmed in the same verse. <hi>Abrahams</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:57586:67"/>
sincere will, is by God accounted for the very Deed.</p>
               <p>If the Doctor still retorts, that <hi>Abraham</hi> understood not
aforehand that God would accept the Will for the Deed; and
that his willingness and readiness was all that God intended:
but on the contrary that he was then perswaded that he ought
to shed his sons blood on the Altar; and that in this perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
he was deceived by God. To this, my former answer
concerning <hi>Abrahams</hi> conditional perswasion, is sufficient,
But I add, had he been perswaded, that he ought (absolutely,
without any condition, and exclusively of any thing that might
happen and intervene to the contrary) actually to shed his
sons blood: how will the Doctor prove, that God conveyed
into him this perswasion? for if God did convey it, then must
God be supposed to perswade <hi>Abraham,</hi> 1. That the readiness
of his will would not serve his turn. 2. That though any
thing intervened, be it a countermand from God in the very
Act, yet he was bound to neglect that countermand, and to
execute the first injunction. Dares the Doctor suppose that
God thus perswaded <hi>Abraham?</hi> Besides, what if <hi>Abraham</hi>
came into such a perswasion as is premised above, by not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the first or second now mentioned, neither affirming
nor denying, nor thinking of either? must it be that God
caused <hi>Abraham</hi> so not to consider them? Thus <hi>Abraham</hi>
might possibly be perswaded that in event he should actually
slay his son, and yet God not so perswade him, or any more
then that it was Gods will he should really goe and obey by
doing on his part what was commanded. Imperative words
are spoken to the Will, what he should will to do, not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive
of what should in event be executed.</p>
               <p>To conclude, God himself intended that <hi>Abraham</hi> should
actually sacrifice his Son, unless he interposed a Command to
the contrary, (for thus we are forced to distinguish in Gods
Acting, to make it intelligible to our selves,) and of thus
much was <hi>Abraham</hi> perswaded; in which perswasion there
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57586:67"/>
was no falsity. That God intended also to interpose a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Precept, the event assures us is true: But this argues not
<hi>Abraham</hi> to have been falsly perswaded in this Point; for
God had conveyed no perswasion into him touching it, either
true or false. The sum is this: <hi>Abraham</hi> was certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that God intended he should sacrifice his Son; unless
before the striking the fatal blow, the same God interposed a
countermand. Whether God would so interpose he knew
not: and when God did actually interpose, <hi>Abraham</hi> found
not himself any more <hi>deceived</hi> by God, then if he had not
interposed.</p>
               <p>The Doctors Addition out of <hi>Siracides, Chap. 4. Vers. 17.</hi>
may well amount to what the Apostle saith, <hi>Heb. 12. 6.
(Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son
whom he receiveth,)</hi> but can never prove that God tries men by
impressing falsity upon their mindes. The Reader may please
to view the place, for I hasten to his</p>
               <p>16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Section,</hi> where he comes to his 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>Disquisition,</hi> and
saith, <q>[The third is, Whether such an <hi>effectual,</hi> though
<hi>permissive</hi> false perswasion from God thus obliging the
Conscience to act, or abstain from acting this or that, may
rightly be called the Command of God?]</q> His old Art
here again. In the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> where he propounds this disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
it is in these terms, <hi>[Whether this false conviction or
perswasion may rightly be called the Command of God to such a
a person thus perswaded.]</hi> What terms he now inserts is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
But however he resolves the question roundly and brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
saying, <hi>[I think it is evident that it is of right so called,]</hi> viz.
<hi>the Command of God.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And truly well he might, if we grant him (what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
we cannot deny) his conclusion of his former Disquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
His Tenet there is, <hi>That it is competible to the Nature of
God to convey into man such a false perswasion, as doth of its
own Nature necessarily oblige him to act conscientiouslly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:57586:68"/>
These are the last words of his 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Section.</hi> Now if it
<hi>oblige</hi> a man, if of <hi>its own nature</hi> it oblige him, if it oblige him
<hi>necessarily</hi> to act, it must needs be supposed to have the nature,
and so to deserve the name of a <hi>Command.</hi> This 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition</hi>
therefore might (as I noted at first) have been well
spared, did not the Doctor take much felicity in unnecessary
Scribling.</p>
               <p>But his word <hi>Permissive,</hi> which he hath crowded into this
Disquisition, seems something to trouble his stomach;
wherefore to ease himself, he makes his Reader object that,
if it be <hi>Permissive,</hi> it is <hi>no Command.</hi> To this he makes this
pretty Answer: <q>[Here I am very willing to compound with
the Opposer, and to determine it onely <hi>A Permissive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi>]</q>
But the Compounder presently suspected that the
Reader would count his Composition pitifull nonsence: im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
therefore he adds, <q>[Which is not so bad syntax,
as it may seem at first sight, but very good and warrantable
sense.]</q> Alas, the syntax is not to blame, but looks well
enough at first sight: all the fault lies in the Contradiction of
the terms. Let us see therefore how the Doctor <hi>warrants</hi>
and makes <hi>good (very good)</hi> the sense. Why this he saith he
will do by this <hi>obvious Illustration,</hi> 
                  <q>[Suppose some migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Prince should knowingly and wittingly by connivance per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Keeper of his Broad Seal to Signe some Commission
or Command, to such or such parties in some Province of
his Empire to act thus or thus, but <hi>not contrary</hi> to any of his
Laws promulgated to that Province, so that they cannot
make the <hi>least scruple</hi> concerning the legitimateness of the
Instrument. I demand if these Parties that receive this
Broad Seal, do not receive a command from their Prince;
and ask further, Whether it be any more then a <hi>Permissive
Command.</hi> I do not mean <hi>Permissive</hi> in counterdistinction
to <hi>Injunctive,</hi> (for that indeed were not so good sense) but
an obliging injunction from their Prince, and <hi>yet coming to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57586:68"/>
them onely by his Connivance and Permission.</hi> This I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
to be a <hi>Permissive Command,</hi> and such as will secure
the Parties from all blame and harm from the displeasure of
their Prince, they having his Broad Seal to authorize their
Actions; nor have any other Authority violently to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their proceedings, till they have a certain and infallible
injunction from the Prince himself, not onely <hi>Permissive,</hi> but
<hi>Oral</hi> and <hi>Positive</hi> so to do.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is a great part of this Doctors trade, when he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of solid Arguments, (as needs he must be) to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
gross Errours and Nonsense; to attempt the feat
by Comparisons. But of all that I have happened to read,
I remember no Writer who useth this kinde of Proof with
so bad luck.</p>
               <p>Here he first compares God to a Prince, who willingly and
wittingly by connivance, permits the Keeper of his Seal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
This falls short of the Question, which is, Whether God
himself conveys a false Perswasion or Command; not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he Permits another to convey it. And by the Doctors
instance in <hi>Abraham,</hi> his Opinion appears to be, That God
himself immediately (without the intercurrence of any Keeper
of his Seal) doth convey a false Perswasion or Command.
Besides, what false perswasion is conveyed into him who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
Commission from the Keeper, as the Doctor supposes?
Is it that he thinks it to be the Princes Command which he
receiveth? Nothing less, for he were falsely perswaded, if
he did not think so, seeing no Prince doth more certainly and
legally Command, then by his Bread Seal. But the truth is,
a Keeper of his Princes Broad Seal, may possibly set that Seal
dishonestly to what he ought not. But Gods Broad Seal can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be set to ought, but by himself. For Gods Broad Seal,
are such Works, as none but himself can set or work; and
therefore they are his Seal. So that the comparison comes
not up to the main thing in Controversie, Whether God
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57586:69"/>
himself can convey a false perswasion into mans minde. What
any other Officer doth (he not doing it,) is not in this case Gods
Act or Conveyance, nor to be held as such, though in earthly
Princes it may.</p>
               <p>Yea, but the Doctor supposes that the Prince did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
bid his Keeper Seal such a Commission, but onely wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
and willingly connived at it, and that therefore it
is his Command no more then <hi>Permissively.</hi> I answer, If
Commissions or Commands under the Princes Broad Seal,
be (as they are) most truly and legally his Commissions and
Commands; and if such a Commission or Command be not
issued by the Keeper surreptitiously, or of his own head, and
against the Princes Minde and Laws, but so as the Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>prudens &amp; sciens</hi> doth wittingly and willingly (as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
here supposeth) give way to the issuing of it; this is as
much to all intents and purposes the Princes <hi>Positive</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and Command, as if he had <hi>Orally</hi> in the most express
words imaginable joyned his Keeper to Seal and Issue it. This
example therefore affords not the least parallel to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
Chimera of a <hi>Permissive Command</hi> from God; nor doth
it prove the terms to be <hi>good,</hi> much less <hi>very good,</hi> and <hi>warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
sense.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had I leisure to be sportfull, I would scan those pretty
words of his, invented as if on purpose <hi>pro Ridiculo &amp; Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctamento;</hi>
                  <q>[I mean not <hi>Permissive</hi> in contradistinction to
<hi>Injunctive,</hi> for that indeed were not so good sense, but an
<hi>obliging Injunction</hi> from their Prince, yet coming to them
onely by his Connivance and Permission; this I understand
to be a <hi>Permissive Command.</hi>]</q> Wherefore let some body
else ask him, First, How <hi>Permissive</hi> can be understood to be
<hi>Permissive,</hi> and yet not contradistinct to <hi>Injunctive?</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
How that can be an <hi>obliging Injunction,</hi> which comes but
by <hi>Permission</hi> and <hi>Connivance?</hi> That the sequel involves him
in inextricable non-sense, who can help it; seeing the Doctor
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57586:69"/>
will rather venture to speak any thing, then yield that he hath
spoken amiss?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. He saith, <q>[Wherefore having rightly stated
and cleared the three Particulars of the Question propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
we shall now be bold to infer the whole Conclusion in
this 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Aphorism.</hi>]</q> Reader, how <hi>rightly</hi> and <hi>clearly</hi> he
hath performed what he here boasts, do thou judge; mean
while I follow him to his 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Aphorism,</hi> which runs thus;
<q>[That a full and firm conviction of Conscience in a soul that
is sincere, touching a Religion into which some things are
incorporate that be false, but without any moral Turpitude;
and of that nature that no moral sincerity may be able to
discover the falseness of them; is rightly said to be the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive
Command</hi> of God to that soul for either punishment
or trial.]</q> I see how loath he is to leave his trick of intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
more terms in the Conclusion, then he propounded in
the Question, for instead of these words in his Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<hi>Sect. 3. [Can be rightly said to be the Command
of God,]</hi> here he saith, <hi>[Is rightly said to be the Permissive
Command of God.]</hi> But let this pass. Having produced
his Aphorism, he presently falls a crowing in this fashion,
<q>[This Assertion, I hope, to all indifferent Judges, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
both <hi>true and modest.</hi>]</q> That it <hi>is true,</hi> is falsly said,
which appears by what I have alledged against his Proofs of it.
That it is <hi>modest,</hi> whatever the Doctors hopes be, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seem such, till the world can so far dote as to believe, that
one repugnant thing doth signifie another; that to <hi>Command</hi> is
to <hi>Permit,</hi> and to <hi>Permit</hi> is to <hi>Command.</hi> That <hi>Permissive</hi> may
signifie <hi>Injunctive;</hi> and <hi>Injunctive Permissive:</hi> That <hi>Boldness
of Innovations</hi> may signifie <hi>Madesty, &amp; vice versâ;</hi> and that
therefore the one may without impudence be used for the other</p>
               <p>Well, but as <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Modest</hi> as it is, he dares not trust it
abroad in that garb which in his foregoing <hi>Sections</hi> he took
such large pains to trim it in: His Conscience pricked the man
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57586:70"/>
on to say something more, though God knows just nothing
<hi>ad rem.</hi> He pleads that he <q>[understands not this Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
or Command of God in any false Religion, in a
<hi>Positive</hi> sense, but onely <hi>Permissive:</hi> and means not that
in such a case God as it were riseth off from his Seat to act or
speak, but onely by letting the course of things go on, and
giving no stop to secondary causes, such a perswasion <hi>as from
God</hi> is conveyed into the minde of man <hi>permissione certâ &amp;
efficaci.</hi>]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Doth not this interfere with his alledging <hi>Abrahams</hi> example
as most <hi>unexceptionable</hi> for his purpose? did God there onely
let the course of things proceed, without putting a stop to
secondary causes? But that which I chiefly observe here, is
his staggering quite from his principle, in those words, <hi>[Such
a perswasion as from God is conveyed into the minde,</hi> &amp;c.] Now
it seems, it is but <hi>as from God;</hi> not <hi>from God. As from God,</hi>
and that onely by his letting of the course of things go on;
and thus Gods conveying of a false perswasion into the mindes
of men, is defended by denying it, by conveying it away out
of that which he will defend, and yet that perswasion must
still be conveyed, that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi> hath not conveyed any errour
in his Writings.</p>
               <p>Nor stays he here, but by a strange giddyness reels again
to his former fancy; for he adds in the later part of this
17<hi rend="sup">h</hi> 
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> That God conveyeth a false perswasion into the
minde of his Creature, <q>[Not by a positive particular exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his power upon the Creature, but onely by an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
permission of secondary causes.]</q> But this onely intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
him in a farther absurdity, (as I have somewhere hinted
before, and must, since the Doctor here leads me to it, declare
again:) For if Gods permission of secondary causes be Gods
Command, then God Commands all the sins in the world.
The Doctor therefore must be content to grant, that Gods
<hi>Permission</hi> is no more then <hi>permission;</hi> and not jumble <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:57586:70"/>
and <hi>Commanding</hi> together, in his contradictious No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Commanding Permissively.</hi> For if he thinks to get off
by calling this Permission an <hi>effectual Permission,</hi> his device
will fail him, seeing the sins which God permits, are <hi>effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
permitted,</hi> (if he will so speak,) else they could not be
acted upon his Permission. But this effectualness is not from
any positive operation of God, but of those the Doctor terms
the secondary causes, namely, finners themselves. Now
though God knows that if he withdraws his restraining
Goodness, those secondary causes will certainly produce sinfull
effects; yet he may in his Justice, and for reasons known to
himself, withdraw that his restraining Goodness: nor can he
therefore be charged to be an <hi>effectual concurrer</hi> to those sins,
seeing those second causes are supposed to be free Agents,
and onely biassed to perverseness by their own prevailing
Corruptions</p>
               <p>In his 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> he sums up what he had premised in five
Particulars: in the fourth whereof he falls upon a new shift to
palliate the odiousness of his Position, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>[The Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Command may rightly be conceived to lye rather
upon that part of the Religion that is unexceptionably true,
then upon what is erroneous.]</q> He supposeth thus much truth
in the false Religion conveyed by God, as to acknowledge
one true God, and life to come, and a blessed immortality
for those that serve him in sincerity and truth. As for other
points it may be erroneous, but saith he, <hi>Gods Command
may rightly be conceived to lye rather upon that part which
is true, then upon what is crroneous.</hi> I will grant him more
then thus, for I affirm that Gods Command cannot rightly
be conceived to lye upon any part of the Religion, but that
which is true. But if the Doctors Position were true, it
must be granted to lye not onely on the true part, but on the
erroneous also; for he holds that conviction of Conscience
touching a Religion in which some falsities are incorporated,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57586:71"/>
is the Command of God: this Command therefore respects
the whole Religion of which the Conscience is thus by God
convinced; and how can a man so convinced, be able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that Gods intent was to Command him this part
of it, <hi>rather</hi> then that, when he is perswaded in his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that all of it is Commanded? The greatness or the small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Points in that Religion will not vary the case; the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
being not which Articles are of chief consequence, but
whether all, both great and less are true and obligatory, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from God.</p>
               <p>But the Doctor will needs be declaring this his fancy by a
knack, in which I have observed him marvellously unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
I mean, by a simile. Wilt thou have patience Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
till I repeat it? <q>[If the command of a Master to his
Servant should run in this form of a discreet Axiom; <hi>I will
have you wait on me at such a Meeting, though your cloths
be old or out of the Mode.</hi> The great stress of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
lies upon that indubitable point of duty <hi>the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Master,</hi> which he will not dispense withall,
though the Servant be not in the best mode accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
for it, and it may be it is his Masters pleasure that
as yet he should not. But he hath a full warrant, and
no man ought to hinder him from serving in that garb
he is. The like may be said of <hi>that habit of minde</hi> it
a Religionist which is not yet devoid of errour and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
but joyned with an irreprehensible sincerity that
he is to serve God, though in that less seemly and less per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
habit, and that his Master hath so commanded him
to do, and that therefore no man may rightfully hinder
him.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>That which the Doctor calls, <hi>The habit of minde in the
Religionist, not devoyd of errour and ignorance;</hi> he should
by his own Doctrine have called, That perswasion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
instilled by God touching a Religion into which
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57586:71"/>
some falsities are incorporated; which perswasion religiously
obliges the party to act accordingly. But this would
have spoyled the Play, and too much disfigured his fine
simile. However, there is no help but thus it must be,
or else his example of the Master and Servant cannot be
applyed to the present case. Hereupon he must suppose,
that the servants old unfashionable Clothes, are such as his
Master purposely put upon him, and such as in putting on
him, he commanded him to wear at such a Meeting. Now
upon this supposal, how indiscreet and ridiculous is that
Command in form of <hi>a discreet Axiom, [I will have you
wait on me though your Clothes be old and out of the Mode?]</hi>
that is, (I will have you wait on me in those Clothes,
though they be the Clothes I have put on you; and in
putting them on, commanded you to wait upon me in them.)
But much more ridiculous will the counter-part be; for by
the Laws of this simile, God must be supposed to say
thus: (I will have you serve me in this false perswasion,
though it be a false perswasion which I have conveyed
into you, and in conveying it Commanded you to serve
me in it.)</p>
               <p>After he hath abused the Reader (and indeed himself,)
with eighteen tedious <hi>Sections</hi> of this kinde of stuff; he
saith, <hi>Sect.</hi> 19. <q>[Now I conceive my self well appointed
for a sufficient Answer to the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Objection in terminis,</hi>
which is this.</q>
                  <q>Object. 7.</q>
[<hi>He saith, That God may and doth infuse into men false
perswasions in matters of Religion; instancing in</hi> Turcism
<hi>and</hi> Judaism, <hi>which contradict the Christian Faith,</hi> t. 10.
c. 10. p. 517, 518.]</p>
               <p>To this he first Answers thus, <q>[I no where in those Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
nor any where else, affirm that God <hi>infuseth</hi> a false
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57586:72"/>
perswasion into men. That Scholastick word <hi>infusion</hi> sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
quite contrary to my meaning; as if he infused fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
as he is said to <hi>infuse Graces,</hi> by a <hi>special and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive</hi>
operation upon the minde; whereas I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
fully declared my self, that I understand all that
which I have spoken concerning Gods conveying a false
perswasion into a man, in a Permissive, not Positive
way.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing the Doctor is thus nice, I will suppose the word <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi>
to be in the <hi>Objection</hi> instead of <hi>infuse;</hi> for certain I am,
that he here makes a distinction where the Objector made no
difference. And what hath he now got by it? for God may
as truly be said to convey Grace as to infuse it; and as truly
to infuse a false perswasion as to convey it. Nay his convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of falshood into the minde, must needs be an operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a special positive operation; no less then his infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Grace into the minde: if that falshood by him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
doth as the Doctor affirms, oblige the Conscience;
for no obligation can arise from a permission, but from some
other word of him that can oblige us, or something impressed
or infused into the minde.</p>
               <p>As for his adding, That he understands (and hath fully so
declared) all he hath spoken about Gods conveying a falsity,
in a <hi>Permissive, not Positive way:</hi> Besides the repugnancy
of the thing it self, I ask where he did thus <hi>declare himself?</hi>
In this Apologie I grant, but not in that place of his <hi>Mysterie,</hi>
where he delivers the Objected Doctrine. I finde not there
so much as the mention of <hi>Permission,</hi> to mitigate the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
But these words I finde, <q>[When can God be said
to Command a person, if not then when he conveyeth a
practical perswasion so unto him, that there is no place left
to doubt, but that it is his Command? for if he spoke
to him face to face, there could be no greater assurance of
receiving a Command from him.]</q> And these: <q>[The
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57586:72"/>
simple falsities in Religion, are not sufficient to detect that
such a Religion is not Commanded to such and such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
by God himself.] And these: [If thou wilt be so
humoursome for all this, as to deny that such a conviction
of Conscience so stated as I have stated it, is the <hi>Real Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God in every particular,</hi> namely, <hi>in the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
which are false,</hi> &amp;c.]</q> By which last words it is plain,
That the Command may not rightly be conceived to lye
rather upon that part of the Religion that is unexceptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
true, then upon what is erroneous, (which yet was
the Doctors last shift, <hi>Sect.</hi> 16.) but must equally lye upon
the whole.</p>
               <p>Let us suppose then, that the Doctor hath now found it
the safest course (the Laws being settled as they are,) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
himself in his <hi>Apologie</hi> as he saith he hath done. What
is this to his former Book? unless he also professeth, that in
it he delivered Doctrine which cannot be maintained, and
which is indeed incapable of the sense he saith he now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
that Doctrine in? Since a Command it was, if any
thing can be called a Command; for so he said, <hi>When can
God be said to Command a person, if not then when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys
a practical perswasion so into him, that there is no place
left to doubt but that it is his Command?]</hi> These words
now justified in his Preface (with all that he hath Writ)
cannot be minced as now he would in his <hi>Apologie,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Retracting them; of which honour it seems he judgeth
himself unworthy.</p>
               <p>Touching <hi>Turcism</hi> and <hi>Iudaism</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
he answereth thus, <q>[Though I do not stick to instance
in <hi>Turcism</hi> and <hi>Iudaism,</hi> nnd that in such things as they
contradict the Christian Belief in; yet again I reply, That
it is onely in things that have no moral Turpitude in them,
and that I suppose an invincible ignorance in them that
are thus perswaded, and that the conveyance of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57586:73"/>
in respect of God, is not Positive but onely Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>I must also again Reply, That there is not the least inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in the place where he handles this in his <hi>Mysterie,</hi> of
Gods conveying such a perswasion not Positively but Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missively.
Secondly, Touching <hi>moral Turpitude,</hi> (of which I
have said enough before,) it is easie to drive him from that
starting hole, though he makes frequent use of it, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
pleaseth himself in it. He instanceth in <hi>Turcism,</hi> as
a false Religion conveyed by God into his Creature; but this
Religion includes some points of moral Turpitude as gross as
any imaginable, no less then Points of bare falsity. And this
Assertion, though the Doctor would here seem so squeamish
as to abhor it; yet I desire no other witness then himself to
affirm it: for in the next <hi>Chapter, Sect.</hi> 9. he tells us that
this is a Precept in the <hi>Turks Luna, Occidite homines quoús<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
omnes Mauri fiant;</hi> which he saith, <hi>Is a Precept against
the Light of Nature and indispensable Law of Morality.</hi> And
in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Book</hi> of his <hi>Mysterie, Chap. 10. Sect. 1.</hi> he saith,
<hi>That this Precept is both in the Luna and Alcoran,</hi> and argues
from it, <hi>That Mahomet was no true Prophet, because of his
Laws to butcher all men that would not presently turn to his
Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Doctor here retorts, That the particular instances he
made in his <hi>Mysterie</hi> of <hi>Turcism</hi> and <hi>Iudaism,</hi> onely respect
Christs dying on the Cross, and his Resurrection; in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of which the <hi>Turks</hi> Belief, in the later the <hi>Iews,</hi> is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to the Christians; and that those particulars include not
directly any moral Turpitude. I Answer, Though that be
granted him, yet he denies not in his <hi>Apologie</hi> that his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
in his <hi>Mysterie</hi> supposeth, that the <hi>Turks</hi> Religion may
be conveyed into men by God; and if so, then may all the
Precepts of that Religion be conveyed by him. Indeed no
<hi>Turk</hi> who truly professeth <hi>Mahomets</hi> Religion, and sincerely
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57586:73"/>
seeks God in it, (as the Doctor supposeth men in a false Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may do,) but is perswaded that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was a true Prophet;
and being so perswaded, he must needs imbrace all <hi>Mahomets</hi>
Precepts, (even such as this we speak of,) as the Precepts of
God. Whence it follows, that if God may be the conveyer of
<hi>Turcism,</hi> he may be the conveyer of what includes moral Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitude:
wherefore for the Doctor to suppose that God may
convey <hi>Turcism,</hi> and yet to pretend that God doth not convey
what hath in it moral Turpitude, is apparently to contradict
himself.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Concerning invincible ignorance in the persons
thus perswaded, he is not content with what he had said, but to
make all sure adds, <q>[Here I suppose invincible ignorance,
and that the <hi>Iew</hi> or <hi>Turk</hi> had lived out of all opportunity to
be rightly instructed in the Christian Religion, but are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
minded toward the truth where ever they finde it.]</q>
What will not this Doctor say, rather then acknowledge that
he hath erred! His instances in the <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Iew,</hi> were (as I
even now noted) That the one denies that Christ dyed on the
Cross; the other, That he rose again from the dead: which
perswasions were by his own Doctrine, conveyed into them by
God. And here he tells us, that he supposeth invincible ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
in this <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Iew;</hi> why so? namely, because
though they had a sincere minde to the Truth, yet they lived
out of all opportunity of being rightly instructed in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion. Did they so? how then came they to know
these two Articles of the Christian Creed, the Passion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of Christ, and so stiffly to oppose them, as perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily
to conclude them false? Certainly they must have
heard of them before they could condemn them; and if they
had opportunity to hear of two Articles, they might at the
same time have had opportunity to have heard of the rest;
nay, upon their supposed sincerity towards the Truth, they
would diligently have sought full information; whereupon,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57586:74"/>
they from whom they heard the two Articles, might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
them, or directed them to instructers. If therefore
they were ignorant of the other Articles, it is evident that their
ignorance could not be invincible, but was plainly wilfull. And
the truth is, the Doctor fowly enterfers with himself, in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
those men to deny two Articles of the Creed, and yet
mean while to be <hi>sincerely minded toward the Truth wherever they
finde it;</hi> for in these two Articles they met with it, and yet
obstinately opposed it. And sure there is moral Turpitude in
the <hi>Iews,</hi> by moral wickedness, forgery and subornation,
endeavouring to suppress the witness of Christs Resurrection:
and the present <hi>Iews</hi> are the justifying heirs of their Ancestors
rampering with and debauching witnesses. Unless we think,
that to bear false witness (against the witness of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
concerning his raising his Son, be no moral Turpitude.</p>
               <p>Yet for all this, the Doctor concludes in an high Rant,
<q>[So that this 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Objection,</hi> though it seems at first sight
of a dangerous aspect, yet is <hi>easily, safely,</hi> and <hi>sufficiently</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
out of what I have premised:]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whether so or no, let the Reader now determine; and
withall observe, That the Doctor rather then confess himself
to have written an errour, will needs maintain that God can be
the Authour of falsity. Though the truth is, by his own Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
he cannot be sure but all his own Doctrines are false, and
conveyed into him by the same God, who may be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer
of errours in Religion.</p>

               <head type="sub">Touching Liberty in Religion.</head>
               <p>THis chapter he begins thus <q>[the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Objection is touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Liberty of Conscience: which right I confess is

with D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mores</hi> Theologie, will easily perceive that the drift of
his desperate and blasphemous Opinion in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Objection,
is chiefly, if not solely, to usher in this Liberty of Conscience.
That 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Aphorism was this (that a full and firm conviction
of Conscience in a Soul that is sincere, touching a Religion
into which some things are incorporate that be false, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any moral Turpitude, and of that nature that no moral
sincerity may be able to discover the falseness of them, is
rightly said to be the permissive command of God to that
Soul, for either punishment, or tryal.]</p>
               <p>Now, saith the Doctor, if such a man as this <q>[whom he
also supposes to be of a <hi>peaceable unpersecutive temper</hi>] may
not enjoy his own, because the spirit of God hath not so
throughly illuminated him, as to bring him to the full and
exquisite knowledg of the truth; it will bring in a principle
of badder consequence then the protection of innocent men
from perfecution for conscience sake, namely that of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
being founded in grace.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>How full of fraud this supposition is, will in good measure
appear hereafter. Mean while I wonder how this should bring
in the principle of <hi>Dominion being founded in Grace:</hi> the
Doctor is so far from telling us <hi>how,</hi> that he offers not one
word about it. Let me ask therefore: May not the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
who urges the law upon the Doctors sincere unconform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57586:75"/>
brother, and thereby denies him this Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
be himself a wicked ungratious person? D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi> must
by his own principles think him so, for that his very Urging
of the law. Is this man therefore not truly and lawfully a
Magistrate? I guess the Doctor dares not say so. Well then,
if he be a true and lawfull Magistrate, this his very pressing
the Law upon that sincere Brother, proves that <hi>Dominion
is not founded upon Grace.</hi> But on the contrary if he be not a
true and lawfull Magistrate, because he ungratiously uses his
Power against that Brother, let but the Doctor say so, and
I will soon evince from thence, that in the Doctors own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Dominion is founded in Grace.</hi> Nay it is too apparent,
that, were the Doctors grand principle allowed, and were his
<hi>sincere unpersecutive Brethren</hi> to be exempted from the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
coercive power in things indifferent; this were no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
way to introduce the tenet of Grace being the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Dominion. They who might not be commanded,
would soon think it belong'd to them to command: if their
sincere piety sets them above the Laws of their Governours,
it may readily prompt them to think they are above their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
themselves.</p>
               <p>But to make sure of a back-door by which to evade the ugly
and unsufferable consequences of his Doctrine; he very
gravely, in his 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Section gives us a long Character of his
<hi>sincere person</hi> whose Conscience he would have left free,
which also he thrusts upon the stage again, though (as he saith)
in a more contracted draught, Sect. 11. Whilst his Thesis
sounds high for faction and sedition, he plots to bring himself
off by contracting the subject of that Thesis to so small a
point that he might seem to leave in it no room for Danger
or Disturbance. And this he doth, by presenting his <hi>sincere
person</hi> in such a strange dress, that in the close of his 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Sect.
he professes <q>[Very few such are to be found in a whole
province, yea in a whole kingdome: scarce so many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57586:75"/>
as the gates of <hi>Thebes,</hi> or the mouths of the River <hi>Nilus.</hi>]</q>
So then there are scarce seven such sincere brethren in a whole
Kingdome: and the number being so inconsiderable, what
danger of any seditious consequences from them, though they
be allowed their liberty?</p>
               <p>A very well-favoured plea! But, first, Had the Doctor this
Opinion when he wrote his <hi>Mysterie of Godliness?</hi> did he then
so largely patronize the point of liberty, onely in intuition of six
or seven persons who possibly might be found (and possibly
not) in the whole Kingdome? this he will scarce perswade any
part of the Kingdome to believe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Who seeth not that such a person as he describes,
is a mere figment? he makes him <hi>unblameable in his conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
and yet supposes him out of Conscience not to submit to
imbrace the Church Discipline: if so, then he must be a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratist:
if a Separatist, he gives offence to all honest obedient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
Men; he breaks the Churches Unity; he opposes his
private judgement against the publick judgement of his superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
even in things of an indifferent nature: and therefore by
the Doctors leave, he is not of <hi>unblameable conversation.</hi> He
makes him also <hi>impregnably loyal and faithfull to his Prince:</hi>
yet supposes that his Conscience leads him, not to observe his
Princes Ecclesiastical Laws. He makes him of complying Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in all things that his Conscience discerns to be <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and not against Gods Word:</hi> and in saying so, he necessarily
supposeth that his sincere Brother finds something commanded
by our Church (for I hope he will not deny but he includes our
Church in his discourse: else why did he not except it?) which is
against Gods Word. And yet <hi>sect. 11. pag.</hi> 546, 547. whereas he
would have an oath taken by pretenders to sincerity, <hi>That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
moves them to depart from the Church, but mere conviction
of Conscience;</hi> he adds, that upon search in the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
no man could in <hi>judgement and conscience</hi> take that Oath,
and leave the Church: which must needs suppose that this
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57586:76"/>
Church commands nothing against the Word of God. Lastly,
He makes him of an <hi>unshaken Belief in all the essentials of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion;</hi> and yet not satisfied that he must obey the
Church exercizing that authority in things Indisterent, which
Gods Word hath given her, although he onely thinks, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
prove the Churches commands to be against Gods Word.</p>
               <p>If there be any such sincere Brother amongst us; what can we
imagine he boggles at, but some Ceremony, a Surplice or Hood,
the use of the Cross, a set Form of Worship; or some such
thing Indifferent in it self, and determined by his lawfull Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours
whom God hath injoyned him to obey? In this case,
if that Brother be perswaded (as the Doctor supposeth) that
such or such a particular is against Gods Word; this perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
hath no just and reasonable ground: yet the Doctor will
have him left at liberty, because the perswasion is conveyed
into him by God, and so obligeth his Conscience. I wish the
Doctor would here be so ingenuous as to tell us in sober sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
whether he believeth that God would thus deceive so
excellent and accomplish'd a Christian in all other points, as he
characters this Brother to be?</p>
               <p>But that is not all: for I think it not amiss fully here to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the gross absurdity of this Tenet. The same God in
his Word commands that <hi>all things be done decently and in
order:</hi> but they cannot be so done, unless some in the Church
have power to determine things Indifferent: those therefore
who are the inferiours are bound in Conscience to submit to
their Governours in such determinations: this is plainly and
undenyably Gods will. But this sincere Brother is perswaded
that the things so determined, are against Gods Word: not
that he can make it appear either by sound reason, or by any
clear place of Gods Word so to be, (for then it might appear
so to others) but that his Conscience tells him so. And the
Doctor would have us believe, that this false perswasion of his
Conscience, was conveyed into him by God. Observe now
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57586:76"/>
what follows hereupon, <hi>viz.</hi> That God by some fallacious
reason, or some obscure piece of Scripture, or some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of such obscure Scripture; perswades this highly vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
man to believe contrary to sound reason, and to plain
scripture, is this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>? Also, that God perswades this
sincere Christian, to boggle at the authoritative definition of
a Christian Church, grounded upon his evident command.
Lastly, that God who injoyns humility to all christians, doth
nevertheless perswade this Christian to oppose his own private
judgement, (though founded upon no just and true ground
either of reason or scripture) against, and prefer it before the
publick and well-grounded judgement of the Church.</p>
               <p>Sect. 4. he saith <q>[The drift of my whole discourse, is
more properly directed toward a Decision of such causes
as concern <hi>nations of several Religions.</hi> And therefore they
do very distortedly who misinterpret my management of
this controversie which doth really include in it so notable
an interest of Christian Religion in general, to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
disinterest of any church whatsoever, unless it be the
Roman: which is so exceeding corrupt, and yet so preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
infallible, that I must confess nothing can be so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
to her, as this right of Liberty of Conscience,
though in such unexceptionable circumstances as I did even
now describe it.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>His description with unexceptionable circumstances, I can
no where finde: this therefore is but one of his usual bold
sayings. Indeed all he hath talked here, is but another of his
shifts; and as vain as the rest. For, 1. How can the proper
drift of his discourse tend to the decision of cases touching <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of several Religions?</hi> The liberty of conscience he pleads
for, is liberty, not for nations of several Religions, but for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
men under the Christian Religion, and that in some
particular Church: else what means his long Character of his
sincere person, whom he makes a Christian, and who must
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57586:77"/>
therefore be in some Christian Church or other, which may
allow him that liberty the Doctor presses for? yea and this
sincere person, he himself grants to be <hi>Rara Avis;</hi> so far was
his drift from aiming at whole Nations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, How can <hi>Nations of several Religions</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in this point? What is the liberty of conscience in
Turks, to that in Christians; <hi>&amp; vice versâ?</hi> should D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi>
have that liberty granted him or denyed him here, what would
that be to the Mahometans? Nay suppose such liberty allowed
among the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> how would that concern the <hi>Calvinists?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Though the Doctor would have the contrary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved;
yet I must tell him, that this liberty would prove a
great disinterest to some (nay to any) Church, besides to
the Roman. For let his position once be granted: That
the sincere brother must be allowed liberty of conscience.
Surely it is fit the magistrate should know whether he whom
this liberty is to be allowed to, be indeed sincere, and not a
demure dissembler, How shall he know this? the Doctor I
presume will answer, that he may know it, by the other part
of that persons character which represents him for eximiously
vertuous: or by the oath (which he mentions pag. 547.) <hi>that
he departs from the Church in meer conviction of conscience, and
not on secular design, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the first <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it is not sufficient. He that keeps
the whole Law and offends in one point, is guilty of all: for
he that said do not commit Adultery; said also do not kill:
now if thou commit no Adultery, yet if thou Kill, thou art
become a transgressour of the law. It is S. <hi>Iames's</hi> doctrine
c. 2. 10, 11. He that <hi>sincerely fears</hi> God, hath respect to all his
commandments, and is most certainly far off from continuing
wittingly in disobedience of any one; for all of them being
given by one and the same God, he who imbraces one and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
another cannot be thought to submit to that which he
imbraceth, out of sincere loyalty to his Master, but for some
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57586:77"/>
ends of his own: else why doth he not obey in this as well as
in other particulars? Now God hath plainly commanded obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to our spiritual Governours; nor is there any exemption
from their commands but where they evidently appear to be
against the word of God. (And that any commands of the
Church of England are clearly repugnant to Gods word, the
Doctor is now wise enough, and we know why, most hugely
to deny) I infer therefore: He who keeps the whole law,
and yet offends in this one point of obedience to lawfull su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours
in things not forbidden by Gods word; is guilty of
all: (especially if it be not one act, but an obstinate habit of
disobedience.) For he who said thou shalt do such and such
things, said also thou shalt obey thy lawfull superiours; now if
thou doest such and such things, and yet obeyest not thy law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
superiours, thou art become a transgressour, that is, <hi>guilty
of all.</hi> If then S. <hi>Iames's</hi> Logick be good, this sincere brother
of the Doctors, who deliberately and peremptorily refuses
obedience to his superiours, cannot be thought a <hi>truly sincere</hi>
and cordial servant of God; whilst under pretence of a law
conveyed into him by God (which it is impossible he should
prove to the Magistrate,) he opposes an evident known Law
of the same God.</p>
               <p>2. As touching the Oath; the Doctor saith (in his <hi>Mystery
of Godliness</hi> pag. 525.) That it is <hi>very usefull</hi> and <hi>justifyable,</hi>
upon mens relinquishing the publick worship of God in the
Churches. But against this way of tryal, it may be objected:
That the same <hi>sincere</hi> person holds not himself free to take
an Oath. I know the Doctor in the same page sternly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces,
that if any one refuse thus to swear, <hi>Without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
it is not Religion but some fathomless depth of knavery that
lies at the bottom.</hi> Will his friends, the Bartholomew Conies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours,
thank him for this censure. But hereby he contradicts
his own grand principle, that the <hi>Dictate of conscience is Gods
command to every man:</hi> for I hope Gods command is not a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57586:78"/>
fathomless depth of knavery. Such refusers may alledge this
for their refusal, that Christ plainly said, <hi>swear not at all.</hi>
How knows the Doctor, that these men doe not believe
in their Conscience that these words of Christ are by them
truly understood, and rightly applyed? if so: then they are
Gods immediate obliging command to them, <hi>to refuse that
Oath.</hi> If he will renounce his <hi>dogma,</hi> and grant that all dictates
of conscience are not conveyed by God, so as to prove his
commands and become obligatory, (for surely some consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
are erroneous and ought to be rectified,) he may have
ground to condemn those refusers: otherwise he condemns
himself: for these refusers do nevertheless believe a Creatour,
a providence, a life to come with rewards and punishments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which are the conditions he requires in him to whom he would
have liberty of conscience allowed. <hi>ibid. pag.</hi> 516.</p>
               <p>It remains then, that if the magistrate cannot certainly
know, whether such a brothers pretended sincerity, be real or
no; he can have no just reason to allow him his liberty of
conscience against the just law; nor can this liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
be such a brothers <hi>Right</hi> (as the Doctor affirms)
seeing it is inconsistent with that authority of the Magistrate,
which by Gods word is a lawfull authority. And it being
Gods revealed will, that all men should be subject to that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in things not contrary to his own declared commands;
this brother is necessarily subjected to Gods power in the
Magistrate; nor may he disobey, but where he is sure that
the Magistrate commands contrary to God: and sure he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be, but by the plain dictate of scripture, or of Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
if he alledge either of these, it is presumed that the
Christian Magistrate will hear him: if not, he can plead no
right of freedome against the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Perhaps he will here object, that we finde in scripture,
liberty of conscience allowed to the weak, <hi>Rom. 14. 1. &amp;c.
1 Cor.</hi> 8. 7. &amp; 12. To which I answer: was that liberty
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57586:78"/>
allowed in points which the Church had then decreed to be
obeyed by all her members? If it were, let him shew it to have
been so. If it were not: (and who ever said it was?) what is
that objection to the present case of the Christian Churches?
Again; when men were converted from other Religions to
the Christian by the first preachers of Christianity; what
wonder if they were not <hi>totally</hi> converted at the first: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
their former perswasions for a while in some particular
points? But as for such who never were of another Religion,
but were always brought up in the Christian Church; the
case is different: if these mens conscience be debauched by
corrupt perswasions, it is their own fault; nor is there reason
for them to expect such liberty as may be indulged for a while
to converts from another Religion: but rather like truants
who run from the school, they are to be reduced by the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the school.</p>
               <p>But before he concludes his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Section, the Doctor is
again at his comparisons, though he hath the worst luck in that
trade of any Man I know: he saith <q>[<hi>It is no more unseemly</hi>
for Governours to permit something to them (<hi>viz.</hi> the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
brethren) peculiarly, then for a tender Mother to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge</hi>
something to a child that breeds teeth, or any other
ways weak and sickly: or a master of a family to <hi>permit,</hi> if
not to provide, some proper accommodation for those of
his family apart, whose infirmities or constitutions make
them less fit to dine and sup at his common table: for this
is no diminution of his authority, but a more discreet and
commendable exercise thereof.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Question is touching liberty of conscience, which the
Doctor vouches to be the <hi>right</hi> of a <hi>sincere person.</hi> Now by
these comparisons he would shew, that <hi>it is not unseemly</hi> for
the Governours to <hi>permit him that liberty:</hi> that is, <hi>If the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
permits such a Man that which is his right, he doth
not unseemly.</hi> Can any thing be more impertinent! the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57586:79"/>
part, is, not to permit and indulge, but to defend
and assert men in their <hi>right:</hi> and when he doth thus, it is
but a cold commendation to say, <hi>he doth not unseemly;</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he doth <hi>most seemly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I would ask the Doctor, whether in any secular Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicks
he hath read or heard of, he meets with a law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
all children and members of the family to be used alike
in all the respective parts of the domestick discipline, without
making allowance for sickness and infirmities which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
help? I presume he never did. But in the family of the
Church, the laws of discipline relating to several orders of
Christians, are notorious; and none of them make any
allowance for sincere weak-conscienced Brethren; because
the Church is well assured that her laws are consonant to Gods
word, and therefore even in conscience to be obeyed by all her
children; whose pretended infirmities are onely such as they
may themselves help when they will but vouchsafe to be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
informed that the things commanded were indifferent,
and not against Gods word. So that if the case be duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
here is no ground at all for the Doctors comparisons.</p>
               <p>At length, Sect. the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> not denying but this his tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
preamble was onely <hi>talking at large,</hi> he comes to the
<q>Object. 8.</q>
Which is in these words, [He saith, <hi>That Liberty of Religion
is the common and natural Right of all Nations and Persons,</hi>
l. 10. c. 11. p. 521. <hi>And the sovereign Power of God sets
the sincere Religionist free from external force and power,
ibid.</hi> p. 520. By the sincere Religionist he understands,
<hi>Every one that really believes there is a God, and that he is
a Rewarder of them that seek him. But more is required in
such a sincere Religionist, then is to be found in the Turks.
This overthrows all Laws for Church-government and
Discipline.</hi>]</p>
               <p>His Answer he thus begins, <q>[First I confess it is my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57586:79"/>
That Liberty of Conscience is the common and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Right of <hi>all Nations and Persons.</hi> But I have also added,
That this <hi>Right is forfeitable;</hi> and I have restrain'd this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to such conditions, that I think it is impossible to doubt
but that so much Liberty as I have left is their <hi>most unviolable
Right.</hi>]</q>
               </p>
               <p>It seems the Objector hath not wronged him in the first
Particular, he confesses it; but he pleads his adding that this
<hi>Right is forfeitable.</hi> This perhaps might be plausibly pleaded
for the Right of particular <hi>Persons,</hi> but is the Right of <hi>whole
Nations,</hi> nay of <hi>all Nations</hi> forfeitable? Good Doctor teach us
to what Magistrates they can forfeit it, or who will be left to
take the forfeiture.</p>
               <p>Yea, but he hath <hi>Restrained this Liberty to such Conditions</hi>
as will make it <hi>most unviolable.</hi> Truly I remember not, that
either in this <hi>Apologie,</hi> or in the <hi>Chapters</hi> of his <hi>Mysterie,</hi> which
he Apologizeth for, he hath at all restrained the Liberty of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which yet is the first part of the Liberty he here speaks
of. As for his restraining the Liberty of particular persons, how
little that will help him, I have partly shown already, and shall
have occasion to declare farther when I come to his 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> of
this <hi>Chapter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next he sallies out to some sayings of the <hi>ancient Fathers,</hi>
which he counts more free and full touching <hi>this Subject</hi> then
any thing that he hath said. They who know any thing of
the Discipline of the Primitive Church will easily suspect that
the Doctor here slanders the ancient Fathers. But lets view
his Citations, one is out of the Council (he tells us not which)
of <hi>Toledo,</hi> another out of <hi>Tertullian.</hi> The first <hi>forbids any
one to be forced, i.</hi> to be a Christian. The second professeth
<hi>That Christianity doth not revenge it self by the Sword.</hi> What
he crowds these sayings in for, I profess I know not. After
this he tells us that <hi>Grotius,</hi> out of whom he borrows these
Quotations, <q>[Cites also the constitutions of <hi>Clemens, Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:57586:80"/>
and <hi>Chrysostome</hi> to the same purpose, who expresly
exclude force and compulsion in bringing men over to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.]</q>
And what of this! Did those Fathers therefore
think Liberty of Religion to be the common and natural
Right of all Nations and Persons? <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>! Have Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
Right to be of a false Religion, because Christians have
no Right to compel them to the true? The Church judgeth
not those who are without, but those who are within: Those
who are without God judgeth, for all their pretended Right
to Liberty, and to him they must answer it for their adhering
to a false Religion in spight of all the means his universal
Grace and Providence useth to reclaim them. But how pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably
all this discourse of the Doctor is extravagant from the
Question, appears by the close of the Objection, <hi>(This over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
all Laws for Church-government and Discipline.)</hi> The
Objector meant not to trouble him farther then by hinting to
him, That if Liberty of Religion be all mens Right, Church-Government
must signifie nothing, for then might Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
shake off that yoke at their pleasure. And how is <hi>the
not persecuting and compelling of Infidels</hi> pertinent to this
Point?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. He thus proceeds, <q>[Secondly, As for that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
out of <hi>Pag.</hi> 520. it is no new Charge, but contains
Reasons for the former Assertion; namely, That consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the sincerity of the Religionist, wherein he is so faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and unfeignedly obliged to the Sovereign Power of God,
he is not harshly to be dealt with by any inferiour Power;
he having that integrity and sincerity, which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
all along in this Subject, and have more explicitly
described in my Proof of my <hi>first Aphorism</hi> in the foregoing
<hi>Chapter;</hi> as also where the case is more particular in the
3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                     <hi>Section</hi> of this.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>What is this, but to suppose, and run away with, what nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath, nor can be proved; namely, that the Sovereign
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57586:80"/>
Power of God obligeth mens Consciences (by conveying false
perswasions into them) to resist the Truth, and to oppose that
Power which the same God himself hath confessedly institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
The Doctor also falls here from <hi>Nations</hi> to particular
<hi>Persons,</hi> and yet pretends that this Addition contains Reasons
for the former Assertion, which Assertion related to <hi>all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
as well as to <hi>particular Persons:</hi> But it is plain, by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
to his <hi>first Aphorism</hi> of the former <hi>Chapter</hi> and the
3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>Section</hi> of this, that he laies the main stress of his <hi>Apologie</hi>
upon the <hi>sincerity</hi> of the Religionist. And how I pray shall the
Magistrate be assured that this Religionist is <hi>indeed sincere?</hi> It
is the Question I asked before, and must repeat where I meet
the Doctor obtruding his <hi>crambe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he adds <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. <q>[By the <hi>sincere Religionist,</hi> I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
more then is recited in the Objection; for a man may
not cast off the Belief of a God, and of a life to come, and
yet be exceeding far from being <hi>sincere,</hi> as you may easily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
out of the formentioned description.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>What reason the Objector had to describe the Doctors sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Religionist, as is set down briefly in the <hi>Objection,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
out of his own words in his <hi>Mysterie, lib. 10. cap.</hi> 10.
In the <hi>Contents</hi> of which <hi>Chapter,</hi> his first is this in terms:
<q>[That in those that believe there is a God, and a Life to
come, there is an antecedent Right of Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
not to be invaded by the Civil Magistrate.]</q> And in
the beginning of the <hi>Chapter</hi> he explains himself thus: <q>[For
those that seriously make a profession of the existence of
God Creator of all things, and of his Providence, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that there is a life to come, wherein the wicked
shall be punished and the vertuous rewarded; it seems to me
that there doth naturally accrew such a Right to these men
of freedome in their Religion as is inviolable, and such as the
Power of the Magistrate ought not to invade, unless there
be some perverse mixture in it that forfeits their Right.]</q>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:57586:81"/>
Where by the way, observe how the Doctor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds
himself in his sincere Religionist; for he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that there may happen to be some perverse mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in his Religion, that is, <hi>he may be perverse, and yet
sincere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To his pretence here alledged, I must crave his leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply;
That whereas he now in his <hi>Apologie</hi> gives us a new
Character of his <hi>sincere Religionist;</hi> and then wipes his mouth
and saith, <hi>(He understands more by the sincere Religionist then
is recited in the Objection,)</hi> is meer Boys play. The Question
is not, what he now understands, but what he wrote in his <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie.</hi>
Had he now acknowledged that what he wrote there
was rashly written, it had been something.</p>
               <p>He proceeds, <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. <q>[I willingly grant, that it will be
hard to finde any such sincere Religionist, as I understand
and describe among the <hi>Turks,</hi> it being a Precept in their <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
Occidite homines quousque omnes mauri fiant.</hi> Slay and
kill, till all men have become <hi>Mahometans;</hi> which is a
Precept against the light of Nature and indispensable Law
of Morality, <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris.</hi>]</q> This
Answer respects that part of the <hi>Objection,) but more is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to such a sincere Religionist, then is to be found in the Turks.)</hi>
And the Doctor tells us <hi>it is hard</hi> to finde such a <hi>Turk. Hard?</hi>
why not <hi>Impossible?</hi> For if their Religion contains Precepts
contrary to the Light of Nature and indispensable Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
(as he grants it doth,) they who sincerely profess that
Religion, must endeavour the practice of such Precepts. And
yet the Doctor in this 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Chap. Sect.</hi> 3. of his <hi>Mysterie</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in the <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Few,</hi> as persons whose Religion was
conveyed into them by God.</p>
               <p>Indeed he here adds, <q>[That this <hi>Turk</hi> forfeits his
Right of Liberty of Religion, by this poisonous and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Principle.]</q> If so, no Religious <hi>Turk</hi> can have any such
Right; and would the Doctor have that Right belong onely
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57586:81"/>
to such <hi>Turks</hi> as are not true to their Religion, that is, to Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites?
are these the sincere ones?</p>
               <p>To that in which the main force of the <hi>Objection</hi> (he saith)
consists, and which runs in these words, <hi>(This overthrows all
Laws for Church-government and Discipline,)</hi> he thus models
his Answer, <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. <q>[First, That there is a marvellous
incommensurability of things in humane Affairs; and that
we may as well expect that the Diameter of a Circle should
be Symmetral to the Periphery, and the Diagonal of a
square to the side thereof; as that one thing, or <hi>one truth</hi>
should serve all turns and all occasions: nay, though it were
in our power to mint Truth as we please, and to set that
stamp and title upon whatever Proposition would serve our
turn best; yet we should finde that it would not serve all
emergencies, nor fit all occasions, nor be exempt from all
exceptions.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He Cants! he Cants!</hi> will many an honest Reader here cry
out. Indeed we may well wonder what he means; for though
<hi>one thing</hi> will not fit all occasions, yet <hi>one Truth</hi> will and must;
for <hi>Truth</hi> is and can be <hi>but one.</hi> But those last words, <hi>That
though we had power to mint Truth, yet it would not be exempt
from all exceptions;</hi> minde me of what I have read in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Authour, which I think it not unseasonable here to
insert. That Authour though a private person, having min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and delivered for current certain Rules for publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in a Christian Church; doubts not to conclude, That if
those be observed, <hi>(It will not be easie to imagine what is
wanting to a due and</hi> unexceptionable <hi>filling up of all comely
Circumstances of that publick Worship that is fit to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by professed Christians, unless you would bring in also
Images and Pictures.)</hi> In this mans Judgement it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
enough (at least for him) to mint something which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable,
that is, <hi>Exempt from all Exceptions.</hi> And if
the Reader longs to know this so wise and able Authour; truly
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57586:82"/>
it is even D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Henry More</hi> in his <hi>Mysterie of Godliness,</hi> lib. 10.
cap. 14. sect. 16.</p>
               <p>But I ask the Doctor, What are the Truths here in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion?
They must be either touching the Fundamental and
Indispensable parts of Religion; or concerning things in
themselves Indifferent, and variable upon just occasion,
Touching the former, I hope there can be but one Truth,
which must alwaies persist the same: And touching the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
The Church doth not determine and appoint them irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versibly,
but suits them to time and place as she sees most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient;
never imagining, that one Form is by absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
fit to serve all occasions and possible Emergencies. Yet
still this one thing is true, this one Truth will serve in all
change of occasions, that the Church hath a Power in all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
and all turns to judge what is fit; and hath Power in
things Indifferent to determine and command what she sees
meet; And they who are given to change, must not make
their own changeable humours (sincerely changing very oft)
a plea of Exemption from their Superiours Lawfull Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
Hitherto then the Doctors Answer amounts to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Let's see what follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>[As for example, because this Proposition, <hi>That Liberty
of Religion is the common Right of all Nations and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
doth not please; take the opposite to it, <hi>That no
Nation or Person can claim Liberty of Religion as their Right.</hi>
Will not this prove as Incommensurable to humane Affairs,
and be laden with as great Inconveniencies?]</q> Here he slips
the Collar, and leaves the Question. For the Question was,
Whether that former proposition of his <hi>were true or no;</hi> and
now he would onely have it supposed, that <hi>it doth not please,</hi>
and therefore he neither styles nor pretends to prove the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
proposition <hi>false,</hi> but <hi>inconvenient</hi> and <hi>incommensurable</hi> to
humane Affairs. But how proves he this Inconvenience? why
he makes account thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:57586:82"/>
                  <q>[For if no Nation or Person have any Right to profess
any Religion but what is in all Points True, then will every
Nation (since they are perswaded of the truth of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
otherwise they would not be of it,) presume they
have Right of Persecuting any other Nation that differs
in Religion from them, they so easily conceiting every
different Religion false, which is to set the world together
by the ears.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was kindly done of the Doctor to help me to an Answer
to this his proof in the proof it self. If every Nation <hi>be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of the Truth of their Religion, because otherwise they
would not be of it:</hi> then cannot this Nation imagine but that
other Nations professing Religions different from this <hi>are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that the Religions they profess are true.</hi> And why should
the Doctor think, that one Nation should count it either rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
or advantageous to it self, to persecute another Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for professing what their Conscience tells them is the
Truth? What were this but to make that persecuting Nation
utterly stupid and insensible of what is for her own Peace and
Interest? for by this Principle, such a Nation publickly profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
it lawfull for all other Nations of different Religions to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
and persecute her.</p>
               <p>But he adds, <q>[Again, If no private Person have the
Right of Liberty of Religion, then is he bound up to the
Religion of his Prince and Nation, be it what it will; for
if he may judge, his Right is reserved to him.]</q> I grant,
that every man ought to be satisfied in his Conscience (and
the Doctor may if he will call this <hi>Iudging,)</hi> of the Religion
he professeth. Yet this reserves him not a Right of Liberty
in Religion; but onely supposeth that he hath a Right of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
examining, and using his best judgement in order to the
satisfying of his Conscience: which Right if he duly useth, it
will certainly fix him in the True Religion, whether that
Religion be professed by his Prince and Nation or no. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Prove, or Try all things; Hold fast that which is good,</hi>
saith the Apostle, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 21. Here is a Right to Try, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
and Judge; but no Right of Liberty in Religion for
all that. This tryal is onely in order to the <hi>Holding fast that
which is good. God will have all men to be saved, and to come
unto the knowledge of the Truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 4. If this be Gods
will; (and I hope D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi> when he thinks well of it, will
not deny it) that all men should come unto the knowledge of
the Truth, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the Christian Religion, then is the pretended
Right of liberty in Religion, flatly <hi>against Gods will.</hi> To fancy
then that private persons are bound up to the Religion of
their Prince and Nation, be it what it will, because such
persons have no right to be of what Religion they list, is
ridiculous: seeing the King of Kings hath determined the case,
and signified it to be his royal pleasure that all men should
come to the true Religion, which can be but one.</p>
               <p>His last inconvenience is that <q>[All Atheists and profane
Persons will make their Markets to the full; there being no
Obstacle to them to what ever enjoyments of this life;
but the sore and unsupportable burden not onely of falling
short in their fortunes, but of cruel persecution, will light
upon those onely that are conscientious, <hi>and have the fear of
God before their eyes.</hi>]</q>

               <p>First, Touching Atheists and profane men, I demand how
this follows? If it be granted that <hi>No man can claim Liberty of
Religion as his Right,</hi> then saith the Doctor, <hi>Atheists and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
persons will make their markets to the full, there being no
obstacle to them to whatever enjoyments of this life.</hi> A marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
clear consequence, and suitable to the Doctors Logick!
Take therefore the opposite Position which is his own, <hi>viz.
(Liberty of Religion is the common and natural Right of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.)</hi>
And tell me if that Consequence will not be much
clearer; for hereupon the wicked Person having Right to
what Religion he lists, will never scruple to profess any thing
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57586:83"/>
that may best consist with his temporal Advantage; for still
he professeth no more then he hath Natural Right to profess.</p>
               <p>As for the Conscientious, this will expose them (he saith)
to persecution. Suppose so. Is therefore the Position <hi>(That
no Nation nor Person can claim Liberty of Religion as their
Right) incommensurable to humane Affairs?</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> saith,
<hi>All that will live godly in Christ Iesus shall suffer persecution,
2 Tim.</hi> 3. 12. D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi> would prevent this, and therefore
likes no Positions that will occasion Conscientious men to be
persecuted. But what thinks he of the Religion planted by
Christ? was that <hi>Incommensurable to humane Affairs?</hi> I hope
not. Yet he assured his Apostles, that it would expose them
to the hatred of all the world. Did Christian Religion not
teach us a reward in the life to come, the Doctor might count
it, (as he doth this later Position,) to be of very partial and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
consequence; but upon supposal of this future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
neither this Religion nor that Position can be justly so
accounted.</p>
               <p>In the next, the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Section;</hi> though I were so well aware
of the Doctor, that I thought he could not have cheated
me, yet I must confess I was down right gulled; for thus
he begins, <hi>[But to answer more closely and satisfactorily
to the purpose.]</hi> This Preface rowzed me to an expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of something not impertinent at least; but the sum of all I
finde is but this that he himself saith, <hi>[That Right of Liberty of
Religion,</hi> as he hath stated it, <hi>overthrows not any due Laws of
Government in any Church, nor opposeth any Interest but the
Romane; and that Reformed Churches need not fear, but it will
rather enlarge their Iurisdiction then overthrow their Laws;]</hi>
And the Reason he subjoyns is this, <q>[For what hinders men
from coming over to the Truth, but those Babylonish Chains
of barbarous and Antichristian Persecution?]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Is this <hi>close</hi> and <hi>satisfactory to the purpose,</hi> as was promised?
First, Let me ask the Doctor, Whether he ever heard of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57586:84"/>
greater complaints of Persecution from those who lived under
the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, then from those who lived under the
Reformed Church? yea under the Reformed Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which he, tacking about, hath of late so highly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified?
Secondly, If this Right of Liberty in Religion were
granted, let us consider how the Jurisdiction of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> would be thereby <hi>inlarged.</hi> Did the Doctor never
hear of such things as <hi>Presbyterians, Independents, Quakers,
Latitudinarians</hi> here in <hi>England?</hi> Are not these a pretty
round company? make they not a great (I dare not say, how
great) part of the Nation? and are they not sincere and
hearty enemies to our Church-government, or proud despisers
of it? Now let all these be allowed a Right of Liberty, and
who doubts but they would soon have Governments and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciplines
of their own? whereby so vast a part of the Subjects
of our Churches Discipline being taken away, it is very
strange how her Jurisdiction should by this device be <hi>Inlarged.</hi>
And how cordially D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi> desires the inlargement of it, let it
be guessed by the goodly means he would have used for that
purpose.</p>
               <p>I, but he will tell you now, That he means not that all
those Sects should be allowed their Right of Liberty. Indeed
he may tell us so <hi>now,</hi> when he sees it is not safe for him to say
the contrary. But I have already shewed, that his <hi>sincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionist</hi>
(for whom he pleads this Liberty) is not the same
here in his <hi>Apologie</hi> with him whom he holds forth in his <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie.</hi>
Besides, if this Liberty be (as he saith) the <hi>Natural
Right of all Persons;</hi> none of all the Rabble I have named,
but will make good his Title to it, against any forfeiture the
Doctor can pretend. For what is every mans <hi>Natural Right,</hi>
is his Right given him by God the Authour of Nature, and
therefore part of Natures Law. How then can any man
forfeit what he holds by the Charter and Law of God
and Nature, onely because he conforms not to the Churches
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57586:84"/>
Order in things which were in themselves but Indifferent; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he makes the Churches Law more sacred then Gods? I
say, in <hi>things in themselves but Indifferent;</hi> for which of
those forementioned Sects will not readily profess that they
imbrace all the Essentials and indispensable Precepts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?
And to tell them that Obedience in things Indifferent
is Commanded by God, will nothing prevail with them, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they are taught, that this is inconsistent with the exercise
of their Natural Right of Liberty; and therefore any such
Command infers no Indispensable Duty, because this would
destroy that Original Right which they have by the Law of
God and Nature. They may obey if they please, but if
they have no minde so to do, that Natural Right will bear
them out.</p>
               <p>His next pretence in the Clause immediately subjoyned is
this, <q>[Again, when there was no external force nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion
to make men Christians, as there was not for some
hundreds of years, were there no Laws for Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Discipline all that time? Wherefore Liberty of
Religion doth not take away or overthrow all Laws for
Church-government and Discipline, but rather keeps men
from making any disallowable and scandalous ones, which
was one reason that kept the Church from that Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Lapse all the time before the Empire professed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
But external force imprints Truth and Falshood,
Superstition and Religion alike upon the dawed spirits of
men.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Marvellous <hi>close</hi> and <hi>to the purpose still!</hi> for I see, that in
the Doctors Dialect, <hi>Close</hi> signifies <hi>Extravagant,</hi> and <hi>To the
purpose, quite beside it.</hi> His business was to have shewed us,
That the Laws for Church-government are not frustrated,
though men be allowed Liberty of Religion. By which <hi>men,</hi>
who understands not men entered into Christianity and living
under Christian Governours? To prove there is no such Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57586:85"/>
he appeals to the Primitive times, when Infidels
were not compelled to turn Christians; which notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
there were in those Times Laws for Church-government
and Discipline. Whereas his Proof should have been, That
the Primitive Church compelled none of her Members by
Censure to obey her Commands; but gave Dissenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
their Liberty, and onely exercised her Jurisdiction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Assenters. But he knew he could never make out this
Proof, and therefore wonderous wisely and demurely walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
aside from the Question. At length he concludeth, <hi>That
External force imprints Truth and Falshood alike,</hi> &amp;c. But
what he means, or how this sentence coheres with what
was premised, let them divine who are more at leisure
then I.</p>
               <p>To his <hi>Thirdly;</hi> in which he refers us to his Answer to the
4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Objection</hi> I will repeat nothing, but make the like refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
desiring the Reader to review if he pleases my Reply to
that his Answer.</p>
               <p>In his <hi>Fourthly</hi> he saith, <q>[That this Right of Liberty of
Religion is forfeitable, by mixing therewith such Principles
as are contrary to good manners and civil Right, or repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the very Principle of Liberty we speak of. Which
forfeiture is so large and in a manner Universal, that in the
very <hi>Chapters</hi> of this Subject I acknowledge the Theory I
plead for hugely unpracticable. So that there is room enough
and too much left in the world, for the exercise of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Jurisdiction.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Enough, and too much room</hi> for the Churches Jurisdiction?
God desires that the Church may reach to all Nations; which
cannot be, except her Discipline and Jurisdiction be co-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to the same limits. D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi> grudges, and thinks
this Jurisdiction hath enough, yea, and too much room alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Perhaps he will expound his meaning to be, That in
regard of the great multitudes of such men as mix with their
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57586:85"/>
Liberty Principles contrary to good manners, and are
thereby liable to Ecclesiastical Censures, the Churches
Jurisdiction hath a larger Subject then would be wished.
But this will not excuse him, for though there were no men
professing Principles contrary to good manners, yet the
Churches Jurisdiction would not be of the less extent: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Power is exercised, not onely in the Censuring of
the Bad, but also in the Incouraging, Meliorating, and
Perfecting those that are Good. For God gave some Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
some Prophets, &amp;c. for the perfecting the Saints, for
the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the Body of
Christ. But grant this Expression of his were of no such
ill aspect, yet his other words will sufficiently betray
him. For</p>
               <p>First, If his <hi>Theory be hugely unpracticable,</hi> what meant
he to trouble the world with it; especially so largely as he
hath done? Secondly, If the forfeiture be <hi>in a manner
universal,</hi> then by the Doctors Censure, it is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
universally true, <hi>That men hold Principles contrary to
good manners and civil Right.</hi> But I must take the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to think, That his charging in a manner all the world
with this foul Crime, is so far from good manners, that
it favours neither of Modesty, Truth, nor Charity; but
is indeed, what <hi>Michael</hi> durst not bring against the Devil
himself, <hi>A Rayling accusation.</hi> Yet I wonder not much
at it; for since he patronizeth Liberty of Religion, what
marvel is it that he assumeth such Liberty of Censure?
But abate him all this, and examine his device of <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture,</hi>
which he seems to have provided as his safest
back-door.</p>
               <p>First, He who holds a Principle repugnant to this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Liberty needed not have been counted among
those who <hi>forfeit their Right in this Liberty;</hi> but should
rather be reckoned among those who will not allow it.

                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:57586:87"/>
For if he pretends such Liberty to be proper to himself
alone, he onely renders himself ridiculous. Consider we
then, <hi>(Those who mix with it Principles contrary to good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and civil Right)</hi> And it will easily appear, that by so
doing they forfeit not that supposed Right of Liberty in Re<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gion,
for this their Right the Doctor makes to be <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural:</hi>
Now no Right of Nature (nor indeed any other
Right that is truly such) is forfeitable, but by some offence
to which some Law appoints that forfeiture as a Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Let the Doctor then shew us, what Law either of
God or man is extant, by which the mixing Principles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to good manners or civill Right, makes any man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
his Right of Liberty in Religion. Many Laws may be
produced, which appoint other Penalties for those who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
any thing contrary to civil Right or good Manners;
which Penalties such Professours must undergo, be they the
forfeit of part or of all their Estate, or of their civil Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
or of any of their Limbs, yea, of their Life also:
but till some Law appears, which makes their Penalty to
be the forfeit of their Liberty in Religion; that Liberty
cannot truly be said to be forfeited. The truth is, The
Doctor cannot in all his huge reading shew us any such
Law: for why should any Law ever be made for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting
of that which is not? Wherefore this back-door is
a meer figment, nor can the Doctor ever make his escape
through it.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Fifthly;</hi> onely thrusts in his repeated Character of
his sincere Religionist; by which it is evident, that all this
Right of Liberty in Religion, for which he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the Advocate, must concern such as are Christians:
and that therefore all his Discourses against forcing men to
the Christian Religion, were nothing of kin to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Question, but crowded in onely to amuse unwary
Readers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:57586:87"/>
His <hi>Lastly</hi> contains his own devised knack of an Oath,
whereby to discover Hypocrites and Pretenders to Sincerity.
But of both these I have spoken sufficient, upon occasions gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me by the Doctor already.</p>
               <p>His 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Section</hi> is an Applauding of himself, that he
hath wrote nothing, but what tends to <hi>the more success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

A Discourse touching the Knowledge of God.
His <hi>Fourteenth</hi> and <hi>Fifteenth,</hi> A Redargution of those
who pretending the Unction of the Spirit, disobey the
Churches Authority. His <hi>Sixteenth,</hi> An Invective against
Persecuting Men for Heresie, who hold all things plainly
determined by Scripture. In which <hi>Sections,</hi> though the
Doctor be sufficiently repugnant to himself, yet because
all of them are either so pitifully loose, or so misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
remote from the propounded <hi>Objection,</hi> (to which
he ought to have confined his Reply,) I forbear clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
my Reader with any Observations upon them. And
this the rather, because the Doctor himself being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious

in the Front of his next <hi>Chapter,</hi> That he <hi>fears

Objections, he thus sets down the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.
<q>Object. 9.</q>
                  <hi>He sharply inveighs against all Church-government and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
no where excepting ours; nay directly saith that our Church
is not quite emerged out of the general Apostacy,</hi> lib. 5. cap.
17. sect. 7. pag. 206. and pag. 211. <hi>The Reformers having
separated from the great Babylon, have built less and more
tolerable ones, but not to be tolerated for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here being weary, it seems (and well he might) of his
own <hi>preambulatory ambages,</hi> he arms his forehead, and without
any more adoe, answers <q>[First, that I do not speak against
any Church-government, no not so much as Presbytery,
much less Episcopacy; but on the contrary I have spoken
for it in my Preface. So far am I from sharply inveighing
against that Government, or any else.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Objection was, for his inveighing against Church-government,
and <hi>Governours.</hi> In his answer he takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the second part of the charge <hi>(viz.</hi> the Governours)
but slily passes that over; as if reviling lawfull superiours
were a thing inconsiderable. But I shall by and by make it
appear, that his Invectives strike at both Government and
Governours, and that, with as contumelious unsufferable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence,
as I think the heartiest Schismatick or Fanatick
could wish, But first, because he confidently appeals to his
Preface, let me reminde the Reader, that there the Doctor
ranks Episcopacy with the worst of Factions, Presbytery, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency,
Quakerism, &amp;c. That he professes (pag. 19.)
that <hi>Episcopacy simply in it self is not Antichristian:</hi> And pag. 20.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57586:88"/>
                  <hi>That Episcopacy joyned with Presbytery, is better then Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sbytery
alone.</hi> Is not the Authour of these passages, <hi>one who
speaks for Episcopacy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for his bold affirmation, <hi>that he speaks not against any
Church-government,</hi> I crave the readers patience till I rake
up some of his dirt. Page 526. of his <hi>Mystery,</hi> he saith <q>[Now
our Religion is wrapt up in so many wreaths of hay and
straw, that no man can see nor feel the edge of it.]</q> And if
thus wrapt up; by whom is it done but by the Governours of
the Church? Doth not this strike at both the Government
and the Governours? Again pag. 492. <q>[Freely to profess
what I think in my own conscience to be true: <hi>The most
universal and most fundamental mistake in Christendom,</hi> and
whence all the corruption of the Church began, <hi>and is still
continued and increased,</hi> is, That <hi>conceited estimation of ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Opinions,</hi> and external ceremony, before the indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
practise of the precepts of Christ, &amp;c. Instead whereof
there is <hi>generally</hi> substituted curiosity of Opinion in points
imperscrutable and unprofitable; obtrusion of Ceremonies
<hi>numerous, cumbersom,</hi> and not onely <hi>needless,</hi> but much
unbeseeming the unsuspected modesty of the spouse of
Christ, <hi>&amp;c. This self chosen Religion in all the parts of
Christendome</hi> (though it be such as a wicked man may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
as dextrously and plausibly, as the most truly righteous
and regenerate) being so highly extolled and recommended
to the people, <hi>is almost an irresistible temptation to make them
really and morally wicked.)</hi> And pag. 496. [That I may not
seem to slander the <hi>state of Christendom, I mean of the whole
visible Church in what nation soever under heaven,</hi> if we may
believe Historians, there is none, neither Greek nor Roman,
Lutheran nor Calvinist; but will be found guilty of this
fault.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>If this be not to inveigh against Church-government; and
universally too; for all Christendom is his scene; What is?
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57586:89"/>
seeing the tragical miscarriages he thus charges upon all the
Christian World, must lie at the doors of the Church-government,
and Governours; or no where.</p>
               <p>Again, in his Preface, page 28. falls he not foul upon the
Governours, <q>[Who, saith he, instead of holy love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—
with zeal scalding hot seek to hale and force other men by
external compulsion to their foolish and useless Opinions
and Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</q> for here he must mean the Church-Governours,
seeing they alone have power of compulsion,
<hi>Ibidem</hi> 
                  <q>[It is injustice and barbarous cruelty to afflict men
for what they cannot help, and in what they do not sin: and
it is plain rebellion against God to wrest the sceptre out of
his hand, by which he rules in the Consciences of Men,
and to usurp this Empire to themselves.] Here he makes
the Churches censuring her factious,</q> schismatical, or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
members, to be Rebellion against God. Yet this man in|
veighes not (if you will take his own word) against any Church-government.
More such stuff I could rake up out of his
<hi>Mystery;</hi> but that I am loath too much to turn the Readers
stomach.</p>
               <p>But he goeth on, and in his second Sect. of this 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
pleads thus: <q>[If any one will call my free and zealous
Advertisements to the guides of Christendom, <hi>sharp invectives;</hi>
that doth not change their nature: they are still
wholesom reproofs and advertisements, not Invectives: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as they proceed from no Hatred nor Ill will, but out
of a sincere affection to the truth, and a desire of promoting
the true interest of the Kingdom of Christ in the world.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Truly a spade must be called a spade; and if any one will
call it a fan of feathers, that doth not change its nature; for
it is still a spade, and not a fan of feathers. If the Doctor will
call Invectives, Reproofs and Advertisements, that doth not
change their nature; they are still Invectives, and not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs
or Advertisements. And indeed if this kinde of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57586:89"/>
be onely Advertising or Reproving, it is impossible
there should be any such thing as <hi>inveighing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I, but it was not out of <hi>Ill will,</hi> but out <hi>of sincere affection to
the Truth,</hi> and a <hi>desire of promoting the true interest of Christs
kingdom.</hi> Doctor, I know not your heart; I leave that to
God: but this I know, that a good meaning and intent can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
justifie a bad action: and therefore you may do well to
consider, how you will answer for having spoken evil of
Dignities, to him who is the authour of them. What you
add for your justification out of scripture, is so far from mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the matter, that it onely shews how boldly you dare abuse
Gods sacred word.</p>
               <p>First you tell us, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Titus</hi> exhort and rebuke
with all authority, chap. 2. And charges him to rebuke the
Cretians sharply. chap. 1. And what of this? I pray did
S. <hi>Paul</hi> give any such kinde of charge to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More? Titus</hi> was
Bishop of <hi>Crete;</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> commanded him to exhort and
rebuke offenders in his Diocess: what could be properer?
Doth this authorize you, who are no Pope, I trow, no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
Universal Bishop, but a private person, Fellow of
<hi>Christs Colledge,</hi> and not Master of his whole Church, to
Rebuke all the Bishops of the Christian world?</p>
               <p>Then you go on thus <q>[Is it not also said <hi>Isa 11. He shall
smite the earth with the Rod of his mouth, and with the breath
of his lips shall he slay the wicked.</hi> Which our Saviour Christ
doth even in his true and living members also, as well as in
his own Person; his spirit in them kindling their zeal, and
directing their words to the just reproof of ungodliness. And I
am sure I inveigh against nothing (if it can properly be called
inveighing) but what is confessedly wicked and ungodly.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here you presume, that you are a <hi>true living member of
Christ,</hi> and that <hi>Christs spirit kindled that zeal, and directed
your words</hi> in these Invectives. If so; then your words are
sacred, and infallibly true, because proceeding from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57586:90"/>
of the Holy Ghost: but that they are such, all the
wit you have, will never perswade men in their wits, to believe.
May not any rayling sactary say as much for himself, if this
will serve? may he not vouch himself for a true living mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Christ? may he not call his passion, zeal, and father it
upon the Spirit of God? and yet will not all sober persons
count that such a one Blasphemes? Because some lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Pulpiteers of late, were wont to broach what wilde rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious,
antichristian Invectives would seem most to promote
the Cause; and then in their concluding Prayer, tell God
Almighty that he had taught them thus and thus: was the
Auditory therefore bound to believe that Gods Spirit was the
Authour of such stuff? I hope not. Christ may indeed, when
he pleases, Commissionate his true living members to do him
such service as you intimate: but for all that; if you can shew
no Commission for such imployment, but the zeal of your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
spirit, kindled (as you are pleased to imagin) by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, you will be counted no better then a furious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiast.
As for your jolly vaunt, that <hi>you are sure</hi> you inveigh
against nothing but what is <hi>confessedly wicked and ungodly:</hi> it
is but like your self: for it is apparent enough by the foregoing
Passages which I cited out of your <hi>Mystery,</hi> that you inveighed
against the Government of all the Churches in Christendom
and that the Government of all the Churches in Christendom,
is <hi>confessedly wicked and ungodly,</hi> who but D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi> would
affirm?</p>
               <p>His next words are <q>[Is it not the command of God to
<hi>Isaiah, Cry aloud, spare not, list up thy voice like a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
and shew my people their transgression, and the House of
Israel their sins?</hi> And doth not the same Prophet complain
of blinde and ignorant watchmen, of dumb Dogs that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bark, sleeping, lying down, and loving to slumber? And
if it be a fault to be thus dumb, certainly it is a vertue to
bark and give warning; though that canine eloquence must
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57586:90"/>
needs sound harsh to their ears of whom our Saviour hath
foretold (The thief cometh not but to steal kill and destroy)
answerable to those <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> mentioned in the
<hi>Apocalyps.</hi>]</q> Is not this wonderously to the Doctors purpose?
God commanded <hi>Esay,</hi> a known Prophet to shew <hi>Israel</hi> her
sins: but when or were did God command this Doctor to do
the like; or is he a known Prophet, sent to the Christian
<hi>Israel? Esay</hi> complains of Watchmen, who were dumb dogs;
for Watchmen were in publick office, and ought to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
warning: But doth he complain of private Persons for
being silent, and refraining from publick Invectives against
all the Governours and Government of Gods whole Church!
And here take notice of the Doctors strong Logick: If, saith
he, it be a fault to be dumb, certainly it is a vertue to bark and
give warning: and hereby he would prove that it was a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in him thus to inveigh or bark. What fresh-man will not
smile at this wretched sophism; and presently retort, that it
is a fault to be dumb, in those who ought to bark, but not
in those whose duty calls them not to it: That it is no vertue
in such an one to bark who was not appointed to that imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but both by barking usurp the office that belongs to
others: That if D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi> were commissionated to bark, it
were a fault in him to be dumb, and <hi>certainly</hi> a vertue to bark:
That if he be not commissionated, silence would better have
become him then barking.</p>
               <p>Now touching his last clause (though that canine eloquence
must needs sound harsh to their ears, of whom our Saviour
hath foretold, The thief cometh not but to steal, kill and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy,)
Are not <hi>all the guides of Christendom</hi> much beholding
to him for it? for he makes no bones at all, of pointing them
out as the very men of whom Christ foretold; namely as
thieves, whose business is to steal, kill and destroy. Those
they were, against whom he used his canine eloquence; and
who but they are the men who, above all others, must count
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57586:91"/>
that eloquence harsh? They therefore (if you will believe
the Doctor) and every one of them without exception, are
murderous destroying theives.</p>
               <p>But he adds <q>[And again in <hi>Isaiah,</hi> Those that say to the
seers, see not, and to the Prophets, prophesie not unto us
right things, speak unto us smooth things; they are stigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
with the title of a Rebellious people, lying children,
children that will not hear the Law of the Lord. For the
Law of the Lord is as fire, and the word of God, a sharp
two-edged sword. All which I think, is Apology sufficient
for sharpness of rebuke if it be rightly placed.]</q> They are
stigmatized, who forbade the seers to see, and the Prophets
to prophesie right things. This I grant: and what then?
Those seers were by their office bound to see; and those
Prophets to prophesie right things: hence it follows that they
were much to blame who forbade them to doe their duty.
And how doth this concern D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More?</hi> Is he a Prophet, or a
seer, or any thing analogous, constituted over all Christendom?
If he were so; (as, God be thank'd, he is not) did any one
command him not to see? did any one command him not to
prophesie right things, but smooth things? Again, I grant
Gods Law is as fire, and his word a sharp two-edged sword:
are D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mores</hi> dictates and expressions such? Yet he very man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
concludes, that in his opinion, what he hath here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
out of scripture is a <hi>sufficient apology for sharpness of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke,
if it be rightly placed:</hi> his meaning is, that it is a sufficient
apology for his own Invectives. First he should have proved
(what he onely supposeth) that his Invectives are <hi>rightly
placed.</hi> Secondly though this justifies those who had due
commission sharply to rebuke and inveigh, where there was just
reason so to do; yet it is far from being a sufficient apology
for those who arrogate to themselves the liberty of being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Censors.</p>
               <p>Sect. 3. To that part of the Objection, that <hi>he no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57586:91"/>
our Church;</hi> he answers <q>[That as he no where excepts
her, so he no where nominates her.]</q> This he needed not
to have told us: for <hi>that he no where nominates her</hi> is plainly
enough supposed in the very words of the Objection. But
because he did not except her in his taxing all Churches in
general, he therefore plainly and undenyably included her.
If I should take upon me generally to stigmatize all presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and illogical impertinent writers; though I nominate not
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi> who is apparently enough one of that tribe; yet if I
except him not, I doe certainly comprehend him in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of those whom I stigmatize.</p>
               <p>Sect 4. He saith, that he farther answers <q>[It was needless
for me to except our own Church; for providence it self had
excepted her, in that she disappeared, &amp; was wholly under the
hatches, when I wrote those Advertisements to the Guides
of Christendom.]</q> Sutably to this he saith in his 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Section,
upon the same account, <q>[That the English Church was
out of sight, if not out of being, that is, politically dead,
when he wrote this.]</q> Good God! where is this Doctors
ingenuity! for it matters not when he wrote this stuff; but
when he Printed and Published it. The Book the Objections
were framed against, is his <hi>Mystery of Godliness,</hi> Printed and
Published, after his Majesties return; which return he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in his Preface to that Book, dated from his Study at
<hi>Christs Colledge</hi> in <hi>Camb. Iun.</hi> 12. 1660. Did the Church
of <hi>England</hi> then <hi>disappear; was it wholly under the hatches?</hi>
Did not his Sacred Majesty; did not the venerable Bishops;
did not the Universities; did not the Cathedral and Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giat
Churches; did not Millions of the People publickly
own and profess it? Under the hatches then it was not: at
least not <hi>wholly under and out of sight.</hi> The Doctor is not so
pur-blinde but he might have discovered it, had he had a
minde. Yet here he thinks to put off all, with this putid shift,
that the Church appeared not at the time <hi>when he wrote.</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:57586:92"/>
Suppose he had, during the Rebellion, wrote a Book against
the King; and for the asserting him who was much of his
Opinion concerning liberty in Religion, and touching the
Government and Governours of the Church, I mean the most
infamous Oliver (whom I doubt not but the Doctor knows
who it was that affirmed to be <hi>the most wise, valiant, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Prince in Christendome.)</hi> Suppose also that he had ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
to publish that Book, after the Kings Return, it had been
strange impudence, you will say: But the Doctors Apologie
had been ready against any Objector, <hi>viz.</hi> That when he
wrote that Book, the King <hi>disappeared,</hi> was <hi>wholly under
hatches,</hi> was <hi>politically dead.</hi> But more of this point, when I
come to his 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Section.</p>
               <p>To that part of the Objection, which chargeth him with
saying that (our Church is not quite emerged out of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Apostasie,) he answers <q>[Though those words may
seem at first sight to intimate so much, <hi>viz.</hi> (wherefore out
of a due humility and modesty, suspecting our selves not
to have emerged quite out of this general Apostasie
of the Church) yet I am sure it is a mere <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, like
that which follows, (Again as for Idolatry, cannot we finde
also that among our selves? I do not mean covetousness
onely, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Where I think no man will say, I am one of the
number, if he read the whole paragraph. Wherefore I do
not speak of the English Church, of which I profess my self
a member, but of such faults of the reformed Churches in
general, whether common to them all, or not, as occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to my minde, the English Church then disappearing,
both in such a sense as I intimated before, and also as <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi>
his patrimony in <hi>Socrates</hi> his Map of the World: so
universalized were my thoughts in that meditation, nor
could they be fixed on our English Church, since the things
that I alledge, are incompetible to her, as I have proved
in my vindication of her</q>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:57586:92"/>
A pretty fetch, or Cheat if you will! to say, we may
finde Idolatry <hi>among our selves;</hi> doth not argue that <hi>I am
one of the Idolaters:</hi> Therefore, <hi>To suspect our selves not to
have emerged quite out of the general Apostasie of the Church;</hi>
argues not a suspicion that <hi>Our Church is still in that Apostasie.</hi>
What Consequence is this, where the expressions run not
parallel? Had the Doctor said (We may suspect our selves
not quite emerged out of the general Crime of Idolatry, it
had answered to the former expression <hi>viz.</hi> (We may suspect
our selves not quite emerged out of the general Apostasie
of the Church:) but then, by his leave, he had given just oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to suspect that he himself was not quite free from
Idolatry.</p>
               <p>Again, whereas he saith <q>[I do not speak of the English
Church, of which I profess my self a member,]</q> what can
be more ridiculous? The Question is, touching what he spake,
<hi>lib. 5. cap. 17. sect. 7.</hi> of his Mystery. Now I demand: Did
he when he wrote that, profess himself a member of the
English Church? if he did not; though since then he
findes it more for his ease and safety to speak in a contrary
strain, and mightily to extoll this Church, what is this to the
purpose? If he did, let him prove it; for I have great reason
to believe otherwise. Besides it is not very probable that he
professed himself a member of that Church which to him
appeared not, but was wholly out of sight, and politically
dead.</p>
               <p>As vain is that which follows, <hi>viz.</hi> (that he speaks of such
faults of the Reformed Churches in general, whether common
to them all or not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) can any faults be <hi>not common to all,</hi>
that is, particular to some Reformed Churches; and yet be
the faults of the Reformed Churches <hi>in general?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To his pretence that the Church of England was then
disappearing, I have answer'd already; and shall reply farther,
in his 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Section. But whereas he professes that his thoughts
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57586:93"/>
                  <hi>could not be fixed upon the English Church;</hi> I expected he
would have given her disappearance and dead condition, for
one reason: but that had spoil'd his plot, as being inconsistent
with that reason which he annexes, <hi>viz.</hi> (<hi>that the things he
alledges,</hi> (namely the crimes generally charged upon the
Churches) are incompetible to her: as he hath proved in his
vindication of her.) For herein he must suppose our Church to
be then extant: else how could any thing be said to be either
incompetible or competible to her, by any man who meant
to speak intelligibly? Lastly, the sport still is, that he refers
us, not to his <hi>Mystery,</hi> which is the sole subject of our contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
but to his vindication publish'd divers years since: might
he not abuse her there, though he extols her here?</p>
               <p>But now after all his shifting, I shall plainly prove that in the
mentioned place of his <hi>Mystery l. 5. c. 17. sect. 7.</hi> he understood
also the Church of England: and that by his own words pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent,
and subsequent. First in the close of the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Section
of that Chapter, he saith <q>[Those divisions of Churches
which were made <hi>about an hundred years agoe,</hi> and which
immediately became the Churches of this or that Polity;
if those alterations then had been into a way purely Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical,
it had plainly been the enlivening of the witnesses, and
the calling of them into heaven many years before the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration
of the 1260. days. Which is a strong presumption
all is not yet right, and that the witnesses are not yet alive,
nor the Woman yet out of the wilderness.]</q> Then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
follow those words of his 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Section (Wherefore
out of a due humility and modesty suspecting <hi>our selves</hi> not to
have emerged quite out of this General Apostasie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] I
grant he may comprehend other Reformed Churches, in those
words <hi>(our selves)</hi> but the Church of England he necessarily
must include, if he speaks after the rate but of common sense
especially considering the time he premised of the divisions of
the Churches of which he discourses.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:57586:93"/>
Secondly, to make all clearer yet, by his subsequent words
in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Section of that 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter <q>[We will be prone
enough to acknowledge this against others, <hi>viz.</hi> in those
dominions where Popery hath so great a stroke: but it is
more to our advantage to examine also what is amiss <hi>at home:</hi>
for it doth not follow that because the number of the Beast
is not upon us, that we doe not bestianize; nor is it the
purple spots, but the disease, that is mortiferous.]</q> What
is <hi>amiss at home,</hi> surely cannot point at Churches abroad; at
least so as to exclude our own.</p>
               <p>Sect 5. He grants he hath said something wherein she
may seem <hi>consequentially concerned, viz.</hi> (his concluding from
the highest <hi>Epoche</hi> of the 1260. years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) I have disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
enough wherein she is <hi>directly concerned:</hi> and therefore
mean not to trouble my self with tracing him in his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyptick
computes, to examine what he calls a concernment
consequential. Onely the Reader may take notice that the
Doctor here in some measure grants, what hitherto he hath
indeavoured to Deny.</p>
               <p>This Section he concludes thus <q>[If I have been injurious
either to the Protestant Reformation in general, or to our
English Church in particular; I have, I think, made abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
amends in my <hi>Synopsis Prophetica (Pref. sect. 16. 17.
18. and Book 2. chap. 22. Sect 13.)</hi> to which I refer the Reader
for fuller satisfaction.]</q> The Doctors conscience heaved fair,
and would fain have made him ingenuous: but that unlucky
<hi>If,</hi> (if I have been injurious) blasted the Credit of his acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement:
for I hope it appears by what I have said in these
Observations upon his Apologie, that his <hi>If,</hi> might and ought
to have been spared. As for the <hi>abundant amends</hi> he boasts of;
I easily believe he talks high things of our Church now, and
would not stick to be hyperbolical in her <hi>encomium;</hi> for there
is main reason for it: the winde is turned. But I must tell
him, that if he obstinately persists in defending all that he
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57586:94"/>
wrote in his <hi>Mystery,</hi> (particularly, those things which these
Objections point to) without the least confession plain and
direct, that he hath said divers things rashly and falsly; his
professions in his <hi>Synopsis</hi> (be they what they will) can signifie
little to any sober men who are acquainted with his <hi>Mystery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sect. 6. In answer to that part of the Objection (The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
having separated from the great Babylon, have built
less and more tolerable ones, but not to be tolerated for ever.)
He brings upon the stage the whole Paragraph out of which
it was cited: (and which being prolix, and, God knows, little
to his purpose, I forbear to transcribe) after which he adds,
<q>[What ill construction can be made of this Paragraph or
any part of it, in reference to our English Church, I must
confess, I cannot easily divine: for the English Church was
out of fight, if not out of being, when I wrought this, that
is to say, it was politically dead.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Though I have touched already upon this pitiful disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
evasion, in his saying that [when he wrote this]
(not, when he printed and published it) our Church was out
of sight: yet seeing he will needs offer it again, it is not amiss to
say something farther. It seems, had the English Church been
in sight when he wrote this, the ill construction made of it
in reference to that Church had been just: what condition
therefore it was then in, let us now consider. I suppose, in favour
to the Doctor, that he wrote his <hi>Mystery</hi> during the time
of our Churches famous Persecution. If it were then perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
it was not quite out of sight; and dead and gone: for
no man persecutes that which there is no hope to discover:
the Persecutors saw their game, and reach'd it too; and that,
till the very year of his Majesties Return. The Doctor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ignorant that the Church stood all that while established
by law, and was therefore, by his favour, not <hi>Politically dead,</hi>
but alive. It was notorious also that the Bishops, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the flagrancy of the persecution against them, did
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57586:94"/>
every one of them nobly stick to their profession: so did very
many of the rest of the Clergie; and thousands of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
Gentry and Commons; choosing rather to part with their
Estates and Liberties, then with their Religion: in which holy
bravery they persisted, till Peace, together with his Majesty,
returned to the Church and Nation. It is true, the free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of their Religion was violently overborn; Horses, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sbyterians,
Independents, and such like things having invaded
and taken possession of the publick Churches: yet still it
was well enough known, that the Religion was professed (and
that with more then ordinary zeal) in private Congregations;
that the Churches daily service was there solemnly used, and
the Sacraments reverently administred: still many were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by the Bishops: still the Fasts and Feasts of the Church
were observed by thousands: still some Proselytes, much
moved by the pious Constancy of our Confessours, were
gained to our Religion; And had the question been then
asked, <hi>where is the Church of England?</hi> it might truly have
been answered, it was in England still, though unworthily and
sadly oppressed: had the Doctor then sought for it, or any
else who had lost it, they might have found part of it in the
<hi>Tower,</hi> part in <hi>Newgate,</hi> part in <hi>Winchester-house,</hi> part in <hi>Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,</hi>
part in <hi>Peter-house,</hi> and other Prisons: to say nothing of
several constant Congregations in and about the City. Nay all
the country over they might have retrived parts of it, had they
but inquired for Persons notorious enough, I mean those
whose profession of our Religion had exposed them to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
sequestrations and plunders. Yet because our Church
(though still by Law established, still maintained by so many
religious Confessours) was barbarously persecuted, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi>
could take no notice of any such thing as the English Church:
with what Church did he [who was then in Orders, and had
solemnly ingaged himself to the Church of England) commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
all that while? Not with ours, that is plain enough:
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57586:95"/>
though he be now, upon the reflouirshing of it, fallen into a
fit of magnifying it more (I believe) then ever they did who
suffered so much for it.</p>
               <p>But he proceeds <q>[For other Reformed Churches, which
also are so laudably repurgated from the grosser cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of the great Babylon; of what ill interpretation
can it be to exhort them to perfect the good work which is
begun, and more carefully to cleanse out of the old leaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
for thus they shall cease to be any longer so many lesser Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons,
cities of division and confusion, and so clear up at
length (according to the design of him that called them out
of that great Babylon) into one holy City of God.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>I profess not to meddle with other Reformed Churches:
nor do I count the Church of Englands case and theirs to be
one and the same. Yet I cannot but observe the weakness of
this Apologie: First, by <hi>Old leaven,</hi> he must needs understand
Popery; and this he supposes still to remain in those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
I believe they will scarce thank him for his supposal;
but rather give him flat defiance for it. Secondly, He taxed
those Churches for having <hi>built less Babylons</hi> and <hi>more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi>
but <hi>not to be tolerated for ever.</hi> What did they <hi>Build,</hi> but
the frames and constitutions of their Government and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline?
These, saith the Doctor, are <hi>little Babylons,</hi> and not
to be tolerated for ever. And yet he would have them <hi>perfect
the good work they had begun,</hi> that is the little Babylons: but
were these good works? and must they be perfected? why,
this may make them great Babylons: the wiser course, sure, is
to leave them imperfect, and little as they now are. I, but his
following words (<hi>more carefully to purge out the old leaven</hi>) argue
that he would have whatsoever is Babylonish, be purged
out. Be it so: but then let him look how to reconcile those
words with them which precede, <hi>viz. (to perfect the good
work they had begun)</hi> for that work (as the Doctor hath orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the business) was, the building of less Babylons; which
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57586:95"/>
work cannot be perfected, if all that is Babylonish must be
rooted up.</p>
               <p>In his 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Section, he goeth on touching the Reformed
Churches, presaging that God <q>[will not tolerate nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive
any longer at their childish squabling about nutshels,
counters and cherrystones.]</q> These, if there be any depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and sense in his discourse, must be their little Babylons:
so that his long tragical Invectives were, upon the matter,
made onely against Boys-play. Mean while those Churches
are much beholding to the Doctor, who makes them a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of silly coxcombs, whose most serious business (for such
sure, is their Reformation) amounts to no more then squab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
about such childish toys and trifles, as nutshels, counters
and cherrystones.</p>
               <p>His 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Section he thus begins <q>[I have, I hope, by this
time abundantly satisfied the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Objection, we come now
to the tenth and last.</q> It is well he doth not define, but
onely hope so. Whether his hopes fail him or not, I leave
to indifferent Judges; and follow to the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Objection, to
which he replies in this 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter.
<q>Object. 10.</q>
                  <hi>He saith that the Laws of God, are like words in an unknown
tongue, till the conscience be convinced,</hi> lib. 10. cap. 10. <hi>as
I take it. Whence it necessarily follows, that it is no sin to act
against those Laws, if a man believe it lawfull. Then those
who thought they did God good service in killing the Apostles,
were no sinners in doing it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(As I take it)</hi> said the Objector: which he would not have
said, nor trusted his memory, but reviewed the place and set it
down positively, if he had intended that his Objections as they
were given to the Doctor should have been published. What
the Doctor hath got by his publication of them he may
thank himself for. In the mean time, it so happens that the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57586:96"/>
Objector charged him not wrongfully in that particular: else
he should have heard of it.</p>
               <p>This, saith the Doctor, <q>[seems to be a smart and stinging
Objection]</q> and he saith so with scorn enough: for he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
adds <q>[That it reacheth not the right state of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion]</q>
A great fault, I grant, If true: the very fault which I
have so often detected in D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mores</hi> writings. To prove it
therefore, he cites that passage in his <hi>Mystery,</hi> whence the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is taken, and subjoyns thus: <q>[where it is plain that
the most essential part of the state of the question is omitted,
by leaving out <hi>(in those that are sincere)</hi> and that therefore
the Objection, though very strong, yet cannot touch or
harm any position of ours by those formidable consequences,
according as the question is by me stated in this 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter,
both in respect of the <hi>person,</hi> and also in respect of the <hi>matter
of the command. Sect. 9</hi> For I suppose the person <hi>sincere,</hi> and
what I mean by <hi>sincerity</hi> I have fully explicated under my
first Aphorism, and it is needless here again to repeat it.
And for the <hi>matter</hi> of the command, I suppose it to be such
things as are not discoverable by the light of nature, such
as the belief of matter of fact done many ages agoe, and
Religious precepts and ceremonies thereupon depending.
But I have expresly declared in my 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Aphorism extracted
out of this 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter, that nothing that hath any real
turpitude or immorality in it, can justly be pretended to be
the voice or command of God, to either the sincere, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincere.
Out of all which we are abundantly furnished to
answer this last Objection. I say therefore, that such Laws
of God as are meerly <hi>positive,</hi> or depend upon historical or
miraculous Revelation, are like words in an unknown tongue
to him that is truly sincere, till his conscience be convinced.
This I say, and this is all I have said in that 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>How his <hi>sincere person</hi> serves the Doctor for a subterfuge
I have shown already, and need not repeat it. And that what
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57586:96"/>
he affirms to be all that he hath said in that 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter, is
not all, I could easily evince, were it requisite to the present
point. But fully to gratifie him, I will take into the question
both the <hi>person,</hi> and the <hi>matter of the command,</hi> which he
desires; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>sincere,</hi> and that which hath <hi>turpitude</hi> and
<hi>immorality</hi> in it: and then I hope the <hi>formidable consequences</hi>
mentioned in the Objection will <hi>touch the Doctors position.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the person; his Tenet is (which he repeats in his 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
Sect. of this 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter) <q>[That the light and law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and of eternal and immutable morality cries louder in
the soul of the <hi>sincere</hi> then that he should admit of any such
foul motions, much less as from God, or be ignorant of any
indispensable morality, as if it were not his command.]</q> But
what thinks he then of S. <hi>Paul</hi> before his conversion? Was
not he zealous and hearty in his Religon? he saith himself,
<hi>Phil. 3.6.</hi> that he <hi>was touching Righteousness which is in the
law blameless;</hi> that is, according to the knowledge which he
then had of Religion, his deportment was so exact that it
could not be taxed with any wickedness. Whereupon he faith
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. that though he had been (a blasphemer and a
persecutor, and injurious; yet he obtained mercy, because he
did it ignorantly in unbelief) he did it not for want of sincerity
and uprightness of heart in his present perswasion but onely
for want of knowledge. Well, and what was it he then did?
one particular was persecution of the faithfull, and that to the
death: <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 10. he confesses that he <hi>assented</hi> to S. <hi>Stephens</hi>
death: and doubtless he verily thought that herein he did
God good service; accounting S. <hi>Stephen</hi> an enemy to the
true Religion. Yet this act of his was a sin; for which (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done <hi>ignorantly,</hi> notwithstanding the moral law printed in
his heart) he afterwards obtained mercy. It appears then, that
a person most sincere in his way may in blinde zeal run upon
hainous sins, and such as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More</hi> holds to be against the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
law; <hi>viz.</hi> (to use his own words,) The <hi>killing</hi> of good
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57586:97"/>
men <hi>under pretence of heresie against the Iudaical Religion.</hi>
Now what can be the reason of such zeal, but because this <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Zelot</hi> counted that he obeyed Gods Will in this Action?
It follows therefore, That the Law of Nature <hi>cries not so loud
in the sincere soul,</hi> but that such a soul may sometimes <hi>admit
such foul motions,</hi> and that, <hi>as proceeding from God.</hi> This for
the Person.</p>
               <p>Now for the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Command, <hi>viz. Things not
discoverable by the Light of Nature;</hi> and these he supposeth to
be such as have no <hi>real Turpitude</hi> or <hi>Immorality</hi> in them. For
saith he, <hi>Any thing that includes such Turpitude or Immorality,
cannot justly be counted the Command of God.</hi> Here I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minde
him of the example of <hi>Abrahams</hi> being commanded to
kill his innocent son. This Act in the Doctors Opinion (for
I have declared mine own about it already) was against the
Moral Law; and therefore by his Rule <hi>Abraham</hi> could not
justly count it the Command of God, but must have judged it a
Trick of the subtile Tempter. I may add, Gods commanding
<hi>Israel</hi> to plunder and spoil the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> which was against
the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Commandment;</hi> as also his commanding them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
the Countrey, seize the Possessions, and destroy the
lives of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> who never had done them injury.
Would the Doctor have allowed the <hi>Israelites</hi> to dispute
these Commands; to object that they were against the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Law of Nature, <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis,</hi> &amp;c. and that
therefore they included Turpitude? I hope not. God is
Lord of all things, and may do what he will with his own; yea,
even with his own Laws. He hath not bound his own hands
by binding ours, and giving Laws to Nature; and if at any
time he thinks fit to countermand such Laws, his infinite
Wisdom and Justice have sufficient reason for so doing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man understands it or no. The Moral Turpitude of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
the Law of Nature, is not imputable as such to any man
who hath certainly received Gods Command to violate it; for
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57586:97"/>
whatsoever is Gods Command, is by being so necessarily
free from inferring any Turpitude, and most undoubtedly Just
and Right. So that though the Action examined by the
standard of the Moral Law common to all men, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
Turpitude, yet Gods particular Law to the contrary
doth wholly justifie it. (But then we must alwaies remember,
that the Moral Law being his revealed known Will; it must
be our Rule till we assuredly have his Will revealed unto us
to the contrary.) Now I infer, <hi>ad hominem,</hi> I mean, as to
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>More,</hi> If God be above the Laws he hath made for us in
general, and may in particular cases (for such onely concern
this Querie) command contrary to those Laws; then doth
that contrariety not at all prove such a Command not
to be the Command of God. This for the <hi>Matter</hi> of the
Command.</p>
               <p>And now having premised this, I will as I promised (that
the Doctor may have as fair play as himself can with) take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Question his <hi>sincere Person;</hi> and such <hi>Matter of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
as <hi>is not discoverable by the Light of Nature, viz.</hi> as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
terms it, <hi>The belief of matter of fact done many ages ago,
and Religious precepts and Ceremonies thereupon depending;
and Laws meerly Positive, or such as depend upon History and
miraculous Revelation, and not the eternal Moral Law of God,</hi>
(for these also are his phrases.) Nay, I will take in whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
else he can desire me, provided it be but a Command of
God derived to the ears of the supposed <hi>sincere Man.</hi> His
Position will then be this at least, namely, [<hi>That the Laws or
Commands of God</hi> (such as are described, or any else that are
certainly his Laws and Commands) <hi>are to the sincere man like
words in an unknown tongue, till his Conscience be convinced.</hi>]
And what hath the Doctor got by this new Model of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition?
for still the consequence mentioned in the <hi>Objection</hi>
will be good, <hi>viz. [That it is no sin in that sincere man, to act
against those Laws of God till his Conscience be convinced.]</hi> And
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57586:98"/>
so will the result of that consequence added in the <hi>Objection</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
<hi>viz.</hi> [<hi>That those men sinned not, who thought they did God
good service in killing the Apostles.</hi>]</p>
               <p>For first, it appears by the example of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> that those
men might be sincere and right-heartily zealous in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
2. The Laws of Christian Religion were in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
sense Gods Positive Laws, for which those men perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
the Apostles; and which they themselves ought to
have imbraced, having heard them from the Apostles.
3. Though they heard them, they were not convinced in
Conscience that they were Gods Laws, but quite the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and this appears in that they thought they did God good
service in persecuting the Apostles for them. 4. Being not
convinced in Conscience that they were Gods Laws; by the
Doctors Principle those Laws were but like words in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
tongue, and therefore obliged not these men to obey
them. 5. If these men were not obliged to obey them,
then they sinned not in disobeying and resisting them; nor in
persecuting the Apostles to the death, for asserting those
Laws against the <hi>Iewish</hi> Religion, which they were in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
perswaded to be of God; and for the defence of which
their Religion, they were likewise perswaded in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that this their persecuting them, was doing of God
good service.</p>
               <p>But the Doctor tells us also, <q>[That invincible ignorance
makes an Act involuntary, and that therefore there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
to admit, that the transgression or non-obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of these kinde of Laws in him that is thus invincibly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
and unconvicted of them, (as we suppose the truly
sincere to be) hath not the proper nature of sin in the sincere,
though in the unsincere it may. This non-reception of
Truth or Inconviction may be Trial, Punishment, or fatal
Defect; but the nature of sin it properly hath not, as being
wholly and perfectly involuntary, and absolutely out of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57586:98"/>
the reach of the party to help it. For the nature of sincerity
is to do all we can, and no man can do any more. Whence I
will easily admit, That it is no sin to act against, that is, to
transgress or not observe such Positive Laws of God, while
a man stands unconvinced in such circumstances as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
firmly believing that it is lawfull for him not to
observe them, and being fully perswaded that they are
not his.</q>
               </p>
               <p>First, Is it not pretty sport, that he makes the transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods Positive Laws to be sin in the unsincere persons,
but no sin in the sincere? I have heard of an Opinion, that
God sees no sin in his Children, and I have often wondered at
it; but this fancy of the Doctor goeth much higher: God not
onely doth not, but cannot see sin in them, for there is none in
them to be seen; that which is sin in others, being no such
thing in them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He saith, <hi>That non-reception of Truth in the
sincere</hi> (which is indeed, as himself is forced to confess, the
transgression of Gods Positive Laws) <hi>may be Trial, Punishment
or fatal Defect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. For <hi>Trial,</hi> Can any sober man believe that God would
make that a trial of his faithfull sincere Servant, which puts
him necessarily upon resisting Truth, and not believing but
transgressing his own Laws? This the Doctor holds that God
doth by conveying into that person a false perswasion. But
if he narrowly examineth the business, he will finde that this
cannot possibly be any trial of such a mans Obedience, more
then conveying a true perswasion would be; so that he makes
God the Authour of falsity meerly <hi>gratis.</hi> Besides, this trial
which the Doctor supposeth, is in truth no trial at all; for is
any mans Obedience to God tried by <hi>his non-reception of Gods
Truth! gerrae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. For <hi>Punishment,</hi> It is very strange, nay down right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
that God should punish his sincere and excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57586:99"/>
(for such the Doctor makes him,) who doth all he can
to know the Truth, by putting him in such a condition
through false perswasion that he cannot receive the Truth;
and this that God who hath promised that they who ask,
seek, and knock, (that is, do what they can) shall not do it
in vain.</p>
               <p>3. For <hi>fatal Defect,</hi> what means the Doctor by this! Is
his fate any thing different from Gods Providence? if not, why
doth he make this a distinct branch from Gods proceedings
with men? but if it be, he may in <hi>Mahomets</hi> School finde pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage
for it, but not in Christs.</p>
               <p>Touching the invincible ignorance in his sincere man, what
could more vainly have been pretended? for in the close of the
words I last cited out of the Doctor, he represents this man as
one who <hi>firmly believes</hi> that it is lawfull for him not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
such or such Positive Laws of God; and is <hi>fully perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>
that they are not his. If he so believes, and be fully so
perswaded, it is certain that those Laws came to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
for he cannot believe or be perswaded touching any
thing of which he is wholly ignorant. All the Question that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
is, Whether these Laws which he now hears and knows
be Gods Laws or no? And what hinders him from believing
them so to be if he hath a minde? What invincible Obstacle
stands in his way? Not fate, I trow; nor any perverseness of
his own, for he is supposed to be sincere, and to do all that
he can for imbracing the Truth; which Truth is now before
him, and ready for his acceptance. I cannot imagine what the
Doctor can here reply, but that God himself interposeth by an
irresistible false perswasion in that mans soul, and thereby bars
out his own Laws which stand ready at that souls door, else the
mans ignorance was plainly vincible. Now if God thus interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
(which no Christian ears will hear without horrour) I have
no more to say.</p>
               <p>The Doctor adds, <q>[It is not the firmness of our convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57586:99"/>
or inconviction, that will warrant an act from becoming
sinfull, but the perfect sincerity of the party; in that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
to what is false, or inconviction to what is true, ariseth
not from any fault of his, but is invincible ignorance, and in
such things as the most exquisite morality of minde cannot
arrive to the knowledge of.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here he very fairly overturns his own foundation. His Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
was, <q>[That nothing but conviction of Conscience that
this or that is the Will of God, is properly the promulgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Will to every particular soul; otherwise it is but as
the recital of a Law in a language the people understand not,
and therefore can take no hold upon them.]</q> They are his
own words, and those which occasioned this 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Objection.</hi>
Now the proper promulgation of Gods Will, doth certainly
<hi>warrant an Act from becoming sinfull.</hi> But this promulgation
is, saith the Doctor, nothing but conviction of Conscience;
wherefore nothing but conviction of Conscience warrants an
Act from becoming sinfull. And what is this but point blank
contrary to his present Affirmation, [<hi>That that which will war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
an Act from becoming sinfull, is not the firmness of our
Conviction.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The onely warrant he will allow, is the <hi>perfect sincerity of
the Party.</hi> I had thought, that Gods Law it self had been
both the Rule and warrant in this case. But that Rule and
warrant, the godly Doctor makes no bones to slight and
throw aside. But what reason gives he why that sincerity
must be the warrant? namely, because [<hi>This conviction to
what is false or inconviction to what is true, ariseth not from any
fault of his, but is invincible ignorance, and in such things as the
most exquisite morality of minde cannot arrive to the knowledge
of.]</hi> Touching that fond pretence of invincible ignorance, I
have said enough already. But were that ignorance really
such, and truly invincible, and in those things which the most
exquisite morality of minde cannot arrive to know; I see not
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57586:100"/>
how it concerns the present Controversie, for the Question is
not touching such Commands of God as never come to the
sincere mans ears; but such as though he hears them (and
thereby knows them) yet he believes them not (as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
states the case) to be Gods Commands. If he would
use all exquisite moral diligence, he might finde cause to
believe them; but because he hearkens rather to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
perswasion in his own minde, therefore he believes
them not.</p>
               <p>But after all this, I must minde the Doctor that in his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Aphorism, chap. 7. sect. 2.</hi> He saith expresly,
<hi>That the souls being convinced that this or that is Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
is as it were the Kings Broad Seal, by which she is
warranted to act.</hi> How will this consist with his Affirmation
here, <hi>That it is not conviction or inconviction that will warrant
an Act from becoming sinfull?</hi> If conviction be the warrant by
which she may Act, inconviction also is the warrant by which
she must refuse to Act. Nor can this warranty proceed (as
here he saith it doth) from the <hi>perfect sincerity of the party.</hi>
But as I have already often observed, contradictions are in
this Doctors Writings so frequent, that I am past wondering
at them.</p>
               <p>He concludes thus, <q>[This (namely what I last cited out of
him) is the true state of the Question, from which therefore
the killing of the Apostles can fetch no excuse, for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that one of so sincere a heart and moralized minde
as I suppose in this Controversie, should be invincibly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that to kill such holy and harmless men as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
would be Murder, or something extreamly like it;
and for those that are unsincere and immoral, sin alwaies lies
at their own door. And this I hope will fully satisfie this
last <hi>Objection.</hi>]</q> 
                  <hi>Plaudite, Murder or something extreamly
like it?</hi> How comes the Doctor so kinde to the not invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ignorant slayers of the Apostles, as to allow them this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction?
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57586:100"/>
surely it was down right murder, and not something
extreamly like it.</p>
               <p>But the Question was, [<hi>Whether the Laws of God are like
words in an unknown tongue, till the Conscience be convinced, and
that in a person sincere.</hi>] Here he makes the true state of the
Question to be [<hi>Not that the firmness of conviction or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
will warrant an Act from being sinfull, but the perfect
sincerity of the party.</hi>] Whether this be not a palpable vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Question let any man judge. Let us see therefore,
Whether the killing of the Apostles may not fetch an excuse
from that which is indeed the Question, or rather from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
Position which is the ground of that Question.</p>
               <p>First, Those who killed the Apostles might be (as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi>
was before his Conversion) sincere in the Jewish Religion. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
If they were in Conscience perswaded of the truth of
their Religion in opposition to the Christian, (as the Doctor
upon his own Principles cannot deny but they might be,) then
they believed in their Conscience, that the Apostles were not
holy and harmless men, but deceivers, opposers of Gods true
Religion, and introducers of a false one. Thirdly, if they
so believed, they did not count it murder but justice to kill
the Apostles; or (as the Text saith) <hi>they counted they did
God good service by it.</hi> Now for their excuse or rather justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
I produce the Doctors Position, [<hi>That in sincere men,
Gods Laws are like an unknown language, till their Conscience
be convinced.</hi>] What will the Doctor object against them?
any Law of God which forbade them to kill the Apostles?
but they were not convinced that such Law was the Law of
God: their Conscience told them the contrary, namely, that
they fulfilled Gods Will, and did him gratefull service in kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them. Will he reply, That this errour of theirs was not
invincible ignorance, but such as by true sincerity they might
have helped, and that therefore they sinned? This will not
serve, for how if that errour were conveyed into them by God
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57586:101"/>
for trial or punishment, and obliged them to act accordingly?
that so it might be, the Doctor upon his own premised Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
must not deny; and if so, then no sincerity could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that effect. Or will he pretend, That they ought to
have believed Gods Will preached to them by the Apostles,
his true commissioners for that purpose? This will not do
neither, for their Conscience being not convinced that what
the Apostles preached was Gods Will or Law, it was (to use
his own words) but <hi>like an unknown language,</hi> and <hi>therefore

               <p>In his 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Chapter</hi> the Doctor looks back upon his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievments,
surveys his Conquest, and counts his Spoils;
particularly magnifying himself in his reflection upon the sheer
Baffle he hath given to each <hi>Objection.</hi> Then (as a wonderous
pertinent Close to his <hi>Apologie</hi> for himself) he falls upon a
huge Expostulation with the Sectaries, who yet need not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
any better weapons for their own defence, then he hath
furnished them with in his <hi>Mysterie.</hi> If the Reader will follow
him in that his glorious March, he will shew as much patience
in so doing, as I profess indignation in forbearing.</p>
