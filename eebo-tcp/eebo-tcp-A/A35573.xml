            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MOſt of the time of my Minority, I have ſpent in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Things of Nature, and the Ground and Foundation thereof, as you may find was from the Beginning of Times, as in <hi>Geneſis, viz.</hi> when God had perfected that Wonderful Work of his, I mean the Frame of the whole World, and had aſcribed to every part thereof his eſpecial Duty, namely, to the Air, to uphold all Feathered Fowle, the Water to harbour the Fiſh, the Earth for all Beaſts, and to produce and bring forth good and wholeſome things, which may be reduced into three words, <hi>viz.</hi> Vegetables, Animals, and Minerals, and over all theſe things he appointed Man as Regent and Governour, being the laſt and moſt Noble Creature, and did infuſe into him a Conſiderable Mind, apt to underſtand his Myſteries, and with his Tongue to unfold the Arcanaes of his Labour and Induſtry: This was that Conſideration that moved that Wiſeman <hi>Solomon</hi> to wade ſo far into the ſearching out the Cauſe of Things and to apply his Mind to the Study of Nature, not only of Birds, and Beaſts, but likewiſe of Trees, even from the Cedar of <hi>Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> to the Hyſſop that grows on the Wall; It is high time for me to mind that place of Scripture, <hi>viz.

There hath lately come forth a Book, whoſe Author is <hi>Mr. Bacon,</hi> which in peruſing, I found lame and defective, ſo that I thought myſelf obliged to take ſome pains in Confuting him of his errors, by reaſon he perſwades the World to believe what is not, <hi>viz.</hi> that Water is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of all Bodies, which is not the Opinion of your Friend</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. What are the true Principles of Natural Bodies.</head>
            <p>I Shall not anſwer with the Words of <hi>William Bacon,</hi> which are theſe: <hi>The groſs Errours of the Schools concerning Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and their uſeleſs Philoſophy, are ſo well known and exploded by this inquiſitive and ſagacious Age, that it is needleſs to endeavour to confute them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In my ſlender Judgment theſe Words are erroniouſly ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and abuſeful to all Schools in general; eſpecially to the higher Forms: For it is never known a Child as ſoon as it is Born to go alone, nor thoſe which are to learn <hi>A, B,</hi> &amp;c. or the Grammar-Tongue, to meddle with things of this Nature; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I look upon it to be their pride, to abuſe and ſcandal the moſt high and learned Schools, Colledges of Phyſitians, and many old Fathers, who have laid down good Reaſons for Principles of this Nature.</p>
            <p>Now with my ſlender Reaſon, I will endeavour to lay down ſome Arguments concerning what the true Principles of Natural Bodies are; I will lay a Foundation to work upon concerning the three Diviſions of the World, <hi>Sublunary, Coeleſtial,</hi> and <hi>Super Coeleſtial.</hi> Firſt, to define unto you what the World is, <hi>Mundus,</hi> or the World is in the Hebrew Tongue, <hi>Holam,</hi> which implyeth thus much, <hi>Quodiam per aliquot ſecula ſubſiſtat, in quo rerum or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus &amp; interritus ſit,</hi> which is to ſubſiſt and continue for certain Ages, and in which ſhall be the Birth and Deſtruction of all things; the World in the Original directly reproving all ſuch as are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that it hath always been, and ſhall ever laſt. The Greeks call it <hi>Coſmos,</hi> which imports Ornament, which the Latines for perfect and abſolute Elegancy call <hi>Mundus,</hi> becauſe there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more neatly Poliſhed and Beautified; for ſo ſaith <hi>Pliny:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105539:4"/>
Poſſidonius</hi> in Meteor calleth that <hi>Mundus,</hi> or the World, which conſiſteth of Heaven and Earth, Coeleſtial and Terreſtrial Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or of Gods and Men, and thoſe things which were created for their Uſe.</p>
            <p>Some call it <hi>Mundus, Quaſi Ornatus Mulieris,</hi> A Womans Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament.</p>
            <p>He that Buildeth a Houſe, doth not only Build it to be ſo called, but hath a farther purpoſe to make it habitable for ſome others to dwell in.</p>
            <p>There is nothing made for a ſhow only, but ſome ſervice; even ſo was the World created by the Almighty, not only to be called ſo, and retain the Name; neither did he frame his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for the World it ſelf, as if it either needed the Heat or Light of the Sun, the Breath of the Winds, the Moiſture of the Clouds, or Nouriſhment from thoſe things which it ſelf yearly produceth: but He made all things for the uſe of Men, and that they in it ſhould magnifie and glorifie his Name. I end this with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ſaying of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> upon <hi>Matthew, Habemus pro Mare Mundum</hi>; We have for the Sea, the World; for our Ship, the Church; for our Maſt, the Croſs; for the Sails, Repentance; for our Pilat, Chriſt; for the Wind, the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that great Philoſopher, ſaith, <hi>Non plures Mundi ſunt, &amp;c.</hi> There are no more Worlds, nor no more can be, if this conſiſt of the univerſal Matter, as of neceſſity it muſt: All things under Heaven in time grow old, corruptible, and vile. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Multiplicity of Worlds, which divers Philoſophers believe, as <hi>Metradorus,</hi> and others, whoſe Judgments have been oppoſed by better experienced Sophiſters, as by <hi>Pythagoras, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius, Meliſſus, Zeno,</hi> and as is more expreſſed by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the Prince of Philoſophers, above the reſt, concludes upon one World, namely, this we live in: The World, ſaith he, is that in which all things are contained, and without which there is nothing that is or can be found; So by conſequence, if there were any thing without the World, then the World could not contain all things, therefore no World: but this Queſtion may be more fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
            <p>There is but one World, and that perfect, as there is but one moſt perfect Creator, the abſolute Prince and Governour
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105539:4"/>
thereof; without this World there is neither Place nor Time; Place there is not, becauſe there can be no Place without a Body; if no Body, then no Motion; if no Motion, all Time is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, <hi>Nam Tempus eſt menſura Motus:</hi> For Time is the meaſure of all Motion. I ſhall conclude with that which was ſpoken by the mouth of <hi>Moſes, In principio creavit Deus Coelum &amp; Terram</hi>; In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth. Manifeſt it is then, that there is but one World; for ſome have ſtrove to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Permanency, as that it was without beginning, and ſhall always continue without end.</p>
            <p>The Foundatirn being laid, I come now to prove what the Principles of Natural Bodies are, whether unalterable or not, and alſo the opinion of ſome learned Men in theſe things; now I joyn my opinion with that of <hi>Hipparehis, Heraclitus,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſius,</hi> who give the ſole Pre-eminence to Fire as the beginning of all things; the Reaſon thus: That Fire condenſed or moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is made Air, but a degree more thicker than groſs Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and at length made more conſtrict, turned to Earth, ſo bring them retrograde, Earth Rarified, Converted to Water by Evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration into Air, and being purified, tranſmigrateth into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Fire, and by reaſon of the perpetual ſhifting of this one Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the order of the Birth and Breedeing of all things do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and hence new work to ariſe.</p>
            <p>Now give me leave to lay down ſome Opinions of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers concerning the beginning of the World, as <hi>Thales Mileſius,</hi> counted to be the wiſeſt Man in that Age that lived in <hi>Greece,</hi> held opinion, that Water was the beginning and breeding of all things; ſo <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> report of him: The weak Foundation he builded upon was, becauſe he ſaw and found by experience, that there was a Moiſture in the ſeed of all things, and as well in the Elements: This cannot be, for Water is ſoon drank up by Air; neither can that Argument hold good, that a Child not Born to turn to Water, but Corruption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anaximenes,</hi> the Auditor of <hi>Anaximander,</hi> reaſoned that all things were begot or procreated from Air, by thoſe reaſons that Air was capable of all Impreſſion, Action, and Quality, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105539:5"/>
apt to be tranſchanged from one Form to another; a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty which the reſt of the Elements cannot challenge.</p>
            <p>Some ſay the Creation proceedeth from two, namely, <hi>Calor &amp; Frigus,</hi> Heat and Cold, the Fire which gives the Motion, and the Earth which ſupplyeth it with Form. I ſhall not trouble the Reader any more with Opinions, but conclude with theſe words: <hi>Compeſcat ſe humana temeritas, id quod non eſt non querat, ne illud quod eſt non inveniat:</hi> Let Mens raſhneſs bridle it ſelf, and that which is not, let him by no means ſeek, leſt that which is, he can no ways find.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Elements <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, That the Beginning of them, are Heat, Cold, Moiſture, and Drought: Likewiſe that they have a repugnancy among themſelves, and therefore cannot be laſting.</p>

                  <l>The Fire next to the Stars. The third ſucceeding</l>
                  <l>Is that moiſt Element which fills the Ocean,</l>
                  <l>Ebbing and flowing with continual Motion,</l>
                  <l>The moving Waves a gentle Stem do breed,</l>
                  <l>Which ſo exhal'd from them the Air doth feed.</l>
                  <l>The Earth remoteſt from the former height,</l>
                  <l>Sits loweſt, as ſuppreſt with its own weight.</l>

            <p>Drought or Dryneſs is proper to the Earth, which challengeth it to it ſelf. Cold is inherent to the Earth, but not peculiarly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath that Quality common with the Water; and as Water challengeth Coldneſs, ſo it hath humidity common with the Air; and as the Air claims Humidity, ſo by a kind of fellowſhip it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105539:5"/>
draweth a Heat from the Fire; and as the Fire doth vindicate Heat as proper to it ſelf, ſo it participateth of Dryneſs with the Earth, which claims that quality to it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Thus it is manifeſted what is proper to every Element diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and what is common among them which they borrow one from another by which they are connext and knit one to another: it was neceſſary that they ſhould be firſt diſtinct and ſeparate, that each of them might preſerve its own nature.</p>
            <p>Needful it was alſo that they ſhould be connext, thence might grow the Compoſition of Bodies, ſo that one might adhere to another, according to their common Qualities.</p>
            <p>The Bodily matter and the matter of the four Elements were created with the Spiritual Creatures; that is to ſay, with the Soul and the Angels who were created together, which is proved by the teſtimony of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſaying, That by Heaven and Earth ought to be underſtood the Spiritual and Corporeal Creatures, created in the beginning of Times: From theſe move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and changeable Elements all things in the World have their beginning and ending.</p>
            <p>It is likewiſe obſerved, that God in the Creation of the World began above to work downwards; for in the firſt three days he laid the Foundation of the World, and in the other three days he furniſhed and adorned thoſe parts. The firſt day he made all the Heavens, and matter of the Earth, and came down as low as the Light: The ſecond day he deſcended lower, and made the Firmament or Air: The third day loweſt, and made a diſtinction betwixt the Earth and Water. Thus in three days the three Parts or Body of the World was laid, and in three days more, and in the ſame order, they were furniſhed: For on the fourth day, the Heavens which were made the firſt day, were deckt and ſtuck with Stars and Lights. The fifth day, the Firmament, which was made the ſecond day, was filled with Birds and Fowls. The ſixth day the Earth was repleniſhed with Beaſts; and laſtly, with Men. And thus did the Almighty accompliſh and finiſh the marvelous work of the Creation.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not enlarge upon Beaſts, Vegetables, nor Minerals here, but come to treat on Men, which is my intended buſineſs; only

this, all Creatures whatſoever (Man excepted) are bred and born with Natural Defences againſt Injuries and Diſcommodities, as the Tree is preſerved by the Bark, the Birds by their Feathers, the Fiſh defended with his Scales, the Sheep clad with his Wool, and Man only is brought into the World naked, and altogether unarmed: For needful it was that Nature ſhould take care of them who were not able to take care of themſelves.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. A Conſideration of the Action of the Vital Spirits.</head>
            <p>IT is well obſerved, that Angels were the firſt Creatures God made, created pure as the Light, ordained with the Light to ſerve God: The ſame day was the Soul of Man created, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid that <hi>Man is but little lower than the Angels,</hi> if he lives after the Spirit.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not trouble the Reader any more concerning the charge the Angels have over the Soul of Man; but come to treat of the Archeos, that is, the Place, Habitation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Power hath lodged the Soul of Man, <hi>viz.</hi> the Body of Man, wherein the Soul, the Image of God, abideth for a time, which is moveable and changeable, and may be called a totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tabernacle. Theſe Earthly Bodies have their aſſiſtances and being from a Spirit in Latine called <hi>Vita,</hi> or Life; the Vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which hath its Nutriment from Blood, and this Sanguine or Blood is maintained and preſerved by Nouriſhment as Meat or Drink, which we inwardly take.</p>
            <p>It may be convenient to give you a word or two concerning the Blood, how it comes to ſupport the Body, or Vital Spirits, as I have told you before by Food; and after it hath paſſed that place called the Ventricles, or Stomach, which is there concocted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105539:6"/>
or digeſted, it deſcends into the Hungry Gut called <hi>Jejunum</hi>; it is drawn from the <hi>Jejunum</hi> by five of the Miſeraical or Sucking Veins, which chuſe out the beſt for Blood; it is drawn into the great hollow Vein, called <hi>Vena porta</hi>; it is drawn from <hi>Vena porta</hi> into the Liver, and there 'tis converted into Blood; it is drawn from the Liver into the hollow Vein again the ſecond time to be refined and ſeparated: it is from thence ſent each to his natural place and receptacle, as Choler to the Gall, and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly to the Spleen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Principles of the Bodies ſo called of the Phyſitians.</p>
            <p>Now the Living or Vital Spirits ſtand in need of two things, that it may ſubſiſt, convenient Motion and Aliment, and ſo is the Body of Man preſerved and kept alive.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. Where, and how the Vitals do perform their chief Operation.</head>
            <p>NOw theſe Spirits, as Authors have obſerved, are the Maſter-Workmen in the Body, and as the upper Wheel which turneth about the lower Wheels in the Body: therefore whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is healthful, and refreſhing to the Spirits, works powerfully good effects in the Body, and that ſpeedily and ſuddainly, as the Author ſaith, Vapours and Affections work compendiouſly upon the Spirits. It is well known that the Almighty hath placed in the World all things for the uſe of Mankind, and nothing in vain; it was appointed by God that Mans Body ſhould receive Nouriſhment by the Fruits of the Earth, what is a greater Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bleſſing than perfect Health of Body? Some ſay, <hi>Valetudo eſt ſummum Bonum,</hi> Health is the chiefeſt Good.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To ſhew you how this Wheel or Vital Spirit doth work for or againſt us; firſt for us, <hi>viz.</hi> for Health of Body. Firſt, good Nouriſhment cauſeth Health. Secondly, good Air will
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105539:7"/>
revive the Vital Spirits: But for fear this ſmall Volume ſhould be too big, I will only give you two Reaſons which will give light to the loweſt Capacity, <hi>viz.</hi> All Bodies are guided and governed by four Elements; not only the Bodies of Men, but all Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Animals, and Minerals.</p>
            <p>An Element is a Body pure, Simple, and unmixt, from which all Natural Things have their Original; they are held to be in Number four, <hi>viz.</hi> Fire, Air, Water, Earth; Since that there is none born into the World but their bodies do participate of all theſe four Elements, and theſe cauſe all Alteration, and Change by Reaſon of theſe four Elements, becauſe of their changing and ſhifting one with the other, therefore no Man ſtands at one ſtay, but he is either growing Rich or Poor, in Health or Sickneſs.</p>
            <p>Now when theſe four Elements can be weighed in the Balances of Uprightneſs, there can be no Sickneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the Heat to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſway the Cold, or the Cold to be prevalent, or over-power the Heat.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The Cauſe of Sickneſs is when thoſe four Elements are une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually balanced, <hi>viz.</hi> if Heat be moſt prevalent, then it cauſeth Choler, and extream high Fevers; if Cold be, then Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Moiſt Humours.</p>

            <p>This is the way that our Vital ſpirits ſtrive for us, and againſt us, ſo they borrow one from the other, and change this World of four Elements, which is produced out of the two inward Worlds, and is a Glaſs of them, wherein Light and Darkneſs, Good and Evil, are mixt; It is not Eternal, but hath both a beginning and ending, meant of Heaven, which comes out of the midſt of the Water, <hi>viz.</hi> of Mercury, whence ariſeth the Male and Female Kind in the Spirit of the outward World, that is the Male in the Fiery Mercury, and the Female in the Watery.</p>
            <p>This Separation was made all over in every thing, to the end the Fiery ſhould deſire and long for the Watery, and the Watery for the Fiery, that ſo there might be a deſire and love between them in the Light of Nature, from which the Conjunction ariſeth; therefore the Fiery Mercury, <hi>viz.</hi> The over-flowing Word, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates it ſelf according both to the Fire and Water-nature of the Light, and thence comes both the Male and Female kind in all things, both Animals and Vegetables.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:105539:8"/>In the third days Work, the Fiery and Watery Mercury entred again into Compoſition or Mixture, and Embraced one another, wherein the Salnitre, <hi>viz,</hi> the Separator in the Earth, brought forth Graſs, Plants and Trees, and that of the firſt Generation and Production between Male and Female.</p>
            <p>In the fourth days Work the Fiery Mercury brought forth his Fruit, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt Eſſence on Higher Powers, or Vertue of Life; then the four Elements, and it is in the Elements, of it the Stars were made.</p>
            <p>In the Fifth days Work, the <hi>ſpiritus Mundi, viz.</hi> the Soul of rhe World, opened it ſelf in the firſt Eſſence, it is here meant of the Life of the Fiery and Watery Mercury, wherein God Created all Beaſts, Fiſhes, Fowl, and Worms, every one from its own peculiar property of the Divine Mercury.</p>
            <p>Here you ſee how the Eternal Principles have moved themſelves according to Evil and Good, for there are Evil and Good Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Created, every thing as the Mercury, <hi>viz.</hi> the Seperator, and yet every kind of life hath its Original, in this Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from which it is that all Creatures in their kind or property love one another.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth days Work God Created Man; for in the ſixth day the Underſtanding to the Life opened its ſelf out of the Fiery Mercury, and that is out of the inward ground.</p>
            <p>God Created them in his Likeneſs, out of the three Principles, and made them Images, and breathed into them the Underſtanding Fiery Mercury, <hi>viz.</hi> according to Time and Eternity, ſo he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Living and Underſtanding Soul.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. What is the Object of the Digeſtive Faculty.</head>
            <p>THe four Adminiſtring Vertues are, Attractive, Digeſtive, Retentive, and Expulſive.</p>
            <p>But the Digeſtive Faculty is the principal of them all, and the other like Footmen and Handmaids to attend it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:105539:8"/>The Attractive Faculty, draws that which it ſhould digeſt, and ſerves continually to feed and ſupply it.</p>
            <p>The Retentive Vertue retains the ſubſtance with it, till it be perfectly digeſted.</p>
            <p>The Expulſive Faculty caſteth out, and expelleth what is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous by digeſtion.</p>
            <p>I think no one will deny this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that hath but a ſpark of Reaſon, but that the Object of the Digeſtive Faculty is nothing elſe but this, <hi>viz.</hi> an earneſt deſire and eagerneſs after thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Things of Nature it ſelf, or Vital parts of the Bodies after ſolid Bodies, which are digeſtable or agreeable to its ſelf, and ſo joyn with its Spirit, from whence that old ſaying may be made good, <hi>What is one Mans Meat, is another Mans Poyſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this my good friend <hi>William Bacon</hi> comes very nigh, which is the trueſt ſentence in all his Book.</p>
            <p>In theſe material matters, <hi>viz.</hi> the digeſtive Faculty or Vertue wherein lyeth the Ground-work of the Bodies of Mankind; for when this Vertue or Digeſtive Faculty is debillitated, both Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vitals and Body decay, and alſo the Fundamental parts on which Phyſitians whet their wits on, <hi>viz.</hi> in ſearching out for ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dicines and Spirits as to ſtrengthen and renew the digeſtive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, things which will beſt agree and ſuit with the Vital Spirits.</p>
            <p>For if a ſick Perſon take never ſo much nouriſhment into his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, it will not nouriſh the Body, or Spirits, but hurt and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the ſame, and turn to Corruption: For prevention of which diſaſtre, incident to moſt men, I will here lay down a few <hi>Regulae Salutares,</hi> or wholſome Rules of Dyet for advice, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. V. Whether there may be an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Medicine, or not.</head>
            <p>MR. <hi>Bacon</hi> declares thus. According to my Hypotheſis, I conceive there may be; for if there be but one formal Cauſe of Diſeaſes, and alſo to prove it ſo, becauſe in Womens Cauſes: for he tells us, that the ſame Medicine which preventeth Miſcrrriages, the ſame to turn the Child in the Mothers Womb, and to bring it away; and truly, ſays he, I have a Medecine of mine own may well be called <hi>Panaceas,</hi> and beſides it may well deſerve the Name of <hi>Polyaceas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt Anſwer Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> plainly, that he doth not underſtand the Bodies of men or Phyſick. I cannot compare him to any thing, but that great <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who deluded the People by a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon which he brought up, and trained to take Peaſe out of his Ear, and ſo made the People believe that it was an Angel from Heaven which informed him of all Tranſactions, and by that means he was worſhipped as a God.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis convenient to give ſome Reaſons to convince the World that there is no ſuch Medicine as a <hi>Panaceas,</hi> or Univerſal Medicine for almoſt all Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſome ſlender Arguments, <hi>viz.</hi> Are all Mens Children of one Subſtance and Conſtitution? or can one Pair of Shooes ſerve one Pair of Feet? And alſo of all the multitude of People in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105539:9"/>
World, are not each of them diſcernable one from another? ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you may ſee two will reſemble one the other at firſt ſight, but bring them together, and diſcern them both with a ſtrict Eye, and you ſhall ſoon perceive a great alteration.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay that there may be an Univerſal Medicine in caſe of an Univerſal Diſtemper, as Peſtilence, Small-pox, Feavers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which generally happens in Cities, Towns, and Countries. No, there cannot be any Univerſal Medicinal Rules for one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſon: For it is well and often obſerved in the time of the Plague, ſome are taken with a Giddineſs in the Head, ſome a Pain in the Side, ſome no Pain at all before they fall down dead: ſome Perſons have the Sore break out in one place, ſome in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And ſo in all other general D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſeaſes, which will be tedious here to nominate, which may tend all to one Diſtemper. The Reaſons why it is ſo, I will give you elſe-where. Alſo it is well known that the four Complexions do not agree one with the other; for what is good to Cure the Sanguine, is prejudicial to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy: Experience tells me, that a ſmall Portion will purge the Sanguine Man, but a double Portion will hardly purge the Melancholy man, becauſe his Nerves are very cloſe. I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and do very well know, that many loſe their Lives by the Deluſions of ſuch new Fellows, and Pretenders to an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Medicine.</p>
            <p>Some have a good Receipt for the Pox; Some have a good Receipt for a Feaver; Some have a good Receipt for the Scurvey; Some will ſay they had it from a very learned Perſon, and that they keep it (not as it is) as a rare Jewel: I will not deny but that it may be good to its kind, but it may want a true Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I have Experience that many dye with the Running of the Reins and Pox, becauſe they put their Lives into the Hands of ſuch Men that do not underſtand the nature of their Bodies, for it is well known by Woful Experience, that theſe Diſtempers break out ſeveral ways according to the Nature and Conſtitution of the Bodies of men and Women: For in ſome it remains in the Secret Places, in ſome Perſons in the Head, and in other ſome in the Legs, and Shin-Bones. This one Argument ſhould be enough to Convince the Ignorant, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſeveral Natures being mixt together, ſhould make ſo great a War and Diſturbance in the bodies
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105539:10"/>
of Men and Women. Some Seed is very hot, and ſome very cold, and by conſequence your own Reaſon will tell you, that what is good for one Body, is ſometimes prejudicial to another. There may be an Univerſal and Nutrimental aſſiſtance to the Sick, <hi>viz.</hi> good Cordials, and the Quinteſſence of good things, and theſe the Vitals and Digeſtive Faculty eagerly ſuck in, and revive and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh more than ordinary; as in Cold, Fire is an Univerſal help and aſſiſtance: But this cannot be taken in a Phyſical ſenſe.</p>
            <p>God by his Providence hath ſufficiently furniſhed us with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Things, both for Nouriſhment, and Phyſical Uſes, known to all; but ſtill they want the true application thereof; and if it were not ſo, Men would be very unwiſe to beſtow ſo many Pounds in educating their Sons, and bringing them up to underſtand Things of this Nature or the Little World.</p>
            <p>I am here obliged to give you ſome Account why it is ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to know the Humour abounding, and perpetual motion of Mans Body, I have ſhewn already how the Bodies of Mankind are nouriſhed and guided in the firſt Chapter, and therefore ſhall not rehearſe here again; but begin thus:</p>
            <p>The Natural Faculty and Vertue reſide in the Liver to nouriſh the Body, and is diſperſed through the Body by the Veins.</p>
            <p>From this are bred four particular Humours, <hi>viz.</hi> Blood, Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Phlegm, and Melancholy: Blood is made of Meat perfectly Concocted; it is by a third Concoction tranſmitted into Fleſh, the ſuperfluity of it into Seed, its Receptacle is the Veins, by which it is diſperſed through the Body.</p>
            <p>Choler is made of Meat more thin, perfectly Concocted, it is the ſpume or froth of Blood, Cleanſeth all the Humours, heats the Body, and nouriſheth the Apprehenſion as the Blood doth the Judgment; it fortifies the Attractive Faculty, as Blood doth the Digeſtive, and moveth Man to Activity and Valour; its Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle is the Gall.</p>
            <p>Phlegm is made of Meat not perfectly Digeſted, it ſo fortifies the Vertue Expulſive, as makes it ſlippery and fit for Ejection; it fortifies the Brain by its con<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſimilitude with it: yet it ſpoils ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion by its Antipathy, the Heart thereby ſuſtaining it, and the whole Body from the Fiery Effects, with continual motion; its Receptacle is the Lungs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:105539:10"/>Melancholy is the Sedement of Blood, fortifying the Retentive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and memory, and makes them ſober and ſtedfaſt for ſtudy, ſtays the unbridled toys and fooleries of Luſtful Thoughts, and reduces them home to the Centre; it is like a Grave Counſellor to the whole Body, its reſident place is the Spleen.</p>
            <p>Blood is the chief of all theſe four humors, yet without the other three, <hi>viz.</hi> Choler, Phlegm, and Melancholy man connot ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe four Humours, are the four Elements, which mans Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is guided by, which I treated on in the Firſt Part of this Book.</p>
            <p>Reader, view over the Nature and Conſiſtence of theſe four Humours or Elements, and let your Reaſon be your Guide, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one ſort of Medicine will ſerve to Conquer theſe four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: No, not if the World, and the whole Frame thereof, could ſtand or ſubſiſt with two only, as you ſee 'tis impoſſible to be, by the Firſt Part of this Book.</p>
            <p>The advice and counſel we ought to have of a Phyſitian is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Phyſick the ſick perſon ought to take.</p>
            <p>Or what dyet, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Now there is no Phyſitian, or Pretender hereunto, unleſs he is well skilled in the perpetual motion of theſe four Elements: for without this Art the Phyſitian can never ſafely judge, <hi>viz.</hi> when to purge or Evacuate, either by Potion or by Vomit, or by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Blood, or for what Humour, or by what Quantity, in all which Caſes Aſtrology preſcribes Rules: and without theſe, no one can attain to the Art of Phyſick; otherways they are but like Blind Men that grope out their way with a Staff.</p>
            <p>I have ſhewn already in the Firſt Part of this Book, that the Principles of the Elements, and Natural Bodies proceed from Fire, but the main Principles, and Beginning and Ending of the Life of mankind is taken from the Horoſcope to be the Firſt motion of Time.</p>

            <p>We ſee by Experience that the Moon placed in the Heavens at ſuch a Poſition, the Sea Flows, and at ſuch a Poſition it Ebbs: after this way may be taken the firſt beginning of life and motion of mankind, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Horoſcope and fixed ſtars, and from the ſeven Planets, <hi>viz.

            <p>A fixt Hermorphrodite is only, that which conſiſts of two parts, <hi>viz.</hi> fixed and Voluntary Body united together.</p>
            <p>The Antients tell us, that it is theſe two parts, pure and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together. It will be too large here to lay down the full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe thereof, becauſe I intend to ſatisfie the World in a ſhort time in full of this Hermorphrodite, and alſo of a ſeeming Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Fire which <hi>Mr. Bacon</hi> ſpeaks of.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Mr. Bacon</hi> is pleaſed to tell us that he can produce a fixt Hermorphrodite, which I leave to your diſcretion to judge of at preſent; but in my opinion 'tis a meet fancy, or, as they ſay, to build Caſtles in the Air.</p>

                  </gap>gyria,</hi> which is but Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation, of which there are three Principals, and Cheif Diſtinctions and Diſcriptions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is a certain Art of Extracting the Liquor of the Humid part of Things by vertue of Heat, as the Matter ſhall require, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt diſſolved into a vapour, and then condenſed again by Cold.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Diſtillation is the Art of Extracting the Spiritual and Eſſential Humidity from the Phlegmatick, or of the Phlegmatick from the Spiritual.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Diſtillation is the changing of groſs thick Bodies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a thinner, and more liquid Subſtance or Seperation of the pure Liquor, from the Impure Feces.</p>
            <p>So by this Means you may ſee what great power and dignity God hath beſtowed on mankind, as it is ſaid in the Eighth Pſalm, <hi>Thou haſt made him to have dominion in the works of thy hands</hi>; and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. where God hath appointed the ſervice of the Stars unto all people that are under Heaven, but in particular to the buſineſs we are on now, he hath made him King and Lord over three Kingdomes, <hi>viz.</hi> Vegetable, Animal, and Mineral, and by Vertue of theſe, what cannot he do? and how honourable are they that have the Command of theſe? They may command Lead into Gold, dying Plants into fruitfulneſs, the Sick into Health, Old Age into Youth, and what not? Prevail with Nature, and the fair <hi>Diana</hi> of the Philoſopher is at your ſervice. I you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevail with Nature for the faireſt of her Daughters, <hi>viz.</hi> the Mercury of Philoſophers; Yet there is another of wonderful Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as are the Eſſence and Magiſter of Philolophers, which are endowed with Riches, Honour and Health, for theſe you may more eaſily prevail with Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:105539:12"/>This Art is more noble than all other Arts and Sciences, and if it did once truly ſhine forth out of the Clouds, wherewith it is Eclipſed, it would darken all the reſt, as the Sun doth the ſtars, or at leaſt ſwallow up their Light. This is that true Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, which moſt accurately Anotomizeth Nature, and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As you ſee in the firſt Chapter, that Fire is the grand principle of Natural Bodies, ſo by Fire and Heat we are able to ſubdue hard Bodies, change and ſeparate their Souls or Spirits from their Feces, which are dull earthly mixtures, which do but hinder the Efficacy they ſhould have on ſick Bodies, but by the Art of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry, we take their pureſt part of their Bodies, which will ſooner ſhew their efficacies and power, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſupport and heal any of the four Humours which the Bodies of mankind are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by, we may by good Reaſons divide Diſeaſes into two parts, Chronick and Acute, Chronick by the Sun, Acute by the Moon; the Acute Diſeaſes may be cured in a very ſhort time, but Chronick Diſeaſes not ſo ſoon, for they proceed from Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Stoppages in Head or Viſcera, but far ſooner by our Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Medicines than thoſe of the Gallenical Way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Bacon</hi> is pleaſed to tell us, in the latter part of his book, ſtrange things, <hi>viz.</hi> that he Cures Chronick Diſeaſes, as conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Feavers, Agues, and ſuch like, in two or three Fits, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo any conſiderable Diſeaſe or Sickneſs within ſix hours; and alſo, ſaith he, all Peſtilential Feavers. Thoſe that believe this, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly muſt be of a ſtrange Faith and Opinion, as to think that Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> is able to alter the Creation of the World, and to cauſe the Signs, Circles, and Stars of Heaven, which God hath made fixed, for him to make moveable and common; ſurely not ſo: methinks he is too haſty, the only way in my Judgment is, not to diſannul, but remember and agree with that wiſe ſaying of <hi>Solomon, Tempus eſt ad omnia perpetrandra,</hi> There is a time for the doing of all things; which muſt be allowed of, for it is that which brings things to perfection.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IX. The Character of a true Medicine.</head>
            <p>SOme will ſay, How ſhall we know how to diſtinguiſh betwixt good and bad? That will be too large for me here to lay open to you all the ways to know a good Medicine from the bad; for it is well known that it is very difficult to know ſome ſorts of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines by an Oculary Judgment; therefore it lieth and conſiſteth in the honeſty and uprightneſs of the Operator, or thoſe that ſell thoſe medicines; for there are ſome who buy of Chymiſts Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines Cheaper than ordinary, and the other ſell for little profit, when they know that it is not as it ought to be: Therefore this lies and conſiſts too in Experience. Your beſt way therefore is to confide in an ingenuous and approved Chymiſt, or an honeſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, Drugſter, or the like, by which you will not fail.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more which caſts a great ſcandal upon our Medicines, <hi>viz.</hi> A miſtake of the Doctor, or by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulneſs; Firſt, in not Adminiſtring ſuch of them as ought to be, or in the quantity of the Doſe, and ſo it works not the expected Effects, for which we bear the blame. Secondly, by unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for there are many who go under the Title of Doctor, who know not what Humour or Diſeaſe they are to Cure; neither can they give an accout of what they take in hand.</p>

            <p>BY theſe three Intentions, Firſt, the prohibiting of Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, The perfecting of Reparation, and The Removing of Oldneſs. Theſe three Intentions to thoſe Operations.</p>
            <p>Firſt is the Operation upon the Spirits, that they may renew their Vigour.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is upon the Excluſion of the Air.</p>
            <p>The third is upon the Blood and Sanguine Heat.</p>
            <p>The fourth on the Juyces of the Body.</p>
            <p>The fifth upon the bowels for their extruſion of Aliment.</p>
            <p>The ſixth is upon the outward parts for their attraction of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liment.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh is upon the Aliment it ſelf for the Nutriment thereof.</p>
            <p>The eighth is upon the leaſt Act of Aſſimulation.</p>
            <p>The ninth is upon the Intineration of the parts after they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to dry.</p>
            <p>The tenth is upon the purging away of the old Juyce, and to the ſupplying it with new.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:105539:13"/>The four firſt belong to the firſt Intention; the four next to the Second; and the two laſt to the third Intention.</p>
            <p>It may be thought good to propound ſundry Remedies to the ſundry Intentions; but the choiceſt of theſe Remedies, and the order of them, is left to diſcretion: for to ſet down exactly, which of them agreeth beſt, with which Conſtitutions of Bodies, with the ſeveral Circles of Life, and how the whole practice of theſe things are to be Adminiſtred and Governed, would be too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.</p>
            <p>But it may be convenient to give a word or two, to ſhew you what a Phyſitian ought to be, and how he ought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the whole Body of Man, <hi>viz.</hi> the Ground and Caſe of all Diſeaſes in all ſorts of Bodies.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, it is well known, and undeniable, that thoſe Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that are to be underſtood Natural, their Cure is to be effected in a Natural way, and that all Diſeaſes have their Original from Super-abundancies or differency, from Heat, Coldneſs, Drought and Moiſtneſs; and he is a Phyſitian that knows which of theſe Qualities at any time abounds moſt. And alſo all Time is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured out by Motion, and that all motion hath its Original in the Heavens, by which is cauſed Life and death: For the Elementary, World is the Womb of the Elementary Creatures, both Animals, Minerals, and Vegetables.</p>
            <p>God made but one World, and yet in this one World, a Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Firſt, Elementary, which is Loweſt; Secondly, Coeleſtial, which is next above that; Thirdly, Intellectual, which is higheſt in degree.</p>
            <p>The Cauſe of all Diſeaſes is to be underſtood to be Natural, ſo alſo is their Cure to be effected in a Natural way; and if you do but conſider the Univerſe as one United Body, and Man an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy of this Body, it will ſeem ſtrange to none but to Madmen and Fools.</p>
            <p>But that the Stars ſhould have their Influences upon the Body of Man, conſidering he being an Epitomy of the Creation, muſt needs have a Coeleſtial World within himſelf; therefore all things which belong to Man, whether Sickneſs, or any thing beſides, may be taken two ways; Firſt, from the beginning of times, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Horoſcope, or the Moment of time in which Mankind
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105539:14"/>
comes into the World; Secondly, by the Decumbiture of the Sick: It is my buſineſs to treat concerning Sickneſs, and ſo it muſt be taken: No man can reaſonably deny but that the whole Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtick part of Phyſick is governed by Aſtrology, and thoſe Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians who follow <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> in making them their principal Refuge, do wiſely and commendably, it being an Art which ſhews the firſt natural beginning and proceeding of all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Mutations of all inferiour things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Phyſitians ſay that all Natural Infirmities not coming by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Accidents, prove Seeds from four Humours, <hi>viz.</hi> Choler, Blood, Phlegm, and Melancholy, which are nothing elſe but a Humidous and Vaporative ſubſtance, only differing in quality, and therefore if the quality or quantity of the Head of the Fountain be changed from its uſual courſe, the Streams ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent and belonging muſt conſequently be altered, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in quantity or quality; ſo it comes to paſs that the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral quantity or quality of the Influences of the Moon, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with the different Influences of the other Planets, doth likewiſe produce an alteration in ſome of the four Humours, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame to augment above Nature, or to diminiſh, or be corrupted or connexed contrary to the firſt Natural Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Elementary Humours of the Body, which cauſeth Sickneſs and Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian Reader, this may ſatisfie you what a Phyſitian ought to be, and how he ought to Cure Diſeaſes, unleſs he will go hand over head, and in the dark, groping out his way like a blind man, and ſo is not certain whether he Kill or Cure.</p>
            <p>Seeing it is ſo, a Word of Advice to the Sick, Deceive not your ſelves in aſſuring to your ſelves Cure by thoſe many deluding Perſons who tell you they have an Univerſal Medicine, and which far exceedeth all others: Firſt of all, you are not only at the loſs of your Time, your money, but which is worſe, and moſt pretious, your Life; they alſo pretend to you that they can do ſtrange things, as to alter the motion of the Heavens, and to cure Chronick diſeaſes in an inſtant; the one as probable as the other, and as much to be credited: Alas, 'tis meer mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and folly to give car to ſuch Perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:105539:14"/>It is not to be denied, but that there are many rare and good Receipts in the Hands of many People at this day: But whoever thou art that followeth the Receipts and Ways of thoſe pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſons I afore have mentioned, muſt needs put thy ſelf to a great hazard; for perchance they may work their expected ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and perchance not, the conſtitution of one Body being more eaſie to be wrought upon than another, and ſo conſequently greatly different.</p>
            <p>Our Nation is too much inclined to theſe Phantaſms, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny we have in every corner crying out, <hi>A good Receipt for the Scurvy, A rare Receipt for the Dropſie, Pox,</hi> &amp;c. But how few of theſe perform their promiſed Effects? and how few are cured of thoſe general Diſtempers which reign in our Land? For in ſtead of curing and abating a Diſtemper, they rather the more increaſe and augment it, by reaſon the riſe and original of it is not well pryed, ſearched, and lookt into. As for the Scurvy, a diſeaſe which ſeizes on the Body of Man by ſeveral ways and <hi>Items,</hi> ſo accordingly ought it to be workt upon as you ſee the perſon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and as you ſee the diſtemper ſeize him, which certainly muſt be the beſt way.</p>
            <p>Seeing it is ſo, that the original of a diſeaſe muſt be firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into, before a man (as he ought to do) proceed any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let me invite you to come to me, or to any other that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands the Elementary qualities of the Body of mankind; for without that, not any one perſon deſerves the Name or Title of Phyſitian, which many now adays aſſume undeſervedly unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: there is an old ſaying, it ought not to be forgot, <hi>The Diſeaſe once known, is half cured,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A Word of Comfort to thoſe who are under affliction: Here they may have a ſpeedy help after a regular way of adminiſtring Phyſick, and beſides a certain accompt of their Diſtempers, and their riſe, approved Medicines, according to their ſeveral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and Conditions and Humours of their Bodies, which (as I ſaid before) being once known, a man may the more eaſily, and with greater hopes of proſpering, give his helping hand.</p>
            <p>I need not enlarge much more, for I think you all have had ſufficient experience of Medicines compoſed by thoſe many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful perſons, and how many lie languiſhing at this day in a very
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105539:15"/>
ſad condition: I will go to one particular, that is the <hi>POX,</hi> for which they think they can effect no Cure without a Doſe of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, which in ſtead of clearing the Body, and diſperſing the Poyſon, afflicts the Brain, and ſo conſequently at laſt the whole Body with a greater and far more incurable Calamity, which is not my way of proceeding, as I hope you will all in good time make experience; therefore thoſe I deſire to repair to me, who are afflicted with any of theſe following Diſtempers, which by Gods help and my own diligence I hope to cure; namely,
