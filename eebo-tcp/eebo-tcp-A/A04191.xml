            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>Ribera</hi> and <hi>Lorinus.</hi> Now as to vſe the benefit of a truth known and teſtified is alwayes lawfull, ſo in this caſe it is to vs moſt expedient, almoſt neceſſarie. For either I did not rightly apprehend whiles I read it, or at leaſt now remember not, how the Schooleman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooues the ſtumbling blocke which he had placed in the very entry to this Creed, [If <hi>to beleeue in God</hi> be as much as <hi>to put truſt or confidence in Him</hi>; by exacting a profeſſion of this Creed at all mens mouths, we ſhall enforce a great many to profeſſe a lie.] For of ſuch as not onely out of ordinarie charitie, but vpon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar probabilities, we may ſafely acquit from actuall Atheiſme or contradicting Infidelitie, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber doe not put their truſt or confidence in God; this being the marke whereat the beliefe of novices muſt ayme, not the firſt ſtep they are to make in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe. And for my ſelfe, (vntill I be better inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) if a poore deiected ſoule ſhould come vnto me with a complaint of his diſtruſt or diffidence, I would not inſtantly vrge him to make proclamation of his truſt in God againſt his conſcience; for this were to <hi>quench ſmoaking flax,</hi> by violent blowing thoſe weake and ſmoothered ſparkles, which ſhould be charily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived by milde and gentle breathing. The contrarie advice on my part, or practiſe on his, ſhould not want an approved patterne; To confeſſe his preſent vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, whiles he prayes for future increaſe of ſuch weak

beliefe, as he may ſafely make profeſſion of. And, as the fire once throughly kindled, burſts out of its owne accord into a laſting flame: ſo beliefe, once inwardly planted, wil naturally bring forth ſtedfaſt confidence, without farther plantation or ſuperaddition of any new beliefe or perſwaſion. Many beginning their faith the other way, may for a long time be ſtifly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that <hi>they beleeue in God,</hi> when in deed they doe not truely beleeue him, his Word, or his mercies. Theſe no man firmly can beleeue, but he ſhall aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeue in <hi>him,</hi> yea put his whole truſt and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his <hi>goodneſſe.</hi> Howbeit, as much as now I write, would hardly be permitted me, in moſt mens hearing, to ſpeake, without this or the like interpella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, [Shall we then beleeue in Saints or good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, becauſe we aſſuredly beleeue there be ſuch na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Or ſhall we ſay the wicked Angels beleeue in God, becauſe they beleeue his being more firmely then we can doe, and know his word as clearely?]</p>
               <p n="3">3. That inferior ſubiects ſalute not every officer in the Court after the ſame manner they doe the Prince, is not becauſe they ſee not the one as perfectly as the other: rather the more fully they diſcerne them by one and the ſame inerring ſight, the better they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the different reſpect which is due to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall preſences. Angels we beleeue are miniſtring ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, appointed to execute Gods will, whoſe maieſtie they adore, as fervently as we doe; putting greater confidence in his mercie then we can doe; even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their knowledge of it is more cleare, their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of it more vndoubted.

Againe, admitting truſt or affiance in God to receiue continuall increaſe, according to the growth of our beliefe of his <hi>word</hi> or <hi>being</hi>; That Divells albeit they beleeue or know both more clearely then the beſt of vs, ſhould notwithſtanding perpetually remaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any truſt or affiance in Him or his mercies; no man vpon iuſt examination of the difference between their collapſed eſtate and ours, can deeme ſtrange or doubtfull, much leſſe a doubt, as ſome in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings ſuppoſe, inſoluble, vnleſſe we make truſt or affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in God, eſſentially to difference our beliefe of <hi>his being,</hi> from theirs. If the Kings Maieſtie ſhould proclaime a generall pardon to a number of knowne rebells, and vow execution of iudgement without mercie vpon ſome principall offenders, which had maliciouſly and cunningly ſeduced their ſimplicitie: I ſuppoſe his will and pleaſure equally manifeſted to both, and ſo beleeved, would as much diſhearten the one, as encourage the other to relie vpon his clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Such altogether notwithſtanding, is the caſe of men and wicked Angells: the one beleeues Chriſt tooke the womans ſeed, and therefore cannot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch wilfull miſtruſt of the promiſe of life as was in his firſt parents vnto Gods threats of death; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of redemption by the eternall ſacrifice: The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as firmly beleeue, or rather evidently know, that Chriſt in no wiſe tooke the Angelicall nature, and without this ground, the better they beleeue his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, the leſſe are their hopes of their owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>

Now to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe proofes of leſſe truth or perſpicuitie then is the matter to be prooved, is but to eclipſe the evidence of it, (which, of it ſelfe, would in due ſeaſon ſhine to calme and purified meditations) or to provoke ſuch as delight in trying maſteries of ſtrength or skill in arguing, to aſſault truths otherwiſe ſafe enough from all attempts, did they not ſee them ſo weakly guarded vpon preparation. Thus the diſcovery of timorous lookes, or meane proviſion, often incourageth baſe and cowardly theeues to encounter paſſengers, whoſe number or preſence, they durſt not behold, if they did not betray themſelues.

I will not in the firſt place vſe the benefit of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Schoolemens labours, to proue, by ſtrength of ſpeculatiue reaſon, there is a God; although they bring abundance of reaſons, all irrefragable to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous well diſpoſed contemplator: but, vnto ſuch, this principle is of all others moſt cleare and evident in it ſelfe, as being moſt deeply implanted in the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable nature</hi>; not acquired by vſe of ſenſe or obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The beſt method, in my opinion, to prevent Atheiſme, or cure an Atheiſt, would be to hold the <hi>Meane</hi> betwixt the contemplatiue Philoſopher, and the practicall Phyſitian. I haue heard of ſome ſo far over-growne with melancholy, that they would eate no meate; conceiting, either they had no mouths, or that their teeth were as ſoft as butter. For a Phyſitian, to haue attempted remoovall of ſuch fancies, by force of reaſon, or importunate ſuggeſtion of contrary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, had beene <hi>cum ratione inſamre,</hi> to haue prooved himſelfe as mad, as his patients were melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. The readieſt way (as not long agoe hath beene experienced) to relieue parties thus affected, is, for a time rather to aſſent vnto, then contradict them; that ſo, by promiſing a remedie to the ſuppoſed maladie, an entrance may be made to purge the humour which breeds the falſe imagination. And he that would cure an ordinary Atheiſt, ſhould, as not ſooth him in his impietie, ſo not directly or fiercely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter him with ſyllogiſticall proofes, or diſcourſes metaphyſicall; for ſo (<hi>aegreſcit medendo</hi>) he will grow ſicker by ſeeing the medicine: but labour rather, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to vndermine the internall diſpoſition whence ſuch vnhallowed imaginations ſpring.

graine is but a ſpirituall madneſſe, ariſing from the abundance of ſuch diſtemper in the ſoule, as in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion anſwers to melancholy in the body.

The bent of their nature did ſway a larger compaſſe, and (to vſe the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians dialect) deſcribed a greater circle by it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall motions.

That the reſurrection (though this truth to corrupt nature ſeemes moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult) is not impoſſible, yea that it is impoſſible there ſhould not be a reſurrection or iudgement after death, may be demonſtrated; but that the wicked ſhall riſe to torments, the righteous to ioy &amp; glory everlaſting, is a ſtreame of life which naturally ſprings not within the circuit of the heavens; it muſt be infuſed from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue.</p>

Whiles ſenſible obiects (for example, <hi>colours</hi>) are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, they grant a reſultance of ſuch a forme or ſtampe of them in the eye, as the ſeale imprinteth in the wax, which notwithſtanding ſtraight way vaniſheth with the removall of the obiect, onely the ſenſitiue facultie (in their Philoſophy) being thus farre acquainted with them, can tranſforme it ſelfe at its pleaſure into the ſame likeneſſe againe, as a cunning Actor can imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate any mans motions, ſpeech, or geſture, whom he hath heard or ſeene, and the more he converſeth with him, the better will his imitation be. This manner of producing <hi>phantaſmes</hi> I muſt confeſſe is moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the vſuall manner of producing effects more reall, which haue no ſenſible forme or ſhape. Thus when one <hi>yeawnes,</hi> another <hi>yeawnes,</hi> and many moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons begun in one, excite the like in others, not by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of their formes, but by meere imitation. The bloud of many beaſts will riſe at the ſight of red colours, whoſe formes or images cannot be imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon it, becauſe more red than they. But bloud, being like them, it is excited by their preſence or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation made in the eye; and ſo may this <hi>forme,</hi> or repreſentation it ſelfe be onely excited by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the reall obiect. In like manner may the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all motion or repreſentation of the <hi>phantaſme,</hi> excite the intellectuall <hi>notion</hi> anſwering to it. For, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall facultie, being more actiue then ſenſe, may from the vertuall ſimilitude which it hath with all things, put on the actuall ſhape of any which ſhall be

repreſented, or ſuggeſted to it. The manner we may conceiue to be ſuch as if the eye could repreſent any colour being once named, without the preſence of a reall obiect. By this declaration we may conceiue how the <hi>phantaſmes</hi> doe raiſe a conceit of an higher or different nature, then they formally repreſent. As red colours doe not onely produce their owne reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance in the eye, but withall ſtir or moue the bloud; ſo attentiue inſpection of ſenſible effects moſt exactly repreſented in the <hi>phantaſie,</hi> may ingender a conceit of an inviſible and latent cauſe, which we cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly figure or expreſſe, and yet be more raviſhed with the conſideration of it, then with the exacteſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations poſſible of that which cauſed it. The manner of our delight in this caſe is wrought as it were by a ſecret ſympathie or <hi>contract</hi> not apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as ſhall herafter be declared. The like <hi>ſymptomati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> conceits oftimes accompany the <hi>formall</hi> repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of meere ſenſe; as ſight of the Wolfe imprints with his bodily ſhape a terror in the ſilly Lambe, whereof there can be no diſtinct or formall repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.

He that neither dreames nor ſtirres whiles he ſleepes by night, thinkes he is but newly lain downe when he awakes; whereas he that lies waking the ſame time, would thinke a ſhort night longer than a ſummers day. How the yeare goes about we could not tell, but by the motions of the heavens; what a yeare is we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not better expreſſe, than by the Sunnes revolution from ſome point of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> to the ſame; nor what a day is but by its circumvolution in a part of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall,</hi> or other parallel circle.

Or though both clockes and houre-glaſſes moved twice as ſwiftly, as now they doe, time would be the ſame, but ſo could not the diſtinction or apprehenſion of it be to vs, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we knew in what proportion their ſwiftneſſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; certaine withall that they had an equall and conſtant courſe. If vpon their variation or vnconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie we ſhould haue recourſe vnto the motions of our owne ſoules or bodies, or keepe a perpetuall account of time (as for a ſpace Muſicians doe) with our hands; theſe would deceiue vs. The ſame motions or bodily agitations ſeeme much longer to men well nigh wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, than to ſuch as are luſtie or freſh. Solitarineſſe without corporall imployment ſeemes long and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to illiterate ſoules, ſo doth vaine iangling or toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings reall or verball to minds bent for contemplation, becauſe in this latter caſe, men are enforced to take too deepe notice of externall motions; in the former, of their owne vnſetled cogitations or working phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies. All ſickneſſes, paines, or eager expectations, whether of releaſe from evills, or of accompliſhing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement deſires or hopes, doe double or treble the length of time in our conceit according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of paines or pleaſure felt or expected. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is becauſe the notice of every ſeverall motion is more deepe and pearcing, and the motions are in a manner multiplied. In ſickneſſe there is a conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt nature and the offenſiue humour, both which haue their ſeverall ſwayes or motions. In expectation likewiſe the ſoule is moued two wayes, and being thus affected the difference betwixt our conceit of times length, and theirs that paſſe the time in ſport

and merriment, is much what ſuch as is betweene their progreſſes or menſurations which runne the ſame race for length, the one directly and by a ſtreight plaine way in ſummer, the other by way of indenture, or in winter, or in a deepe ſoyle. All theſe argue time to haue a nature of its owne diſtinct from motion more abſtract and immateriall. And if we conſider it onely indefinitely or vnder the generall conceit of <hi>ſpace</hi> contradiſtinct to <hi>diſtance locall,</hi> the conceit of it is as familiar &amp; obvious as of any thing ſenſible, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to define what it is diſtinctly, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> who hath ſifted this point as accurately as any Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher could doe, well obſerues.</p>

                  <hi>Poet.</hi> But who hath ſeene his bodily ſhape at any time in a raging Sea, or ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſtreame, although that concourſe or efficiency, which our faces or bodies afford to the production of their owne images or ſimilitudes, be in all places, and all times the ſame. So is the irradiation or agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the actiue vnderſtanding in the Philoſophers opinion perpetuall, nor works it by fits or glimering. So we were alwayes alike apt to learne or apprehend, it is alwayes alike readie to make vs vnderſtand. For as nothing can be weary of its eſſence, ſo neither can the intellectiue facultie be of this its proper operation, which as the Philoſopher thinkes, is the ſelfe ſame with its eſſence. The proper eſſence and operation of it, is to diffuſe theſe intellectuall rayes or ingraffed <hi>notions</hi> of truth: but theſe we alwayes apprehend not, we remember not their apprehenſions, becauſe the <hi>paſsiue</hi> or <hi>faſhionable</hi> vnderſtanding (which ſome take to be all one with the <hi>phantaſie</hi>) is ſubiect to change and corruption, often ſo ill diſpoſed, that either no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations are made in it, or els ſuch as are falſe and vnperfect. This I take to be the Philoſophers meaning in theſe words; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. To thinke he ſhould here giue a reaſon, why our ſoules after ſeparations from their bodies reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber not what they knew in them, would make his ſoule I am perſwaded, yet to ſmile, could it but reade the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters gloſſes vpon theſe wordes to this purpoſe.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7903:63"/>
Not to inſiſt vpon his authoritie, nor to wrangle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his particular meaning in this place, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he purpoſely left obſcure and doubtfull, all that can be gathered from his reaſon or from experience is this, that the humane <hi>ſoule</hi> hath a perpetuall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion independent of the body, which ſufficiently proues it to be immortall; but ſo is not humane knowledge, becauſe in the production of it the ſoule muſt be patient as well as agent, and doth not worke vpon it ſelfe directly, but by repercuſſion or reflection. And ſeeing theſe are not wrought without ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe of the <hi>phantaſie,</hi> whoſe operations as it ſelfe is, are ſubiect to corruption and change, our <hi>Intellection</hi> whether it be made by imitation or impreſſion of <hi>phantaſmes</hi> refined, cannot be perpetuall or immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That potentialitie or aptitude which the ſoule hath to be linckt, and made one ſubſtance with the body, muſt needs abate ſome part of that perfection which is in Angels. They are pure <hi>actes</hi> and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally apprehend their owne perpetuall operations: the ſoule of man hath an immortall deſire to doe the like, but is held downe by the earthly and mortall body, whoſe motions and vnruly appetites doe ſtill counter-ſway theſe inbred deſires, which the ſoule hath to contemplate her ſelfe, as containing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed <hi>notions,</hi> or ſimilitude of all things. Hence is that which the ſame Philoſopher elſwhere excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerues, that <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>prudence</hi> doe in a manner voluntarily reſult from the ſtay or ſetled eſtate of the ſoule without variation. Now theſe diſturbances, or turbulent motions of the ſoule which hinder know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7903:64"/>
ariſe for the moſt part from alliance with the body, or from the allurements of externall ſenſes. For his reaſon, as we ſaid, before when bodily calamitie or affliction cut off the hopes of temporary or ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all pleaſure, and vntie or burſt the ſtrings which held vs faſt vnto the pomps or vanities of the world: the ingraffed <hi>notions</hi> of Gods power or providence, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall dictates of conſcience, haue libertie and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to <hi>notifie</hi> and expreſſe themſelues. Then as <hi>Plinie</hi> ſayth, we know our ſelues to be but men, and our ſoules begin to vnderſtand themſelues, and their former errors; they now ſee what precious ſeede was ſowne in them, ſo they had not ſuffered it to be ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and choaked with worldly cares, nor ſuffred it to ſtarue by nouriſhing vaine hopes of reaping for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine pleaſures. And yet even whiles the reaſonable ſoule condemnes the ſenſes for hiding this ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treaſure of <hi>ingraffed knowledge,</hi> ſhee cannot diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it without their helpe; the repreſentation is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes effected by ſome concourſe of the <hi>phantaſie,</hi> in which it is firſt begun, as bodily paine or maladie oftimes manifeſtes it ſelfe not in the part which is principally affected, but in ſome other which hath ſome neere bond of nature, or peculiar ſympathie with it. And the former fault, to ſpeake the truth, is not in ſenſe or <hi>phantaſie,</hi> but in the reaſonable ſoule which ſuffers her ſelfe to be miſled by theſe her ſervants, whoſe right nurture or <hi>making</hi> for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out latent truthes, is in her power. But as the <hi>French</hi> by often vſing the <hi>Switzers</hi> ſervice vpon ſome eſpeciall occaſions, were ſometime <note n="*" place="margin">Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</note> ſaid to haue brought themſelues to ſuch a paſſe, that they could
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7903:64"/>
not manage any warre without them: ſo the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoule being vpon neceſſity beholding to externall ſenſes for perceiving obiects ſenſible, by too much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying vpon their informations difenables her ſelfe for more noble imployments. The ſtrict <hi>vxorius</hi> confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy which is too oft, enters with theſe two groſſe ſenſes <hi>touch</hi> and <hi>taſte,</hi> and her too much familiaritie with their adherents, vtterly diſſolues her natiue cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency or acquaintance with intellectuall or more noble eſſences, which are of the ſame deſcent and progenie with her. Thus abuſed or miſinformed as great men are vſually by their ſervants, ſhe neither can deſire, conceiue, nor entertaine truth ſpirituall, but after a faſhion meerely carnall. The originall or manner of theſe preiudices wherewith this image of God is by the ſuggeſtions of ſenſe ſurpriſed, are but ſuch as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon experience witneſſeth to be moſt rife in every particular ſenſe: the right frame or conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whoſe organs, alwayes ſuppoſe a vacuitie of thoſe reall qualities, whereof they are ſole competent, and ſhould be indifferent judges. For if any one of theſe qualities haue once gotten poſſeſſion, and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it ſelfe in the organ, it excludes all the reſt, or makes what compoſition it liſtes, often charging the externall ſenſe with that, whereof it ſelfe is ſole cauſe. As if any groſſe or malignant humor haue incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it ſelfe into the tongue or palate, it either quite takes away all taſte of meates or drinkes, or makes ſuch as are indeede ſweete and pleaſant, ſeeme iuſt ſuch as it ſelfe is. Or if any tincture of brighter co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, whereon we haue long gazed, ſticke in our eyes, it either dazells our ſight, or makes vs thinke other
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7903:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
obiects to be of the ſame hew with that whence it was taken. In like manner doth the contagion of every ſenſe, or ſtudies vnto whoſe pleaſures we are partially or too much addicted, diſſolue that aequilibrium or vertuall proportion, which our ſoules haue with all things, and whereby they are qualified for vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their natures, eſſences, or properties. Bewitching delight in Mathematicall ſpeculations (though of all ſenſibles theſe be moſt abſtract and immateriall) hath beene as a falſe glaſſe to pervert the ſight of ſome in matters philoſophicall, and cauſe them tranſforme materiall naturall bodies into imaginary or motion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe figures. From this roote ſpring all tranſformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the divine nature, or attributes, whether in the Heathen, the Romaniſts, or true profeſſors.

Thus much onely was here to be praemiſed, That our ingraffed <hi>notions</hi> of <hi>Gods goodneſſe</hi> or inclinations either natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are, or by evill cuſtome become indefinite and indiſtinct, more flexible to goodneſſe ſenſible, than to intellectuall; to carnall, than to ſpirituall; alwayes apt to ſettle, or continue their courſe, where they finde firſt iſſue or vent, and to be moſt addicted to their olde acquaintance.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat pit wherein <hi>Democritus</hi> imagined Truth to be buried, was queſtionleſſe the heart of man. Not much vnlike vnto his riddle, was the ſaying of the wiſe King; <hi>Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but a man of vnderſtanding will draw it out.</hi> Prov. 20. verſ. 5. But he muſt be a man of vnderſtanding indeed, that can draw any conſultations God-ward out of his owne heart.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Senſe,</hi> ſaith the Philoſopher, is of Particulars; and every Particular in his language, though preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſenſe, but as one, includes an heape, or cluſter of ingredients, or circumſtances; every one in nature much different from other. We ſee the quantitie, the colour, ſhape, and proportion of <hi>Socrates,</hi> with other adherents not meere <hi>Socrates,</hi> or the Individuall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>eſſence.</hi> Senſe then is of concretes or congeſts, not of abſtracts, or eſſences, whether apprehended as vniverſall, indefinite, or ſingularized. Thoſe things
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7903:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we are properly ſaid to <hi>vnderſtand,</hi> whoſe natures, or entities are repreſented vnto vs as pure, and immixt, and as it were diſſolued from the bundle, wherein they were apprehended onely in groſſe by ſenſe. Whatſoever we diſcerne can be truely avouched, or denied of any thing thus conſidered apart, and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by its owne proper bounds, muſt needs be avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, or denied of every like nature ſo conſidered. And ſeeing things are thus conſidered by the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding onely, to whom this power of ventilating, and ſifting <hi>Phantaſmes,</hi> or of diſſolving, or ſevering thoſe combinations which delude ſenſe, properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs; Intellection, or vnderſtanding is ſaid to be of Vniverſalls, not of Particulars. Every nature thus abſtracted, or conceived onely by it ſelfe, without any forraigne adherents, or admixture, ſerues as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon meaſure for comprehending all of the ſame kinde, and is apt to <hi>found</hi> an vniverſall Rule, or defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition. The falſhood, or imperfection of all Rules ſuppoſe ſome precedent defect in the abſtracting, or diſſolving the parts, or ingredients of ſenſitiue repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations. Many things we cannot rightly, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly conceiue but by compoſition of <hi>phantaſmes,</hi> which can never be rightly compounded, vnleſſe they be firſt rightly diſſevered, or abſtracted. Sometimes we may attribute that to one nature, or ingredient, which is proper to ſome other, linked with it in the ſame ſubiect, but not diſcerned; and then the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is falſe, or true onely <hi>ex Accidente; vt Muſicus aedificat</hi>; as if a man ſhould thinke a Metrapolitane ſhould doe that as privie Counſellor, which belongs vnto his ſpirituall place, becauſe the actions of both
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7903:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
kindes proceede from one and the ſame partie, who notwithſtanding is indued with a twofold authoritie. Sometimes againe we may attribute that to one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, or ingredient, which ioyntly iſſues from two, or more. And in this caſe the Rule failes, when the Conjunction is diſſolved. As if we ſhould thinke the Moone ſhould alwayes be Eclips't when it is in the full, or when after exact calculation it is found to haue the ſame diſtance from the Sunne, which had beene noted by vs in two or three former Eclipſes. For equality of the Moones diſtance from the Sunne, vnleſſe it fall out in the <hi>Eclipticke line,</hi> is not ſufficient to inferre this effect, if an Eclipſe, or deficiency may properly be tearmed an effect. This is a rule moſt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall, and tranſcendent [<hi>That every Rule which holdes true in ſome caſes, and failes in others, is taken from ſenſitiue obſervations, or preſentments not perfectly ſifted, or abſtracted, whoſe ingredients notwithſtanding diſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themſelues in thoſe particulars, wherein they faile.</hi>] Thus <hi>Hippocrates</hi> Rules of Windes, and Waters held true in thoſe Regions, wherein he made his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but not in ours: becauſe the ſoyle, which lay Eaſt, Weſt, North, or South of his habitation was of a different temper from thoſe Countries, which haue the like ſituation (in reſpect of the Heavens) from vs. Many rules againe are oftimes not acknowledged ſo generall as they are; becauſe we take ſome concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of circumſtances, or accidents, or ſomewhat annexed vnto the latent nature, whence the effect i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> deriued, as a concauſe, or neceſſary condition, when as it was onely preſent, not acceſſary to the event. Thus many people in this Land are afraid to begin a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7903:67"/>
good worke vpon the ſame day, that <hi>Innocents</hi> day fell on the yeare before: becauſe they held the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time as a neceſſary concurrent to proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous proceedings. And vnleſſe experience did teach the contrary, a meere diſputant would hardly graunt hot water could quench fire; becauſe it wants that qualitie, which may well ſeeme to be as a neceſſary concurrent to the deſtruction of the contrary forme. The evidence of this event hath occaſioned Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers to obſerue a propertie in the fire diſtinct from heate, and another in the water diſtinct from colde, perhaps in part from moiſture. Which properties ſenſe without the helpe of vnderſtanding could never haue diſtinguiſhed from heate or cold. Thus are heate and cold for want of like abſtraction taken for thoſe qualities, wherein the Medicinall vertue of hearbs or other phyſicall ſimples properly conſiſts. He that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had ſeene any creatures indued with ſenſe, and motion, but ſuch as with theſe haue reaſon; no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures but <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> nor blackneſſe in any ſubiect, but in this kinde of men, would imagine all thoſe to be one, or each to inferre others preſence. And if the vnderſtanding ſhould not vpon new obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations correct ſenſe, theſe collections would preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offer themſelues. [<hi>Whatſoever hath ſenſe, or motion, or is blacke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is indued with reaſon, and diſcourſe; [What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not capable of theſe latter adiuncts is vncapable of the former</hi>]. But once obſerving motion, or ſenſe in many creatures wanting the vſe of ſpeech, or obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many men whoſe complexion is farre from blacke, or blackneſſe in diverſe ſubiects, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue life, motion, ſenſe, or reaſon; the abſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7903:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of each from other offering it ſelfe, would mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the folly of former inferences. Generally, the more in number, and more different in nature the ſubiects be, wherein we obſerue any accident, or propertie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more eaſie and evident is the abſtraction of it from others, with which it often hath coniunction. The true reaſon why <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Algazel</hi> in his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick.</note> Mathematicall rules are ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous and evident, is becauſe lines and figures are found in every matter, that is ſubiect to ſenſe, as <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> and <hi>vnities</hi> accompany all things we can vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. Quantitie we may finde in many bodies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch concomitance, as it had in others. For ſundry ſubſtances much differing in all things elſe, agree onely in ſhape, or figure. But where one attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, or qualitie is linked with another in all, or moſt ſubiects, wherein either can be found, the diſtinction betweene them is more difficult, vnleſſe they belong to ſeverall ſenſes, or ſo belonging we vſually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found their cauſes, or obſerue ſmall diverſitie betwixt them. Seing permanent colours are not vſually ſeene but in mixt bodies, and all mixture is wrought by heate and colde, moyſture and drineſſe; we often imagine the diverſity of colours ſhould ariſe from the diverſe mixture of theſe prime qualities (as they are reputed) when as the diverſitie indeed is from the mixture of two more ſimple, more immateriall, and more generall and prime. As light and darkeneſſe were firſt created: ſo their of-ſprings, or propagations (<hi>Opacitie</hi> and <hi>Perſpicuitie</hi>) haue firſt place in all bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, alike communicable, to ſingle, or compounded, to corruptible, or incorruptible ſubſtances. There is no mixt body without their mixture, and oftimes
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7903:68"/>
where the one is really, the other there will be by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation, whether in the elements, or in bodies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, or imperfectly mixt. <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalion de Coloribus.</note> From the different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of their mixtures, or combinations ariſeth all diverſitie of colours. It skilleth not whether the fire were hot or cold, or whether the coales were dry or moyſt, ſo the one be bright, and the other ſootie or duſtie; the flame at firſt kindling will ſeeme blacke, afterward reddiſh, or blewiſh, laſtly yellow, and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. The originall of reall colours (as they call them) is no other, onely the perſpicuitie, and opacitie, whence they ſpring are more permanent, as being deeper incorporated into the matter, and the bond of their mixture more firme.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Moſt obiects (as they are preſented to vs by ſenſe) reſemble the firſt <hi>Chaos,</hi> or confuſed Maſſe. The vnderſtanding by ſifting, and ventilating the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ingredients, and aſſigning ſuch as are of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (ſorted together) to their ſeverall, and proper places, imitates the great Creator of the world in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting light out of darkeneſſe, and diſtinct bodies out of confuſed heapes, and pure celeſtiall ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces out of earthly droſſe. The right conſtitution of every Art or Science, is a kinde of Creation, and their Inventors come neareſt to God in wiſedome; yet not herein to glory, or reioyce, ſaue onely that by this cleare reſolution of every effect, or obiect into its ſimple and prime Elements, the beames of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors wiſedome, and diſtillations of his goodneſſe, which lay buried in the confuſed Congeſts, which ſenſe preſents, become cleare and ſenſible, if the winde be once touched with grace, which ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7903:68"/>
be excluded, but full implored in the ſearch of what truth ſoever. For no truth can be ſo meane, or ſlender, but being made cleare, and evident, it may elevate the minde, to which it ſo appeares, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the firſt truth, and is as a ſtep or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to that light, which is inacceſſible. Nor was it the ſearch, no not the curious ſearch of Sciences na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, Aſtrologicall, or Politicke, but the profeſſors ſlouthfull readineſſe to relie vpon the repreſentations of ſenſe not accurately ſifted, from which theſe three maine ſtreames of Atheiſme before mentioned did firſt iſſue. All three (with the <hi>ſource</hi> of Superſtition, or Idolatrie to be proſecuted in the next <note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 18. Sect. 3.</note> Diſcourſe,) we may deriue from a further head, then there we did, and ſomewhat more particular and proper, then was now intimated.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is a dictate of nature engraffed in all [<hi>That every thing, which before was not, muſt haue a cauſe of its now being</hi>]. And if the cauſe manifeſteth not it ſelfe in the production, we are ready by nature to father the effect vpon that, which is repreſented by ſenſe as neareſt vnto it. Thus the Philoſopher tooke the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Aſtrologer the ſtarres for ſole or chiefe cauſes of all things: the Politician his owne plots for prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall accompliſhers of all thoſe proiects, whereto they concurre as the dropping of a petty Conduit to the overflow of a mightie river, out of which the whole ſtreame, which feeds it, and many other, was firſt cut. And if the event be ſuch, as hath no perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent duration, or fixt ſeate, but falls out now and then without any certaine obſervation; the time, and place, wherein it was brought forth, are vſually ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7903:69"/>
to be ſole compartners in the begetting, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of it; and ſhall according to the goodneſſe, or badneſſe of this their ſuppoſed broode, reape the ſame praiſe or diſpraiſe, the ſame thankes or impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, which Parents, or Tutors haue for furniſhing the Common-weale with towardly, or vngracious plants.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Nor doth ſenſe entiſe vnto Atheiſme, or Idola<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trie, onely by putting that vſuall fallacie of <hi>non cauſa pro cauſa</hi> vpon the vnobſervant. But this error ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, ſeeing the linke betwixt cauſes, and their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects is moſt ſtrict, the multiplicitie of the one ſuggeſts a multiplicitie of the other. So doth every tearme of Relation multiplied in the Individuall, occaſion vs to conceiue a like number of correlatiues. The ſame er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror often inſinuates it ſelfe into the proper acts of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. For no things in Nature truely diverſe can be ſo indiviſibly, or eſſentially continued in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations made by ſenſe, as the obiect, or nature conceived by vs, and our intellectiue conceit of it: no things really different more apt, than theſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelues as one. Now ſeeing our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings cannot comprehend the entire entitie of many natures in themſelues moſt intelligible by one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, but muſt view them peece-meale, as we doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſided bodies, or meaſure them by reiteration of the ſame or like acts, as we doe large quantities by often application of the ſame palme or ſpanne. We ſlide by this meanes into a common error of imagining as many diſtinct natures conceived, as we frame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts of it, being indeed but one, and the ſame. Thus doth error become circular; for by conceiving
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7903:69"/>

The prime ſeede of both theſe roots was the imbecillitie of corrupted nature, whoſe chiefe and ſupreme faculties, though well inſtructed, are alwayes apt to be over-borne with the imbred and accuſtomed deſires of ſenſe. Of the forementioned apprehenſion, or acknowledgement of ſome inviſible power, as chiefe author of <hi>good and evill,</hi> one immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate conſequence was this; <hi>That the ſame power; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one, or moe, was the rewarder of ſuch, as ſought to pleaſe him, and a revenger of thoſe that neglected, or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it.</hi> Whence, in mindes miſ-led by their corrupt appetites, the beſt and finall conſequence of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer apprehenſions or <hi>notions,</hi> was to wooe the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed divine powers by all meanes poſſible to patronize themſelues, and their actions, though vniuſt, diſhoneſt, or ſuſpitious; rather than to ſubmit their wills, and affections wholly to their diſpoſalls, or ſo to frame their liues, as they might be capable of their iuſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. And as vnskilfull <hi>Empyricks</hi> ſeeke remedy from every medicine they haue read, or heard of, becauſe they know not the diſtinct vertue of any, or how it is proportioned to the effect they ayme at: So theſe poore-blind Heathen, daily more and more ignorant in the grounds of true Religion, did as it were grope after a new inviſible power in every viſible effect, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till at length they came to ſubdivide, and breake the generall <hi>notion</hi> according to the diſtinction, or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſenſibles, which they beſt or worſt affected.

                  <note n="*" place="margin">Num. 22.41.</note>. But <hi>Balaak</hi> feared (as by the words following it ſeemes) that <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaw too many at once, that this place was too high, a fitter levell for a bleſſing than for a curſe. <hi>And Balaak ſaid vnto Balaam; what haſt thou done vnto me?

And he anſwered, and ſaid; Muſt I not take heede to ſpeake that which the Lord hath put in my mouth?</hi> Yet this proteſtation perſwades <hi>Balaak</hi> onely to alter his ſtation, not his minde. <hi>And Balaak ſaid vnto him; Come I pray thee with me vnto another place, from whence thou maiſt ſee them; thou ſhalt ſee but the vtmoſt part of them, and ſhalt not ſee them all, and curſe me them from thence. And he brought him vnto Sede-ſophim</hi> (a place by the very name apt to enchant a ſuperſtitious minde with
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7903:88"/>
expectation of ſucceſſe) <hi>to the toppe of Piſgah, and built ſeaven Altars, and offered a bullocke, and a ramme on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Altar</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Num. 23. ver. 11, 12, 13, 14.</note>. As before triall made, he hoped the change of place would haue altered his lucke; ſo after returne of the like anſwer, he ſuſpects the Prophets wordes as cauſes of his miſhappe, and would hire him to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. <hi>And Balaak ſaid vnto Balaam; neither curſe them at all, nor bleſſe them at all. But Balaam anſwered, and ſaid vnto Balaak; Told not I thee ſaying; All that the Lord ſpeaketh, that I muſt doe</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ver. 25, 26</note>? So ſtrong is the conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ingraffed <hi>notion</hi> of Gods power to bleſſe or curſe whom he pleaſed, and the vnrighteouſneſſe, wherein it is detained, that after a ſentence paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, he will yet remoue his ſuite to another Court. <hi>Againe Balaak ſaid vnto Balaam; Come I pray thee; I will bring thee vnto another place, if ſo it may pleaſe God that thou maiſt thence curſe them for my ſake</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ver. 27.</note>. And laſtly perceiving his triple attempt to curſe had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a Trinitie of bleſſings (perhaps a bleſſing from the Trinitie giuen by each perſon in courſe) the laſt more effectuall than the former; he abandons the Prophets companie as an vnluckie gueſt. Of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaith <hi>Balaam: He coucheth, and lyeth downe as a young Lyon, and as a Lyon: who ſhall ſtirre him vp? Bleſſed is he that bleſſeth thee, and curſed is he that curſeth thee. Then Balaak was very angry with Balaam, and ſmote his hands together. So Balaak ſaid vnto Balaam; I ſent for thee to curſe mine enimies, and behold thou haſt bleſſed them now three times: Therefore now flee thou to thy place</hi>

Whatſoever the matter of the medicine may be (though oftimes it be rather verball, than materiall) the manner of applying it, is for the moſt part meerely magicall, and ſerues (though not in the intention of the patient or Phyſician) as a ſolemne ſacrifice to the founders of theſe Arts. Or if the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of applying or wearing medicines be not ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly ceremonious, the ſolemne profeſſing (though

And Mariners after a tedious and dangerous voyage, will ſalute the ſhore with complement very ſuſpicious to be daily practiſed by inhabitants. True imitation of affection, whileſt it vents its fullneſſe, is the beſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall motiue to breede or ſtirre affection in our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, or ſpectators. From imitation of mens ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and geſtures in like exigences of affection, or plunges of vehement diſires came Proſopopeia's firſt in requeſt amongſt Rhetoricians; a forme of ſpeech very effectuall, and approueable in its right ſubiect, the circumſtance of <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> duely obſerved. But the frequent vſe of it in Panegyricall Orations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Martyrs graues, did firſt occaſion that groſſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie of invocation of Saints; although it came not till long after by degrees inſenſible (as it were an huge ceſterne filling by continuall droppings) to that height, wherewith it ſo ſwelled in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, as it had almoſt overflowne the whole world beſides. Yet as theſe Panegyricks were auncient: ſo the firſt beginning of Proſopopeia's might as eaſily occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the Heathen to miſtake Chriſtian devotions as the vnſeaſonable imitation of their firſt vſe, did ſeduce Chriſtians afterwards to an heatheniſh conceit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Martyrs. So ſhort had the vſuall paſſage from theſe figuratiue and affectionate exclamations to ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous invocation of men departed beene: That the heathen either out of their own experience, that ſuch Proſopopeia's were introductions to Deifications of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7903:102"/>
men deceaſed, or from ſome reliques of their firſt lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders diſpoſitions propagated vnto them, did dig the bodies of noble Martyrs out of their graues, throwing others after torture into the ſea, as fearing leſt their Encomiaſts ſhould adore and worſhip them after the ſame maner they themſelves did their grand Patrons, great benefactors, or Heroicks, whom breath of fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, (as the next diſcourſe ſheweth) ſought of dead men to make living gods.</p>

Theſe exclamations were more rifely, more daungerous in Poets, than in Orators, or ſuch as vſed them not but vpon externall impulſion, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner againſt their wills. As are the Poets names, ſo is their nature: <hi>Makers</hi> they are, and herein they imitate the <hi>maker</hi> of all things, that they call things that are not, as if they were, and ſtriue to infuſe the ſpirit of life and motion into every ſubiect they take in hand; as they faine <hi>Pygmalion</hi> did into his Image. So wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſh are we all, that are borne of women; that our delightfull and choice conceites deſire alwayes to haue their pictures drawe in ſeemely luſter and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and we ſolace out internall fancies with loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on theſe outward Images; as Gentlewomen doe themſelves by gazing on their owne faces repreſented vnto them in a favorable glaſſe. Of thoughts or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the Poet is the onely picturer.

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7903:103"/>

For albeit the title of the Chapter containing this ſtory in our Engliſh <hi>Euſebius,</hi> takes it as graunted, that he did; the text notwithſtanding leaues it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if not more probable, that he did not. Nor was it neceſſary he ſhould in this caſe follow the example of <hi>Ioſias</hi> or <hi>Ezekias,</hi> having that libertie, which they had not, to build a Temple in the ſame place to the Lord; vnto zealous devotion in whoſe ſervice the groue might afford no leſſe plenty of fuell, than it had done to heatheniſh ſuperſticion and Idolatry.

And this is to ſhare or divide the mediation of Chriſt betwixt him and ſuch Saints, by even portions. For of the two principall parts of Chriſts Mediatorſhip, which the Auncient and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall Church did exactly diſtinguiſh in the <hi>forme</hi> of their prayers, the <hi>firſt</hi> is, our hope or beliefe to be heard <hi>propter Chriſtum, for Christs ſake,</hi> for whoſe ſake alone God graunts whatſoever He grants vnto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde: the <hi>ſecond</hi> is, our beliefe or acknowledgement, that thoſe bleſſings which God doth grant for Chriſts ſake, are not conveyed or imparted vnto vs, but through Chriſt, or by Chriſt. He is not onely our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator to God, but Gods hand to vs. Now the Romiſh Church in their ſolemne Liturgie expreſly giues the firſt part of this mediation vnto Saints, and leaues the latter onely vnto Chriſt. The hymne ſung or ſaid vnto the Croſſe vpon the ſame day, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the character of magicke ſpells falls vnder the ſame cenſure, that worſhipping of Saints Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or worſhipping God in every viſible creature doth. Of which Chap. 35, 36. The Hymne is thus; <hi>O crux ſplendidior cunctis aſtris, mundo celebris, homini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus multùm amabilis, ſanction vniverſis: quae ſola fuiſti digna portare talentum mundi, dulcia ferens pondera: ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua

They graunt the Saints can heare no prayers immediately from our mouths, much leſſe diſcerne their conception in our hearts: they vnderſtand them onely by ſeeing God; and for this reaſon happily prayers of this forme, are in the firſt place directed to God the Father, or to the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Is God then, as the booke wherein they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, altogether ſenſeleſſe of their meaning, vntill the Saints, whoſe interceſſion they craue, read them vnto him? or hearing them, is he vnwilling to grant them, vntill the Saints haue expounded them? But what is Chriſts office in the meane time? to requeſt his Father
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:7903:129"/>
that he would heare the Saints for his ſake? or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, doth he and the Saints mediate for ſinfull men both together, as joynt advocates? or doth He firſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the caſe, and leaue the Saints to proſecute it? or doe the Saints onely ſue in his name, that God would communicate his merits vnto them; as ſometimes in earthly Courts one of principall note beares the name, whileſt another manageth the buſineſſe? The ſupplicant ſhould, methinkes, in good manners frame ſome petition to Chriſt, or aske his leaue, to vſe his name in ſuch ſuites as they would haue managed by this or that particular Saint, in honour of his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Perhaps this forme of prayer was firſt invented by ſuch (for ſuch in the <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Ribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram in <hi>7.</hi> ad Hebrae: num. <hi>72.</hi>

In like ſort the ſight and preſence of any, whom God hath graced with extraordinary bleſſings of his Spirit, will voluntarily extort ſignes of ſubmiſſiue reſpect from every ſanctified and religious ſpirit, in vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted token that they reverence Gods gifts beſtowed vpon him, and heartily deſire their ſoules might take ſome tincture or impreſſion from his gratious carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age or inſtructions, which they can hardly doe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome nearer linke of familiaritie and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: or at leaſt, would doe ſo much better, by how much the linke were cloſer, or their vicinitie greater. The right end and ſcope whereto the inſtinct of grace inherent in our ſoules doth direct theſe externall ſignes of ſubmiſſion, is to <hi>woe</hi> their ſoules and ſpirits whom we thus reverence, to ſome more intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction.

Contemplation of others excellency without this ſubmiſſiue temper in our ſelues, either ſtirres vp envie, or occaſioneth deſpaire: and yet all that theſe outward and vnfaigned ſignes of ſubmiſſion can lawfully plight vnto them, is the ſervice of our bodies or inferior faculties. Theſe

we could be content to ſacrifice not to them, but for their ſakes: alwayes provided that we doe not preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the right or dominion, which our owne ſpirits and conſciences haue over our bodies, immediately vnder God. But to offer vp the internall and proper fruits of the Spirit vnto them by way of tribute and honour, is to diſhonour, to deny that God which made them. The ſeedes of grace and true Religion are ſowne immediately by his ſole powerfull hand; and their natiue of-ſpring (acts of faith eſpecially) muſt be reſerved entire and vntouched for him. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>intrinſecally religious,</hi> or <hi>devotions</hi> truely ſacred, are oblations, which may not, which cannot without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſacriledge be ſolemnly conſecrated to any others honour, but onely to his who infuſeth the Spirit of prayer and thankeſgiving into mens hearts.

None may worſhip or ſerue any Creature with <hi>religious Worſhip</hi>; all of vs muſt ſo worſhip and ſerue God alone.

And of all kindes of religious feare or ſervice, <hi>Cultus duliae</hi> is either moſt improperly or moſt impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly tendred to Saints and Angels.

               <p n="4">4. It is a warrant to our Churches, fully ſufficient, not to doe homage vnto Angels abſent, becauſe in preſence they refuſe and forbid it. By what warrant the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church can obtrude it vpon them againſt their wills, let her ſonnes looke to it. Wee haue cauſe to ſuſpect, and they to feare, that the Devill and his ſwift meſſengers haue played <hi>Gehazies</hi> with their <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amans</hi>; runne to their Rulers in theſe heavenly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets names, to demaund ſuch gratifications, vpon falſe pretences, in their abſence, as they reſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, when in all reaſon they beſt deſerved them, if at any time they might haue taken them. The Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is not aboue his Maiſter; much leſſe is the pupils practiſe to be imitated before the Tutors doctrine. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in this Dialogue was the pupill: doe they then grace him by taking his proffer to worſhip this Angel for their warrant, or rather wrong the Angel in not admitting his two-fold inhibition (at both times o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed by this his ſchollar) for a ſufficient caveat to deterre them from making the worſhipping of Saints and Angels a ſpeciall part of their ſolemne ſervice?
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:7903:138"/>
But this is the curſe which by Gods juſt judgement is fallen vpon them for detayning the truth in vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; That as the Horſe-leach ſucketh onely the melancholy humor out of mens bloud: ſo theſe <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts</hi> having relinquiſhed the pure fountaine of truth, muſt <hi>long</hi> after the dregs of Antiquitie in their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and in their practiſe feede principally vpon ſuch infirmities of the fleſh, as ſometimes mingle them ſelues with the ſpirituall behaviour of Gods Saints. For even the ſoules of Gods deareſt Saints haue their habitation, during this life, with fleſh and bloud. And albeit we ſinfull men may not paſſe our cenſures vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> nor meaſure his carriage in the Angels preſence, by any the leaſt overſight in our ſelues, who are never raught beyond our ſelues, in ſuch admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpirit, as he then was: yet the holy Angel with whoſe glorious appearance he was aſtoniſhed, might diſcover the miſplaced motions of his ſpirit or affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ſome ſuch outraying or miſ-faſhioned lines in his bodily geſture or outward behaviour; as an expert Courtier would quickly eſpie in a meere contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Scholar, called into ſome Court-like audience. This carriage was for the preſent more pardonable in him, than the continuall imitation of it can be in any. A gratious Prince would take little or no diſpleaſure, if a man in a dreame or traunce, or in ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary paſſion of feare ariſing from apprehenſion of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger, or of ioy for vnexpected ſafetie; ſhould beſtow royall titles on his ſpeciall benefactor, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre extemporary petitions or <hi>gratulations ore tenus</hi> in ſuch ſubmiſſiue ſtyle or geſture, as might impeach, as well the greateſt ſubject in the Kingdome that
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:7903:139"/>
ſhould accept them, as the meaneſt that could offer them, of diſloyaltie, if they were drawne into legall forme or daily practiſe. Admitting the Angel had not twice diſallowed the worſhip proffered by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle: yet if we conſider the extaſie or ſtrange exultation of ſpirit, whence it was wreſted; the delinquencie of the Romiſh Church (vſing his example for a patterne of their behaviour in publicke and ſolemne ſervice, when no occaſion of like paſſion is offred either by Angelicall preſence or joyfull Embaſſage) argueth more wilfull and contemptuous diſloyaltie towardes God, than the former ſuppoſition implieth towardes earthly Princes. And as it is a point of indiſcretion to ſhew ſuch peculiar obſervance to great Perſonages in the Princes preſence, as good manners elſe-where would exact; ſo to tender ſuch ſolemne worſhip to Saints and Angels in the Church or houſe of God, is a circumſtance which much aggravateth the hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſſe, or rather induceth an alteration of the qualitie of the Worſhip it ſelfe; enough to make it ſuperſtitiouſly Religious, though otherwiſe decently civill, or offenſiue onely in exceſſe.</p>

to diſpute it. And other occaſion we can haue none, ſaue what their preſence or commerce with vs ſhall adminiſter. Or, admitting their vndoubted ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions were at this day as rife, as heretofore they haue beene pretended, it would be the firſt part of our dutie to faſhion our ſelues vnto ſuch obſervance as they would preſcribe vs, not to preſcribe them what manner of honour they were to receiue from vs. Gods word concerning their worſhip is ſilent, ſaue onely that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath adviſed vs to content our ſelues with ignorance in theſe ſecrets, vnto whoſe ſearch we are not called; to affect whoſe knowledge, wee can haue no provocation or impulſion beſides the <hi>vaine-ſwelling of our fleſhly mindes.</hi> But, whatſoever reſpect or obſervance might lawfully be tendred to their infallible appearance, cannot without impious folly be ſeriouſly proffered to them whileſt they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare not: and ſolemnly to conſecrate it to their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages whoſe perſons we never ſawe, is the height of impietie. Civilitie &amp; common ſenſe may enforme vs that to tender ſuch reſpect or ſignes of ſubmiſſion to Princes or great Perſonages, whom wee ſee a farre of, as would become vs being admitted to conference with them, would argue either diſtraction of minde, or clowniſh ſimplicitie. Though it were lawfull to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe our neceſſities with bended knees to Saints or Angels vouchſafing their preſence, and to implore their interceſſion for vs with ſighes and teares; yet may not ſuch as haue eyes, pray to them or any whom they cannot ſee, ſaue onely to him who is <hi>inviſible.</hi> None that haue ſenſe, may pray to any of whoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall preſence or acquaintance with our affaires, we
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:7903:144"/>
haue no ſenſible vndoubted pledge; ſaue onely to him whom we know not by ſenſe, but by the ſpirit of grace and faith, every where to heare and know all things that are done or ſayd any where. Howbeit for every man at all times, in every place, vpon all occaſions to worſhip <hi>him</hi> in ſuch manner, as they without offence, with true devotion, haue done, vnto whom his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary preſence hath beene manifeſted, would be but a ſuperſtitious obſervance. For although we be fully aſſured, that he ſees our geſtures, knowes our hearts, and heares our petitions, at all times and every where alike; yet he ſees that we haue not alwayes the like occaſions, which they had, to pray or worſhip as they did. And any extraordinary manner of worſhip without extraordinary impulſion, is will-worſhip. More particularly; Religious prayers being proper acts of faith, vnleſſe they be made in faith, are moſt properly <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>not of faith,</hi> quite contrary to the rule of faith, which in any point to croſſe, is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſinne; but to contradict it in matters of religious worſhip, is the ſinne of Idolatrie.
<q>Now reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious prayers cannot be conceived or exhibited to any in faith, without certaintie of faith, that they to whom they are exhibited, doe heare vs. Seriouſly to tender requeſts to the ſoules of Saints deceaſed, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtant from vs than any one part of the earth is from another, after the ſame manner we might do, vpon certaine notice of their preſence, or mutuall pledges of commerce with vs, is but to offer the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of fooles vnto the winde, or to ſow the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherein we breath, with the poyſonous ſeedes of Ethnicke ſuperſtition. And ſo in fine the <hi>Romaniſt</hi>
                     <pb n="270" facs="tcp:7903:145"/>
doth not enrich the Saints, but ſtockes and ſtones (the workes of his owne hands) with that honour whereof he hath robbed his God. His adoring, his kiſſing and his worſhipping of Saints and Images with bended knees and other ſignes of ſubmiſſion, is but a ſolemne invitation of infernall <hi>ghoſts</hi> to keepe reſidence about them. Theſe are the <hi>Harpies</hi> which defile Gods ſervice, and devoure the peoples offrings, which their inchanted Prieſts would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them were preſented to &amp; accepted by Gods Saints.</q>
To thinke the Saints ſhould be permitted to receiue our particular petitions, and not be permitted to returne their particular anſwers; or not be enabled as freely to communicate their mindes to vs, as we to impart our deſires to them, is an imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo groſſe, that it can haue no ground either of faith or common reaſon. Wee may retort <hi>Bellarmines</hi> and his Conſorts arguments for invocation of Saints vpon themſelues.

To ſay they will not if they can, is to impeach them of pride or want of charitie: to ſay they cannot, is to ſlander them with impotencie, or with want of favour with God. For He that enables them as they ſuppoſe He doth to heare vs ſpeak from earth to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven can queſtionleſſe enable them ſo to ſpeake or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe themſelues, that wee might heare them from heaven to earth.

that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> did either ſend downe fire from Heaven, or cauſe the mouths of theſe Prieſts of <hi>Bell</hi> to be ſtopt with haire and pitch; this is to me, and will be vnto the vnpartiall Reader, a better argument that this bleſſed Saint did never heare thoſe or like prayers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected vnto him; than the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bring, <hi>That Saints deceaſed are</hi> (ordinarily) <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with mens petitions or deſires in particular.</hi> Yet vnto all theſe &amp; many like we muſt expect no anſwere but one: but that wee may well expect ſhould be a ſound <hi>one</hi> and worthy the noting: <hi>Eſt ergò notandum cum dicimus non deberi peti à ſanctis, niſi vt orent pro no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, nos non agere de verbis ſed de ſenſu verborum.

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:7903:149"/>
continued the ſame or greater; His ſpeedie diſſolution or departure to Chriſt had beene as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the Churches which he planted, as for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.

                  <hi>It was expedient for his diſciples that he ſhould leaue them and goe to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, otherwiſe that Comforter would not haue come vnto them.</hi> But it never was expedient for any Church or Congregation, to be deprived of their godly &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Paſtors bodily preſence. The onely reaſon of this diverſitie is, becauſe Chriſt liues for ever, and hath an everlaſting Prieſt-hood; whereas Saints and godly men which are departed this life, although they ſtill liue vnto God, are, (touching interceſſion or other acts of their miniſteriall function) dead to vs. Vpon theſe advantages we may here conſtraine Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> either to call in his vnanſwerable argument (as he enſtyles it) or to admit of that anſwer to it, which our Writers haue given: <hi>Why the invocation of Saints ſhould be vnlawfull or vnprofitable, no other reaſon can be alledged but either becauſe they cannot heare the prayers which we make vnto them, or will not pray as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to God for vs, as they did when they lived, or are not in ſuch favour with God to obtaine what they aske.

How vtterly theſe men evacuate the eternitie of Chriſts Prieſthood as well by continuing a ſucceſſiue multiplicitie of ſacrificers to reiterate his everlaſting ſacrifice here on earth, as by joyning other everlaſting interceſſors with him, as his aſſiſtants in heaven, is an argument more directly pertinent to ſome Articles following in the Creede.

                  <hi>as by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, ſo by the building of Temples, by the erection of Statues. Wee conſecrate ſhrines and offer ſacrifice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to the Gods: vnto the ſame Gods Hymnes are due, as prayſes are to men. But the honour due to the Gods is ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally differenced by the manner of adoration. Men are gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with kiſſes; but the Gods are ſaluted with adoration, being placed ſo high that wee may not touch them. Vnto the Gods likewiſe wee expreſſe our ioyfull thankeſgiving in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne dances and ſongs. And no marvell, if the honour which we giue to Gods be diſtinguiſhed from the honour which we giue to men, ſeeing divers kindes of honours are allotted to divers Gods. The honour given to Heroickes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed differeth from honour truely divine. It is therefore vnfitting to confound theſe; vnfitting to extoll men by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh honour aboue humane ſtate, or to coarctate the Gods vnto a ſtate vnfitting their dignitie, or to worſhip them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner as wee doe men. Nor could Alexander himſelfe be well pleaſed, if a priuate man ſhould vſurpe roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all titles by election, or vnlawfull ſuffrages.

onely to his Maieſtie. Theſe, by their own confeſſion, are proper acts of that religious worſhip, which may not be communicated to any Saint or Angell; and ſo are vowes conceived in ſolemne and legall forme. Let vs ſee then how well their practiſes ſute with their ſpeculations in theſe points, and what neede the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions of vulgar breaſts haue of ſublimated braines to preſerue them from the poyſon of damnable and more than Heatheniſh Idolatrie.

Or to gather the reſolutions into ſuch diſtinct tearmes, as yonger or weaker capacities may ſtrike at their <hi>errors</hi> without iniury to the truth which they would make vs beleeue doth vnderprop them: <hi>Deus eſt vnicus terminus, non vnicus finis ſacrificij oblati; God is the only party to whom the ſacrifice is offered or ſolemne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſented, not the onely partie whoſe honour is by the offering or ſolemnitie intended.</hi> They haue as true an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to honour S. <hi>Peter</hi> as to honour God, though

in a lower degree; and (for any conſtruction I can make of their aſſertions) S. <hi>Peters</hi> honour though in it ſelfe leſſe, is notwithſtanding more ſpecially and principally intended. So that by offering ſacrifice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God onely, we may in ſome reſpects grant they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God more than S. <hi>Peter,</hi> in <hi>others</hi> we muſt accuſe them for honouring S. <hi>Peter</hi> more than God. For illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating this collection, I will alter onely the matter and perſons, not a whit of the forme of the Action or order of intention. The caſe is the ſame, as if ſome great Family or Corporation ſhould tender the King a royall preſent in moſt ſubmiſſiue and loyall manner, but petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> withall to haue ſome favorite, whom they moſt affect, made Baron or Governor and Fee-farmer of the Citie or Territories which vnder his Maieſtie they inhabite, reſerving all rents and ſervices, aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently due out of the lands, vnto the Crowne; or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, if neede were, a little to raiſe them. A wiſe King in this caſe would neede no ſpectacles to diſcerne the true reaſon of their profeſſing more than ordinary loyaltie to his Highneſſe, at this time and place, to haue bin their extraordinary affection vnto the partie whoſe <hi>honour</hi> they ſought for their owne patronage; vnto whoſe coffers more gaine were likely to accrew for the <hi>proprietie</hi> of the revenewes granted, than could come to the Chequer from the Fee-farme or <hi>Royaltie.</hi> And the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> (I am perſwaded) would be more ready to deride our ſimplicitie than to commend our charitie, if we could not ſuſpect that S. <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> S. <hi>Dennis</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> S. <hi>Iames</hi> in <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> the Lady <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> in <hi>Loretto,</hi> or other worſe deſerving Saints in the places wherof they are Patrons, in the Churches and

Temples dedicated to their memorie, did not gaine a greater portion of the peoples hearts, and a truer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in their devotions, vnder the title of <hi>Dulia,</hi> than is reſerved for the great King, vnder the title of <hi>Latria.</hi> If then we conſider not the phyſicall <hi>forme</hi> of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice onely, but the end and circumſtances of the whole ſervice, they honour God with greater titles of Religion, but with leſſe <hi>realtie</hi> of religious reſpect or affection, then they doe thoſe Saints, whom they conceiue as their immediate Lords, their peculiar Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons or eſpeciall Benefactors. As for the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God, ſeeing they make him the matter of the offering wherewith they hope to induce his Father to grace the Saints, (by granting immunitie vnto themſelues vnder their patronage and protection) they no way honour, but (as much as in them lies) diſdignifie him in ſuch ſolemnities. The indignitie offred by them vnto Chriſt, though for its meaſure much leſſe, is in proportion much what the ſame, as if a ſaucie petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or diſhoneſt ſupplicant, ſhould ſeeke to worke the King to grant his petition for his owne gaine and his friends honour, by preſenting his Maieſtie with rareſt Iewells of the Prince his onely Sonne, without his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe conſent, or vpon preſumptuous hopes of his preſumed approbation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But let vs take their confeſſion concerning the other points propoſed in their owne language. We demand, whether S. <hi>Peter</hi> haue no better intereſt in the Churches &amp; Altars that beare his name, of which his image hath taken poſſeſſion, than he hath in the ſervice that is celebrated in the one, or in the ſacrifice that is offered vp on the other? Here ſuch as joyne

hands and hearts in the repairing of the new <hi>Babell,</hi> are ſomewhat divided in their language. Some grant the tenor of his intereſt to be one &amp; the ſame in both, and therefore make the ſame plea they did before, [That one Church is called S. <hi>Peters,</hi> another S. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> admits (in their doctrine) this expoſition; <hi>Both are dedicated vnto God, but the one in the name and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of S.

                  </note>. This, ſayth <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> is a godly expoſition and conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the rites which the Church obſerues in the conſecration of Temples. For ſometimes the Biſhop, amongſt the prayers belonging to ſuch ſolemnities, profeſſeth that he conſecrateth the Temple <hi>in hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem Dei, &amp; nomen talis, vel talis Sancti; to the honor of God and name of ſuch a Saint:</hi> but directly to God <hi>vnder the title of Latria, to the memorie of the Saint vnder the title of Dulia.</hi> But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> foreſaw, that their practiſe and forme of conſecration, well examined, might be enforc'd to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe more then this expoſition implies; and vpon this foreſight hath framed another more wary plea to our inditement: for whoſe better ſucceſſe he had conceived his fourth propoſition concerning the right vſe or end of building Temples in theſe tearmes; <hi>Sacrae domus non ſolum Deo ſed etiam Sanctis, &amp;c. Sacred palaces or religious houſes may be lawfully built and dedicated not onely to God but vnto Saints.</hi> To bring
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:7903:154"/>
in this concluſion in due place and order, not Fathers and Councells onely but holy Scriptures alſo muſt be wreſted to countenance blaſphemie; and blaſphemie (having put on an impudent face vpon preſumption of their warrant) muſt <hi>man</hi> in ſuch heatheniſh Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, as not ſo guarded would bluſh or be affraid to appeare amongſt Chriſtian ſpectators. <hi>Salomons</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (ſayth he) was erected not onely to be an houſe of prayer or of ſacrifices, but to be withall an habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Arke, as <hi>Davids</hi> intendment (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.) and <hi>Salomons</hi> accompliſhing of it (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. <hi>cap:) bare manifeſt record.</hi> This being proued which no man denyeth, he thus aſſumes: <hi>The ſame or greater honor is due to the ſacred reliques of Chriſt and his Saints, than vnto the Moſaicall Arke. Ergo, it is as lawfull to erect a Temple over the ſepulcher of Chriſt, as over the Arke: and if over the ſepulcher of Chriſt, then over the ſepulcher of the Saints, for there is one and the ſame reaſon in all:</hi> they differ onely <hi>ſecundum magis &amp; minus.</hi>
                  <q>He addes withall, (leſt the people ſhould be too ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous) that vnder the name of ſacred reliques he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends not only the bones or garments of Saints, but the places where they ſuffred, where they dwelt, or did any famous act; as S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had two ſacred <hi>houſes</hi> erected to him, one where he ſuffred, another where his body lay. Nay ſuch houſes may be erected to Saints in any place; onely to preſerue or inlarge their fame or memory, by retaining their Images or names, to the intent that ſuch as enter into them being put in minde of their dutie by the image, or knowne name of the Temple, may remember Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. and worſhip him in that place as their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, and pray to him.</q>

                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:7903:154"/>5. He hath brought the point to this iſſue for vs; Temples may not be erected to any beſides God <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliter,</hi> they may be erected to Saints <hi>materialiter</hi>; that is, one and the ſelfe ſame <hi>ſacred houſe,</hi> which is a true Temple, and wherein ſacrifices are offered vp to God, may be erected in honor of this or that Saint, but not as it is a Temple. How then? As it is a <hi>ſacred ſeat</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle</hi> of the Saints bodie, or as a monument of his fame: as (that he may juſtifie one impiety by another) one and the ſame ſtone is both an Altar and a Tomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, or Sepulcher; an Altar in as much as they offer ſacrifice vpon it vnto God, a <hi>Tombſtone</hi> or <hi>Sepulcher</hi> in as much as it covers the bodie of ſome Martyr. For (as he tells vs for our learning) all Altars are Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers or Tombſtones of Saints.
His finall reſolution is,<q> [As the ſame ſtone is rightly dedicated to this or that Saint, not in conſideration that it is an Altar, but in conſideration that it is a Sepulcher: ſo the ſame houſe, which is a Temple, is truely dedicated to the Saint; <hi>non ſub ratione Templi, ſed ſub ratione Baſilicae</hi> (not as a Temple but as a ſacred Palace, for the Saint to reſt or to be worſhipped in). Now, as it would be plaine Idolatry to erect Altars to Saints, but no Idolatry to erect the ſame <hi>ſtones</hi> vnto them which are Altars: ſo it would be Idolatry to erect Temples to Saints, vnder this reſpect, that they are Temples; but no Idolatry to erect the ſame <hi>houſes</hi> vnto them, which are Temples, not as they are Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but as they are <hi>ſacred Palaces</hi>].</q>
Did the Maſons or Carpenters, or ſuch as ſet them a-worke about a thouſand yeare agoe, either lay the foundation, raiſe the walles, or put on the roofes of Temples, which
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:7903:155"/>
they built to Saints, by the rule of this diſtinction? If they did not, they committed groſſe Idolatry. And, for ought I can gather from <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Apologie, he makes no ſcruple to confeſſe that Romane Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques doe ſtill commit Idolatry; all his care is to avert the imputation of committing this foule ſinne <hi>quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ipſum,</hi> or <hi>formally,</hi> as it is Idolatry, that is, of pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their ſoules with it by art and methode, or of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting it by expreſſe conceipt of it's eſſentiall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; with which none but the Schoolemen haue eſpeciall acquaintance. Nor will I (for mine owne part) charge them thus deepely, for dedicating Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples vnto Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it ſufficeth me to proue, that they are in this point plain down-right Idolaters. But I would gladly in the next place, be reſolved how they can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit themſelues from the imputation of committing Idolatry <hi>quatenus Idolatrie,</hi> in <hi>ſolemnizing Vowes</hi> to Saints.</p>

vowes into their <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>forme</hi>; bequeathing the <hi>former</hi> part to glorified Saints and living men, the <hi>latter</hi> onely vnto God.

                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> very well, becauſe in vowing obedience to Prelates or Governours, men intend not to honour them but God.
<q>On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he that vowes a <hi>faſt</hi> or <hi>pilgrimage</hi> vnto Saints; intends directly to honor them with religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.

Becauſe <hi>Caietan</hi> before him had condemned <hi>Aquinas</hi> his reſolution out of the mouthes of preaching Fryars.</q>
For they, whileſt they profeſſe or promiſe the materiall part of their vow to men, tender the formall parts as directly to Saints as vnto God. <hi>I vow to God, to S. Marie, and all the Saints, that I will faithfully obey my Governour. Caie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> anſwer to the difficultie propoſed, is ſo ſlight that it ſeemeth he cared not much, if there had beene no practitioners in this kind, or that their practiſe might want Patrons.

But his diſtinction is ſo acute, that indeed he denies any vowes or promiſes to be truely made vnto Saints; as they are reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or for their internall excellency.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to avoyd this ſcandall; avoucheth it as a generall agreement amongſt all <hi>Catholiques,</hi> that they make promiſes as directly and truely vnto Saints as vnto God. For if it be lawfull to build ſacred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to erect Sepulchers, and burne Lampes before them, why ſhould it not be as lawfull to make ſolemne promiſes vnto them? Thus one impietie being allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:7903:156"/>
and admitted into their Church, muſt in charitie approue another. Now every promiſe that is made to God or Saints deceaſed, is a formall vow, as he very well declares; nor can the Church, by his acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, make the ſame plea in this caſe as in the former, that their vowes are directed only vnto God, though in memory and honor of the Saints; for they are terminated joyntly and directly vnto God, and to the Saints. Here (methinkes) they ſhould invoke the ayde of ſome Saint or other, to vntie this knot, which he vainely thinkes will vntie it ſelfe, by the former di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.
<q>The promiſe (ſaith he) is indeed one and the ſame, but is not made after one &amp; the ſame manner: They bind themſelues vnto God, in token of their thankfulneſſe towards him as the fountaine of all good, and in recognition of bleſſings received from him, as from the firſt author of all things. And, by this apprehenſion or recognition, ſolemne promiſes made to him become <hi>cultus latriae,</hi> proper acts of <hi>diuine worſhip.</hi> But they bind themſelues vnto Saints onely in ſigne of their thankfulneſſe towards them, as Mediators or Interceſſors by whoſe favour they receiue bleſſings from God; and this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their ſubordination vnto God, makes the ſame vow or ſolemne promiſe vnto them, to be but <hi>cultus duliae.</hi>
                  </q>
But the queſtion was, whether ſolemne vowes be not eſſentiall parts of <hi>latrie,</hi> and if ſuch they be (as moſt of their Church doe hold them to be:) no mentall reſpect or conſideration of ſuch as make, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or authorize them, can tranſforme them into <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus dulia.</hi> Beſides; the diſtinction is naught: this great Champion did either evidently miſapply it to this
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:7903:156"/>
difficultie, or els did much amiſſe, in not applying it to the former. For might he not as well haue ſayd; <hi>They erected Temples or offered ſacrifice to Saints in ſigne of thankefulneſſe to them,</hi> as Mediators or Interceſſors; but vnto God onely as to the firſt fountaine of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings received.</p>
               <p n="3">3.
<q>It is confeſſed by our adverſaries that the name of <hi>Vow</hi> in ſacred writ or dialect, alwayes imports a promiſe made to God, and yet they thinke it no I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry to performe that religious ſervice vnto Saints which the holy Spirit hath appropriated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; <hi>becauſe the Canon of Scripture was accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed before the Cuſtome of vowing vnto Saints begun,</hi> (or rather the authoritie of it was abandoned by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of this cuſtome, if not before.)</q>
This reply ſeemes to inſinuate, that if Gods Spirit had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ought to writing ſince vowes were enacted, as parts of religious worſhip due vnto Saints deceaſed, <hi>He</hi> would haue fitted his language to their cuſtome. How ever, this anſwere takes but a part of our objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though more by much than this <hi>Goliah</hi> was able to deale with. For we argue not onely from the vſe of the <hi>word</hi> in Scripture, but from the reaſon, why it is ſo vſed. Now the reaſon why vowes in Scripture are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated vnto God, is becauſe they are a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and eſpeciall part of his worſhip than ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are. He that offered legall ſacrifices of his Cattell or of the fruites of the earth, did thereby teſtifie his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude vnto God, as vnto the ſupreme Owner of theſe, and ſole author of all other bleſſings: and as vnto him <hi>which gaue man power to gather ſubſtance.</hi> But he that vowed vnto the Lord, did acknowledge him to be the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:7903:157"/>
ſearcher of the heart, the juſt avenger of perfidious negligence; the bountifull rewarder of fidelitie, and diligence in his ſervice. Hence it was, that legall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, were oftimes the matter of religious vowes. The forme of religious worſhip or ſervice and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate end of ſuch ſacrifices, was <note n="*" place="margin">See Pſal. 50. ver. 7. &amp;c. and the 14.</note> performance of the vowes; whoſe neglect plentie of ſacrifices could not recompence. But fidelitie in performance of what was lawfully vowed, did pleaſe God without the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of ſacrifice. And whether the vow were concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of gratitude vnto God for benefits paſt, or out of ſorrow for ſinne, or former ingratitude: the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obſervance of it was a true part of that <hi>living ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> or <hi>reaſonable ſervice,</hi> which our<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 12. ver. 1.</note> Apoſtle requires at our hands, as the patterne or prototypon of Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call offerings. May we then offer any part of our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſervice to any other beſides God, vnto whom onely his people were to offer legall ſacrifices?

And is there any likelihood that he, which conceiues a vow in one and the ſame thought, and profeſſeth it with one and the ſame breath, <hi>ioyntly</hi> to God, to the bleſſed Virgin, and to other Saints, ſhould ſcholaſtically diſtinguiſh their ſeverall excellencies or proper titles, and proportion the degrees of ſeverall worſhips to them?

No mans heart in his firſt ayme is ſet on money for it ſelfe, but as it is the <hi>viaticum</hi> to ſome better end. And yet how rare a thing is it, to ſee a man much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this mettall, not to affect it as his God, to whoſe ſervice he conſecrates his beſt intentions?

               <p n="2">2.

this inferior one which they call <hi>Dulia</hi> ſeizing ſo hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily vpon the Saints, ſhould not interrupt the others flight towards God, and miſperſwade men that his worſhip did conſiſt in devotion towardes them; as men are drawne as it were in a dreame to thinke feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie is ſeated in thoſe meanes which are ſubordinate and ſubſervient to it.

To haue offered ſuch ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices (then) vnto that holy one, as <hi>Gregory</hi> there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, had beene the ſame ſinne (onely inverted) as to haue offered ſacrifice, before Chriſts comming,

And ſomewhat, in both reſpects (I graunt) might lawfully be tolerated, which to continue after ſuch extraordinary occaſions ceaſed, was hereſie in doctrine, and Idolatry in practiſe. For the retaining of thoſe lawes as neceſſary iniunctions for all ages, which the Apoſtles had commended as expedient onely for late converted Gentiles, was by orthodoxall antiquity adjudged no leſſe than an hereſie in the ſect of <hi>Nazarens.</hi> To haue ſuffered an hiſtoricall vſe of Saints images in Temples, might, vpon peculiar cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of times haue argued religious diſcretion in Church governours: but to permit their daily wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, vpon theſe mentioned or like occaſions, was from the beginning moſt vnexpedient and vnlawfull. To continue or authorize it ſo begun is Idololatrical. And yet as well the very arguments which ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for their religious vſe, as the circumſtances of the time wherein their broken <hi>title</hi> prevaild, perſwads me they could never haue gotten readmiſſion into the Church, but from ſuch indulgence to Heathen Converts, as <hi>Gregorie</hi> graunted to our Forefathers.

And theſe inſtances, though they may ſeeme to haue ſome ſimilitude at firſt appearance, will vpon a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular tryall eaſily appeare moſt diſlike. Firſt, if we ſpeake of particular oaths given onely for ſatisfaction of men, they include or preſuppoſe a religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our allegiance vnto God; as to our ſupreame Iudge: they are not ſuch proper acts of his <hi>ſervice,</hi> as ſupplications, thankſgivings, and ſolemne vowes are. The true end and vſe of their inſtitutions is to giue ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction vnto men in caſes wherein no aſſeveration will be taken for ſufficient, ſuch as is ſolemnly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberatly conceived and vttered, as it were in the ſight and preſence of him, whom we acknowledge to be the ſearcher of all hearts, the ſupreame judge of all controverſies, and the avenger of all falſhood and wrong. And, for this reaſon, ſolemne oaths are not to be adminiſtred by any but by thoſe whom he termes gods. Theſe juſt occaſions or neceſſity of taking oaths preſuppoſed; the generall reſolution or publicke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction to ſweare onely by the name of the true and everliving God, is an honour to him, becauſe we here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by profeſſe our ſelues to be only his ſervants, and him to be the cleare fountaine of truth, the ſevere avenger of all falſhood in deede, word or thought. But his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:7903:174"/>
would be no whit leſſe, if the vſe or neceſſitie of oaths amongſt men were none; as in caſe every mans <hi>yea</hi> or <hi>nay</hi> were as good as his <hi>affirmatiue</hi> or <hi>negatiue</hi> oath; much better than his bond. But taking men as they are; to confirme every word vttered or promiſe made by them, with a ſolemne oath; would be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of his name, by whom they ſweare; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſweare or promiſe nothing but the truth. For it is one thing to ſweare the truth, another to ſweare in truth and judgement. This can never be performed without due obſervance of the end and occaſion why oaths were inſtituted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Far otherwiſe it is in ſupplications and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings; the more often and ſolemnly we prayſe God or pray vnto him, the more we honour him; becauſe theſe are direct and immediate acts of his ſervice, not inſtituted to giue ſatisfaction vnto men but onely to glorifie his name, and to better our owne ſoules. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this difference in the <hi>ſubiects</hi> wherein they are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; the vſe and end of Images in <hi>Romiſh</hi> devotions, is altogether different from the vſe or end of the <hi>booke</hi> in adminiſtration of oaths. The image is vſed by them as the <hi>meane</hi> or meſſenger for tranſporting devotions or religious affections vnto God or the Saints, whoſe honour is principally and expreſly aymed at, in their vnwildie ejaculations before ſtockes and ſtones; yet ſo, as the image is, in their intentions, a true ſharer with the prototypon in ſuch honour. We vſe the <hi>booke</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a complement of the civill act whereby we giue ſatisfaction vnto men, or as a viſible remembrancer partly to by-ſtanders or ſpectators, whoſe eyes by this meanes may become as true witneſſes as their eares,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:7903:174"/>
that ſuch proteſtations haue beene made; partly, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that makes them, who will be more wary and circumſpect what he avoucheth and proteſteth; when he perceiues his ſpeeches muſt be ſealed with ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable circumſtances, as they cannot but be often recalled to his owne and others memory. To the ſame end men of honourable place or calling, vſe to lay their hands vpon their hearts, when they take a ſolemne oath: yet no man will thinke that they intend hereby to honour themſelues, or to ſhare with <hi>him</hi> by whoſe name they ſweare; although we grant oaths ſo taken to be true and proper acts of Religion or Gods ſervice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor doe ſuch as ſweare, or (at leaſt) are thought to ſweare by ordinary or obvious creatures, as, <hi>by this bread, by this light,</hi> intend the tranſmiſſion of any pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar honour by them to the creator. Nor can ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s though in ſome caſes, (for ought I conceiue) not vnlawfull, be in any caſe or vpon any occaſions, more proper acts of divine worſhip or ſervice than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſeverations of truth are; from which they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not in nature but onely in degree of ſeriouſnes or vehemencie. There is in all men by nature a proneſſe or deſire to make them, vpon provocation or miſtruſt: which naturall proneſſe may (perhaps) by religious diſcretion, be ſevered from that corruption of nature, wherewith even oaths expreſly conceived in Gods name, are often polluted. Though the forme be not alwayes ſo expreſſe, the intent and meaning of ſuch atteſtations may, for the moſt part, be the ſame with that which <hi>Ioſuah</hi> vſed, <hi>cap.</hi> 24. <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>And Ioſuah wrote theſe words in the booke of the Law of God; and tooke

Againe, it will be graunted but by a few of our writers (though <hi>Vaſques</hi> take it for vnqueſtionable) that <hi>Iacob</hi> did truely worſhip the ſtone, but God alone <hi>preſente lapide,</hi> as <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Nac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantum epiſt. ad Rom cap. <hi>1.</hi> loco citato.</note> ſome of his ſect perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues they honour God <hi>in the Images preſence, not the Image.</hi> Of many expoſitions, to this purpoſe, I might make better vſe againſt <hi>Bellarmine</hi> &amp; <hi>Sacroboſcus</hi> than I can againſt <hi>Vaſques,</hi> who hath drawne the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie about <hi>Image-worſhip</hi> to ſuch a ſtrait and narrow iſſue, that by pinching him too hard or too haſtily in theſe paſſages, we may giue him opportunity to <hi>bruſh</hi> vs of, or occaſion him to ſtand at <hi>bay.</hi> Whereas if wee giue him leaue to take his own courſe through them, he will quickly run himſelfe ſo far out of breath, that we may eaſily overtake him on plain ground, or driue him into that net, out of which there is no poſſibility of evaſion. Be it granted then (to this end, and no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) that <hi>Iacob</hi> did not onely adore God <hi>praeſente lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi> but <hi>ſalute</hi> or <hi>adore</hi> the ſtone withall, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as <hi>Vaſques</hi> would haue Images worſhipped, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their prototypons: will it hence follow that ſuch as frame their devotions by <hi>Vaſques</hi> his rule, doe not tranſgreſſe the law of God, doe not remoue the bounds of the ancient, or commit no more Idolatrie than <hi>Iacob</hi> did?

For what profeſſor of magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſecrets at this day is there, which cannot, which doth not pretend the like examples of Patriarkes or Prophets for their ſuperſtitious practiſes? As Satan is Gods ape; ſo Idolatry and ſorcery, (the two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall parts of his ſervice) haue their originall for the moſt part, from an apiſh imitation of ſome ſacred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, rites or ceremonies vſed by Gods ſervants. He is a counterfeit Lord, and his profeſſed or domeſticke ſervants muſt be cloathed in ſuch liveries, as may beare ſome counterfeit colour of Saints garments. The reaſon why moſt men ſlide more eaſily and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into theſe two ſinnes, than into any other (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ſuſpition of any danger, oftimes with preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of doing well) may be gathered; partly from the propertie of mans nature aſſigned by the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher; partly from the Apoſtles character of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man: <hi>Qui non percipit quae ſunt ſpiritûs Dei; who cannot perceiue matters of the ſpirit.</hi> Man by nature is of all creatures moſt apt to imitate, and the naturall man moſt vnapt rightly to imitate or expreſſe the ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or motions of the Spirit, which cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than ſpiritually diſcerned; much leſſe managed.

his preſent profeſſion with the poſſible hopes of a martiall life; out of this doubtfull diſtaſt of his preſent eſtate, whoſe beſt ſolace was ſecurity from bodily dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
frames a preſage vnto himſelfe not much vnlike vnto that of <hi>Ionathans,</hi> 
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">and it was to throw vp his axe into an high tree, having conditioned with himſelfe, that if it came downe againe, he would take it vp and follow his wonted trade; but if it ſhould chance to hang in the boughs, he would ſeeke to raiſe himſelfe and his familie by the warres; </hi>as afterward he ſtrangely did: for he himſelfe became ſo great a Commander, that <hi>Sforza</hi> his ſonne, vpon the foundations which he had laid, did advance him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the Dukedome of <hi>Millaine.</hi>
For every repining diſcontented peazant to put the forſaking or follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his wonted calling vnto the like caſuall devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, would be a tempting of God: to prognoſticate the ſame ſucceſſe, from experience of the like event; albeit he had opportunitie to try the concluſion, with the ſame axe, vpon the ſame tree, would be ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: to reſt confident in ſuch perſwaſions, would be to ſettle vpon the dregs of ſorcery. <hi>Charles</hi> the fift did once ſalute the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſhore, whereof he was, (vnder God,) the ſupreame Lord, in ſuch an affectionate and proſtrate manner, as his meaneſt vaſſall could not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily haue ſaluted either him, or it, without juſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of groſſe Idolatry. And yet I ſhould ſuſpect him to be way wardly ſuperſtitious or ſuperſtitiouſly peeviſh, that would peremptorily condemne this his ſtrange behaviour, of ſuperſtition, or cenſure it as ill beſeeming ſo heroicall a ſpirit, for the preſent; though at other times it might haue ſeemed, not

vaine or fooliſh onely, but <hi>Apiſhly impious.</hi> His late farewell to the warres and reſignation of the Empire, his longing deſire to giue ſolemne teſtimony of his loue to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation, his ſafe arrivall (after long abſence and eſcapes of many dangers) in that ſoyle, many of whoſe ſonnes had ſpent their liues in his ſervice, and wherein he purpoſed to ſpend the reſt of his life in the ſervice of his God, in that ſoyle, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe cuſtody he then publickly bequeathed his bones, did extract theſe ſignificant and extraordinary expreſſions of his extraordinary and ſwelling affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from him. And ſuch expreſſions as are ridiculous or rather impious when they are affected or faſhioned by forced affection, are alwayes pardonable, for the moſt part commendable, when they proceede from an vnexpected inſtinct or <hi>vnmaſterable</hi> impulſion. All extraordinary diſpoſitions, as <hi>loue, ioy, ſorrow,</hi> or <hi>feare,</hi> whether naturall or ſacred, naturally deſire a ſpeedie vent, and that vent is fitteſt, which firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelfe without ſeeking. The ſuddaine motions wherewith ſuch full paſsions ſeeke to expreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, are vncapable of rule or method. To put the characters of ordinary complement or behaviour vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; breeds greater violence or incumbrance, than gyues or fetters to a man diſpoſed to daunce, or manicles to one provoked to boyſterous fight. And as the Sunne in his ſtrength cannot directly ejaculate his beames vpon any body capable of heat and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, but others adioyning will be ſecondary participants of theſe qualities by reflection; ſo cannot our affections be ſtrongly and intenſiuely ſet vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny object extraordinarily amiable or louely, but ſome
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:7903:178"/>
rayes or branches of them will redouble vpon thoſe ſenſible creatures which haue ſpeciall affinity with it, though of themſelues vncapable of any loue. Tender and endeared reſpects to mens perſons, will alwayes leaue ſome touch of gratefull affection towardes the place wherein we haue enioyed any memorable fruit of their preſence. Thus <hi>Andromache</hi> bereft of her yong ſonnes company, deſires his garments to reſt her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildie affections vpon them. Nor dare I cenſure this her deſire as vnlawfull, leſt I ſhould condemne the generation of the juſt. For did not old <hi>Iacob</hi> expreſſe the tender affection which he bare to the ſonne of his age whom he now never lookt to ſee againe, by kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his coate? yet to haue hanged it vp about his bed or table, that it might receiue ſuch ſalutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s evening and morning, or at every meale-time, might haue countenanced many branches of ſuperſtition. <hi>Once and vſe it not,</hi> in moſt like caſes is the true rule of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion; continuall vſe of that, which vpon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions is not vnlawfull, degenerates (no man knowes how) into abuſe. God in his Law permits a kinde of ceremonious mourning for the dead, but preſcribes a meane withall. So then to mourne is naturall; but to mourne continually, or to feed our griefe by artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall repreſentions, is ſuperſtitious.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To the inſtance of <hi>Iacobs</hi> worſhipping the ſtone: the internall ſenſe or touch of Gods extraordinary preſence, inſpired his breaſt with extraordinary paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And to reflect or exonerate themſelues vpon ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible circumſtances, is altogether as naturall to the fulneſſe of thoſe affections which proceed from ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall cauſes, as to their fulneſſe, whoſe cauſes
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:7903:179"/>
are meerely naturall. The meere imitation of naturall motions is alwayes artificiall, never naturall. The imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſuch motions or externall actions, as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally flow from ſupernaturall inſpiration, is hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall; artificially Sathanicall. Howbeit the <hi>Romanist</hi> cannot ſo properly be ſayd to imitate, as to invert <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> behaviour, whiles he ſeekes to raiſe his affections by ſaluting or adoring Images, or to tranſmit the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which he ſo raiſeth, to God or the Saints by Images of his owne erection. This is in truth not to invocate but to conjure God or the Saints. The imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (if ſo we call it) is as prepoſterous, as if a man ſhould ſtriue to propheſie or counterfeit viſions by affecting to ſpeake non-ſence, becauſe ſome Prophets in their viſions haue beene raught beyond their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. In fine, the ſcholaſticke ape, while he exactly imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates his maſter Satan that ſets him a worke, and his manner of worſhipping God by Images, hath the ſame proportion to <hi>Iacobs</hi> worſhipping (which he pretends for his warrant) that the voyces or motions of bodies aſſumed by wicked ſpirits, haue to the vitall motions or ſpeeches of living men. The one moue themſelues as the ſpirit which God hath implanted in them directs; the other ſuffer ſuch motions as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant ſpirits put vpon them. The old <hi>Saracens</hi> ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a ſtone, may with better probabilitie be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by <hi>Iacobs</hi> example, than the vſuall worſhip of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages in the <hi>Romiſh Church.</hi>

                  <hi>Vaſques</hi> hath very well refuted.

Secondly, becauſe <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai</hi> proteſted his readineſſe to doe <hi>Haman</hi> greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour than was exacted, ſo his people might haue bin preſerved or advanced by his deiection.

And albeit <hi>Haman</hi> was bent to doe the <hi>Iewes</hi> an extraordinary miſchiefe for <hi>Mordecais</hi> ſake; yet <hi>Mordecai</hi> had no opportunitie offered him by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence to prevent it by ſubmiſſion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to <hi>Haman,</hi> but rather by ſtanding out againſt him. In this generall then, <hi>Vaſques</hi> and wee well agree, that ſuch externall worſhip as vpon ſpeciall and rare occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions may be lawfully exhibited to ſome creatures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Idololatricall by vſe or continuance, without concurrence of like occaſions.
The iſſue which wee deſire to joyne with him and his fellowes, from theſe grounds, ſhall be this Firſt,<q> whether the homage, which they doe to Images be not in it ſelfe much greater, and, in reſpect of many circumſtances, far more ſolemne than <hi>Haman</hi> required of <hi>Mordecai?</hi> Secondly, whether the exhibition of it in Gods Temples be not more frequent and vſuall, than <hi>Mordecais</hi> occaſions and neceſſities of ſaluting <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> could haue beene in <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> Court?</q>
Herein onely they truely follow <hi>Mordecais</hi> example, that they
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:7903:181"/>
ſeldome or never communicate Gods honour to ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Princes; but on ſtockes or ſtones they vſually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow all the ſignes of ſubmiſſion or other ſolemnities that can be appropriated to Gods ſervice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſtrict tenour of Gods commandement, and that ſignificant character, whereby he expreſſeth his ſpeciall obſervance of mens demeanour in this point, evidently condemne the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> of abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Idolatry; yet in my judgement it doth no way preiudice the performance of ſuch externall reſpect, or ſuch teſtification of reverence vnto true reliques of Saints, or vncouth places (ſometimes extraordinarily graced with Gods preſence) as <hi>Iacob</hi> tendered vnto the ſtone. We ought in theſe caſes to moderate the impulſions which their ſight would procure, by the analogie of that libertie, which diſcretion and good manners grants vs in other points, wherewith the occaſions of Idolatrie haue moſt affinitie. For Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is but a ſpirituall fornication or adultery. Now there is no man of diſcretion, though otherwiſe more iealous than he hath iuſt cauſe, but will permit his wife to ſalute his friends vpon ſpeciall occaſions, or at firſt meetings after long abſence. But ſuppoſe a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, vpon this libertie, ſhould preſume to continue the ſame ſalutations evening and morning, or moſt houres of the day, for a moneth together, and plead her excuſe from the analogie of <hi>Romiſh Catechiſmes</hi> in caſes of conſcience concerning ſpirituall adulterie, thus; Sir, I thought I might as freely kiſſe my friends and yours, at one time, as at another; at all times, as well as at any, ſo long as I kiſſe them onely with kiſſes of loue and kindneſſe, not of luſt and wantonneſſe.

Would this diſtinction giue iuſt ſatisfaction to any husband, no farther iealous than he hath occaſion? I thinke no <hi>Ieſuite</hi> would relie vpon it, if he ſhould be detected to be thus over familiar with another mans wife of better ſpirit. And yet in expreſſe denying the equitie of this apologie, they implicitly graunt that their mother doth preſume farther vpon the patience of the Almightie (who in this caſe hath proteſted his eſpeciall iealouſie) than any ſecular Strumpet dare, vpon the patience of her loving or doting husband. <hi>She hath done all the workes of a preſumptuous whoriſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, building her high places in the corner of every way, and making her high places in every ſtreet, and hath not bin as an harlot that deſpiſeth a reward, but as a wife that play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the harlot, and taketh others for her husband</hi>

And being deprived of their company proſtrates her ſelfe, evening and morning, all the houres of the day and night, vnto carved Images of both ſexes; with whom her Lord and husband hath ſo ſtrictly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den her all familiaritie.

The wiſeſt of her ſonnes are now become ſo fooliſh, as to publiſh with their mouths, what ſhe had long ſince ſaid in the pride of her heart:
<hi>Tuſh God was a iealous God in the dayes of the Synagogue his former wife, which wanted diſcretion and proued vnfaithfull</hi>: <q>but this his new Spouſe, our holy mother the Catholicke Church, is more wiſe and gratious in his eyes, able to warrant whatſoever is done by her appointment; ſhe knows how to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor and pleaſe her loving husband, who is not like man that he ſhould be jealous of her carriage, that meanes no harme &amp; cannot behaue her ſelfe amiſſe, though, to vnfaithfull eyes, ſhe may ſeeme outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to doe as wantons doe.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. God indeed is never jealous as men are, without grounds of juſt occaſion, yet more tenderly obſervant of his <hi>ſpouſes</hi> demeanour in this kinde, than any hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is of his wifes; becauſe he knowes (as by his law he would giue vs to vnderſtand) that familiaritie or dalliance with ſtrange and wanton lovers, is not ſo powerfull to corrupt the weaker ſex, as kiſſing or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne ſalutations of graven Images, is to pollute the wiſeſt ſoules, or to enveigle the ſtrongeſt faith.

                  <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> ſhould be ignorant, that the viſible exhibition of Chriſt in the fleſh, makes all ſervice of graven Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges more abominable in the Chriſtians, than it could haue beene in the <hi>Iew.</hi> It is a truth ſealed by the new Teſtament as well as by the Law, We heard a voyce, we ſaw no ſimilitude beſides the engraven Image of Gods ſubſtance, by whom, though he ſpeake moſt plentifully to the world, yet ſpake he nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Images. Neither is there any inſtance or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact in all the new Teſtament, that can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for worſhipping Images or other viſible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with ſuch <hi>ſhew</hi> of probabilitie, as the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Iacob</hi> may be. But whether <hi>Iacob</hi> did onely worſhip God, <hi>praeſente lapide,</hi> or whether he did in ſome ſort externally worſhip or coadore the ſtone with God; or whether he did make vnto himſelfe ſuch ſenſible atteſtation of his ſolemne vow, by anointing the ſtone, and erecting it into a pillar, as wee doe of our ſolemne oaths by kiſſing of the booke: I leaue it to the Reader; though for mine owne part I like this laſt <hi>forme</hi> of <hi>ſpeech</hi> the beſt.
But however mens opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s may vary concerning the <hi>forme</hi> of <hi>ſpeech,</hi> the matter moſt to be conſidered by all (which ſeemes to me a truth vnqueſtionable,) is this: <q>If the wiſeſt or moſt circumſpect man on earth ſhould worſhip God in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very place, after the ſame manner (for every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance) that <hi>Iacob</hi> did God in <hi>Bethel</hi>; or, if the moſt accurate Anatomiſt of his owne thoughts or affections, ſhould take every ſtone into ſuch conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, whileſt he worſhippeth God, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did that ſtone: <hi>He</hi> ſhould become a groſſe Idolater without all helpe from any diſtinction, wherewith
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:7903:183"/>
the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> can furniſh him. The truth is, that <hi>Iacob</hi> did ſo worſhip God in the preſence of the ſtone, as his poſteritie were bound to worſhip him before the Arke of the Covenant. Both worſhipped him <hi>in</hi> or <hi>by</hi> thoſe creatures, after ſuch a manner, as wee may not worſhip him in any created viſible ſubſtance, ſaue onely in that <hi>created ſubſtance</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he dwelleth bodily.</q>
The manner of his preſence (then) at <hi>Luz</hi> or <hi>Bethel,</hi> and in the Arke, were ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes or pledges of his inhabitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the man Chriſt Ieſus; in whom, were he preſent on earth, wee might and ought to adore God in ſuch a manner, as would be ſacrilegious to adore him in any other man or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:7903:184"/>
one and the ſame rule of law. There is no man ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly wiſe, but would ſooner requeſt his prayers whom he knows to be diſhoneſt or of irreligious life, then beare a ſolemne teſtimony of his honeſtie or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Mutuall prayer, is a dutie enioyned vs while we liue together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the practiſe of it, is the beſt <hi>meane</hi> to make bad men good, and good men better. But men deceaſed, whether elect or reprobates, are vncapable of amendment, either by our prayers for them, or theirs for vs. Nor doe the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> enioyne vs to pray to ſuppoſed Saints, with purpoſe to encreaſe their happineſſe, or, as if they ſtood in need of our devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. To pray for any whom it is lawfull publickly to pray vnto, is by their doctrine a foule diſgrace vnto the Saint; a point of infidelitie in the ſupplicant. Praying to Saints is by their opinion on our part a dutie or tribute wherewith we are bound to honour them: their prayers or interceſſions for vs, are Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favours or graces which muſt be ſought, not as acts of debt or mutuall dutie, but by religious ſervice and ſupplication. Now, admitting it were lawfull to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate thus vnto S. <hi>Peter,</hi> or vnto others whom we beleeue and know to be true Saints; yet, in publike liturgies, to offer vp our prayers and vowes vpon our knees, either in honour of thoſe with whoſe liues and deaths we are altogether vnacquainted, or of thoſe whom we ſuſpect to haue lived and dyed not ſo well, as we could wiſh to doe our ſelues, is a ſinne, ſo much more grievous to good conſciences, than bearing te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony vpon oath for mens poſitiue honeſtie whom we know not; as ſtealing of treaſure out of the Church is in reſpect of ſimple theft or burglarie. Teſtimonies
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:7903:185"/>
given vpon oath require certaintie of ſence or experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and tendering of prayers as a tribute or honor, or in teſtification of our religious reſpect, requires cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of faith, that the partie to whom they are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, is worthy of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2.
<q>The ground of this difference betweene pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to living men, and praying to deceaſed Saints, (which the ſuperſtitious Doctors ſeeke to conceale from the ſimple) may very well be gathered by <hi>ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie</hi> of <note n="*" place="margin">Bellar. l. <hi>3.</hi> de Sanctor. beatitud. cap. <hi>9.</hi>

                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> reſolution in another point of their ſervice. <hi>Promiſes</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>religiouſly made to living members of the Church militant, are but promiſes: but ſo made vnto Saints or members of the Church tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, they are truely and properly vowes.</hi> His firſt reaſon is, becauſe a vow is but a promiſe vnto God, and our promiſes vnto Saints are liker our promiſes vnto God than vnto the promiſes, which we make to mortall men. For, as that which we promiſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, is vnprofitable vnto him, but profitable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, and is tendered onely by vs in ſigne of honour and thankfulneſſe; ſo whatſoever we promiſe vnto Saints, it cannot profit them but our ſelues. Their happie eſtate ſtands in need of nothing that is ours; all that we offer and promiſe them, is in teſtimony of the honour which wee owe them, or in ſigne of our thankfulneſſe to them. But performance of our promiſes, either is or may be profitable to living men, becauſe mortalitie ſtands in neede of <hi>many things.</hi> Secondly, the Saints can haue no title to our vowes, <hi>Niſi quatenus ſunt Dij per participationem; but in as much as they are Gods by participation.</hi> Now we know the Saints which raigne with Chriſt to be
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:7903:185"/>
ſuch: but that ſuch as liue with vs, are partakers of the divine nature, wee may hope well, certaine wee cannot be. Thirdly, the Saints in heaven are <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, glorious,</hi> the ſonnes of <hi>God,</hi> Gods by participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe they are confirmed in their eſtate, and are not ſubject to change or Apoſtaſie; to both which all in this life having their bliſſe and glory rather in <hi>ſpe</hi> than in <hi>re,</hi> are (in his judgement) <hi>ſtill obnoxious.</hi>
                  </q>
From theſe reſolutions wee thus infer. If promiſes, then the prayers which we make to Saints, haue greater affinity with the prayers which we make to God, than with our requeſt to living men, that they would pray for vs. To ſpeake properly, we pray men, we doe not vſe to pray vnto them. But as vnto God, ſo vnto Saints, men of the <hi>Romane Churches</hi> catechizing vſe to pray, &amp; that ſolemnly, becauſe they hold them <hi>Gods</hi> by <hi>participation.</hi> Now as we might not worſhip our redeemer <hi>Cultu latriae with divine worſhip,</hi> vnleſſe we were by faith aſſured that he were truely God: ſo admitting the invocation or worſhipping of true Saints <hi>Cultu Duliae,</hi> were warranted by the word of God; yet might we not worſhip any with this kinde of worſhip, without like certaintie of faith, that they are <hi>Gods</hi> by <hi>participation,</hi> or <hi>heires</hi> of glory. Had this great Clerke beene mindfull, in his third booke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the worſhipping of Saints, of what he had ſaid before in the firſt, he would in wiſedome haue concealed theſe concluſions. Or if he had in the firſt booke foreſeene the neceſſitie of this reſolution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning vows, <hi>ſhame</hi> would haue made him diſclaime the practiſe of praying though privately vnto vnca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized Saints, whoſe lawfulneſſe, he there maintains
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:7903:186"/>
by the ſame plea, that Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> vſed; <hi>Oramus viuentes etiamſi neſciamus eſſe Sanctos, cur non defunctos quando maiori ratione confidimus eſſe ſanctos, We pray li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving men to pray for vs, albeit we know them not to be Saints; and why not men deceaſed, whom we may on bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſons hope to be Saints; though this we may not doe in publicke Letanies and ſacred Service?</hi> Now; they may not invocate ſuch Saints in publicke Liturgies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church hath forbidden it, otherwiſe <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzens Proſopopaeia,</hi> in his <hi>Panegyricke</hi> to <hi>Baſil</hi> or <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> might haue beene a ſufficient warrant to haue conceived a publicke hymne in the ſame forme. But (as I ſaid) we pray living men to pray for vs, as we are readie to doe for them; we pray not vnto them; we giue no ſolemne teſtimony of their ſanctitie, whoſe ſinceritie we miſtruſt; though this were leſſe ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and diſhonourable vnto God, then praying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them whom we know not to be Saints, albeit to pray vnto knowne Saints, were no ſacriledge. For what prepoſterous partialitie is this? that God muſt manifeſt his right to ſupreme honour by his workes of creation and providence; that our Saviour which died for vs, muſt plead his title to the like, by miracles, whileſt he lived; by his reſurrection from the dead, and glorious aſcenſion into heaven: and yet men that were ſubiect to the ſame paſſions as we our ſelues are, muſt be worſhipped after death, with ſuch worſhip as is more like to the honour which wee owe to God, than any reſpect or reverence, which is due to the beſt man living; and all this without any evidence of their ſanctitie, or juſt proofe of their right vnto ſuch obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies.</p>

No; in that the words of the Decree expreſly forbid all publike wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Saints not canonized; the Interpretors gather, it was his purpoſe to allow them private worſhip. They may yet haue houſhold Saints of their owne chooſing, to whom they may tender all the points of religious obſequies hitherto mentioned, not in ſecret onely, but as many looking on as lift, ſo it be not in the open Church or in ſolemne ſervice. For publicke worſhip, (ſuch as in that Decree is onely forbidden) is not oppoſed to ſecret or private worſhip, where none beſides God and good friends be preſent. The prohibition of it, vnleſſe the penaltie be great, and the enquirie ſtrict, licenceth any worſhip, that is not tendred in the <hi>name,</hi> &amp; as the inſtitution of the whole Church.

greater devotion in their chambers or private chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells, than if their open ſervice had beene authorized in Churches. A man may take a deadly ſurfeit as well at home as at a publicke feaſt; and ſpirituall ſurfeiting or drunkenneſſe being the diſeaſe, which Pope <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> ſought to cure, his preſcript was no better, than if a Phyſician ſhould ſtrictly charge an intemperate glutton or drunkard to be abſtemious at great feaſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, leaving him to his bellies diſcretion, at his owne Table or amongſt his companions in private meetings.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Never had the infernall powers, ſince their fall, ſo juſt occaſion given them by any creatures, of inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and triumph at the wonderfull ſucceſſe of their policies, as by theſe latter <hi>Romaniſts</hi>; who as well by
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:7903:195"/>
Apologizing for their ſuperſtition towards the dead (whereof others haue chalenged them,) as by ſeeking to reforme ſome groſſe abuſes whereof themſelues were aſhamed, haue beene fetcht over to commit more deteſtable and more blaſphemous idolatry with living men, than any Heathen ever did with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Heroicks, with their falſe Gods, or true devills. Such as worſhipped thoſe beaſtly <hi>Romane</hi> Emperours, whom their Succeſſors <hi>conſecrated,</hi> were not bound to beleeue, nor could their Succeſſors perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that the Senate could not erre, or doe amiſſe in decreeing divine honour to them. That people not knowing what faith meant, did onely as their chiefe Magiſtrates commanded them, nor did theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all throughout the Empire to be partakers with them in their idolatrous worſhip. But now to diſpute whether the Pope doe well or amiſſe in canonizing men after death, whom he knew not living; is held a point of hereſie or infidelitie. His abſolute infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie as well in declaring who are Saints, as in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining what honour is due vnto them, is preſt vpon vs as a Maxime of faith. And is not this to worſhip him with divine honour? That conceipt which the old <hi>Romanes</hi> had of their conſecrated Emperours, came as farre ſhort of this divine excellency, which <hi>Papiſts</hi> imagine in the Pope, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> opinion of their <hi>Meſsias</hi> whom they expected ſhould be a King, doth of that eſteeme which true Chriſtians make of Chriſt, whom they adore as God. The ſuperſtitious <hi>knowledge,</hi> or rather the practicall <hi>ignorance</hi> of the true God differeth no otherwiſe in <hi>Rome-Heathen</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Rome-Chriſtian,</hi> than the ordinary knowledge of
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:7903:195"/>
Chriſt in the old Teſtament and in the New. The idolatry of <hi>Rome-Heathen</hi> agrees with the idolatry of <hi>Rome-Chriſtian,</hi> as the type or ſhadow with the body or ſubſtance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> giveth <hi>Melancthon</hi> the lye for ſaying the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> aſcribes a divine power to Saints in knowing mens thoughts. I aske them, not knowing our thoughts, how can they know our petitions? No Catholique (ſaith he) did ever teach, that they know our prayers as they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceived in our minds, but as they are in God, who reveales them to his Saints and Angels. He would not thus fiercely avert the imputation of the Antecedent, vnleſſe he knew the inference to be legall and vnavoydable. To pray then to Saints, out of preſumed beliefe that they know the ſecrets of our hearts, were by his confeſſion to aſcribe a divinitie vnto them, and to worſhip them with divine honour: plaine idolatrie. Therefore they pray vnto them out of aſſurance that God who ſees our hearts, acquaints them with our hearts deſires. Yet that one Saint, that every Saint ſhould by this meanes know every mans prayers, that is enjoyned to pray vnto them, neceſſarily ſuppoſeth a participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that infinite knowledge, which is incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. To ſee the ſecrets of mans heart, is one of Gods peculiar titles. If Saints by enioying his preſence, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy this ſight; no reaſon can be conceived why in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him they may not ſee all things that are in him, all that he ſees. And ſo they ſhall not be onely Gods, but (as was obſerved before) Gods Almightie by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation. But admitting that all ſuch as enioy Gods preſence doe heare our prayers; I demaund what
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:7903:196"/>
ground of beliefe <hi>Romane Catholiques</hi> can haue that many whom they muſt pray vnto, are partakers of Gods preſence? Onely this; <hi>The Pope hath canonized them.</hi> But ſeeing the world is full of diſſimulation and hypocriſie; ſeeing men are partiall to giue better te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of ſuch as they ſeeke to preferre, than they can deſerue: how can his <hi>Holines</hi> know them to be true Saints, vnleſſe he know their hearts by better te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony than humane? As a Chriſtian, he knowes that <hi>onely the pure in heart enioy the bleſſed ſight of God.</hi> But how can he ſo infallibly know, as becomes a Pope, whether ſuch as lived in <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> in <hi>Aſia, America,</hi> or other remote parts of the world, were pure in heart or but hypocrites? If he may erre in this knowledge, the people muſt erre in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Their reſolution of this point comes to this finall iſſue. Saints celeſtiall ſee our hearts in ſeeing God. <hi>Romane Catholiques</hi> ſee the integritie and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their hearts, whoſe faces they never ſaw, in the Pope or by reading his decrees. He ſtands as God to them on earth, as the true God is to the Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. He knowes as certainely who goes to heaven, and what they doe there, as God knowes what is done in earth. And out of this confident beliefe of his infallible all-ſeeing ſpirit, his creatures pray to S. <hi>Francis, Dominicke, Aquinas,</hi> as vnto ſecondary or intermediate Interceſſors, with the ſame aſſurance of faith, that they doe to Chriſt, as to their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Mediatour. And reaſon they haue ſo to doe. God Almightie hath ſaid that Chriſt is in heaven; and the Pope hath ſayd of <hi>Aquinas, Dominicke,</hi> or ſome
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:7903:196"/>
other, they are in heaven. Thus like fooliſh Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or Freſh water Souldiers, after they had beene long carried vp and downe with the blaſts of vaine doctrine, fearing ſhip-wracke in the open Ocean of former ages idolatrie, (and yet aſhamed to returne to the Haven whence they <hi>looſed,</hi> leſt wiſe men ſhould laugh at them) they put in at the jawes of hell for Harbour.</p>

Hence they imagined ſuch a correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency between him and other gods or goddeſſes of meaner ranke, as is betweene the father of every fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, his wife and children and other domeſtickes: or as is betweene the chiefe of every Tribe or Clan, and his alliance or dependants; or at the beſt ſuch as is betweene Princes and the ſeverall orders of their Nobilitie.

But the belly had neither eyes nor eares, nor can it be pleaſed with pleaſant ſonets though of feaſtings, or with faireſt pictures of daintieſt meates. Men pinched with hunger or ready to periſh for want of looking to, haue ſmall deſire of wealth or greatneſſe, ſaue onely for bettering their fare or attenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Such ſmell-feaſts, as <hi>Homer</hi> was, or rather ſuch as he ſought to pleaſe, or ſet forth vnto vs, conceived the <hi>life</hi> of their Gods to be ſuch, as themſelues would haue led, had they beene in their place. The greateſt part of heavenly joy ſeemed to conſiſt in the quinteſſence of ſuch delicates as they had ſeene or taſted, or in the magnificent va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of royall ſervice. Not much better was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate <hi>Iewes</hi> conceipt of the ſacrifice appointed by their God. For that reproofe; [<hi>Thinkeſt thou that I will eate the fleſh of Bulls, or drinke the bloud of Goats?</hi>] ſeemes to argue a like faultineſſe in them of meaſuring the Almighties delight by their owne appetite.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others out of a Philoſophicall deriſion of high prized vanities or ſuperfluities, tranſformed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Gods into that diſpoſition, which liked them beſt. Vacancy from care was the body, innoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous merriment or recreation the ſoule of that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which they affected as their portion in this life: the whole world was to them but a ſtage, wherein Princes and Stateſmen ſerved as Actors, the alteration of States and Kingdomes, but matter of Comoedie to feede their phantaſies and paſſe the time. Agreeable
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:7903:199"/>
to this humor their opinion was, that the chiefe vſe or care the Gods had of men of beſt wit, place, or faſhion was no other, than men had of Apes or Munkeies, or then great ones haue of fooles and jeſters, or Lords of miſrules; which kinde of ridiculous creatures are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times better kept and attended, then befits their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, meerely for their ſport that maintaine them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such as had rightly valued the ſecret joy of contemplation in regard of all other contentments or ſolaces of mortalitie, reſted ſecure they had done the divine nature no wrong, but grace rather, in admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to be chiefe ſharer in this kind of pure delight. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thinkes, that if the ſweetneſſe of that ioy, which ſomtimes had raught his ſpirits, could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued freſh and liuely without interruption of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary diſturbances, defatigation, or ſatietie, it might make vp ſo full a meaſure of <hi>felicitie,</hi> as might well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit the principall mouer, or ſupreme diſpoſer of the heavenly Orbes, that is the ſupreme power, which he knew or did acknowledge.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Out of the groſſeſt ſpeculations of heathen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God much matter of no vulgar conſequence might be extracted. Howbeit the beſt of their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was alwayes mingled with folly, and the pureſt truth, that can be found in their writings, ſtill detained in vnrighteouſneſſe. As in that booke <hi>De Mundo ad Alexandrum</hi> (aſcribed to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> by greater autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of the auncient, then will eaſily be overſwayed by <hi>noetericall Criticiſmes,</hi> or moderne coniectures) how many paſſages be there conſonant to Chriſtian truth about the vnitie, the wiſedome, and glory of the God-head: and yet while he ſeekes to ſurpaſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

in exemplifying the excellency of divine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, he finally tranſformes it into the corrupt likeneſſe of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchie. To reſerue cauſes of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall importance to the Prince, referring others of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary moment to the inferior Iudges, was a point of wiſedome apprehended by the auncient heathen, yet quickly aſſented vnto by <hi>Moſes,</hi> the man of God and chiefe governour of his people. This adviſe, which he followed vpon neceſſitie, was afterwards entertained by ſecular Princes as the mother of eaſe or nurſe of pleaſure; by many improved to the maintenance of their Maieſtie. The author of the former booke could meaſure the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarches greatneſſe by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſubiects and amplitude of dominions. But to match theſe with an equall extent of provident care for the good of moſt particulars, was to diminiſh his pompe or glory; a great impeachment to his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Glorious and happie he rather ſeemed in this, that having the abſolute commaund of ſo many, he needed to trouble himſelfe with the governance one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſome few Provinces, by nature more choyſe and delicate, much beautified by art, as ſo many pleaſant gardens to entertaine his royall preſence with varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of delight. The charge and over-ſight of others, affording leſſe ſolace and more toyle, was aſſigned to Vicegerents; whoſe accompts (if called they were at any time to account) were as ſpeedily diſpatched, as the briefe inſtructions for their proceedings were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. This over-prizing the contentments of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall life, whoſe practiſe could plead no warrant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the limited perfection of humane excellency, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned a like tranſfiguration of the divine Maieſtie

                  <q>Non vacat exiguis rebus adeſſe Iovi.</q>
He who had made the earth and all therein, muſt leaue the charge and government of it and all the reſt of this inferior tumultuous Globe (as little beſeeming ſo great a Maieſtie) vnto his Angells or Deputie-gods. The ſuper coeleſtiall region muſt be to him as was <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> or <hi>Ecbatana</hi> to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings, not onely the ſole garden of his delight or totall ſphere of his reſidence, but the compleat horizon of his glorious ſight: the immortall inhabitants thereof, the onely pupills, of whom, without diſparagement to his dignitie, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairement of his ioy or happineſſe, he might vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to take immediate and perſonall charge.</p>

No man, that thinkes too charitably of himſelfe, but will eaſily be perſwaded, that he is as charitable, as any man living towards others; towards ſuch eſpecially to whom charitie is moſt due. To ſpeake well of Chriſt and their King, no man more forward, than ſome kinde of drunkards.

And, if at any time they be ſweetly merry without quarrelling or offence; or if each tickle other with exchange of mutuall applauſe or delightfull toyes; they miſtake their meetings for feaſts of charitie. Some of this ſect, will not ſticke to profeſſe how highly they ſcorne, that any dull ſowre Stoicks devotion, at Gods board, ſhould be ſo well ſeaſoned with loue, as are their friendly paſtimes at

But if Gods Embaſſadour, as time and place require, ſhall open his mouth againſt them, it is in their conſtruction but to giue a vent vnto malice, with whoſe abundance his heart would otherwiſe burſt. To thinke thus maliciouſly of others, is held by them in this humor eſpecially, rather an effect, than breach of charitie. For not being able to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh that true and abſolute good, which they ought at all times moſt to affect, from that, which ſeemes good to them thus affected, they kindly well-come their eager deſires of enjoying the wonted pleaſures of good fellowſhip without moleſtation, for the fruits of peace. There is no foule of the ayre nor beaſt of the field, either by kinde or breeding ſo wilde or brutiſh, as to abandon all tearmes of loue, or deſire of peace with ſome others; but that exceſſiue loue, which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous beaſts beare to their yong ones or conſorts, doth ſtill animate them with rage &amp; fury againſt man, their lawfull Soveraigne, and whets their appetite to devour and prey with more than wonted greedineſſe, vpon ſilly and harmeleſſe creatures. In like ſort that loue, which bad minded men mutually foſter among themſelues, alwayes proues the mother of deadly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and vncharitableneſſe towards all ſuch, as loue God and his lawes; for theſe are greateſt enemies to that kinde of peace, which they onely know, and moſt deſire. Thus by a worſe error, than can rightly be emblematized by <hi>lxions</hi> fabulous imaginations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the fumes of wine are often miſtaken for the motions of the ſpirit, factious amitie goes currant for true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſocietie, riotous mirth or other vnhallowed ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace is entertained as the comfort or peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:

All the miſperſwaſions hitherto mentioned, are but ſo many reciprocations of that deception, which was obſerved before to be the maine Conduit or common ſpring of Idolatrie in the Heathen.

The Chriſtian in what kinde ſoever alike exorbitant (if we compare his ſecret perſwaſions, or preſumptions either of Gods favourable affection or indulgence towards his perſon, or approbation of his enormous actions, with his profeſſed beliefe of the ſame Gods abſolute puritie, juſtice, holineſſe, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partialitie) makes the Almightie Creator, which made him man (that is the comelieſt of all viſible creatures) an hideous deformed monſter. The faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this inviſible Creator in viſible ſhape; the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of ſuppoſed divine powers ſo faſhioned, were rather acceſſaries than principalls in the nature of this ſinne which we now reproue. At the leaſt, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract or divide the divine power into ſeverall formes or portions not much diſagreeable to ſome particular diſtinct attributes of the true God, is leſſe abominable than to frame a multiplicitie of contrary wills, or commixture of diſſonant affections or reſolutions in one indiviſible, eternall, immutable Eſſence.

And Mary hath choſen that good part, which ſhall not be taken away from her.</hi> Luk. chap. 10. verſ. 41, 42.] in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes a Maxime of ſacred vſe, and will warrant this Aphoriſme; [That a life priviledged with vacancie from ſecular imployments for better meditation on heavenly matters, is the moſt compendious courſe to that endleſſe life, which every Chriſtian propoſeth as the ſole end of this weariſome pilgrimage.] Were our hearts conſtant in themſelues, and ſtedfaſtly ſetled vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the former generall truth; it were impoſſible our inclination or aſſent to it, ſhould not be ſwayed as ſtrongly to the practiſes ſubordinate.

The naturall ſituation of the former generall aſſent was thus; [<hi>The true ſence and meaning of our Saviours adviſe is alwayes beſt, and to be followed before any contrary counſell.</hi>] But when free choyce of oppoſite particulars is preſented, it turnes thus; [<hi>That which is the beſt courſe and moſt to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is certainly ſuch, as our Saviours words, truely vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, doe adviſe vnto.</hi>] The aſſent is in effect the ſame, onely inverted. But from this inverſion wee vſually draw Iuſtifications or Apologies for our moſt ſiniſter choyces.

The waight or conſequence of the matters conteined in the mentioned controverſies, breeds an extreme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to haue their profitable tenents countenanced by ſacred authoritie; and extremitie of deſire, an vnſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thirſt or greedineſſe of lucking &amp; wringing thoſe Texts of Scripture, which in colour of words or lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſhew doe ſeeme at firſt ſight to make ſomewhat for them, but in truth and ſubſtance manifeſt the poyſon of their doctrine, and argue their eager appetite in maintaining it to be a ſpice or ſymptome of ſpirituall madneſſe. To proue the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, ſome not content to vrge that of the Prophet, [<hi>And they ſhall offer a pure oblation to me in all places</hi>;] or <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deckes</hi> offering conſecrated bread and wine, (which being once granted would everlaſtingly over-throw it;) would perſwade vs the latine <hi>Miſſa</hi> was coyned in the Hebrew mint from <gap reason="foreign">

The ſame phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſmes which by floting in our braines breed dreames by night, preſent themſelues to our waking thoughts by day; but want opportunitie to deceiue; ſo long as our eyes and eares are open to receiue forraigne infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. But whiles the externall ſenſes, which ſerue as witneſſes, and that principall internall ſenſe which ſittes as chiefe Magiſtrate in the inferior part of the ſoule are ſurprized by ſleepe; the vaineſt fancies the braine can repreſent, paſſe for currant without exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or checke.

No man that reades their writings, but will perceiue many phantaſmes or modelles of Evangelicall truth ſwimming in their heads: but the vaile being laid before their hearts diſenables their iudgements for diſtinguiſhing figures from ſubſtances, or apparitions from realities.</p>

The reliques of orthodoxall truths, which vnto this day worke in this heartleſſe peoples braines, would be ſufficient to forme Chriſt crucified in the hearts of Heathens, not given vp to a reprobate ſenſe.

For from a reaſon not much vnlike vnto the cauſe of dreames it is, that externall noyſes oftimes conſort ſo well with internall muſings, as if the one were but the tune and the other the dittie, or one the baſe and the other the treble.

And ſometimes as if we meant to ſaue our ſelues a labour or ſpare our breath, which would be ſpent in ſpeaking, we tacitely articulate the ſounds of bells, or other tuneable bodies, as if they did audibly ſpeak what we inwardly muſe. Muſing and dreaming are of neare alliance; the fancy in both is apt to weaue in every circumſtance or occurrent, that hath the leaſt ſemblance or connexion with the principall matter repreſented or thought vpon. In dreames the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall or judicatiue ſenſe is ſo bound with ſleepe, that it cannot examine intimations given by the fantaſie. In muſing the phantaſie is ſo contracted within it ſelfe, that it can neither receiue inſtructions from the vnderſtanding, nor giue it perfect information from repreſentations made by externall ſenſes. But from what originall ſoever theſe erroneous imaginations or fallacies proceed, they inſinuate themſelues after the ſame manner into ſuch as dreame, and ſuch as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſe than meditate vpon Scripture. Nor is there any other meanes to prevent their inſinuations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides vigilant and attentiue alacritie, to ſift and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine every circumſtance, by ſetting our imaginations a-worke to counterſway our extemporary conceites or apprehenſions with all contrary inducements poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.

Vnleſſe I had compared the marginall quotations of ſome Anabaptiſticall and ſchiſmaticall diſcourſes with the Text, and both with the concluſions intended by their authors; I ſhould hardly haue conceived it as poſſible for a man to ſpeake nothing but Goſpell, and yet to ſpeak ſcarce a true or wiſe <hi>word.</hi>

This kinde of dreaming temper in many, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the breaking out of the former generall ſeedes of errour, vnto whoſe workings inwardly it vſually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords advantage and opportunitie.

To excell others in many points, men of this diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will not ſtriue; to be excelled in moſt, they can ſuffer with patience. Gods gifts of wit, of learning, and judgement they will admire &amp; magnifie as much as any, in others, whoſe induſtrie and opportunities of increaſing their talent in ſacred negotiations they cannot but acknowledge greater, then their owne: yet will they not in concluſion be perſwaded, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man not of their owne ſect or diſpoſition, knowes ſo much of Gods eternall will &amp; purpoſe, as they doe. Others generall ſkill in Scriptures, if it be great, is for this reaſon alone, ſuſpected to be vnſanctified. The ſtronger the reaſons brought againſt them be, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder are they to appeale from reaſon vnto Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as if grace did aboliſh as well the life or remnant of natures integritie, as her corruptions; as if Gods law or written word did rather obliterate, than refine &amp; quicken the imperfect characters or liueleſſe linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of natures law written in our hearts. Thus to abandon the helpe of Arts and naturall reaſon, in this ſearch they haue good reaſon, if wee reſpect the end, whereat their deſires covertly ayme. For Arts and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon being once excluded from examination or tryall of ſacred myſteries, their irrationall and ſurd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of Scriptures ſenſe in particulars, which they ſtand vpon, may be as well eſteemed, as the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible deductions, that can be drawne from the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall <hi>Maximes</hi> of Religion, or concluſions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly &amp; remonſtratiuely parallel'd to the rule of faith. If allegations of ſacred authority might once by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of mens voices thus affected, be taken by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber rather, than by waight; to refute the Anabaptiſt,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:7903:225"/>
the Separatiſt, or maintainers of other moderne er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, would be a matter ſo much the harder, as the refuter is more judicious. For the better his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, the more accurately will he ſearch, or ſift ſuch circumſtances, as at firſt fight wedde theſe mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions to their owne dreames or fancies. To avoyde their fallacies, the Reader is to remember that their modeſtie in ſome caſes no way acquits them from imputation of extreme pride and inſolency in many points of Chriſtianitie. Few there be ſo tranſcendent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceited of themſelues, but will yeeld to knowne profeſſors of thoſe faculties, wherin they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant. So on the other ſide not many there are, that will not ſtand vpon their skill in thoſe particulars, whereto they haue beene wholly addicted, or long imployed in. It is no marvaile then, if ſuch, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding greateſt myſteries haue wholly betaken themſelues to the ſpirit, or to mens labours whom they preſume to be throughly ſanctified, doe as light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteeme the opinion of greateſt ſcholars, auncient or moderne, in divine myſteries, as they highly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie their wit, and judgement in artificiall learning or ſacred generalities. For matters of ſanctification, of election and ſalvation, are as the onely trade or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, which theſe men profeſſe, and of which they deeme their owne corporation onely free; others not fit to be conſulted, or at leaſt their voyces not to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, vntill they haue ſerved the like compleate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prenticeſhip to their ſuppoſed ſpirit, or beene as long profeſſors of the pure Word alone, renouncing all commerce with naturall reaſon.

               <p n="7">7. Their firſt intention, I am verily perſwaded, is to magnifie Gods grace, more then others (to their thinking) doe. Now it is a Maxime as plauſible as true, that Gods graces can never be magnified too much by any. But it is a fault common almoſt to all, to doe many things much amiſſe before we haue done them halfe enough. The wiſeſt oft miſcarry in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects; theſe men erre in their very firſt attempts, their very intentions are miſlevelled, in that they thinke there is no direct way to grace but by declining helps of art or gifts of nature. The firſt and immediate iſſue of this perſwaſion, (thus ſeeking to nurſe a perpetuall irreconcileable faction betwixt Scripture and reaſon, to magnifie grace by nullifying nature and art) is that every action which is not warranted by ſome expreſſe rule of Scripture, apprehended by grace, is <hi>non ex fide, not of faith,</hi> (whoſe onely compleate rule is ſcripture;) and being not of faith, it muſt be a ſinne; ſo that theſe two propoſitions; [1. <hi>all actions warranted by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe word of God muſt needs be lawfull</hi>] 2. <hi>all lawfull actions muſt needs be warranted by the expreſſe word of God,</hi>] differ no more in their Logicke, then this verſe read forward, doth from it ſelfe read backward, for Grammaticall ſenſe,
<q>Odo tenet mulum madidam mappam tenet anna.</q>
And after once (out of a ſcrupulous feare to ſinne in any action by following reaſon without expreſſe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Scripture for the particular) they haue for a

while accuſtomed themſelues to levell every action or ſaying,<note place="margin">Cap. 48.</note> and to ſquare each thought by ſome expreſſe ſuteable rule of Scripture: the Scripture and their thoughts or apprehenſions become ſo intwined, that in fine they are perſwaded whatſoever they haue don, thought, or ſpoken, in matters concerning God or Chriſtians duties, is warranted by ſome expreſſe rule or other of ſacred Writ. Whoſe teſtimonies for the moſt part, they vſe no otherwiſe then men in high place and authoritie, often vſe the <hi>placets</hi> or ſuffrages of their inferiors, to countenance their peremptory deſignes by way of ceremony or formalitie: which if they doe not voluntarily, they ſhall doe at length a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wills.

The Scripture we grant to be the compleate and perfect rule of faith, to be the onely rule likewiſe of planting the roote or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, whence all good actions or reſolutions muſt grow.

The efficacie of every agent reſultes from the fit diſpoſition of the patient; whence it is, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall diſtemper or indiſpoſition of the organ will not admit the proper ſtampe or impreſſion of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, though its proper object.

For the very motion of it is a kinde of conception. But the organ being prepoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by abundance of heterogeneall matter mingled with it, the impreſſion or conception proues like the monſtrous brood, of males and females of diverſe kindes. And the more vehemently the organ is agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,<note place="margin">Diſtemper is a kinde of motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the greater the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the organ is, the more apt it is to be agitated by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</note> the more ſenſible is the repreſentation or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the inherent humors; and in as much as the object is rightly apprehended as the cauſe of this actuall motion or repreſentation, it is likewiſed jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged (but amiſſe) to be ſuch it ſelfe, as the motion or repreſentation, which it worketh. Thus we ſomtimes miſ-gather thoſe things (the Sunne for example) to

be hote themſelues, which produce heate in others; thoſe to be colde, which cauſe ſenſe of colde; thoſe moyſt, which leaue an impreſſion of moyſture where none was or was vnfelt before their operation. Yet is the Moone neither colde nor moyſt in its ſelfe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the true cauſe of coldneſſe or moyſtning in ſubiects, aptly diſpoſed to either qualitie. Braines ſtuffed with <hi>cold</hi> will eaſily ſuſpect fragrant or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne odoriferous perfumes of the lothſome ſmell, which indeed they cauſe by provoking the putrified phlegme to imprint its ſelfe vpon the organ. As the Sunne ſhining through a red glaſſe tranſports the red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vpon the eye, and being the immediate cauſe of the actuall repreſentation now made, is judged to be of the ſame hue. So externall colours preſented to eyes ſubiect to ſuffuſion, or poſſeſſed with reall effluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of other viſibles, cauſe a repreſentation of thoſe internall humors in the organ, whence colours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, being the true cauſe of our preſent actuall ſight, we deeme them to be like vnto the internall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, which are ſeene. Many like irritations of the fleſh are vſually cauſed by the ſpirit, ſeeking to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print the right ſence or Character of Gods word, could the polluted heart or minde infected with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudicate opinions, admit the impreſſion. But carnall luſts, or implanted phantaſies, being by this meanes ſet on working, conceiue a depraved ſenſe, or a ſenſe quite contrary to the ſpirits meaning, and yet ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it to be ſuggeſted by the word of God; onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it concurres to the actuall producing of ſuch humors or phantaſies.</p>

The commendations of ingenuitie or freedome of ſpirit ſympathize well with braue reſolute mindes, as they doe in part with ſtubbornneſſe or ſelfe-will, and the applauſe which the ſtubborne or ſelfe-willed take in this their partiall ſympathie with the temper of Saints or holy men, works a delight in them to glory in their ſhame. So the prayſe of valour or courage in good cauſes is as a watch-word to foole-hardineſſe, which once ſtarted will admit no curbe or reſtraint from any ſacred precept commending warineſſe or ingenuous feare. The approbation given by Gods word to exceſſiue zeale or indignation ſwelling vpon juſt occaſions, oftimes provokes malitious diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to vent their bitterneſſe in a kinde of affected imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Saints. Now not onely all imitation of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit goodneſſe, but all counterfeit imitation of true goodneſſe, will in the end bring forth true and reall naughtineſſe. Generally as the word of life and grace where it fructifies, doth tranſlate our naturall diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into goodneſſe ſupernaturall: ſo the opinion or preſumption of having our actions warranted, or our
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:7903:228"/>
diſpoſitions countenanced from Gods word or will revealed, doth ſublimate all corruptions by nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, or acquired by cuſtome, into a degree of evill more then naturall.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe groſſe prepoſterous miſconſtructions ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no ſet bounds or limits of increaſe or waning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the different degrees or qualities of the humour, whence they ſpring. As exceſſiue intemperance breeds an hate or loathing of divine goodneſſe, and diſpoſeth to an amitie with hell: ſo in others rightly perſwaded as well of the truth of the Deitie, as of the veracitie of his written word indefinitely conceived, ſome particular rootes of bitterneſſe may be ſo vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and malignant, as will cauſe them to caſt aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of blaſphemie vpon the ſalvificall ſenſe of theſe ſacred oracles, and to deifie contrary miſconſtructions prompted onely by the luſts and corruptions of the fleſh. Choler in ſome men, though abundant, is forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with pacified with placid behaviour or gentle lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; but in others is ſo peeviſh and fretfull, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them interpret all addreſſements to pacificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be but mockerie. That, which at other times to them, or at all times to other men, would be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>affabilitie,</hi> is, in the heate of preſent diſtemper, <hi>flatterie</hi>: what others would take for true ſubmiſſion, or be glad to entertaine as a ſerious proffer of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement, whiles this humor is ſtirred, is diſſimulation or ſubtiltie to entrap them. The reaſon of ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable miſconſtructions is the ſame which was given before. Whatſoever is <hi>obvious</hi> to thoughts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly perplexed or grieved, is apprehended as evill, becauſe it reviues or exaſperates the cauſe of griefe;
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:7903:229"/>
and being apprehended as irkeſome to their preſent diſpoſitions, the vnderſtanding or fancie muſt play the Paraſites, and make good ſuch imputations, as the predominate humor layes vpon the obiect. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers words or geſtures alwayes provoke ſome moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in vs, and with the motion, ſome humor or other is ſet on working. Now if the humor be tart or bitter, the motion of it will be vnpleaſant to the partie, in whom it reſides. For this reaſon men ſickly or chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke proſecute all, that ſpeake to them, or whatſoever moues the fretting humor, with the ſame diſlike they haue of it, or their internall grievances <hi>thus</hi> occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. All is one whether the ſpeech or behaviour be faire or foule, ſo the irkeſome diſpoſition be exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, which ſometimes is more offended with the antipathie of affabilitie or proffered courteſie, than with churliſh or boyſterous oppoſition of the like temper in others. For being boyſterouſly oppoſed it either relents or findes opportunitie to exonerate it ſelfe, and ſpend its venome by vehemencie of provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked motion; but gathers ſtrength by fretting inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at their ſpeech or geſtures which vnſeaſonably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to allay it: as the Spring-ſunne by ſtirring hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors being not able to draw them out or digeſt them, produceth agues. Some tempers of minde in like ſort there be, very apt to be offended with divine truth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bluntly, obſcurely, doubtfully, or vnſeaſonably propounded, and yet as ready to be friends with it diſtinctly and placidly repreſented. Others are ſo tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſower leaven of Phariſaiſme, that the more evident the truth is made, or more plauſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered vnto them, the more bitterly they maligne it
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:7903:229"/>
and the propoſers of it; for the inward griefe of a worme-bitten conſcience doth more diſquiet the ſoule and ſpirit, than any choler can doe the body or animal facultie. Thus the high Prieſt rent his cloathes at our Saviours interpretation of that place in <hi>Daniel: [Hereafter ſhall ye ſee the Sonne of man.]</hi> as if he had ſpoken blaſphemie. Albeit his manner of delivering this divine truth, manifeſt enough to ſober exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, were moſt placid, and in tearmes mitigated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the tenour of a direct anſwer to the queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Had he prophecied to haue made them Kings, or vpon opportunitie of his late triumphant enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, interpreted the Prophets words of himſelfe then comming, as their Generall to outbraue the <hi>Romanes</hi> with golden ſhieldes or glittering ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, he might haue gained that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, which they afterward gaue to <hi>Herod; Non vox homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, ſed Dei.</hi>

knowledge of the Deitie. To the better ſort of them it was a cleare truth and a received Maxime;
<q>That as the Sunne cannot be ſeene without its owne light, ſo God could not be knowne without his illuminations:</q>
That by theſe illuminations profered to all the moſt part were not in any degree inlightned for want of internal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. The preparation or diſpoſition by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, was purification of the ſoule. Of excellent paſſages to this purpoſe <hi>Triſmegist, Plato</hi> with his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, <hi>Plotine</hi> ſpecially, and amongſt the Romanes, <hi>Seneca,</hi> are very fertile. Their conſonancies to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian truth are gathered by many, briefly by <hi>Panſa,</hi> and ſome other late Writers, whom I commend vnto the Reader for no other end, but that he may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended or directed by them to theſe authors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, worthy to be lookt into by the moſt eagle-ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Divines of our times.

And if whiles

we ſeeke a rule or ſtay to our vnderſtandings, leſt they ſlide into error, we deſire withall a ſpurre vnto devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the vſuall profeſſors of Schoole divinitie come as farre ſhort of theſe heathen Theologiſts, and their Chriſtian expoſitors in this later ſervice, as they goe beyond them in the former.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Plotins</hi> frequent interſperſion of much divine matter throughout moſt his Philoſophicall diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, often makes me doubt, whether familiaritie with <hi>Origen</hi> did not draw him to ſome acquaintance with Chriſtian myſteries; howſoever he ſought to forme them in Philoſophicall mouldes, and ſet forth ſtollen fragments of the food of life with Platonicall ſawce. By what meanes then may the ſoule in this mans judgement <hi>be elevated to contemplate the vnprizeable beautie, which hath her dwellings in the ſacred cloſetts, and gaddes not abroad, leſt profane eyes might gloate vpon her?</hi> Not to queſtion how well he ſpake them, or how farre he did aſſent vnto them; theſe, and the like ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his (very pertinent to our preſent argument) inferre a divine truth out of Philoſophicall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
<q>If the eye be either infected with bad humors, dull or weakned for want of ſpirits, the brightneſſe of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects preſented, breeds a dimneſſe, and diſenables it for ſeeing, what otherwiſe might eaſily be ſeene. The ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor muſt be made like the ſpectacle; nor could any eye ſee the Sunne, were it not by naturall conſtitution Sunne-like: No more can the minde vnleſſe purified, behold the fountaine of puritie: whence he muſt be divine or deifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that meanes to ſee God, or the patterne of beautie.</q>

Of the latter purification, in this life none can be, of the former all the faithfull muſt be partakers.

               <p n="2">2. May we in this caſe, as in the like before, admit of a two-folde cleanſing or purification; one morall, or right onely in its kinde, but farre ſhort of accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

in it ſelfe, onely acceptable, as it is deſtinated to a ſecond which is ſpirituall, and pleaſing to God through Ieſus Chriſt, as being the ſymbole or partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated forme, whereby Chriſts righteouſneſſe becomes actually ours. The truth of this diſtinction was ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by S. <hi>Iames,</hi> otherwiſe he had ſet thoſe ſoules, which he ſought to cleanſe, in a perpetuall <hi>backwater.</hi> Vnto men as then not juſtified nor ſpiritually purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; vnto all, (notorious ſinners not excepted) for to them by eſpeciall title was that exhortation directed; <hi>Draw neare to God, and he will draw neare to you.</hi> Iam. 4.8.

No moderne Catechiſt knowes better then he did; That God alone muſt ſpiritually cleanſe and purifie, becauſe he alone creates that grace in their hearts, whereby this their ſanctification is wrought. Yet that they might be finally ſo cleanſed, and purged by his meere grace, they were firſt morally to be cleanſed, by abſtinence from vnrighteous actions, by denying of indulgence to internall luſts. This wavering of minde, though it ſpring from impuritie of heart or corrupt affection; (as one obſerues) is no ill ſigne in youth, but rather the working of the ſoule, ſeeking to purge it ſelfe from corruption; although a wavering and floating imagination is for the preſent moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of the impreſſion of Gods image.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="443" facs="tcp:7903:233"/>3. As corruption of nature doth ſway vs both to conceiue, and bring forth evill of every kinde: ſo our acquired proueneſſe to practiſe it, being outwardly curb'd, or our naturall propenſions by Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence diverted from ſuch objects, as might entice or inlarge them, the light of nature as yet not ſanctified will manifeſt the folly of our former wayes, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cauſe notorious malefactors to water their cheekes with teares, in ſigne they would (as perhaps for the preſent in part they doe) waſh their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from wonted vncleanneſſe, if it ſhould pleaſe God to grant them opportunitie of teſtifying their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by reformation of life prolonged. And what they thus proteſt may be either meerely pretended, or vnfainedly purpoſed. So may purpoſes, for the time being vnfained, be either temporary and weake (eaſie to be defeated) by future opportunities; or firme, and conſtant, able to reſiſt all ordinary or wonted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements to commit externall miſchiefes. Such they may be, and yet never approach the confines of true ſpirituall renovation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That hearts thus farre cleanſed and mollified are more apt to admit the true ſtampe or character of any morall truth, and may be more eaſily and farther poized with any wholeſome admonition or reproofe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> needs no further proofe, than that, which is aboue all proofes, which can be brought to the contrary, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience.

vp theſe ſacred principles in their hearts, giving them little or no vent, except in practiſe, will in theſe caſes ſuſpect their iudgement, and appeale from paſſion to calme and ſober meditations. Many pleaſant and gratefull fancies, which ſecretly intrude themſelues by night, are often miſtruſted by ſome, even whiles they dreame; though the like dreames in others, which haue leſſe occaſion to beleeue them, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from all ſuſpition. The cauſe of difference, as an exquiſite <note n="*" place="margin">Philip. Mocenicus.</note> Philoſopher tells vs, is this. In the one, the paſſages betwixt the braine, and the heart are in ſome ſort open: in the other ſo ſtopt, that the head, which ſerues as an illiterate meſſenger or newes-car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier to the heart, can haue no direction or reſolution thence, but takes every thing for true, that hath any appearance of truths formerly experienced in waking thoughts. This falls out ſo, as if, whiles grand Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors ſleepe, Poſt-boyes ſhould take vpon them to determine of matters of ſtate by vulgar rumors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſecrecies incloſed in their Packets. The vigilant thoughts of men attentiue to worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or bent to vice, can be no better in ſacred mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, than dreaming fancies in matters ſecular. No morall knowledge not implanted in a purified heart, but vpon intercourſe of paſſion or new occurrence, either vaniſheth or varieth as ſtrangely and quickly, as nocturnall repreſentations. Nor is it poſſible any ſacred knowledge ſhould enter into our hearts, vntill they be in ſome meaſure cleanſed of their natiue ruſt or adventitious fouleneſſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Not vnconſonant to as much of S. <hi>Iames</hi> divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as hitherto hath beene diſcuſſed, is that reſolution

<q>Muſtum intereſt inter, &amp; bonam valetudinem, &amp;c. There is a great difference betweene health and ſtrength: Thou carrieſt about no counterfeit face, nor frameſt thy ſpeech vnto anothers minde: Thy heart is not invailed, thou art free from avarice, which depriues it ſelfe of what it hath purloined from others; from luxurie, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paires the waſted ſtocke more filthily, then it was waſted. Thou art not ſubiect to ambition, which ſeldome brings men vnto dignitie, but by baſe and indigne practiſes? Thou art as yet a non-proficient, and rid of all other ill gueſts, not of thy ſelfe. The vertue we ayme at, is magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent: not that it is in it ſelfe a happy thing to be without vice, but that want of evill doth free the minde, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it for the knowledge of heavenly matters, and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it for acquaintance with God.</q>
                  <hi>Plotin</hi> likewiſe (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouching the conſent of the auncient) makes every vertue a beame or ray of the former purification, in his opinion requiſite for attaining vnion with the prime light or fountaine of beautie. What is tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance but abſtinence from bodily pleaſures, as being neither pure in themſelues, nor fit for any affecting puritie of life to follow? Wiſedome and Prudence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the minde to things ſupernall, and keepe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loofe from this inferior and baſe part of the world, which pollutes it. Wherefore it was truely ſaid; That the goodneſſe, and beautie of the humane ſoule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in being like to God. But by what meanes in his divinitie muſt our ſoules put on his likeneſſe? <hi>By put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off, whiles they aſcend to him, the vitious habits, which they put on in their deſcent to worldly ſpectacles; as thoſe

that enter into the ſanctuaries of the Temples, put off their garments, and approach not the preſence of the gods till they be purified.</hi> And againe, <hi>Our ſoules muſt be divorced from all corporall beautie, before we come acquainted with the prime light or fountaine of beautie, of whom all bodily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are but images, on which who ſo doates, or eſteemes as obiects worthy of his loue, ſhall be partaker of his folly, that drowned himſelfe by aſſaying to embrace faire ſhadows in the water. For thus enclaſpt with loue of bodily decencie, that he cannot acquit himſelfe from it, he muſt needs ſuffer a precipitation</hi> (not ſo much of body as of ſoule) <hi>into a pit darke and gastly to the minde of man; blinded both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the infernall ghoſts, and even whiles they liue here, haunted ſtill with ghoſts or ſhadowes.

Out of this Heathens Philoſophie, that Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which ſhould be in Chriſtian Divines, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract much matter, well ſymbolizing with the words of life. Howbeit, leſt either young Readers ſhould wrong themſelues by doating too much vpon theſe or like paſſages, or Divines ſhould depriue him of his due; let vs ſee a little farther wherin they decline from Chriſtian truth.
It was an heavenly doctrine of <hi>Plotine</hi> and other Heathens; <q>That gold being ſevered from droſſe or gleibs of earth often intermingled with it, and the ſoule of man once purified from vice or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall impreſſions, both recover their natiue beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: that the ſoule thus recovering her natiue-ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, becomes a true glaſſe for right repreſentation of Gods image or his attributes.</q>
But the beſt of the Heathen wanting this perſpectiue glaſſe, whereby things of heavenly nature muſt be diſcovered, could not diſcerne many internall ſpottes or blemiſhes, which no leſſe pollute the humane ſoule, then thoſe running ſores, wherewith moſt others beſide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues were in their judgement fouly infected. Beſides theſe mentioned, much of their ſeed wee cannot deny to be moſt pretious, as being either borrowed from the Hebrewes, ſince the law was written, or propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Noah</hi> the Preacher of righteouſneſſe. Yet
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:7903:236"/>
even the beſt, that they did ſow, compared with <hi>Pauls</hi> or <hi>Apolloes</hi> labours, proved in the growth but like graſſe or greene blades vpon the houſe-toppe, withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring before they be ripe. And thus ill it proved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not ſowne in contrite hearts, becauſe not rooted in true humilitie, never watered with penitent teares, without whoſe moyſture the ſeed of Gods word ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily receiveth no iuſt increaſe. If wee may iudge of other Heathens by <hi>Plotine,</hi> and of <hi>Plotine</hi> by thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances wherein he ſought to be moſt wiſe, their pureſt doctrine was infected with a double error: the one, that it was but a kinde of hand-labour to put of bad habits, or cleanſe our ſoules from ſuch filth, as had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen them, from contagion of externalls; the other, that perfect ſplendor, beautie of minde, or fulneſſe of felicitie, did immediately reſult from theſe morall ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions or reſecations of ſuperfluities. Hence were he and his fellow Philoſophers often occaſioned to triumph before victory; to boaſt of libertie, when they had but laide aſide ſome externall badges of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; to reioyce when they ſhould haue ſorrowed. For of that true purification, which is but as the ground or matter of ſpirituall reformation, penitent teares and ſecret mournings are parts eſſentiall: <hi>Suffer afflictions, and ſorrow ye, and weepe. Let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your ioy into heavineſſe. Caſt downe your ſelues before the Lord, and he will lift you vp</hi>

whoſe fruition this happineſſe conſiſteth, was the <hi>port</hi> for which the Philoſophers in their intricate diſputes were bound: the <hi>point,</hi> whereon the former deſire is by nature directly ſet; but from which the alacrious endevours or vigorous intentions of men moſt gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of knowledge, vſually divert as far, as an headleſſe vnfeathered flight, ſhot out of a ſtrong bow in a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie winde, doth from the marke whereto the Archer would haue ſent it. Not the moſt exquiſite knowledge of natures ſecrecies, of every creature in the world, can adde ought vnto our happineſſe, otherwiſe than by rectifying or right levelling that inbredde deſire, which impells or ſwayes vs to this anxious ſearch of knowledge. For knowledge it ſelfe we deſire onely as it is good, whereas no goodneſſe, ſaue divine, can giue ſatisfaction to this deſire. Vnto this point or center of the ſoules reſt and contentment, which Philoſophers ſought vp and downe by as many Arch-lines, as there be ſpheres or circles in the ſeverall workes of nature, the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> directs vs by a ſhort corde or ſtring: <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light thou in the Lord, and he ſhall giue thee thy hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</hi> Pſal. 37.4. And our hearts deſire includes (at leaſt) ſuch a meaſure of knowledge and true happineſſe, as in this life is fitteſt for vs. But as we may in ſome ſort deſire his goodneſſe, may we ſo truely delight in him, whom wee haue not knowne?

neare childebirth hath beene affrighted or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected with, will be miſliked by the childe brought forth. Hence doe theſe ſecret enmities, which ſome reaſonable creatures beare to dumbe beaſts, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver offended them, vſually growe. The Paroxyſmes or fits of this diſlike, are never occaſioned but by ſight or feeling, or ſome other ſenſitiue actuall apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of matters thus offenſiue: howbeit, ſome grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings of the ſame diſeaſe may be procured by meere vicinitie or the vnknowne preſence of the adverſary; as I haue known ſome men, reſtleſſe after hard labour, and ever and anone to refuſe the ſeate of their wonted reſt, not knowing any reaſon, why ſo they did, till ſearch being made, the ſight of their adverſary, (that was a Cat) did bring their fit vpon them. And yet I make no queſtion, but either delightful imployments, exerciſe of the ſpirit and ſenſes, or the company of louely creatures, might eaſily haue either <hi>prevented</hi> the working of the Antipathie, or <hi>deaded</hi> all impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of irkeſomneſſe or diſlike; although their badde neighbour had ſtill beene preſent. As diſlike and hate from antipathie; ſo loue or delight may be raiſed from ſecret contact or vicinitie of ſympathizing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And whether we holde our ſoules to be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately created of nothing, or to ſpring as branches from our parents; both wayes they may be capable of impreſſions from Gods preſence, which (though for the moſt part vnapprehended) is alwayes intimate and immediate to them as well in their operations, as productions; and would vndoubtedly fill them with ſecret joy, did we not either giue prepoſterous iſſue to ſuch gladneſſe, as by the ſympathie is often vnwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly

The ſumme of the <hi>Pſalmists</hi> late mentioned adviſe is, to nurſe the ſympathizing inſtincts or ſeeds of ſecret joy, but by abandoning all delight, ſaue in thoſe practiſes, which preſerue the health and peace of conſcience. For to delight in the Lord and in his law, are with him tearmes ſynonymall. Vnto this point the laſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the fourth booke, as of <hi>laying vp Gods word in our hearts,</hi> of giving mature and right vent to internall motions or ſuggeſtions, haue (as the Reader will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perceiue) peculiar and immediate reference. The imperfect light of ſpeculatiue or artificiall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge may well beget ſome heate of loue: but the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or ſplendor of knowledge divine cannot ſpring but from loue throughly kindled and burſting out into a flame, which it ſeldome doth, if thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward touches of vnknowne joy, finde too much, too ſpeedie, or ſiniſter vent.

And perhaps the reaſon why ſome ſo ſtiffely deny all poſſibilitie, <hi>etiam de potentia dei abſoluta,</hi> for loue to kindle in the rationall ſoule, without ſome preſent elicit act of knowledge or apprehenſion, may be their averſneſſe from <hi>Plato</hi> in holding ſcience to be but a kind of reminiſcence.

The firſt ſeedes of both, are not from without, but within vs; and the manner how our knowledge comes to perfection, may (I take it) be beſt illuſtrated by the manner how wee our ſelues become capable of this chiefe ornament of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The firſt and prime ſubſtance of all bodies or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganicall is homogeneall or of one forme. The mould, whence man (farre the moſt excellent in this ranke) is by degrees (ſcarce ſenſible) extracted, ought to be reckoned rather amongſt the creatures lineleſſe and inanimate, than vitall.

Afterwards it aymes or levells at ſome particular obiects, rather drawne vnto them by ſympathie or impeld by inſtinct, then directed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe rule of reaſon or actuall choyſe. And perhaps, the firſt thing apprehended by it, is its owne attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or impulſions; the apprehenſion of them being but as it were a reflexe or doubling of former inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or propenſions; and once come to this perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it moues it ſelfe, and loues as well the exerciſe of its owne acts or choyce, as the objects, to which it was otherwiſe drawne or impeld; now vſing ſenſe as a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, which before did leade it as a guide, but did not giue it life or beginning.</p>

once throughly <hi>ſett,</hi> overgrowes the other in height, in ſtrength, and vigour. But vnto this facilitie in brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging forth, few attaine without extraordinary mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifry or much experience. The difficulties of their firſt travells make many proſtitute their wills to fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe popular commercements, never reſolving to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceine more deeply of any matters, then may occaſion extemporary pleaſure or delight, or procure ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſarie or ſolemne flaſhes of generall applauſe. But much more painefull, then any contemplation beſides, whereof the reaſonable ſoule ſeeketh to be delivered, is our owne new birth, which, in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles language, is but the faſhioning of Chriſt Ieſus or Gods image in vs. In this our <hi>tranſlation</hi> from <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to light</hi> how often are we enforct to cry out with <hi>Ezechiah; The Children are come vnto the birth, and there is no ſtrength to bring forth.</hi> Sometimes we ſeeke with ſighes and groans to giue vent to the inward working of the implanted inclination, ſtirred and quickened by the ſpirit of God. Otherwhiles, we ſtriue to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the expulſiue force, or to make an eruption by knocking our breaſts; oftimes enforced to reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with a ſtreame of teares, ſtrained out by this ſtrugling agonie betweene the infuſions of ſpirituall life, and the fleſh reſiſting this our birth, as the Dragon did the bringing forth of the Womans childe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit theſe ſorrowful teares ſerue to this end, as a ſpring or ſummer ſhower to a ioyful harveſt. And the greater our paine in the travell, or the longer our expectation hath beene masked with carnall blindneſſe; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alwayes is our joy in the delivery; when our minds are enlightened to ſee the beautie of that, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:7903:242"/>
we ſo fervently expected, only by ſecret inſtinct or ſympathie. Then fearing leſt theſe tranſient gleams might fade or vaniſh; either we craue with olde <hi>Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> our <hi>Nunc dimittis, Lord now letteſt thou thy ſervants depart in peace, while our eyes beholde thy ſalvation,</hi> or complaine with the Prophet, <hi>How long wilt thou be as a paſſenger or as one, that ſoiourneth but for a night? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne ô Lord, returne vnto thy reſting place, thou, and the Arke of thy ſtrength.</hi> And with <hi>Peter, Wee proffer to build him a laſting tabernacle, to allot him our hearts for a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall habitation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. What joy of heart doth vſually accompany thoſe internall illuminatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which breake forth from ſuch ardent deſire of acquaintance with the divine nature, as hath beene ſecretly kindled and nouriſhed by a touch or ſympathie of his former vnapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded preſence; and how incomparably they exceede the moſt liuely repreſentations which others can frame of his eſſence or attributes, whether for ſolid information of the vnderſtanding, for <hi>affecting</hi> the will, or for vniting our ſoules and affections to him, may in part, be gathered from that exceſſiue delight, which men naturally take in their owne labours in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of others more exquiſitely adorned: partly from the <hi>meaſure</hi> of our exceeding our ſelues either in the right apprehenſion or exquiſite adorning of ſubjects much affected, in compariſon of theſe which wee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally fancy not or lightly eſteeme. The fruits of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens labours, being as it were, gathered to our hands, we like no farther, then as they fit thoſe <hi>moulds</hi> of our ſpeculatiue reflectiue conceites, which haue their ſeate in the ſuperior part of the ſoule, and ſcarce
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:7903:242"/>
communicate with affection. And our judgements are alwayes moſt ſincere in reſpect of thoſe mens workes, whoſe perſons or converſation haue given vs leaſt occaſion of any affectionate ſympathie or anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie. But in the approbation of our owne inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>affection</hi> and that naturall <hi>inclination,</hi> whence they ſpring, haue ſwaying voyces: and vnleſſe theſe ſtubborne ſuffragants be firſt ſquared to the rules of reaſon taught by others, they enforce our judgements to bow vnto their bent. But albeit too much affection leadeth many into folly, yet no man vnderſtands or handles any ſubiect well, which he doth not much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Hence Poets, as their inventions are moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, ſo are they vſually moſt in loue with them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame <hi>bent</hi> of affection, which animates and ſtrengthens their fancies to bring forth, doth alſo <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amour</hi> them with the beautie of their owne broode. Howbeit though indignation may giue the facultie of making verſes, where nature hath denyed it: yet to make a Poet, nature it ſelfe is not able, but by giving an extraordinary affection of like or <note n="*" place="margin">Hoc amet, hoc ſpernet promiſsi car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> diſlike, of ſuch objects as fall within the conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Poeticall facultie. Generally as blunt yrons throughly heated peirce further into hard bodies, then cold edg-tooles; ſo witts in themſelues not the acuteſt, whileſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ardor of affection, conceiue moſt acutely and deeply of matters much affected, and will got through ſuch difficulties, as would turne the edges of the beſt witts living not thus backed or fortified. Nor is it the nimbleneſſe of conceit or apprehenſion, but the vnrelenting temper of inbred deſire and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant ſway or working of ſecret inſtinct, which
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:7903:243" rendition="simple:additions"/>
brings the ſeeds of knowledge to iuſt growth and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turitie; as thoſe plants proſper beſt, not which ſhoote out faſteſt or flouriſh ſooneſt, but ſuch as haue the ſoundeſt rootes, and ſappieſt ſtemmes.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As <hi>reaſon</hi> requires affection to backe it ſo much more doth affection neede the eye of reaſon (dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke or forraine) to direct and levell it; nor is it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directed, but withall refined and purified by being as it were new caſt in the <hi>modells</hi> of our rationall or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexe conceipts; each act of ſetled contemplation di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheth ſomwhat of its naturall ſowrneſſe, as crabs or wilde apples by often tranſplanting or engraffing grow more milde and pleaſant. As there is a circular progreſſe of ſeede from trees, and trees from ſeede: ſo is there a reciprocall production of deſire or loue by knowledge, and of knowledge by deſire or loue in one and the ſame man. For mans actions of this kinde are immanent, and multiply within himſelfe. And as the ſeed ſince the firſt creation doth ſtill in order of nature go before the tree; ſo doth knowledge alwayes preſuppoſe inſtinct or deſire. And yet knowledge of things amiable being come vnto maturitie is alwayes laden with loue, as with its naturall fruit. Nor ſhould wee ſo much deſire to know any ſubject, vnleſſe loue to it knowne were moſt naturall. So that knowledge properly is but our naturall deſire, or implanted blind loue reſtored to ſight: and nature doth as it were firſt grope after that, which at length ſhe comes to ſee, and having ſeene deſires to embrace or kiſſe.
The appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant inconſtancy of yong deſires never ſatisfied mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts their naturall blindneſſe in that they ſecretly ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite a guide or inſtructer: and the originall of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:7903:243" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(as was intimated before) is but the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the ſoule ſeeking to vnſheath the implanted notion or deſire of knowledge and of true happineſſe from thoſe fleſhly invorapments, wherewith it was blind folded as a childe in the wombe; or to deduce the originall of the error from a principle more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Philoſophicall.<q> As vnto knowledge truely ſpeculatiue there is required a perfect abſtraction of the obiect knowne, or of the forme by which wee know it, from all materiall conditions, or ſenſitiue adiuncts, which accompanie it: ſo on the behalfe of the intellectiue facultie it ſelfe (eſpecially for the right contemplation of matters morall or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call) a correſpondent extraction of the ingraffed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or deſire of good is as requiſite. For as thoſe ſpeculatiue or generall rules, which haue beene ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from ſenſitiue experiments not rightly ſevered or abſtracted, though they holde in ſome, yet faile in moſt particulars, when wee come to practiſe: ſo likewiſe all loue of goodneſſe whatſoever, is vnſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and vnconſtant, vnleſſe the ingraffed deſire of happineſſe, whence it ſprings, be firſt ſtript of thoſe ſenſitiue deſires or propenſions, which, by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature are either linked with it or incloſe it, as the Iv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e doth the Oake.</q>
And yet the more wee enure our ſelues to any ſenſuall or externall good, the greater advantage thoſe ſenſuall appetites or propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions gaine, as well for ſtrengthening, as for faſt link<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or mingling themſelues with the intellectuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination or deſire, which by long cuſtome they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quite blind, or make it willing to admit them for its leader.</p>

This then is the Aphoriſme, for whoſe proofe thus much hath beene premiſed; <hi>The moſt compendious and ſafeſt way to conceiue or ſpeake aright of God or his goodneſſe, is to haue our inbred deſire of happineſſe right ſet in youth, and continually held as in a baye vnto thoſe practiſes; whereto God hath promiſed the communication of his gracious preſence.</hi> So ſhall the ſincere knowledge of his goodneſſe and other attributes breake forth (in a meaſure fitteſt for every man in his vocation) in beſt ſeaſon, and bring forth the moſt laſting, conſtant, and pleaſant fruits of loue. And knowledge againe <hi>relying</hi> vpon the internall deſire of happineſſe, which is the ſtemme or branch, whence theſe fruits of loue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, doth ſeaſon and ſweeten the very nature or propertie of it, and in a ſort tranſforme from a wilde plant to a tree of life; as cunning gardiners by often tranſplanting &amp; good dreſſing, much <hi>better</hi> the ſtocke, and in proceſſe of time, in a manner, alter the very ſpecificall nature of the fruit. And after our cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons come once to revolue vpon the fore-mentioned ſympathie or ſetled peace of conſcience, (which cannot ariſe, but from Gods preſence) as vpon a firme and conſtant Center, our ſoules become like a Surveyers Table rightly ſett, for taking the true Modell of the in comprehenſible Nature.</p>
