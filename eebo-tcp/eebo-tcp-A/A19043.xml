            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:8550:3"/>Firſt, the abuſe of their dedication by him who only is proprietar therof, God, <hi>The tithes are mine, and I haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them to the Leuite,</hi> whereby is eaſily perceiued that the Paſtors and Inſtructers in true knowledge, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, are [<hi>ante omnia</hi>] to bee ſuſtained, entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and maintained, euery man in his place or degree of imployment, by whom the Church is builded, and euery particular perſon is formed a liuing ſtone for rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thereof, the chiefe corner remaining, Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, of vplifting the ſame, whereby the fruites of the ground are ſubject to many inconvenients, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the ſloath, and partly by the malice of Tith-poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſours the one beeing careleſſe to ſeparate the ſame from the ſtocke in due time, and the other maliciouſly refuſing to doe it in due time; wherby the ſtock in theſe cold and Northerne partes are ſubject to the hazard of many inconvenients, by tempeſtuous weather: As alſo comming to Tithe, they bring with them ſuch a confluence of men and beaſts, like locuſtes ouerſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the face of the Earth, running through euery corne field, that the poore labourer of the ground is not able to ſee the deſtruction of his fruites, his body not beeing <hi>vbiquiter,</hi> and therfore cannot tell of what to complaine.</p>

               <head>THE MINDE OF THE CHVRCH MY HEART.</head>
               <p>THE Church is heerewith well pleaſed, for howbeit
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8550:3"/>
it bee without contraverſie, that the Tith is the Lords, and by him giuen to the Levite: and therefore may not vnjuſtly bee acclaimed by the Paſtours, ſucceſſours to their function, hauing the charge of Gods Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle. Yet conſidering that their office is not naturally hereditarie, but by grace and election. And therefore their preſent maintainance is only to be deſired; ſince their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſucceſſours (as they are their naturall ſucceſſours) haue no right to their ſpirituall poſſeſſions: as the Levites, whoſe children were Levites, whereby all the Church goodes were euer poſſeſſed by Church-men.</p>
               <p>Againe, conſidering that they are not reſtrained from purchaſing poſſeſſions amongſt their brethren the Laicks, as the Leuites might not inherite nor poſſeſſe any poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions among the other Tribes, whereby the ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of goods, if any they had; of neceſſitie behoved flow backe to their brethren the Laicks from whence it ſprang: otherwiſe their commodities beeing great, and their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour eaſie in purchaſing the ſame, they might happily haue conquered all their brethrens poſſeſſions, and ſo twelue Tribes ſhould bee reduced in one: And therfore ſince they are not thus reſtrained, they deſire no more but a competent allowance according to his Majeſties royall intention aboue ſpecified.</p>
               <p>As alſo, they are content that the ſuperplus bee in his Majeſties Power to bee employed for the publicke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of the Kirke and common-wealth, and for recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing in ſome ſort of ſuch particular perſons as his Majeſtie out of his royall diſpoſition ſhall thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in conſcience tyed to conſidder, in reſpect of the forme of their acquiring of poſſeſſion of Tythes, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the right cannot ſtand in Law. But firſt of all they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8550:4"/>
deſire your LL. conſider, how nothing is more neceſſare for inſtruction in Knowledge, and the worſhip of God, than the knowledge of letters, the firſt <hi>medium</hi> whereby a man, or rather the Jmage of God potentiall, is reduced in act. And therefore it is very requiſite that every man bee inſtructed in his youth in the firſt degree thereof, which is reading, whereby hee is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie able to ſee the ground of all their doctrine [<hi>the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi>] whereof they are the explicators, but even to ſee them, and all explicatours thereof, in their beſt ſhow from the beginning: and ſo may become a noble <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> deſeruing preferment before the <hi>Theſſalonian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this purpoſe it is very neceſſarie, that no Paroche bee without a reader and inſtructer in reading; the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall entrance to true vnderſtanding. The next degrie of letters, is the vnderſtanding of ſubtilities and ſchoole queſtions, whereby the deepe of Theologie and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy may bee dived into. This is not ſo neceſſare to bee commonly inſtructed in euery Paroch, Yet it is very neceſſarie it be ſufficiently inſtructed within this Kingdome, wherby the enemies of Gods flock may finde to their feare not only barking but byting Dogs keeping the Folds. For this purpoſe it is neceſſare that Colledges or ſeminaries bee erected and provyded for, in ſome the moſt eminent parts of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Thus for the generall overtures at this time when your LL. ſhall think good to put the ſame in practiſe, J ſhall more particularly giue ouertures [<hi>de modo.</hi>]</p>

               <head>THE MINDE OF THE BARRONS MY BODY.</head>
               <p>THE Barrons with all humilitie would beg this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and craues no other favour. For howbeit
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8550:4"/>
the heeretofore vnjuſt imployment of tithes, may not vnjuſtly furniſh them a ground to proteſt againſt all pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of tyths, and deſire a libertie to contribute among themſelues for the entertainment of their inſtructers: yet their hearts can neuer harbour ſuch a thought, when once they remember. Firſt, how forcible nature forces from vs that duetie. For who is ſo beaſtly minded or ſo ſenſually addicted, to the only care of his ſenſible part that will not bee content to count with himſelfe till hee can count no further, and of all that count pay but one for the nouriſhment of his Soule? Now who is able to reckon aboue ten? Who then ſhall bee ſo beaſtly as to refuſe one of ten, except hee bee <hi>idem</hi> with the beaſt? what is more to bee ſaid heereanent, J referre to the more learned <hi>Pithagorean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, when they conſidder the antiquitie of this due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> are thought by ſome to haue payed by their offerings: but it is ſpecially expreſſed they were payed in the days of <hi>Abraham,</hi> where the authorities both of the giuer and receauer is notable, viz. the firſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the faithfull is the giuer, the receaver wherof is the Prieſt of the moſt hie God, without Father, without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without kinred hauing neither beginning of dayes, nor end of time; not that he was without them all in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of nature: but in reſpect of his ſupernaturall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſeparation from all thinges carnall and temporarie to teache moſte high Myſteries for accompliſhing the will of God, wherein was his only confidence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte and ſolace: and ſo the doers thereof his only kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and therefore is likened to the ſonne of God, who profeſſed the doers of Gods will to bee his Mother, Brother, and Siſter, hee alſo is called King of <hi>right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſneſſe</hi>;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8550:5"/>
and after, his dwelling Citie is ſaid to be <hi>Salem,</hi> which is peace; for true wiſedome is euer King of peace. But thirdly and moſt of all, when wee remember his divine majeſtie, by whom they are acclaimed, who (as a type of that eternall Prieſthood, wherevnto the true <hi>Melch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or what was more, to bee ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the ſtranger the Fatherles or the Widow: and on no wayes to bee imployed for their further enriching than preſent neceſſitie.</p>
               <p>Thoſe things conſidered, they euen feare to think of witholding the ſame, like as J thinke euery man ſhould tremble to intromet with the ſame, or intrometting ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, ſhould dare to employ it for any private vſe, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching his Children, or acquyring new poſſeſſions: but I leaue every man to his own conſcience; for they (being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to themſelues, that the Tithes belongs not to them) will none of them, howſoever they bee uſed. And therefore I will onely proceede to their ouertures for reforming theſe abuſes noted by our moſt gratious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne. Of theſe abuſes concerning them in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, the firſt is by the ſloath and malice of the Tithe poſſeſſours, and by the vnneceſſare confluence of men and beaſtes, the time of Tithing.</p>
               <p>The firſt part of this abuſe is in ſome ſort already prouided for, by that ſtatute. 22. Parliament 28 June. 1617. Act 9. But if your LL. think it better that the Tiths be valued, and according to their valuation, euery Heretour to pay for his owne Tith, J ſhall be glad to haue it aggried vpon. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>is abuſe is eaſily helped, the vnformall form of tything being reformed. For it carrys no reaſon that the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8550:5"/>
Tith poſſeſſour, ſhould (with the Tith corne;) carry away alſo the ſtrae, which belongs nothing vnto them: for it is no encreſſe to the owner, ſince it is ordained to rott vpon the ground for maintaining the ſame in the owne ſtrength: and is only taken from the ground of neceſſitie, for better collecting the cornes: wherefrom beeing once ſeparate it is againe ſent vnto the ground, which is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the better enabled to yeild her encreaſe; wherof the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite redounds aſwell to the Tithe as to the ſtock, and ſo no man is loſer. But if ſome object; the ſtraw is vſed for fodder and entertainment of beaſts in this Country. J anſwere, in that ſame reſpect it ought to bee free of Tithe, becauſe it is the foode of the labourer for it feedes the beaſtes that tille the ground: and there can bee neither law nor reaſon why either the hyre or food of the labourer ſhould pay tith: eſpecially theſe by whoſe labour the tith it ſelfe is encreaſed. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue I heereby any deſigne to ſtay the tithe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſour from leading his tithe in the ſheaue, being doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to haue a good count thereof out of the labourers barne-floore, a certaine yearly valuation not aggried v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. They only deſire, that the tithes may bee led, and ſet in the labourers Barne-yard, that when the corne is ſeparate from the ſtraw, the ſtraw may remaine with the labourer as <hi>proprium fundi.</hi> And for this cauſe, euery man ſhall bee aſtricted to lead home the Tithe, to the vſe of the Tithe poſſeſſour; as alſo to furniſh ſufficient Barns for threſhing the ſame at needfull times. So ſhall this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed confluence bee needleſſe.</p>
               <div type="section">

Now if any man in eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating of tithes, can both ſay and thinke that the Tith is in value a fourth part of the land duetie, I wold glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie heare his argument in reaſon, for J haue no Logick to proue in <hi>Arithmetick</hi> the tenth to be the fourth part. But if it ſhall bee anſwered, the tenth of the ſtock, and encreſſe will be the fourth of the free encreſſe, (for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it bee free it is no encreſſe.) To this J anſwere: the tenth of the ſtocke will bee more than the halfe, if not more all the encreſſe: for if it bee lawfull to tithe any part of the ſtocke with the encreſſe, it is lawfull to tithe all the ſtock, and conſequently, the oxen, horſe, nolt, kyne, calfes, yowes, lambes, and all muſt bee tithed, ſince all is either ſtocke or encreſſe, yea, the very ground it ſelfe muſt bee tithed, for it is alſo a part of the ſtocke. And this J hope beeing vſed but few yeares, the conteſtation for tithes will expire [<hi>ipſo facto</hi>] Now as this is againſt all naturall reaſon, ſo it is without any ſpeciall Law, for the law of Tithes is plaine,<note place="margin">Deut. 14.21.</note>

Is not this reaſon? or hath any judge in the Kingdome greater authority, whereby he may vilipend this practick, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with another ſort of valuation? or if they will doe, is not the ſentence reduceable? ſince by the ſtatute it is plainly ordained <hi>That all the Iudges and Miniſters of his Majeſties lawes within this Realme, judge and decyde accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this ſtatute, and no other wayes how oft that queſtion ſhall bee moued.</hi> But I know ſome would build much, or rather in effect overthrow all, by theſe ſubſequent vvords, <hi>In the caſe foreſaid.</hi> To the which I anſwere it lacketh <hi>ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly.</hi> But I will not trouble your LL. to diſpute vpon ſuch pen-daſhes, whether they haue beene by accident, or of ſet purpoſe, either adjected or omitted, ſince I doubt nothing your LL. will eaſily perceaue the verie ordinance it ſelfe to be ſuperfluous: for thus I reaſon,</p>

J anſwere, heere is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe: if there bee either law or reaſon for it, let it ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue: But if there bee neither law nor reaſon for it, reaſon it bee reformed. For euerie uſe, which was not ſo from the beginning requires reformation; yea, ſometimes although it bee licenced by authoritie, as is euident by that diſpute betwixt our <hi>Sauiour</hi> and the <hi>Phariſes.</hi> Now it is cleare that this forme of tithing was not in vſe from the beginning: for <hi>Abraham</hi>; (whom, as we are faithfull we claime for our Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore are tyed if not by Law, at the leaſt by example to pay tythes) is ſaid on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to giue the tithes of the ſpoyle. Like as alſo this vſe was never among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> for their Law is expreſſe againſt it, as is ſaid. As for any vſe crept in of late within this Kingdome: there was many cauſes for it, which now are not, and therefore <hi>deficiente cauſa, deficit effectus.</hi> Firſt that ſtatute. Ja. 2, Parl. 14. chap. 82.</p>
                  <p>Ordaining euery pleugh to ſow a firlot wheate, halfe an firlot peaſe, and fourtie beanes, is nor as yet two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeare old: whereby it may appeare how ſmall vſe there was for labouring for cornes, ſome two, three, or foure hundreth yeare before; which all is but a ſmall time, in reſpect of that time, ſince tithing firſt began to bee in vſe. Hence it is eaſily conjectured that the firſt cauſe of this uſe, to tith corne vpon the ground both ſtocke and encreſſe, was, becauſe ſo ſmall partes were laboured at the firſt, that the tith was not much regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: as alſo ſome choyſe partes were only manurde, which beeing fertile in themſelues, both by nature and long reſt, yeelded ſuch encreſſe, as the ſtocke and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour were forgotten by the labourer, rejoycing in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8550:7"/>
good ſucceſſe of his new huſbandry: whereas now the greateſt part of the manured grounds will ſcarce free the charges, if the aire happen to be tempeſtuous: and euen in yeares of plentie, where the ground alſo is fertile, the third of the grouth can hardly be made free to the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond cauſe, whereby this cuſtome hath beene continued, was, the zeale of the people; who were not only content to continue any cuſtome, for commoditie of the Church-men, but even to diſpone their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar lands and heritages vnto them.</p>
                  <p>But this I hope is by <hi>Pandora</hi> ſufficiently cooled; ſince men are now in greater danger to bee eſteemed eaters vp thereof, than to bee eaten vp with the zeale of Gods houſe.</p>
                  <p>The third cauſe, and connexor of all, was, the ſmall or no damnage they found by ſo ouerſeeing themſelues for as all waters running to the ſea, doe neither aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſame, nor diminiſh themſelues. For <hi>as the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers returne to goe vnto the place, whence they came</hi>; euen ſo, what they beſtowed vpon Church-men reflowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnto themſelues; their poore, their orphants, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and ſtrangers all finding hoſpitalitie with the Church: whereas now the traueller, at their ancient dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling houſe, in ſtead of that hoſpitable welcome, <hi>peace bee with thee; howſoeuer, let all thy wants ly vpon me; only ludge not in the ſtreet</hi>; ſhall find nothing of what he wants, but peace or if he happen to heare any noiſe, it ſhal be commanding him peace and without a <hi>peece</hi> to turne ſome other way.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe theſe cauſes were not remoued: no volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ouerſight of any abuſe can enforce a perpetuall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to continue the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:8550:8"/>Jt will bee yet ſaid, this cuſtome hath beene long pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in all countries, and by all Judicatories ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven.</p>
                  <p>But this is eaſily denyed, for a great many parts, if not the moſt part of Chriſtendome, haue neuer beene in vſe to haue the tithe of their cornes drawne after this forme: yea, many parts are in vſe only to pay ſome ſmall acknowledgment, farre ſhort of the worth of the tithe, of their encreſſe, and therefore, no further can bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted of them according to the canon lawe, <hi>Illae deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae neceſſario ſolvendae ſunt, quae divina lege debentur, vel loci conſuetudine approbata,</hi> whereby it is evident that the moſte that can bee craued is the whole tithes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the divine Law aboue-ſaid: like as the leaſt that can be offered is the accuſtomed or ancient duetie; neither will I diſagree from that (indeed) judicious note of Card. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Sicut conſuetudo tollit legem, ſic lex tollit conſuetudinem.</hi> For it is verie true that the authoritie v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon juſt and neceſſare conſiderations, may aboliſh the vſe of paying leſſe than the Law, and command payment according to the Law. But to command anie more, can neuer bee done by any authority, at the leaſt no authority can command to pay more in name of tith than according to the law of tiths. Much leſſe it is reaſon that authoritie ſhould ſuffer to bee vſurped and brought in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, more than the Law, and againſt all reaſon. This (<hi>I</hi> am ſure) will cut off all neceſſitie to value theſe tithes which of old hath beene valued, and according whereto the poſſeſſour hath beene accuſtomed to pay: who ſo liſt to detaine the ſame according to the pryce; as by the particular parties will eaſily bee defended in anie judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, remouing, <hi>ſic volo,, ſic iubeo, ſtat pro ratione volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas.</hi>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:8550:8"/>
From the reſt, neuer more can bee required, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the divine Law aboueſaid.</p>
                  <p>But I ſuppoſe this alledged cuſtome hath beene indeed long vniverſally approuen by all Judicatories, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by all Countries: then ſay I, there hath the more need of a reformation to be begun in ſome Judicatory, and in ſome Country: and by what Judicatory more proper than this? ſince for this, and ſuch like, your LL. are conveened. Can any ordinance paſſe for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of the common weale, forcing a titular to ſet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the valuation, that which in Law hee may ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly lifte without giuing any compt of the value there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? and ſhall all ordinances bee neglected for remeeding that common euill vſed by the titulars, vplifting that, wherevnto by neither law nor reaſon they haue right? This were but to divide, not to remeed wrong. Now as heere is the fitteſt Iudicatory to begin this reformation, ſo is this Kingdome the fitteſt to begin the practiſe therof. Haue we already proceded ſo far in ſo faire a courſe, for reformation of matters in ſubſtance, and now beginne to ſtay at ſtraes? ſhall we continue an abuſe, becauſe it is the vſe of our neighbours? <hi>legibus non exemplis vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> Shall we not know our ſelues?
