            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Gods way of <hi>Juſtification</hi> is for the truth of it above naturall reaſon, and therefore there is required a ſupernatural Revelation to manifest it: Inſomuch that the Divine Authority of the Scripture is in nothing more irradiant, then in the diſcovery of this glorious way of our <hi>Juſtification.</hi> But it hath been a ſtumbling block, and a rock of offence to many mens hearts, who look for a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophicall <hi>Juſtification,</hi> or righteouſneſſe of works, either wholly iſſuing from our free will (as they ſuppoſe) or partly from it, and partly from the grace of God, and on this hand, have erred the Pelagians, Papists, Arminians and Socinians: But while the Orthodox have been diligent to keep this fountain pure from the filth thoſe Philiſtims daily threw in, There aroſe up another error on the right hand, which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistles doth many times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Antidote aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

part, and yet a gift promiſed on Gods part; So on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide the Antinomian cannot at the ſame time ſee the fulneſſe of Grace, only in blotting out our ſins, and yet at the ſame time, A necessity of repentance, without which this <hi>Juſtification</hi> could not be obtained. Hence it is they fix their Meditations and Diſcourſes upon the promiſſory part of the Scripture, not at the ſame time attending to the preceptive part. But whether it be their weakneſſe or their wilfulneſſe, they ſeem to be upon thoſe paſſages of Scripture, which ſpeak of Gods grace and Chriſts ſatiſfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as <hi>David</hi> in Sauls arms, which were an hinderance, not an advantage to him.

               <hi>to their own deſtruction.</hi> It is no leſſe a ſin (ſaith <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenius</hi>) to torture the Scripture by perverſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, then it was to torment and Crucifie the very bodies of the Apoſtles: but to how many ignorant men attempting beyond their ſtrength in Controverſies of Divinity, hath that faln out,<note place="margin">Adverſus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doctum.</note> which did to one <hi>Lucian</hi> ſpeaks of, who finding <hi>Orpheus</hi> his harp conſecrated to <hi>Apollo</hi> in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Temple, bribed the Prieſt of the Temple, thinking to make the ſame melody which <hi>Orpheus</hi> uſed to do, which he attempting, through his ignorance made ſuch an horrid ſound, that it inraged all the dogs neer him, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fell on him, and tore him in pieces.</p>
            <p>It is therefore good for men in all humility and modeſty, not to think of themſelves above what they ought, or to affect to be Doctors, before indeed they have been Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
            <p>But to my matter in hand, I ſhall briefly give an account
<pb facs="tcp:65696:6"/>
of my method in this Treatiſe. Whereas in <hi>Juſtification</hi> many things are conſiderable, the efficient and impulſive Cauſe, <hi>Gods grace,</hi> the meritorious Cauſe, <hi>Chriſts ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> the inſtrumentall Cauſe, <hi>Faith;</hi> and ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry one of theſe hath many Debates upon it by Learned men; Yet I have inſiſted upon that where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the nature of it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſist, and becauſe that is made by ſome two fold, partly in <hi>remiſſion of ſins,</hi> partly in <hi>imputation of Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi> this Diſcourſe is wholly upon the former, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to clear all the Doctrinal and Practical doubts that are of greateſt conſequence in this matter. And if God ſhould bleſſe this part with any good ſucceſſe, to eſtabliſh the mindes of thoſe that waver, I ſhall (with Gods assiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) proceed to the other point, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe;</hi> the miſtaking of which point, is no mean cauſe of Antinomianiſm. I am not ignorant, how ſubject to blindneſſe and ſeverall imperfections the beſt of men are, whereby through after-thoughts, they ſee ſuch an argument might have been more ſtrongly managed, and ſuch expressions better ordered, inſomuch that moſt men may ſay, as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid of his Books, He could (like <hi>Saturn</hi>) eat up his own children: It is alſo to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how difficult it is, with pure ends and godly intentions, aiming only at the glory of God, and edification of others, to undertake ſuch a buſineſſe as this is; therefore in all theſe exerciſes, it is good to go out of our ſelves, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſtrength of God only, and not to boaſt as if we had not received. <hi>Tutius vivitur, quando totum Deo damus, Et in nihilo gloriandum eſt, quia nihil no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing more I am to inform thee of, which is, that
<pb facs="tcp:65696:7"/>
in the former part of this treatiſe, I have more remiſly ſpoken of <hi>Juſtification in the generall</hi> (becauſe that will more pertinently be handled in the other point of <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted righteouſneſſe</hi>) and have indeavoured more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly to proſecute the other part which is wholly ſpent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>pardon of ſin.</hi> Theſe things premiſed, I leave thee to the Lord, who teacheth his children to profit.</p>

               <p>The firſt Propoſition is, that <hi>By the deeds of the Law no fleſh ſhall be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his ſight,</hi> where two things are obſervable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he cals every man by the word <hi>Fleſh,</hi> which is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaticall to beat down that pride and tumor which was in the Jews.</p>

God it is unworthy. The other Propoſition is, that, <hi>All come ſhort of the glory of God</hi>; Some do make it a Metaphor from thoſe in a race, who fall ſhort of the prize. Whether by the glory of God be meant the image of God, and that righteouſneſſe firſt put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, or eternall life, or (which is moſt probable) matter of glorying and boaſting before God, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of afterwards, is not much materiall. Now the Apoſtle having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed our condition to be thus miſerable, he commends the Grace of God in juſtifying of us, which is decyphered moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly in a few words; ſo that you have in the Text a moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious delineation of juſtification.<note place="margin">The diviſion and opening of the Text.</note> Firſt, There is the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit ſet down, <hi>being juſtified.</hi> Secondly, The efficient cauſe, <hi>Gods Grace</hi>; and here we have a two-fold impulſive cauſe, one inward, denoted in the word <hi>Freely</hi>; the other outward, in the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe, <hi>Chriſts death</hi>; which is further illuſtrated by the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God for this end,</hi>

which could expiate our offences.

Now there are divers reaſons why we ſhould keep the Philiſtims from throwing in earth to ſtop up this pleaſant ſpring:<note place="margin">And why.</note> As 1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe herein is the grace and good favour of God eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. Therefore the Goſpel is called <hi>glorious,</hi> becauſe God did not ſo much exalt, and manifeſt his excellency in creating the world, as he did in providing of a Saviour, and pardon for a poor ſinner: Hence its called the <hi>riches of his grace,</hi> rather then of power or righteouſneſs. We are therefore ſollicitous (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Antinomians ſay to the contrary) that the doctrine of Gods grace in Juſtification may be fully improved to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and that every broken heart may be put into a raviſhment and admiration of it. We bewail thoſe times of Popery, when the name and efficacy of Chriſt and his Grace, were obſcured by the works and pretended righteouſneſſe of men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is very neceſſary to keep this pure, becauſe of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold truths that muſt fall if this fall; if you erre in this, the whole truth about Originall ſinne, Free-will, and Obligation of the Law will likewiſe periſh.</p>

                  <hi>Chemnitius</hi> relateth, that he did <hi>ſaepè cohor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſcere,</hi> many times tremble when he thought of a ſpeech which <hi>Luther</hi> would often ſay (and it was ominous) <hi>That after his death the Doctrine of Juſtification would be corrupted:</hi> And indeed when thoſe firſt Reformers had made the body of this truth in all the ſeverall parts of it like that of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> comely and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, without any blemiſh, there preſently roſe up many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in minde, and ſet upon it, as thoſe theeves upon the man going to <hi>Jericho,</hi> leaving it wounded, and half dead. There are errours about the very nature of it, making it to be <hi>the infuſion of righteouſneſſe in us,</hi> for which God doth accept us: Thus they ſpeak of Juſtification, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would about Phyſicall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Some take away the <hi>imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſſe</hi>; ſome take away the <hi>ſatisfaction of Chriſt</hi>; ſome make <hi>Faith</hi> to be accounted for Righteouſneſſe; ſome make ſuch a Juſtification, that thereby <hi>God ſhall ſee no ſin in thoſe that are juſtified whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they do.</hi> Thus in the <hi>nature, parts, inſtrument, conſequents</hi> and <hi>ſubject,</hi> there are manifold errours, and hereby Satan bringeth much miſchief to the Church, for by this means our lives are ſpent in diſputing about this benefit, when it were farre more comfortable to be enjoying of it. And when Satan could not overthrow the truth by mingling of our works with the Grace of God, as in Popery, then he bendeth himſelf to errours on the right hand, by ſetting it up in ſuch a ſeeming way, by amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it, that thereby all repentance and godly humiliation ſhall he quite evacuated: Even as when he could not by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, the Phariſees, diſprove the Deity of Chriſt, then he ſets inſtruments on work to confeſs that he was the Son of God, thereby to get in ſome errours.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3 God in the way of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation goes above our thoughts and reaſon.</note>Thirdly, <hi>God in this way of Juſtification goeth above our thoughts.</hi> And certainly, when a Chriſtian will ſet his heart to think about this truth, he muſt lay this for a foundation, that, <hi>in this matter of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65696:11"/>
Juſtifying, Gods thoughts and his thoughts do differ as much as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth</hi>; ſo that the doctrine of Chriſts hypoſtaticall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not more above our thoughts and expectation in the truth of it, to be believed, then that of Juſtification is above our hearts in the goodneſſe of it, to be embraced. It is in this caſe with us, as with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who found honey in the carkaſe of a Lion, this could not be expected how it could come there; had he found it in ſome holes of a Tree in the Wood, where Bees will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hive themſelves, there had been ſome probability, but here is none: Thus thinketh the ſoul troubled, to finde this honey of Juſtification in the death of Chriſt, how unlikely is it? If I ſhould look for it in the works I do, in my holineſſe, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe that is wrought by my own hands, this were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to rules of righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>And this is the ground of all that dangerous errour in Popery, they look upon it as againſt the principles of reaſon, that we ſhould be accounted righteous any other way, then by that which is <hi>inherent</hi> in us; and this made <hi>Luther</hi> profeſſe, that when he did rightly underſtand the doctrine about free remiſſion of ſins, yet he was exceedingly troubled with the word <hi>Juſtifie,</hi> for that old opinion had much ſoaked into him, that it muſt be to <hi>make righteous,</hi> as <hi>ſanctificare</hi> is to make holy, or <hi>calefacere</hi> to make hot; ſome poſitive quality to be brought into a man, which he might oppoſe againſt the judgement of God. And hereby you may ſee, that its no wonder if the people of God are ſo difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded of their Juſtification; if they be again and again plunged into fears about it; becauſe this way which God taketh is above our thoughts: It is a great matter to deny our own righteouſneſſe, and to be beholding to Chriſt only for pardon.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>As the Doctrine it ſelf is by peculiar revelation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per words to expreſſe this doctrine by.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo the Scripture hath proper words to expreſſe it by, which we muſt wholly attend to.</hi> This would be a good Pillar and Cloud to direct us; for then men began to decline from the truth, when they left off a diligent ſearch of the uſe of the word in the Scriptures. What makes it ſo confidently and generally aſſerted by Papiſts, that Juſtification is a <hi>tranſmutation,</hi> a change from the ſtate of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe to the ſtate of holineſſe, but only neglect of the Scripture-uſe of this word?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:65696:12"/>And though this matter was agitated ſeven moneths in the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> yet becauſe they did not follow the Star of the Scripture, they came not to the lodging where Chriſt was. There are ſome kinde of words, which the Scripture takes from the common uſe and cuſtome amongſt men, and they are to be interpreted as commonly they are taken; but then there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words, which the Scripture doth peculiarly uſe, as being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to expreſſe that peculiar matter, which the holy Ghoſt only teacheth, and ſuch is this word, <hi>to juſtifie,</hi> for the greek word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1 Juſtification implies an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting juſt.</note>Firſt, <hi>The word doth imply an accounting juſt:</hi> And this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the Papiſts themſelves, as more frequent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though they pleade much for ſuch a ſenſe, as <hi>to make juſt.</hi> Now the truth is, there needs not much quarrell even about that ſignification, though the Scripture doth not manifeſt it: For we confeſſe that he is made juſt, who is <hi>juſtified,</hi> and that not only in reſpect of the <hi>inward renovation</hi> of a man, but alſo in reſpect of <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification</hi>; for God doth not account him juſt who is not ſo, and certainly to eſteem a man juſt without righteouſneſſe, is as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd as to account a man learned without learning, or the wall white without whiteneſſe; only we ſay this Righteouſneſs that doth to make a man juſt, is not <hi>inherent</hi> in him, but <hi>reckoned to him</hi> by the <hi>ſatisfaction of another:</hi> for a man is <hi>accounted righteous</hi> two waies, either when he is <hi>not guilty</hi> of the crime charged upon him, or when he doth make ſatisfaction; and in this latter ſenſe by Chriſt we become righteous.<note place="margin">2 To make righteous.</note>

               <p>From theſe two followeth a third,<note place="margin">3 To deal with as a juſt man.</note> which is <hi>to deal with a man ſo juſtified as a juſt man,</hi> ſo that condemnation, crimes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and fear ſhall be taken away from him.

               <p>THe ninth Propoſition is, concerning the <hi>reality</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> of this Juſtification:<note place="margin">9 The reality of this juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> for when we ſay <hi>God doth juſtifie,</hi> that is, <hi>account</hi> and <hi>pronounce righteous,</hi> this is taken by Papiſts, as if here were nothing, but a meer fiction and imagination, without any truth indeed: Therefore the godly are for their comfort to know that this Juſtification of theirs, is no leſſe a reall and ſolid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for comfort (yea it is more) then if they had the moſt perfect and compleat <hi>inherent righteouſneſſe</hi> that could be: for all things that are <hi>conſtitutive</hi> of this Juſtification, are reall; God his gracious accounting and eſteeming of us ſo, is reall: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is moſt wiſe, juſt and holy, what he doth judge muſt needs be ſo; we many times juſtifie our ſelves, but then it is ſometimes a meer opinion, we are indeed condemned at that preſent, but it cannot be ſo with God. Again the <hi>foundation</hi> of this Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is as ſolid and firm as any rock, it being the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, if therefore the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt be not a fancy or imagination, no more is this. And laſtly, the <hi>effects</hi> of this are reall, <hi>viz.</hi> deliverance from wrath, peace with God, joy in the holy Ghoſt, and the ſpirit of Adoption. Now in this treaſure the godly heart may much inrich himſelf, he is not in a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65696:14"/>
dream when his ſoul is raviſhed with this priviledge; thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt be in this transfiguration, and ſay, <hi>it's good for us to be here,</hi> and ſtill know what thou ſaieſt; What ſhame then is it to thee, when if thou hadſt <hi>inherent</hi> perfect righteouſnes, thou wouldſt bid <hi>thy ſoul take her ſpirituall eaſe, for ſhe hath much good ſtored up for her,</hi> and thou canſt not do this upon an <hi>imputed righteouſneſſe: impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted righteouſneſſe</hi> and <hi>inherent,</hi> differ only in the manner, not in reality: it is all one, as to Gods glory, and as to thy comfort, whether righteouſneſſe be thine <hi>inherent,</hi> or thine <hi>imputed,</hi> if it be a true real righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, Conſider, <hi>the Scripture ſpeaks of this juſtification, as to us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">10 The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaks of juſtification as to us in a paſſive ſenſe.</note> 
                  <hi>ſtill in a paſſive ſenſe, we are juſtified,</hi> and that whether it ſpeaks upon a ſuppoſition of Juſtification by works of the Law, or in an Evangelicall manner, and this it doth to ſhew that God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth juſtifie: for ſin is only againſt him, and therefore none but himſelf can remit his own offence. Beſides, none can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn but God, therefore none can Juſtifie. Who can lay trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on thy ſoul, binde thee in chains, and throw thee into hell, but God? and who but God can command all the tempeſts and waves in thy troubled ſoul to be ſtill? When therefore others are ſaid to Juſtifie, that is only to be underſtood <hi>declaratively,</hi> and no more. Now this particular may ſuppreſs all thoſe proud, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaicall thoughts in us, whereby we are apt to be puffed up within our ſelves: what if we Juſtifie our ſelves, and clear our waies? yet if God doth not, we remain ſtill obnoxious, and bound in Gods wrath.</p>
               <p>Again, It is for comfort to the godly, what though Satan, thy own heart, and the world doth condemn thee? yet if God Juſtifie, thou maieſt rejoyce; you ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. what a challenge <hi>Paul</hi> there makes, <hi>Who ſhal lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? it is God that Juſtifieth.</hi> Who ſhall charge any thing? The devil, thy own heart, can lay much pride, hypocriſie, ſloth fulneſſe to thy charge: it is true, but God through Chriſt doth Juſtifie. What a Cordiall and reviver would it be to Gods people, to live in the power of this gift beſtowed upon them? it is God that juſtifieth thee, O my troubled ſoul! who can then condemn? who can hinder it, or invalidate it? Certainly we are therefore in dejections, deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies, and perplexities often, becauſe we drink not of this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65696:15"/>
of life. Lay and apply this excellent Doctrine to thy fainting dying ſoul, and it will become to it, like <hi>Eliſha</hi> applying himſelf to the dead childe, cauſe ſpirit and life again to return to him; right thoughts here, will ſweeten all thoughts in other things.</p>

God in this work of Juſtification, is never deſcribed, as accepting of an imperfect righteouſneſſe for a perfect. No, God doth not ceaſe to be juſt, while he is thus gracious. Again his Juſtice and righteouſneſſe is herein ſeen, that none ſhall be Juſtified, but ſuch ſinners who feel their guilt, and deſire to be eaſed of that burden, beleeving and rolling their ſouls upon him.

that we are no where ſaid in a good ſenſe to Juſtifie ourſelves, or commanded to it, as we are to repent, or beleeve, and to crucifie the luſts of the fleſh, becauſe it is wholly <hi>Gods action</hi>; by faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we apprehend it, but it's <hi>Gods action,</hi> as the window letteth in the light, but it is the Sun that doth inlighten. And from this particular, we may gather much comfort, for when we look into our ſelves and ſee no ſuch righteouſneſſe or holineſſe, that we dare hold out to God, then we may remember, this is not by our doing to God, but receiving from him; and in this ſenſe, it is more bleſſed for us to receive, then to give.

This muſt needs imbolden and incourage the heart, when it knoweth, that both perſon and duties are accepted, though ſo much frailty and weakneſs, yet God will receive thee, The third phraſe is to <hi>make Juſt,</hi> Rom. 5.9. For God doth not pronounce that man juſt, which is not ſo. Therefore when we are Juſtified, this is not abſolutely and ſimply againſt a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of works, but in a certain reſpect, as done by us, and as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience coming from us, and this muſt needs ſupport the ſoul: for when ſatisfaction is made, when God hath as much as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth, why ſhould not this quiet the heart of a man? will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing content thee, unleſſe thou thy ſelf art able to pay God the utmoſt farthing?

                  <hi>Remiſſion of ſin,</hi> and <hi>Imputation of righteouſneſſe:</hi> Indeed here is diverſity of expreſſions among the learned, as you have already heard: ſome thinking the whole nature of Juſtification to be only in <hi>Remiſſion of ſin,</hi> and therefore make it the ſame with <hi>Imputation of righteouſneſſe</hi>; others make <hi>one the ground of the other</hi>; ſome make <hi>Imputation of righteouſnes,</hi> the <hi>efficient</hi> or <hi>meritorious cauſe</hi> of our Juſtification, and <hi>Remiſſion of ſin,</hi> the only <hi>form</hi> of our Juſtification; others make <hi>Remiſſion of ſin</hi> the <hi>effect</hi> only of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.

Now theſe <hi>elect perſons</hi> he cals <hi>unconverted, actively</hi> and <hi>declaratively,</hi> in a very ambiguous, and ſuſpicious manner, as if <hi>converſion</hi> were <hi>from all eternity,</hi> as well as <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> ſo that as they ſay, a man <hi>in time</hi> is juſtified only <hi>declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> being <hi>indeed ſo from all eternity,</hi> thus he muſt be ſaid to be <hi>converted:</hi> and if this be true, then it will likewiſe follow, that a man in heaven is <hi>glorified</hi> likewiſe onely <hi>declaratively,</hi> but <hi>actually</hi> and indeed <hi>glorified from all eternity,</hi> even while he is in this miſerable houſe of clay. In the next place he comes to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical</hi> croſſes, which fall upon them that are <hi>actively</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratively</hi> (as he cals it) <hi>converted,</hi> and theſe he denieth expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be for their ſins, for this were (ſaith he) to deny Chriſts <hi>ſatisfactory puniſhment,</hi> becauſe by his death, we have not one ſpot of ſin in us: therefore he makes them to be only the <hi>tryal of their faith,</hi> and to exerciſe their faith: ſo that (by his divinity) when a godly man is afflicted, the fleſh would indeed perſwade a man hath ſin in him, but this is to try whether thou canſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve thou art cleanſed from ſin for all theſe afflictions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any man yield to this temptation (<hi>viz.</hi> that he hath ſin in him when he is afflicted) what is this (ſaith he) but to deny Chriſt and his bloud?

Hence he laboureth to ſhew that twelve abſurdities would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from this doctrine of Gods afflicting his children for their ſins, the ſtrength of which ſhall be in his place conſidered; I have now only laid down his judgement; and he makes the Doctrine of the Proteſtants oppoſing this to be Popiſh, and confounding the Law and the Goſpel together. Hence intending the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Authors and Miniſters, he ſaith, They paint God like an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry father, ever ſeeing ſin in us, and ever ſtanding with a rod and ſtaff in his hand, lifted up over our heads, with which by reaſon he ſeeth ſins in us, he is ever ready, though not to ſtrike us down, yet to crack our crowns, and ſorely to whip us: whereas the Goſpel deſcribeth him to be not only a loving Father, but alſo our well-pleaſed Father, at perfect peace with us; ſo that the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of his poſition is to ſhew, that they are taskmaſters and do degenerate to the legall teaching in the Old Teſtament, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever preach that God doth correct Believers for their ſins: and I

If we take <hi>peace</hi> in the <hi>firſt reſpect,</hi> it is an abſolute univerſal propoſition, and true of <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very justified perſon</hi>; but in the <hi>latter ſenſe</hi> it is true only of ſome perſons, and at ſome times, for the ſenſe of Gods favour is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable priviledge from thoſe that are in it.</p>
               <p>If by <hi>peace</hi> we ſhould underſtand the ſenſe of Gods favour, and the <hi>declaration</hi> of it in our conſciences (as by their arguments
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65696:26"/>
they muſt do) then it proveth againſt their opinion as well as any others: for they hold that a believer needeth to pray for <hi>pardon</hi> in the <hi>declaration</hi> or ſenſe and <hi>feeling of ſin,</hi> though not for the <hi>pardon it ſelf of ſin</hi>; now there cannot be at the ſame time a want of the <hi>feeling of pardon of ſin,</hi> and the <hi>tranquillity of conſcience</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: ſo that this place muſt needs be a thorn in their ſide.</p>
               <p>But 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, the true and direct anſwer to this place is, that there is a twofold <hi>peace,</hi> one which is oppoſite to the <hi>hatred of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
                  </note> as he is a <hi>terrible enemy</hi> to ſinners, unreconciled with them, in which ſenſe he is often deſcribed in Scripture. The other, as it is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to that <hi>fatherly anger</hi> and diſpleaſure, whereby though for the main reconciled, yet he may for ſome particular faults be diſpleaſed; now the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the former kinde of <hi>peace. Being juſtified</hi> that is God being once <hi>reconciled</hi> with us in Chriſt, he hath no more <hi>hostile enmity</hi> againſt us, and if we do ſin after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he will not become an <hi>enemy</hi> to us, or ſatisfie his juſtice by puniſhing of us, but as a father he may in his diſpleaſure <hi>chaſtiſe</hi> us. The ſenſe of Gods diſpleaſure as a father, may well ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with an aſſurance, that for all this he is no <hi>enemy.</hi> A childe that bitterly crieth out becauſe of his fathers chaſtiſements, yet even then hath that hope and comfort which he would not have if fallen into the hands or rage of an enemy that would kill him. Hence it is that we preſſe all believers, though ſorely puniſhed for their ſins, as their own hearts can tell them, yet they muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver paſs ſuch a ſentence, Now God is become my enemy, he deals with me as with a <hi>Judas,</hi> as with a <hi>Cain</hi>; theſe (we ſay) are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inferences, but they may conclude thus, God, though a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving father, is now very angry, and much diſpleaſed with me.</p>
               <p>Diſtinguiſh then between a <hi>peace</hi> that doth oppoſe the <hi>hatred of God</hi> to a ſinner as an <hi>enemy,</hi> and a peace which doth oppoſe only the <hi>frowns of a father</hi>; and this objection is anſwered. I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the people of God are apt under his ſore diſpleaſure not to diſcern between a <hi>father</hi> and an <hi>enemy.</hi> They have much adoe to keep up this in their hearts; God he ſmites, he frowns, he chides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet he is a father ſtill: but this is their temptation and weakneſſe, and we are apt to endeavour ſome kinde of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to God in our troubles for ſin: therefore it was a moſt bleſſed thing when God at the Reformation out of Popery,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65696:27"/>
cauſed this truth to break out, <hi>That puniſhments for ſin were not ſatisfactory to God, but fatherly chaſtiſements.</hi> Thus you have this anſwered, and as for that which followeth, <hi>we glory in tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> the Apoſtle muſt be limited to thoſe which fall upon us for <hi>profeſſing of Chriſt and his truth.</hi> In theſe we may glory, as the ſouldier doth of his marks and wounds he hath received in the wars for a good cauſe, and to this purpoſe we told you in one Propoſition, That there was a great difference between thoſe troubles that fell upon us, becauſe of the <hi>good in us</hi>; and thoſe which come upon us, becauſe of <hi>the evil in us. What glory is it,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.20. <hi>if ye be buffeted for your faults?</hi> Now who can deny but that even a godly man may fall into ſome hainous crime, for which he may receive a ſentence of death? This man though he may rejoice in God, who doth pardon the ſin to him, yet he can no more glory of this tribulation, then a childe doth of whipping for his faults.</p>
               <p>Another place of Scripture, is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5. <hi>The chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Argum.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and with his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> This Text of Scripture is again and again preſſed by them, and certainly it is more ſweet then the Honey or Honey-Comb: but truly they do with it, as the thieves with the man of <hi>Jericho,</hi> leave it half dead,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
                  </note> and much wounded. Firſt, Let us open the place, and then ſee how far they are from the meaning. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in this Chapter, may be called, as we ſaid before, the fifth Evangeliſt, for he ſeemeth rather to write an Hiſtory of Chriſt, then make a prophecie of him. Among other paſſages theſe two are to our purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him:</hi> by <hi>Peace</hi> here, <hi>Calvin</hi> doth well underſtand, not that of <hi>quietnes in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> but a <hi>reconciliation made with God</hi> through his <hi>ſufferings.</hi> And it is obſerved by ſome, how emphatical the Scripture is in that Pronoun [<hi>He</hi>] <hi>He hath born,</hi> and <hi>He hath been wounded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond follows, <hi>With his ſtripes we are healed:</hi> Some think that this is ſpoken to debaſe that condition Chriſt ſo voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put himſelf in, that ſo his love might appear the more to us; it being an alluſion to the <hi>State of ſervants,</hi> who uſed to be <hi>chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> by their lords. The phraſe is the ſame with that, <hi>He hath born our griefs,</hi> or diſeaſes, which <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.17. is applied to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65696:27"/>
Chriſts <hi>healing of diſeaſes,</hi> and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. to that <hi>ſuffering upon the Croſſe.</hi> And well may this be, becauſe the <hi>outward</hi> healing of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, was a Symbole or Teſtimony of his inward healing. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Grotius</hi> obſerveth, That Chriſt is therefore ſaid to <hi>bear</hi> our diſeaſes when he <hi>cured</hi> them, becauſe of the great pains and travell he took therein, for it was after Sun-ſet, and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude did much throng him; ſo then, by the words you ſee the whole price of our peace laid upon Chriſt, and by him all evils, both temporall and ſpirituall removed: but what is this to the purpoſe? Yes (ſay they) here our <hi>chaſtiſements are laid upon Chriſt,</hi> therefore <hi>we have none for ſin</hi>; but 1. if this proved any thing, it will be more then the Antinomians will yield, for it would infer, that there are no chaſtiſements at all, either <hi>for ſin,</hi> or <hi>no ſin</hi>; now the Antinomians cannot deny (and experience confuteth them) but that the <hi>godly</hi> have <hi>afflictions,</hi> though as (they ſay) not <hi>for ſin</hi>; and this will inevitably follow by their argument; for as they would prove from hence they have <hi>no ſin</hi> at all, not only ſin that will not <hi>condem</hi> (as the Orthodox ſay) but even <hi>no ſin</hi>; ſo it will by the ſame reaſon follow, that <hi>believers</hi> have <hi>no chaſtiſements</hi> at all, I do not ſay (<hi>not for ſin</hi>) but none at all.</p>
               <p>But Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
                  </note> The Antinomian in that place <hi>pag.</hi> 129. doth fully anſwer himſelf, All chaſtiſement (ſaith he) for ſin, needfull for the making perfect peace between God and his juſtified chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, was laid upon him: very true, Therefore ſay we, though theſe <hi>chaſtiſements</hi> be <hi>for ſin,</hi> yet they are not upon the godly as upon Chriſt, they are not to <hi>ſatisfie</hi> Gods <hi>juſtice,</hi> to work a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,</hi> but only to humble them in themſelves, and make them the better feel how much they are beholding to Chriſt who bore ſo much wrath for them. To ſay therefore as the Papiſts, Chriſt by <hi>his death</hi> did only remove the <hi>ſpirituall evil,</hi> and we by <hi>our ſufferings</hi> muſt take away the <hi>temporall puniſhment,</hi> this would indeed be derogatory to Chriſt, and take off in a great meaſure from his glory.</p>
               <p>A Third place brought in to maintain their errour,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Argum.</hi>
                  </note> is <hi>James</hi> 1.2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Count it matter of all joy when you ſhall fall into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers temptations,</hi> therefore (ſaith he) they are not <hi>for ſin,</hi> becauſe they are matters of joy; and mark how he baptizeth (goeth on the Author) <hi>croſſes</hi> and <hi>afflictions,</hi> as it were with a new name, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65696:28"/>
from the nature of the change of them through the Goſpel, calling them <hi>temptations</hi> and <hi>trials.</hi> But mark the ignorance of the adverſary rather then the name of afflictions: for, Is it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to beleevers under the Goſpel, that their afflictions are tryals? what then will he return to that place, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.2. God ſaith, the afflictions upon the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for fourty years in the wilderneſſe (and they were not all beleevers, much leſſe beleevers under the Goſpel) were to humble them, and prove or try them? And <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.7. God ſpeaking of the Iſraelites ſaith, He will <hi>melt them and try them.</hi> See alſo <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.25. <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.9. Whereby you will preſently judge of the mans bold ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. But as for the place it ſelf, certainly the words are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry emphaticall. <hi>Count it</hi> (implying a man in his choiceſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration ought to do ſo) <hi>all joy,</hi> an Hebraiſm, full, perfect joy, <hi>when ye fall,</hi> the word is <hi>ſo fall</hi> that ye are compaſſed round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. And laſtly, <hi>divers temptations,</hi> By temptations <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſeemeth to have underſtood inticements or provocations to ſin, and whether ſuch temptations may be deſired, or to give ground of a juſt joy, is diſputed by the Schoolmen, but that is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: we ſee the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of afflictions, as appeareth by the word following, and not all kinde of afflictions, but ſuch as are for <hi>Chriſts name:</hi> certainly the Apoſtle writing to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, and ſpeaking of the <hi>chaſtiſements</hi> of God upon them for their <hi>ſins,</hi> he doth not bid them count <hi>that all joy,</hi> but rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them to <hi>judge themſelves that they be not condemned with the world.</hi> He doth not then ſpeak of all kinde of afflictions, but ſome only, and his meaning is not, that under even thoſe affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions they ſhould have no grief (for he ſaith, <hi>no affliction is for the preſent joyous but grievous</hi>) but he giveth one reſpect why they ſhould rejoyce, becauſe of the good work of their faith manifeſted thereby, though in other conſiderations they may be humbled. And I ſee not but even in thoſe <hi>perſecutions</hi> which befall the <hi>godly</hi> for the <hi>Goſpels ſake,</hi> they may not, ſome of them at leaſt, and ſometimes, be <hi>humiliations</hi> for the Godlies former ſinnes, as well as <hi>explorations</hi> of their <hi>Graces,</hi> and more eminent glorifying of them here and hereafter. I deny not but even in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions <hi>for their ſins,</hi> the people of God may take comfort to their ſouls from ſeverall conſiderations, but I think not that the

Objections, that may tend much to edification, both in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and affections; and by the ſtriking of flint ſtones together, there may flie out ſparks enough to kindle godlineſs and zeal in our breſt. This I ſhall endeavour by Gods aſſiſtance in that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and famous queſtion, of <hi>Gods forgiving ſin.</hi> For to preach in crabbed controverſies, is like <hi>Gideon,</hi> Judg. 8.16. to teach men with briars and thorns, as the phraſe there is.

               <p>Secondly, Here is a promiſe to remove their <hi>ſpiritual evil,</hi> which was the cauſe of the former; God will pardon their ſins; and by this a profitable Doctrine is taught, <hi>That a people ought to be more deſirous of Gods pardon, then of removal of their calamities,</hi> whereas commonly like unwiſe diſeaſed men, we complain more of the Symptomes then of the diſeaſe it ſelf. The evil of ſin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priveth us of an infinite good; but the evil of afflictions, only of a finite. Now this promiſe is not to be ſtretched out only to the times of the Goſpel, but is particularly true of the Jews, when removed out of their baniſhment, yet not to be limited to that time only; and howſoever <hi>the promiſe for pardon be general to all,</hi> yet it is to be underſtood in this manner, that to the <hi>wicked,</hi> their <hi>ſin was no farther forgiven,</hi> then in this ſenſe, <hi>That their captivity was removed:</hi> but to <hi>the true believers,</hi> there was a <hi>real taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of Gods wrath and diſpleaſure from them.</hi> The <hi>promiſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> is deſcribed very emphatically and comfortably to the <hi>truly humbled Jews, There ſhall be none of their ſins,</hi> and <hi>none ſhall be found when ſought for:</hi> This expreſſion doth ſuppoſe a <hi>judicial inquiry,</hi> (as when God is ſaid <hi>to make inquiſition for bloud</hi>) and <hi>to be found</hi> doth imply, <hi>God judicially taking notice of a man to puniſh him,</hi> ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.15. <hi>In her was found the bloud of the Saints:</hi> So <hi>Beza</hi> am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifieth that word, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>be found in him,</hi> as if the juſtice of God were purſuing <hi>Paul</hi> as a malefactor, and Chriſt was a City of refuge unto him.</p>

Now beſides theſe verbal expreſſions, you have many real phraſes that do declare this great mercy, as <hi>Micah</hi> 7.19. <hi>He will ſubdue our iniquities, and thou wilt caſt them into the bottom of the ſea,</hi> where the Prophet doth admire the goodneſſe and freeneſſe of God herein, <hi>Who is a God like thee? paſſing by iniquity, ſubduing ſins.</hi> The word implieth, that our ſins were as our <hi>enemies,</hi> the <hi>guilt</hi> of them did <hi>inſlave us,</hi> and keep us like vaſſals in fear, but now they are <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered.</hi> And further, <hi>He throweth them in the bottom of the ſea,</hi> there is no more <hi>memory</hi> or <hi>footſteps</hi> of them, as when the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were drowned in the bottom of the ſea, they could never hurt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> more.

to a contrite heart, which is apt to imagine God as alwaies beholding his ſins, and ſending forth his judgements becauſe of them, whereas it muſt be as a foundation laid, That God is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and mercifull, not only in the generall, but even to us in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.

Thoſe ſins committed by thee and repented of, are as abſolutely forgiven as can be deſired: they can be no better par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned if thou waſt in heaven, or hadſt perfect righteouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon thee.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>As God doth indeed really thus remit, ſo the Scripture commands the repentant ſinner to believe this, and with confidence to rest ſatisfied.</hi> Oh what holy boldneſſe may this truth believed work in the tender heart! You may ſee a poor man, though he hath much ado to live, yet if his debts be diſcharged, how glad he is he can go abroad, and fear no Sergeant to Arreſt him, no writ iſſued out to attach him; and thus it is with a ſinner repenting and beleeving; and if there be any whoſe heart is not raviſhed with this glorious mercy, it is to be feared, he never felt the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of ſin, or elſe never ſtrongly beleeved this gracious way of God. Let not then any Antinomian ſay, we put water into the beleevers wine, or wormwood into their bread; for who can ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally deſire more then this doth amount to? but to expect ſuch a <hi>pardon,</hi> ſuch a <hi>juſtification,</hi> as that God ſhall <hi>take no notice of ſin,</hi> to <hi>chaſtiſe</hi> or <hi>afflict for it,</hi> is to ſay, <hi>There is forgiveneſs with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he may not be feared,</hi> contrary to <hi>Davids</hi> expreſſion.</p>

                  <hi>ſins are blotted out, as well as ſins of an inferiour nature</hi>; Though there be ſins that waſte the <hi>conſcience,</hi> yet they do not waſte the <hi>grace of remiſſion</hi>; how is the true repentant affected with ſlaviſh fears ſometimes, as if his ſins did blot out Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy like a thick cloud? as if our tranſgreſſions had ſubdued his goodneſſe, and thrown it into the bottom of the Sea? What a comfortable expreſſion is that, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.18. <hi>Though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow,</hi> &amp;c. It was wonderfull mercy that ever ſo horrid and bloudy ſinners (therefore their ſins are ſaid to be like ſcarlet) ſhould become ſo clear, yet the grace of Juſtification doth as <hi>totally remit great ſins, as leſſe ſins,</hi> as Chriſt did with the ſame eaſineſſe cure ſeveral diſeaſes. Thus <hi>David</hi> alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. after he had wallowed in that mire, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be <hi>purged,</hi> in an alluſive expreſſion, <hi>with hyſope,</hi> which was the laſt thing uſed in their legal purifications, and therefore doth imply the <hi>total</hi> and <hi>compleat cleanſing</hi> by Chriſt, and upon this, <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>He ſhall be whiter then ſnow,</hi> which phraſe is neither with the Papiſt to be extended to <hi>ſanctification,</hi> as if ſuch perfect clean righteouſneſſe were vouchſafed to him, as that there were <hi>no ſin in him,</hi> nor with the Antinomian, as if God did <hi>quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh ſin from</hi> David <hi>out of his ſight,</hi> ſo as to take no <hi>notice</hi> of it, or <hi>chaſtiſe</hi> him for it (for after the pardon was paſt, yet his childe was to die, and much more evil to come to <hi>Davids</hi> houſe) but in reſpect of <hi>final condemnation,</hi> God having thus pardoned

                  <hi>David</hi> through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> would no more adjudge him to everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhment, then he would one that was innocent, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſpot of ſin. And this is to incourage great ſinners; ten thouſand talents was a great ſumme of money, yet how eaſily forgiven by that kinde Maſter? Thus <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. God is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed forgiving ſins of all ſorts, and this he proclaimed, when his glory paſſed by; and how neceſſary is this for the contrite heart, which judgeth his ſins, becauſe of the aggravations of them, to be unpardonable? If they had not been of ſuch a breadth and depth, and length, they would not fear overwhelming as now they do. There are ſins of all ſorts deſcribed, and which is to be obſerved, God putteth no term or bounds to his mercy, whereas he doth ſet ſome to his anger. Let not therefore the greatneſs of ſin be thought more then the greatneſs of mercy pardoning, and Chriſts obedience ſuffering; as it is hypocriſie to extenuate and make our ſins leſſe then they are, ſo it is unbelief to diminiſh his grace; and Gods greatneſs above us is as much celebrated in this his kindneſs, as in any other attribute. The ſins of all the world, if they were thy ſins, were but like a drop of water to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, no more then our eſſence or power is to his Majeſty: Take heed then of ſaying Such and ſuch ſins may be forgiven, but can he forgive ſuch as mine are alſo?</p>

               <p>Secondly, That the Spirit of God <hi>ſeeth</hi> them, <hi>takes notice</hi> of them, they are loathſome to him, and therefore he <hi>mortifieth</hi> them.

                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:65696:37"/>To this what do they anſwer?</p>
               <p>They ſay, <hi>We do not mortifie ſin, no not by Gods Spirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians anſwer confuted.</note> 
                  <hi>out of Gods ſight, but only out of our own ſight,</hi> ſo that when the Spirit of God overcometh a corruption in us, this is not by removing it out of Gods ſight, but our own only, <hi>Honey-Comb,</hi> pag. 164. for (ſay they) <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe being made ours, we are all clean before God,</hi> and that which the Spirit of God doth afterwards in <hi>ſanctification,</hi> is cleanſing away ſin only <hi>declaratively</hi> before men; Hence (as you heard) they diſtinguiſh of a two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>fold <hi>cleanſing,</hi> one ſecret and myſticall by <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe,</hi> and the other palpable and groſſe to our ſenſe and feeling, which is by <hi>Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in us</hi>; but here are many miſtakes and errours.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they oppoſe <hi>Chriſts cleanſing</hi> and the <hi>Spirits cleanſing</hi> together; for what Chriſts bloud doth <hi>meritoriouſly</hi> cleanſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the ſame Chriſts Spirit doth by <hi>efficacious application.</hi> Hence Chriſt by his death doth quite remove ſin, in reſpect of the guilt of it here on earth, and doth give his Spirit to crucifie the power of it; ſo that both Chriſts cleanſing, and the Spirits cleanſing, do relate to Gods ſight: for it is Gods will that we ſhould not only be clean by imputed righteouſneſſe, but alſo by inherent holineſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is falſe, that we only mortifie ſin <hi>declaratively to men,</hi> for it is really and indeed done, even to God-ward. Hence this is the great difference between a Phariſaicall or externall mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a ſpirituall; The former is from humane principles to humane motives; the other is from God, and to God, and through God: ſo that as that is not a divine faith, but humane, which is not from a divine principle, and becauſe of divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; ſo neither can that be divine and ſpirituall mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is not from divine efficiency, and becauſe of divine grounds. Hereby it is that the whole work of grace is called a <hi>new creature,</hi> and it is a new creature not only man-ward, but God-ward, and who can think when <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. we are exhorted <hi>to put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſſe,</hi> that any other ſenſe can be drawn out of it, then that, <hi>the putting off the old man,</hi> and <hi>putting on the new,</hi> have relation to God as well as man? It is therefore well obſerved by <hi>Muſculus</hi> on the former Text, that both theſe are put together, <hi>If ye through the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65696:38"/>
Spirit do mortifie; we</hi> and the <hi>Spirit. The Spirit,</hi> and that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the Popiſh means of mortification to be unprofitable, the Spirit of God neither appointing them, or working by them. Then he addeth <hi>ye,</hi> denoting that we alſo are to work and act (being firſt quickned with a ſpiritual life put into us) and not as ſome do now dangerouſly maintain, give up all, expecting the operation of the Spirit only.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The falſhood of this Aſſertion will further appear; If the Spirit of God by <hi>mortification</hi> doth not <hi>remove ſin out of us,</hi> as to Gods ſight, then by further <hi>ſanctification, it brings no good thing into us as to Gods ſight likewiſe</hi>; and thus as God ſhall ſee no ſin in his people, ſo neither no good thing inherently in his people; for this muſt neceſſarily follow by their principles, as <hi>God takes no notice of ſin inherent in believers to be angry with them</hi>; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>no notice of inherent grace to be well pleaſed with them</hi>; for if the Spirit of God do not cleanſe our corruption from Gods ſight, then ſtill the more corruption is waſhed away, God ſtill doth no waies approve that holineſſe, but it is only the imputed holines of Chriſt, which he regards. Therefore he that maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>God ſeeth no ſin in believers to chaſtiſe,</hi> muſt maintain, <hi>he ſeeth no graces in them to reward them</hi>; and take their own ſimilitude, as he (ſay they) that looks thorow a red glaſſe ſeeth every thing in it red, if there be dirt in it, it looks red, if there be pearls in it, it looketh red, all is one to the ſight; ſo when God looketh upon us in Chriſt, if there be ſin, if there be our own inherent holines, it is all one, God ſeeth only Chriſts holineſs. Thus while the Antinomian laboureth to have our ſins covered from Gods eies; he likewiſe ſpreads a covering over all the fruits of Gods Spirit in us, that they ſhall not be taken notice of: whereas none ever denied but that the graces of Gods people are acceptable to him, though not to juſtification; and many promiſes he makes to them, the imperfection being done away by Chriſt. But in their way, as God takes no notice of <hi>Pauls</hi> ſinfull motions to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at them, ſo neither of all his labourings and ſufferings in the Goſpel way.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If the Spirit of God do only <hi>mortifie, as to our feeling,</hi> and not to <hi>Gods ſight,</hi> then when the ſoul departs into glory, all <hi>that inherent purity,</hi> muſt only be <hi>declaratively</hi> alſo; but in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65696:38"/>
we are made holy <hi>perfectly in Gods ſight,</hi> and that without any imputed righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, though Chriſt did purchaſe and obtain that for us. Now what the Spirit of God doth finiſh and conſummate upon the ſouls diſſolution, he had begun even in this life.</p>
               <p>A third ſort of Arguments is from thoſe places which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <hi>repentance, humiliation, and godly ſorrow for ſin</hi>;<note place="margin">Third ſort of Arguments: Revel 2.18.</note> for if God takes no <hi>notice of our ſin,</hi> be not <hi>offended at it,</hi> we may indeed be ſorrowfull for ſin becauſe of men, but not becauſe of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 4.9, 10. 2 Cor. 7.9, 10.</note> Shall I be ſorrowfull becauſe God is offended when he is not offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? ſhall I weep becauſe God is angry when he is not angry? If you ask <hi>Peter</hi> why he weeps bitterly, will he not ſay, Becauſe he offended God? If you ask the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> why they are ſo deeply humbled, will not they ſay, becauſe by their ſins they provoked God to bring temporal calamities upon them? ſo that the poiſonous nature of this Doctrine, appeareth in nothing more then in this, it taketh away <hi>all grounds of humiliation and repentance of ſin in thoſe that do believe.</hi> Therefore mark it, <hi>He that ſaith there is no ſin in the Church of God now</hi> (which is their expreſs opinion) he muſt likewiſe ſay, <hi>There is no godly ſorrow in the Church of God now.</hi> For what is the reaſon there can be no godly ſorrow in heaven, there was none in the ſtate of innocency, but becauſe there was no ſin there? and it muſt be thus now in the Church of God. This error eateth into the vitals of godlineſſe, therefore beware of it. Say, I will have no ſuch free grace, as ſhall take away godly ſorrow; Remember the gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. where God promiſeth, <hi>a ſpirit of prayer and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſin,</hi> as well as to blot out ſin, he ſhall not obtain the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for the later, that feeleth not the promiſe for the former. And certainly, if this Doctrine were true, why did <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>Though I made you ſorry, I did not repent?</hi> We Miniſters ought to repent, that ever we made you ſorry; and you are to repent that ever you have been ſorrowfull.</p>
               <p>A fourth kinde is from all thoſe places,<note place="margin">Fourth kinde of Arguments.</note> where God is ſaid ſo <hi>to take notice of the ſins of juſtified perſons, as that he doth grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly afflict them for their tranſgreſſions.</hi> This Argument doth properly and directly overthrow the whole Antinomian aſſertion, but becauſe I have largely proved this already, I will
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65696:39"/>
not inſiſt on it. To make good their aſſertion, <hi>that God ſeeth no ſin,</hi> they are forced alſo to hold, <hi>that all the afflictions upon the godly, are only trials of their faith, preſervatives from ſin, but not correctives for ſin.</hi> But did not God ſee ſin in <hi>Moſes,</hi> when for his unbelief he kept him out of <hi>Canaan?</hi> Did not he ſee ſin in <hi>David,</hi> though pardoned, grievouſly chaſtiſing him afterwards? Did he not ſee ſin in <hi>Jonah,</hi> who would fain have run from Gods face, that he might not have ſeen him? Did he not ſee ſin in the Corinthians, when many of them were ſick and weak, for abuſing the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, yet many of them were ſuch, that therefore were cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened, that they might not be condemned of the Lord.</p>
               <p>There are more arguments, but at this time I conclude with an uſe of exhortation, to broken-hearted, and contrite ſinners, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again to meditate upon the great and glorious expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which the Scripture uſeth about forgiveneſſe of ſin.

               <p>A Fifth rank of arguments is from thoſe places of Scripture,<note place="margin">Fifth rank of Arguments.</note> wherein the people of God in their petitions and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, doe neceſſarily imply this truth, <hi>that God ſeeth, taketh notice, and is angry with their ſins.</hi> Now all petitions uſe to be in a two-fold <hi>faith,</hi> one <hi>applicative</hi> and <hi>fiduciall,</hi> the other <hi>doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> and <hi>aſſertive,</hi> which is the foundation of the former. If a Papiſt pray for the deliverance of any out of purgatory, it is a vain prayer, becauſe there is not a theologicall verity to ground his prayer upon: thus a Socinian cannot truly pray to God in Chriſt, becauſe he hath not a dogmaticall or aſſenting faith to the truth of Chriſts divine nature, and ſo cannot have a fiduciall faith in the ſame.</p>
               <p>Thus it would be with the people of God, how can they in their prayers entreat God <hi>to turn away his anger from them, to hide his face from their ſins, if he were not indeed angry?</hi> Now that the petitions of Gods people are for this end, will appear by ſeverall places. I ſhall not here mention that petition, we are directed to in the Lords prayer, <hi>viz. forgive us our ſins,</hi> for that is a noble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and deſerveth a ſingle conſideration of its ſelf; but we have many other inſtances, as <hi>Pſa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 51.9. <hi>Hide thy face from my ſins.</hi> It is plain by this praier, Gods face, and ſo his eyes <hi>were upon Davids ſins though juſtified,</hi> and that a godly man falling into grievous <hi>ſins,</hi> hath them not <hi>preſently covered</hi> from <hi>Gods eyes</hi>; for his meaning by this phraſe, is, that God <hi>would not regard them to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65696:40"/>
viſit them on him,</hi> the contrary whereof is <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119.15. <hi>Let their ſin be continually before thee</hi>; and this is obſervable, that <hi>David</hi> doth again and again petition for pardon, whereby is ſhewed how difficult a thing it is to obtain the favour of God after we have offended him by our ſins. Neither let that be replied, that this is done by Believers in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi>; for <hi>Paul</hi> bringeth a proof from <hi>Pſa.</hi> 32.1. to ſhew what is the nature of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even under the Goſpel. And that I may once for all this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve this objection of theirs, I ſhall handle diſtinctly this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Whether the Justification of believers under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and New, be not uniform and altogether the ſame?</hi> which is to be affirmatively maintained, and therefore remit you to that queſtion. For the preſent, we ſee how <hi>David</hi> here doth twice and thrice with much vehemency deſire that Gods <hi>face would not be upon his ſins.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note> Here may be one conſiderable queſtion made, ſeeing <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet had told <hi>David</hi> his ſin was forgiven him; Was not this great unbelief and diffidence, to pray for pardon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that conſolation? To this it may be anſwered,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Nathans</hi> comfort might be given after this penitential Pſalm: for although 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. the Hiſtory makes mention of <hi>Nathans</hi> oyl poured into <hi>David,</hi> as ſoon as ever he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet it is a frequent thing in Scripture to have thoſe things immediatly connected in ſtory, when yet there was a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the practice. But grant it was immediatly upon <hi>Davids</hi> repentance; yet faith in God <hi>for pardon,</hi> may well ſtand with <hi>prayer for pardon</hi>; The deep ſenſe and feeling of Gods offence, cannot but provoke to earneſt petition, though faith at the ſame time perſwadeth the heart God will hear: Hence <hi>David</hi> doth not here pray in unbelief, thinking God would not pardon him; therefore ſome tranſlate <hi>v.</hi> 7. in the future tenſe, <hi>Thou wilt purge me with hyſop,</hi> becauſe of his aſſurance. Again, though God <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved Davids ſin</hi> in reſpect <hi>of condemnation,</hi> yet not in reſpect of <hi>all other effects of his anger,</hi> for ſo his ſin did ſtill lie as a burden on him, and in this reſpect he ſtill ſeeketh Gods face. In the next place conſider, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 32.1, 3, 4. Of all parts of the Scripture, the Pſalms have this excellency, that they do in a lively experimental way ſet forth the gracious works of God upon the ſoul, and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> doth in many Pſalms, ſtill as it were play upon the Harp, to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65696:40"/>
drive out the evil ſpirit of unbelief and diffidence out of a mans heart. Now this Pſalm is a moſt excellent directory for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of pardon after ſin committed; wherein <hi>David</hi> being for a while grievouſly cruſhed by Gods anger for his ſins, at laſt feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sun-ſhine of his favour breaking through the clouds, he doth in the beginning of the ſame joyfully break out, admiring the happines of thoſe who have their ſins pardoned, and he doth in ſeveral words repeat the ſame benefit, becauſe of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it: and certainly were your hearts touched with the ſenſe of Gods diſpleaſure for ſin, neither riches, nor good trading, or any advantage in the world, would ſo glad your heart, as to have a pardon of ſin. For how cometh <hi>David</hi> to be thus affected with forgiveneſſe of his ſins? even becauſe he confeſſed it not, was not humbled under it, till Gods wrath was heavy upon him, and then he reſolved to acknowledge it, whereupon God immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgiveth him. Now leſt any ſhould think What is this to us in the <hi>times of the Goſpel?</hi> obſerve <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>For this every one that is godly ſhall pray unto thee,</hi> that is, for this remiſſion, for this pardon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that is godly ſhall pray; ſo that its <hi>ungodlineſſe</hi> by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> judgement <hi>not to confeſſe ſin,</hi> or <hi>to pray for the pardon,</hi> which how can any Antinomian do by his principles, that holdeth, <hi>God ſeeth not, or taketh notice, ſo as to be offended with the ſins of juſtified perſons:</hi> and ſo they are not only Antinomiſts, but Anti<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioniſts, Anti-Petitioniſts, and Anti-penitents.</p>
               <p>Take one more inſtance, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 6.1. where <hi>David</hi> prayeth God would <hi>not rebuke him in his hot diſpleaſure,</hi> Compare this with <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.24. where you ſee the ſervants of God do ſuppoſe an anger from God will fall on them for their ſins, and they do not refuſe his rebukes, only they deſire God would moderate and ſet bounds to his wrath, that it may not overwhelm them. Many other places there are, where its plain, the people of God pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, do ſuppoſe him to be angry with them for their ſins; and it is a truth ſo ingraven in the heart of a godly man, that no error can ever quite obliturate it.</p>
               <p>A ſixth ſort of Arguments ſhall be from thoſe places,<note place="margin">Six ſort of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</note> where God is ſaid <hi>to take notice of our ſin, more then we can or do,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.18, 19, 20. where the Apoſtle preſſeth believers to a ſincere love of one another with this Argument, that <hi>hereby we ſhall aſſure
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65696:41"/>
our hearts before him</hi>; the Greek word ſignifyeth to <hi>perſwade,</hi> and doth excellently ſet forth the difficulty of being aſſured in Gods preſence. Now this great benefit he illuſtrates by the contrary, <hi>if our hearts condemn us, God is greater then our hearts</hi>; and this holdeth univerſally in every holy duty, as well as that of love: if our hearts condemn us for hypocriſie, and inſincerity in them, God doth much more, for <hi>he knoweth more evil by our ſelves then we do.</hi> Now how can this Apoſtolicall aſſertion be true, if ſo be <hi>God took no notice, or were not offended at the ſins of his people?</hi> Its an argument of ſweet meditation to humble us, that if where there is but a drop of grace, our ſins are ſo lothſome and offenſive; how much more muſt they be to the ocean of all purity?<note place="margin">Antinomian objections an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> To this the Antinomian replieth (<hi>Honey-Comb</hi> p 89.) that <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks this of <hi>hypocrites,</hi> and not the <hi>juſtified children of God</hi>; But 1. he gives the expreſſe title of <hi>little children</hi> to them, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. and <hi>my little children,</hi> ſo that he taketh upon him the bowels of a father to them. Again, let it be granted that he deſcribes <hi>hypocrites,</hi> yet there is no <hi>godly man</hi> but this text will in ſome ſenſe belong to, there is no man ſo godly, but he hath ſome hypocriſie and inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in his beſt love; there is that worm in his beſt fruit, that droſſe in his beſt gold. It followeth then by proportion, that ſo far as the godly do diſcern imperfections, and inſincerity in their duties, ſo far they are to be humbled before God, who knoweth much more by them then they diſcern; as you ſee little moats are diſcerned by the Sun-beams in the Air, which were not diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before: therefore when <hi>John</hi> addeth, <hi>If our hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence with God,</hi> his meaning is not, as if we could have no confidence where our hearts doe condemn us in ſome degrees, for then none in the world could have confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but he ſpeaks of condemning our ſelves upon a diſcovery of a total and wilful hypocriſie; and ſo we will indeed grant that he ſpeaks of hypocrites, but yet it proveth as much as we deſire, namely, that where there is any condemnation of our ſelves for any degree of inſincerity in any duty, we are to tremble, and to remember that God is greater then our hearts, knoweth more by us, and ſo his wrath might break out hotter then we can imagine. Neither is the former anſwer weakned, though we grant it to be underſtood of total hypocrites, for it is uſuall with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle

Now in this caſe God hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Miniſters of the Goſpel to binde &amp; to retain ſuch a mans ſins till he doth repent.

good in Heaven againſt that man. Now how can God make good the Miniſters threatnings applied to that godly man, if he take not notice, and be not offended with the perſon ſo hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinning? The places that prove ſuch a <hi>binding of ſin,</hi> and Gods ratifying of their ſentence, are <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.23. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18. Can any man ſay, that when a godly man is caſt out of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, the ſeals of Gods grace denied him, and he delivered up to Satan, that God is not angry with him? yea, is not he bound then to apprehend God eſtranged from him? when a godly man is excommunicated, he is not only caſt out from the <hi>externall</hi> Church-ſociety, but likewiſe there is a deprivation from <hi>internal</hi> communion with Chriſt; not as if he were cut off from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or decree of Gods election, or as if the habitual ſeed of grace were quite extinct in him, but only as the outward ſeals of Gods favour are denied him; ſo alſo doth God being angry with him, deny him any inward teſtimonies of his favour; and it would not be faith againſt ſenſe (as the Adverſary cals it) but preſumption againſt Scripture to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God was at that time well pleaſed with him; yea Divines ſay (<hi>Synopſis puri. Theol. diſ.</hi> 48.) that there is a conditional excluſion of the perſon ſo offending from future glory, for the Church threatens him, that as they judge him now, and bid him depart from their ſociety, ſo if he do not repent, Chriſt at the laſt day will command him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from his preſence and the holy Angels, according to that of <hi>Tertul. in Apologetico, Summum futuri judicii praejudicium eſt, ſi quis it a deliquerit, ut à communicatione orationis &amp; conventus, &amp; omnis ſancti commeroii relegetur.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, That ſins committed after our <hi>Juſtification</hi> need an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate</hi>; it is not enough that we were once juſtified, our new ſins would condemn us for all that, were it not for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In <hi>that Chriſt is an Advocate,</hi> it ſuppoſeth, That though God be a <hi>Father</hi> to his people, yet he is alſo a <hi>Judge,</hi> and that he ſo taketh notice of, and is diſpleaſed with their ſins, that did not Chriſt intercede and deprecate the wrath of God, it would utterly conſume them. Thou therefore who ſayeſt, God the Father is not <hi>offended,</hi> why then doth Chriſt perform the Office of an <hi>Advocate?</hi> If thy ſins be not brought into the Court, what need any pleading for thee? In the other place, <hi>Heb</hi> 7.25. The Apoſtle acknowledgeth a two-fold function of Chriſts Prieſtly Office, The one is, <hi>The offering up of himſelf for our ſins</hi>; The ſecond is, <hi>The continual Interceſſion for us,</hi> which the Apoſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.24. calleth, <hi>Appearing before Gods face in our behalf</hi>; now we muſt not ſo advance Chriſts ſufferings in the <hi>taking away</hi> of ſin, ſo as to exclude the other part of his Prieſtly Office, which is, <hi>continually to plead our cauſe for us:</hi> for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle makes Chriſt to ſtand before the face of God, as ſome great Favorite before an earthly Prince, to plead in the behalf of thoſe who are accuſed; ſo that the Doctrine which denieth <hi>God ſeeing of ſin in his people,</hi> doth wholly overthrow <hi>Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion,</hi> and the efficacy of it. Concerning the manner of <hi>Chriſts Interceſſion,</hi> it is not to be conceived in that way as he prayed here upon the earth; but it is his holy will, and expreſſe deſire of his ſoul, that God the Father ſhould be reconciled with thoſe for whom he hath ſhed his bloud: and truly that point of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſts affections and ſympathizing with his people now in heaven, is an Ocean of infinite comfort.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Ninth ſort of Arguments.</note> I Shall now conclude with the laſt ſort of Arguments, which are from thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak how God is <hi>affected with his people when they have ſinned,</hi> which <hi>affections</hi> do neceſſarily imply <hi>Gods ſeeing of ſin,</hi> ſo as to be <hi>angry with them,</hi> yea in ſome reſpects Gods anger is more to them then others, and we ſay, in ſome ſenſe God doth <hi>more ſee</hi> and take notice of <hi>the ſins of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers then others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The places of Scripture which ſpeak in what manner God takes the ſins of believers, are theſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.30. <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God,</hi> &amp;c. where the godly in their ſins are ſaid to <hi>grieve Gods Spirit.</hi> Now can the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> which is alſo God, be <hi>grieved</hi> (to ſpeak after the manner of men) at our ſins, and not <hi>take notice of them?</hi> certainly if they grieve God, they ought to grieve us, let us not neglect that which the Spirit of God is ſo offended with. This place ſeemeth to be taken out of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.10. <hi>They vexed his holy Spirit.</hi> So that it is ſuch a grieving, as doth vex and imbitter the holy Spirit of God. O what a dreadfull conſideration ſhould this be againſt all falſhoods in this point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doth not God, doth not the Spirit of God take notice of thy corruptions, yet it is grieved and vexed at them? furthermore the aggravation of this ſin is ſeen in that it is againſt the <hi>Spirit that doth ſeal us to the day of redemption.</hi> A Metaphor, ſaith <hi>Zanchy (in loc.)</hi> from Merchants, who having bought ſuch goods, ſeal them as their own, that ſo leaving others, they may tranſport
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65696:43"/>
them. Now for the godly to ſin, it is to deface this ſeal, and if it be ſo great an offence to violate humane ſeals, how much more divine? Obſerve likewiſe that paſſage of God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Ex. 4.14. where <hi>Moſes</hi> out of the ſenſe of his infirmity, refuſing the office <hi>God</hi> called him to twice or thrice, it is ſaid, <hi>The Lords wrath was kindled againſt him.</hi> In the Hebrew it is very emphatical, <hi>The fury of the Lord was angry againſt Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>LXX,</hi>

                  </gap>, by which expreſſion was ſignified, <hi>God was not lightly, but grievouſly angry with him</hi>; So <hi>Pſ.</hi> 74.1. the Church crieth out, <hi>Why doth thine anger ſmoke againſt the ſheep of thy paſture?</hi> and in many other places. Now, can God be <hi>angry,</hi> and that in ſo high a degree, with that which he doth <hi>not ſee,</hi> or <hi>take notice of?</hi> It is true <hi>Iſidor.

                  </gap>, but then anger is to be taken in a ſtrict ſenſe, for <hi>puniſhment by way of ſatisfaction,</hi> but otherwiſe the Scripture doth frequently uſe this word, and that of God to his own people, yea <hi>vengeance,</hi> which is more, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 96.8. But that it may the better appear, how great the guilt of ſin in believers, even in the ſight of God is, and what his account is of it, take notice of theſe particulars.<note place="margin">Particulars ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing how great the guilt of ſin is in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers even in Gods ſight.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, What the Scripture ſtiles them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.29. There God reproveth <hi>Eli</hi> in his indulgence about his ſons, with this remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able expreſſion, <hi>Thou honoureſt thy ſons above me.</hi> Is not this an aggravation which God <hi>taketh notice of?</hi> and yet <hi>Eli</hi> did reprove his ſons, but becauſe he failed in the meaſure of zeal, therefore is God thus angry with him; ſo that God doth not only <hi>ſee the</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                  <hi>groſſe ſins committed by his people,</hi> but a <hi>leſſe meaſure of their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and is angry for that. So <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. becauſe the Church abated in her <hi>firſt love,</hi> and her <hi>works</hi> were not <hi>perfect,</hi> therefore doth God threaten her. As the godly are ſaid to honour the creature above him when they ſin, ſo they are likewiſe ſaid to <hi>deſpiſe God</hi>; and can God but be <hi>offended</hi> with them that <hi>deſpiſe</hi> him? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.13. <hi>They that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed,</hi> ſaith God again to <hi>Eli.</hi> Thus likewiſe to <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.9. <hi>Wherefore haſt thou deſpiſed the commandment of the Lord?</hi> God cannot but <hi>take notice of</hi> that which is a <hi>deſpiſing,</hi> and contemning of him. As their ſins are a <hi>deſpiſing</hi> of God, ſo are they ſaid to <hi>diſpleaſe</hi> God, which cannot be if God <hi>ſee no ſin</hi>; for if God <hi>ſee no
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65696:44"/>
ſin,</hi> it is all one in reference to God, whether a believer wallow in the mire of ſin, or whether he live holily; ſo that this Doctrine muſt needs eat and conſume like a Gangrene. Is God as well pleaſed with <hi>Peter denying Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Peter repenting?</hi> as much pleaſed with <hi>David in his adultery and murder,</hi> as when making his <hi>penitential Pſalm?</hi> The Papiſts indeed would faſten ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious conſequences upon the Proteſtants Doctrine, but they abhor it, whereas it followeth naturally from the Antinomian aſſertion. Indeed the Orthodox ſay, <hi>David and Peter in their lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, did not fall from the ſtate or grace of Iuſtification</hi>; but wherein the Antinomian and they differ, is hereafter to be ſhewen. That God is thus diſpleaſed with <hi>juſtified perſons, when they thus ſin,</hi> is plain, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.29. where what we tranſlate (<hi>diſpleaſed</hi>) according to the original, is, <hi>was evil in the eyes of the Lord</hi>; where you ſee expreſſe Scripture, <hi>That God did ſee ſin in David,</hi> becauſe that which he had done, was <hi>evil in Gods eyes:</hi> ſo again, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.7. <hi>Davids</hi> numbering of the people, is ſaid <hi>to be evil in the eyes of the Lord.</hi> Thus the very letter of the Scripture is againſt them. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Their <hi>ſins are offences againſt God,</hi> and can God be <hi>offended</hi> with that which he doth not <hi>behold? Elihu</hi> ſpeaks true and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Doctrine, <hi>Iob</hi> 34.32. though he erred in the application, <hi>Surely it is meet to be ſaid unto God, I have born chaſtiſement, I will offend no more</hi>; where he acknowledgeth, <hi>That chaſtiſements are for ſins,</hi> and that <hi>ſins are offences.</hi> If then the <hi>ſins of Gods people</hi> are a <hi>diſhonour</hi> to him, a <hi>deſpiſing</hi> of him, a <hi>diſpleaſing</hi> of him, they <hi>are evil in his eyes,</hi> and an <hi>offence</hi> to him, it cannot be but that he muſt <hi>ſee ſin in his people.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, The Scripture deſcribeth <hi>Gods threatning and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding of them with all his kindneſſes he did to them,</hi> ſo that God doth not only <hi>take notice of them, but in the ſeveral aggravations of their ingratitude and unkindneſſe unto him, in all that they offend.</hi> Thus obſerve Gods dealing with <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.28. <hi>Did not I chooſe thy father out of all the Tribes of Iſrael to be my Prieſt, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer upon my Altar? Did I not give unto thy father all the offerings by fire of the children of Iſrael? wherefore kick ye at my ſacrifice?</hi> What a cutting ſword muſt this needs be in <hi>Eli</hi>'s heart? and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the children of God have a Spirit of love in them, theſe upbraidings muſt needs wound their heart the more. Again, ſee
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65696:44"/>
the like dealing with <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sa. 11.12.8, 9. <hi>I anointed thee King over Iſrael, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul: and if that had been too little, I would have given thee ſuch and ſuch things, wherefore haſt thou deſpiſed the commandment of God?</hi> &amp;c. Muſt not this pierce into the very bowels of <hi>David?</hi> Shall God upbraid his people falling into ſin, ſpread before their eyes the manifold mercies he hath beſtowed upon them, and all this while <hi>ſee no ſin in them?</hi> Therefore when it is ſaid, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.5. <hi>That God upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not,</hi> that is to be underſtood, in reſpect of his <hi>frequent and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral giving,</hi> as men uſe to ſay, <hi>I have given thus often, and I will give no more</hi>; which kinde of giving <hi>Seneca</hi> cals <hi>panem lapido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum</hi>; but if men walk unworthy of the benefits received, he doth then upbraid, as <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.14. He is ſaid to upbraid the Diſciples, becauſe of their unbelief.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Scripture applieth <hi>the threatnings of God to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>as well as to others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> making no difference between them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they repent. Indeed we ſay againſt the Papiſts, <hi>that all the ſins of juſtified perſons are venial, and not mortal,</hi> that is, ſuch as in the event will have pardon, but that is, becauſe the ſeed of grace will be operative in them, ſo that they ſhall either <hi>habitually</hi> or <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally repent of their ſins.</hi> Neither when the Orthodox ſay, <hi>That E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is abſolute</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do they exclude the <hi>media inſtituta,</hi> means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God, in which the fruit of Election is accompliſhed, but <hi>conditions antecedan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ous,</hi> as if that decree did remain ſuſpenſe and uncertain, till the will of man had determined, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. The Apoſtle laieth down an univerſal rule, ſuch and ſuch groſſe <hi>offenders ſhall not inherit the kingdom of heaven,</hi> that is, thoſe who live ſo and do not repent, and this is to be extended not only to thoſe who are <hi>habitually</hi> ſo, but <hi>actually</hi> likewiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unleſſe they are reformed. Therefore no godly man falling into any of thoſe groſſe ſins, may deceive himſelf, and think he ſhall enter into the kingdom of heaven without a change. Godly or ungodly, yet if found in the committing of ſuch a groſs ſin, unleſs they do repent, God will not accept one or the other. As <hi>repentance</hi> is appointed for the <hi>wicked man</hi> as a duty, without which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved; ſo <hi>confeſſion</hi> and <hi>forſaking of ſin,</hi> is preſcribed a <hi>godly man fallen into ſin,</hi> without which he cannot have <hi>remiſſion,</hi> 1 Jo. 1.9. There is no ſuch free grace or Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as faith to a believer,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65696:45"/>
if fallen into a foul ſin, whether you <hi>repent</hi> or no, your <hi>ſins ſhall be pardoned to you.</hi> Hence 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. the Apoſtle makes <hi>every man that receiveth unworthily</hi> (and yet ſome of them were godly) <hi>to receive their damnation,</hi> that is, <hi>their eternal damnation, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and reformation</hi>; and after <hi>repentance,</hi> their <hi>judgement,</hi> though <hi>not of condemnation,</hi> yet <hi>affliction and caſtigation.</hi> How ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible likewiſe is <hi>Paul,</hi> He. 12.29. where ſpeaking to the <hi>godly</hi> that are to <hi>receive a kingdom</hi> that is <hi>eternal,</hi> he exhorteth them to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Let us have grace</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

It is not ſafe to ſay, that God doth with the Beleever and wicked, as if a Magiſtrate ſhould make a Law, that whoſoever committeth ſuch a crime, if he be a free-man he ſhall only be impriſoned, but if a ſervant, he ſhall be put to death: ſo God, whoſoever murdereth or commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth adultery, if he be a Beleever, the wages due to his ſin, is only temporal chaſtiſements, but to a wicked man, it's eternal death.

grace therefore of juſtification can give no Supeſedeas to any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe that ſhall arreſt a believer offending; but are the wicked in Conſumptions, Agues, Feavers for their ſins? ſo are the godly; yea, the people of God are in theſe calamities before the wicked, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2. <hi>You only have I known of all the Families of the earth; therefore I will puniſh you for all your iniquities.</hi> I have <hi>known</hi> you, that is, acknowledged ye for mine, ſee what that is, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5. <hi>A peculiar treaſure unto me above all people:</hi> The Hebrew word ſignifieth that which is dear and pretious, and to be deſired of all.

               <p>It is a difficult place, and thoſe that would build Purgatory out of it, they are the Architects of that <hi>hay</hi> and <hi>ſtubble</hi> the text ſpeaks of.

Now for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the place, it is wholly Allegorical; The preachers of <hi>Gods</hi> word are builders, and they are to raiſe up a ſtately palace; the materials are compared to <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>ſilver,</hi> to <hi>precious ſtones.</hi>

What anger in the firſt ſenſe, after ſin, the godly may feel, <hi>David</hi> will abundantly tell you, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 11. he cals it <hi>the breaking of his bones</hi>; you know how ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and grievous that is, and in the godly this muſt be the more terrible, becauſe they are of a more tender apprehenſion: As they ſay, Chriſts bodily pain was more then other mens could be, becauſe of the excellent temper and tender conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his body; ſo it is with the godly, every expreſſion of Gods anger, fals like a drop of ſcalding lead into a mans eye; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the believer, when once awakened, feels every frown of God like an hell. Thus after the committing of groſs ſin, God hides his face, and then for the while, they are like ſo many <hi>Cains</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi>'s, crying out, <hi>Their ſin is greater then they can bear</hi>; and truly this <hi>worm would never die,</hi> this <hi>fire would never be quenched</hi> in them, did not God again take them into favor; there is no difference between a man damned in hell, and a godly man troubled in conſcience, but the adjunct of time, one is perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and the other is not. Now our Divines ſay, That eternity is not eſſential to the puniſhment of hell (for Chriſt ſuffered the torments of hell for us, which yet were not in time eternal) but accidental, becauſe thoſe in hell are not able to ſatisfie Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, therefore they muſt continue there till they have paid the laſt farthing, which becauſe they cannot do to all eternity, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are tormented for ever.

Did he not finde ſuch anguiſh, and conſumption in his ſoul, that he thought no words could expreſs it? and all this he ſaith, was becauſe of ſin; O then believe this and tremble, leſt ſuch a whale of ſorrow and grief ſhould ſwallow thee up, as did <hi>David.</hi> Thus it was alſo with the inceſtuous perſon, the devil was ready to <hi>ſwallow him up</hi>; he was delivered to him to be tormented by him; and can all this be done, yet God <hi>take no notice of ſin?</hi> As the godly in this life time, may have that joy in the Goſpel, which <hi>paſſeth all underſtanding,</hi> and more then the heart can perceive; ſo they may have for ſin ſuch trouble, and ſpiritual deſertions, that ſhall make every thing, their chamber, the field, a very hell to them; and <hi>David</hi> in many <hi>Pſalms</hi> manifeſteth ſuch deſolation upon his ſoul; eſpecially this is ſeen in lapſes, when perſecutions do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, and men through fear have denied that truth, which in their conſciences they were aſſured of. We may read in Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Hiſtories of the grievous wounds and gaſhes, Gods people through frailty have made upon their own ſouls.

               <p>ALthough this Text in the general ſenſe of it, will not fully prove <hi>Gods eye of anger againſt ſin in juſtified perſons</hi>; yet becauſe a more ſpecial ſcrutiny and ſearch into the words, will make much againſt the Antinomian Error, and alſo becauſe the Anſwers which are given to this Text, and the like, do contain groſſe falſhoods, ſo that in the refuting of them, all things in this controverſie will be clearly diſcovered, as alſo becauſe that principal and noble Queſtion, How far Gods taking notice of ſin, to chaſtiſe and puniſh it, is ſubject to the meer liberty of his will, will in ſome meaſure be diſcuſſed, I ſhall therefore inſiſt upon this Text. Not that the Orthodox make it their ſhield of <hi>Achilles,</hi> as the Antinomian ſlandereth, <hi>Honey-comb,</hi> p. 73. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the vanity of that diſtinction, which they make between Gods <hi>ſeeing</hi> and his <hi>knowing,</hi> may be brought out from behinde the ſtuff, where like <hi>Saul</hi> it had hid it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And firſt, for the Text abſolutely in it ſelf,<note place="margin">The cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> The words are part of that <hi>excellent commendation,</hi> which is given to <hi>Gods word.</hi> The purity and power of Religion is kept up by acknowledging the fulneſs and perfection of the Scripture.

God cannot but ſee the adultery of <hi>David,</hi> but whether he will ſo ſee it, as to puniſh <hi>David</hi> for it in his own perſon, or in Chriſt; or whether he will chaſtiſe him at this time, or in this manner; that is meerly at the good pleaſure of God.

                     </gap> the attributes of God, and the actions of them.</note> 
                  <hi>there is great difference between the attributes of God, as alſo the exerciſes and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of them.</hi> There are ſome properties that require no object for their exerciſe, but they make it; thus the omnipotency of God, doth not finde, but make its object. Again there are others, which though they require an object, yet not any condition, or circumſtance in it; ſo the wiſdom of God, can and doth order every object, let it be what it will be, to a glorious end. It or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered an harmonious world out of a Chaos, he made all things, <hi>qua omnipotens,</hi> as omnipotent, and ordered them all <hi>qua ſapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi> as a wiſe God. But then there are other attributes, which though eſſential to him, yet cannot be exerciſed, but where the objects are ſo and ſo conditionated; as that mercy of God, whereby he doth forgive ſins, requireth an object penitent and believing: ſo that Juſtice of God, whereby it is punitive and vindicative of ſin, requireth an object, that is a ſinner and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent. Now in the actions about the objects of the former ſort, God is every way free, he might have created the world, or not have created it; but in the actions of the latter ſort, though he be alſo free, yet not ſo as to uſe Juſtice, or not Juſtice, when there is an object with its due condition. As now it was free to God, whether he would make man or no, it was free for him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would permit man to fall or no, but when fallen, not free whether he would be juſt or no: Thus God is free, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65696:58"/>
he will procure, or <hi>prepare an object of juſtice</hi>; but then when he hath ſo <hi>prepared an object,</hi> then he is not <hi>looſned</hi> from the <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Juſtice. To procure an object of Justice</hi> ariſeth from the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>meer freedom of God</hi>: Hence <hi>Gods permiſſion of ſin,</hi> or <hi>reprobation negative.</hi> which is the paſſing by of ſome, are <hi>not acts of Juſtice properly ſo called</hi>; but <hi>condemnation for ſin</hi> is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and <hi>properly Juſtice.</hi> The former ariſe from Gods ſupream do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and freedom. When an <hi>Object of Juſtice is,</hi> there is an <hi>obligation to execute the ſame</hi> upon it, but not when an <hi>object of mercy is,</hi> becauſe its neceſſary to <hi>mercy,</hi> that it ſhould be <hi>indebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> but to juſtice, <hi>debita.</hi>

               <p>I do not here intend to meddle with that Queſtion, Whether God abſolutely might not have let ſin go unpuniſhed, and yet forgive it, as we ſee men can: (This is diſputed even among the Orthodox; ſome are for the Negative, as <hi>Piſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If God did only puniſh ſin becauſe he will, and not becauſe he is eſſentially juſt, there could no true cauſe be given, why Heathens ſhould have terrour in their conſciences after ſins committed, ſeeing the Word is not revealed unto them, declaring Gods will: and when the Scripture ſpeaks of God <hi>puniſhing ſins,</hi> it doth not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute it to Gods <hi>meer will,</hi> becauſe he will do ſo, but to his <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> Rev. 16.5, 7.

that <hi>Gods eſſential Iuſtice doth not receive more or leſſe,</hi> but the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his Iuſtice</hi> may be <hi>more or leſſe:</hi> If many men be in the ſame ſin, and God doth puniſh ſome of them with a remarkable temporal judgement, we may not ſay, God dealeth <hi>more juſtly</hi> with theſe then the other; yet we may ſay, the <hi>effects of his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> are <hi>greater</hi> upon ſome then others.</p>

yet when God doth thus <hi>break out in his anger</hi> againſt them, this is becoming his <hi>juſt nature,</hi> and the world thereby ſeeth how he is <hi>diſpleaſed</hi> with it.

Every ſinne doth as it were deprive God (as much as lieth in a ſinner) of his Godhead and bleſſedneſſe; ſo that if God were capable of miſery and grief, thy ſins would bring it upon him. Hence are thoſe expreſſions of being <hi>preſſed by our ſins as a cart is under ſheavs,</hi> Amos 2.13. And the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> his <hi>lying ſo many daies on one ſide, and then on the other,</hi> to his great pain and trouble, was as ſome think, to repreſent, <hi>how much God was affected with the Iſraelites ſins, and how great his patience was to endure them ſo long.</hi> If then they ſaid to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Thou art worth ten thouſand of us:</hi> how much rather may we ſay to God, Thy honour, thy glory, it is worth ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thouſand of us? it is fitter for us to be damned or annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, then the leaſt glimpſe of his glory obſcured.

               <p>The third reaſon, This Explication,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 3.</note> as the whole ſenſe of the Petition, would overthrow all other places of Scripture, which make <hi>no pardon of ſin</hi> to be, but where the ſubject hath ſuch qualifications, as this in the Text of <hi>forgiving others,</hi> it is not indeed put as a <hi>cauſe or merit,</hi> but yet it is as a <hi>qualification of the ſubject</hi>; therefore our Saviour repeateth this again, <hi>Except ye forgive others, neither will my heavenly Father forgive you.</hi> So <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. <hi>Whoſoever believeth on him ſhall have remiſſion of ſins,</hi>

Rom. 3.15. <hi>He is a propitiation through faith in his bloud</hi>; here faith is made an inſtrument to apply and bring that pardon to the ſoul, which it had not before. So 1 Joh. 1.9. <hi>If we confeſſe our ſins, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſins.</hi> By theſe and the like Scriptures, it is plain, That remiſſion of ſin is given us only in the uſe of theſe graces: not that hereby we <hi>merit</hi> at Gods hand, or that God is tied to theſe wayes; but it is here, as in the Sacraments, he hath tied himſelf to convey his graces in no other chanels or conduits then he hath appointed.</p>

Hence <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeaketh of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold pardon, one <hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>hidden,</hi> when he <hi>forgiveth ſins,</hi> but the people of God do not feel or regard it; The other is open and experimental: now both theſe condonations are neceſſary. The firſt (ſaith he) is more bitter and troubleſome, but more noble and acceptable. The firſt cleanſeth, the latter pacifieth: the firſt is of meer faith, and obtaineth much of God; the latter is of experience more, and takes off from the excellency of faith: for as that is the beſt manifeſtation of love when it is carried out to an enemy, ſo is that of faith, when relying upon God, though feeling terrours, and an hell within us. God uſeth the firſt kinde of pardon to more heroical Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. The latter to thoſe that are more infirm. An inſtance of this two-fold remiſſion we have in <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, when Chriſt turned his back on her, and told <hi>Peter, Much was forgiven her</hi>; the other, when he turned towards her, ſaying, <hi>Thy ſins are forgiven thee, go in peace.</hi> Now in our prayer we muſt not be limited; but as in the Law every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is ſpiritual, and hath a great latitude in it; ſo in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er every Petition is ſpiritual, and hath much in it: let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inlarge our hearts, and open them wide when we ſeek to God for pardon of ſin. The priviledge is exceeding great, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65696:68"/>
many are the dignities that do depend on it. If thy ſins be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, thou becomeſt a favourite of Heaven, there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety between God and thee. The devil ſhowed the glory of the world, and falſly ſaid, <hi>All this is mine,</hi> but thou maieſt ſhew all the glory of the Goſpel and promiſes, yea all the glory of Heaven, and ſay, <hi>All this is mine.</hi> Yea there is a full recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation made between God and that perſon, notwithſtanding all former enmity, as appeareth in the example of the Prodigal ſon, he hath all love, favour and honour. Again, inſomuch that ſuch <hi>come not into judgement,</hi> Joh. 5.24. <hi>There is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to them,</hi> Rom. 8.1. yea there is not ſo much as any charge or indictment againſt them. What devil, what conſcience, what law may accuſe thee when God juſtifieth thee? Now in this Petition we deſire that not only <hi>pardon of ſin,</hi> but all <hi>theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fruits of it,</hi> may be vouchſafed to us. Oh therefore the congealed and icie temper of men, who are no more inflamed in prayer about this! There are many that can heartily and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly pray the former Petition, for the neceſſaries of this life, but how few for the grace of God in pardoning in a ſpiritual manner? Hearken then, O man, to what Chriſt hath ſaid is good for thee to importune and ſeek after. <hi>Philo. lib. de Somniis</hi> ſaith, and it was alſo the opinion of Philoſophers, <hi>That the Heavens make ſuch an harmonious melody, that if the ſound and noiſe of it could reach to our ears, it would make men leave off all their inferiour and ſublunary labour and profit, attending to that only:</hi> Certainly this Doctrine of remiſſion of ſin, which is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Heaven only, hath ſuch excellent harmony in it of <hi>Gods Juſtice</hi> and <hi>his mercy,</hi> of <hi>Gods ſatisfaction</hi> and our <hi>happineſſe,</hi> that it may juſtly make us forget to eat our bread, or delight in other comforts, meditating of, and being raviſhed with his excellency. Let this then inſtruct thee concerning that neceſſary duty of <hi>ſeeking out the pardon of thy ſins</hi>; this belongs to every one, though a <hi>Paul,</hi> though a <hi>Moſes,</hi> though in the higheſt form of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. It is a great comfort that all voluntary ſins after grace received, are not unpardonable, as well as that againſt the holy Ghoſt. How often do we ſin voluntarily and willingly after we are inlightned? And then the ſins of infirmity and ignorance are more then the ſands of the ſea-ſhore: Is it not therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65696:68"/>
that thou ſhouldeſt be continually begging for pardon? Know then that theſe indulgences are not like the Papal, to be bought by money, but they are purchaſed by the bloud of Chriſt: <hi>Peter</hi> thought it a great matter <hi>to forgive a brother ſeven times a day,</hi> but if God ſhould not forgive us <hi>ſeventy times ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a day,</hi> our condition would be damnable. Thoſe that look to have pardon by their meritorious works, and penal ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, cannot look up to God.

No Husbandman regards the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, but <hi>Nilus</hi> only, from which they have rain; ſo in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery Chriſt is neglected, and Angels or Saints ſet up, as thoſe that can give pardon; Men therefore look upon their Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, their Penance, as if they were to forgive their ſins to their own ſelves.</p>

               <p>For the firſt,<note place="margin">1. On the part of the ſubject, or he who prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is implied 1 That all men are ſinfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> There are many things ſuppoſed in thoſe who are to pray thus: As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That all men, though never ſo eminently ſanctified, yet have ſins in them:</hi> And this hath been generally urged by Antiquity againſt <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who have dreamed of perfect righteouſneſſe in this life, as if we might be ſons of light, without any ſpot in us; and that evaſion is ridiculous, that we ſpeak this <hi>humiliter</hi> for humility ſake, not <hi>veraciter</hi> truly: for if we had no ſin, this
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65696:69"/>
hypocriſie were enough to make it in us, and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. putteth it out of all doubt, <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> He doth not ſay, we extol or lift up our ſelves, and there is no humility in us, but <hi>we deceive our ſelves, and there is no truth in us:</hi> Now this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith immediately upon thoſe words, <hi>The bloud of Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin:</hi> So that whether this cleanſing of Chriſt be underſtood in regard of the filth or guilt of ſin, its not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly fulfilled, till we come into heaven. So true is that of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, Qui ſemper pecco, debeo ſemper habere medicinam,</hi> I who ſin alwayes, need forgiveneſſe alwayes. And whereas the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>We all have ſin,</hi> that is to be underſtood, partly in regard of the vicious affections and inordinate concupiſcence, which is in every one; and partly in regard of the guilt, which doth accompany them; neither may we limit this to ſome, for the Apoſtle puts himſelf in the number of thoſe who ought to ſay ſo. Neither may this be reſtrained as ſome would have it, to ſins paſt in our former converſation only, although the Apoſtle ſpeak, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. in the preterperfect tenſe, for he ſaith, we ſo ſin, as that <hi>if we confeſſe our ſins, God is faithfull to forgive:</hi> therefore he ſpeaks of ſins, which are yet to be pardoned, and not of thoſe that are paſt only.</p>
               <p>I acknowledge it is one thing to ſay, Every man hath ſin, and another thing, that he ſinneth in every good action he doth, and if this place did not demonſtratively prove it, yet other places do. It is good to obſerve the danger the Apoſtle makes to come from this opinion, <hi>That we have no ſin in us, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us</hi>; and then which is worſt, <hi>We make God a liar,</hi> who in his Word doth teſtifie of us, as having ſin in us. So that this opinion argueth thoſe that maintain it, neither to underſtand or firmly believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; and this is to be extended to thoſe who hold no ſin in us, as to Gods eye, by reaſon of Chriſts righteouſneſs: For the Scriptures do equally overthrow both. The moſt material Anſwer that I have obſerved by any given to this Argument from our duty of praying for pardon of ſin, is given by <hi>Caſtalio de Iuſtif.p.</hi> 63. It is this, <hi>This prayer is not ſo preſcribed us</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that we ſhould alwayes pray ſo, and we never reade that any in
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65696:69"/>
the Scripture uſed theſe preſcribed words: Nay</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reade that the Apoſtles praied for remiſſion of ſinnes, no nor Chriſt never praied for pardon of them. Therefore the meaning of this Petition muſt be to pray for pardon as oft as they need it, not that they need it alwaies. Therefore he compareth this Petition to ſuch places, Love your enemies, Agree quickly with your adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Honour your father and mother; that is, when you have enemies or adverſaries, when you have a father and mother: ſo here, Pray for pardon, that is, when you have ſinned.</hi> But this very anſwer needeth a pardon, becauſe its fraughted with much falſhood; for firſt, although we reade not that they praied thoſe expreſſe words, yet in their very addreſſe to Chriſt to be inſtructed how to pray, and our Saviour teaching them to pray thus, as one Evangeliſt; or after this manner, as another hath it: it had been hypocriſie and mockery, never to have conformed to it. Beſides, our Saviour ſuppoſeth they have need of pardon, when he tels them, <hi>Except ye forgive one another, neither will my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father forgive you,</hi> verſ. 15. which implieth their need of pardon. Hence <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.11. he cals them evil, <hi>If ye then being evill,</hi> which is not to be underſtood comparatively in reſpect of God only, for ſo the Angels are, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18. but inherently, becauſe of the remainder of that corruption in them. Hence (as you heard) the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> puts himſelf in the number here, <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin,</hi> &amp;c. certainly the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was farre from theſe thoughts, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18. where he cals himſelf <hi>the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all ſinners:</hi> that is, one in the rank of thoſe, whoſe ſins had a ſcarlet hue; and he ſaith this in the preſent tenſe, not of whom I was chief, but I am chief; for although <hi>Cajetans</hi> Expoſition be very probable, that makes this relate not meerly to ſinners, but to ſinners ſaved, thus, Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, of which ſaved ſinners I am chief; yet the former is not to be rejected; and certainly in ſome ſenſe every man is bound to think of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as a greater ſinner then others; As the Phariſee ſaid, <hi>I am not as other men, adulterers, covetous,</hi> &amp;c. The godly man on the contrary, thinketh he is not holy, zealous, ſincere, as other godly men are. When <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 7. complaineth of that evil in him, and law of ſinne, can we think he never deſired the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of it? And when our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.17. prayeth God to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65696:70"/>
ſanctifie his Diſciples; what is that but to ſet them apart for their office, by forgiving their ſinne, even as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was purified by a live coal from the altar. As for his parallell places and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it is a moſt abſurd compariſon; for he may as well ſay, That the Kingdom of God, and hallowing his Name, are not conſtantly to be prayed for, but upon occaſion only. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe places of Scripture which make originall ſinne to cleave to us, even as Ivy to the Oak, and which is as leven in us, ſowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing we doe in ſome meaſure: And thoſe places which ſpeak of ſuch a perfection in the Law, that we are never able to perform it, argue a conſtant abiding principle of ſin in us, we may conclude then, that this Petition doth ſuppoſe a worm in our beſt fruit, droſſe in our pureſt gold, and many ſpots in our choiſeſt beauty. Neither may we dream of ſuch an imputed righteouſneſſe, as ſhall take away the neceſſity of this praying; not that the godly are therefore to be denominated ſinners, becauſe we call them godly, though ſinne be in them, becauſe godlineſſe is the moſt noble quality in them, as we call that a field of corn, which yet hath many weeds in it.</p>

                  <note place="margin">2. A ſenſe of ſin within us.</note>A ſecond thing implied, is, <hi>feeling of ſinne a burden and weight upon us:</hi> For none can heartily and with feeling experience im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune God for this pardon, but ſuch who are ſenſible of a preſſing load by ſin. Hence the Hebrew word <hi>Naſa,</hi> doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie (as you heard) the taking of a weight and burden. So the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is uſed of deliverance from bonds, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. where what was literally true of the Jews that were in captivity and priſons, is applied to us ſpiritually, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt is ſaid, <hi>to preach deliverance to the captives:</hi> ſo that hereby is declared, that as a captive Jew in <hi>Babylon</hi> was wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with his eſtate, and did vehemently expect deliverance: no leſſe doth a man burdened with ſin, deſire a freedom and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation. Therefore the time of the Goſpell is expreſſed allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to the year of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> verſ. 19. as that was proclaimed with the ſound of a Trumpet, ſo this by the mouth of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. How many are there then who pray this prayer, but want much feeling and zeal within. Now ſinne hath a double weight, one of puniſhment, the other of offence and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65696:70"/>
to God, and in this later, we ought eſpecially to groan under it. <hi>Cam</hi> felt a burden of his ſins, and <hi>David</hi> alſo felt a preſſure by them, but the tears of theſe two differed much. The one was meerly becauſe of puniſhment; the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was againſt God, <hi>Against thee onely have I ſinned.</hi> This inward diſpoſition is that which putteth an excellent reliſh and high prize upon Chriſt and his benefits. Hence the word to truſt ſignifieth alſo to roul and caſt our burden upon the Lord: As a man who beareth an heavie weight upon his back, being ready to break under it, rouls it upon the next ſtall he meets with, to eaſe himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.22. Conſider therefore what thou feeleſt within; what preſſures upon thee, while thou deſireſt this forgiveneſſe: Art thou as the poor priſoner, bound in his chains and irons, longing for a releaſment? Art thou as one aſhamed in the preſence of ſo glorious a God? <hi>Quidni totis artubus contremiſcat ranuncula è palude acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens ad thronum Regis?</hi> Why ſhould not the Frog com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the lake to the Kings Throne, altogether trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</p>

Why <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. are theſe groans unutterable wrought by the Spirit of God in us at that time? inſomuch that a ſoul in prayer, is in ſpiritual travel and heavenly Agonies: All which cannot be, unleſſe the heart of a man be deeply humbled within for ſin: ſo that this Petition doth not only imply ſin is in us, and that God ſeeth it, but alſo that all within us ought to be moved and troubled at it. Beg therefore for pardon with the ſame zeal and movings of bowels, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. who had his broken bones. A tear in our eye for ſin, doth more adorn it, then a jewel doth the ear. Now the Antinomian Doctrine is like an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern, or Northern winde, that drieth up, or bloweth away this ſpiritual rain. If God ſeeth no ſin in us, then he would ſee no humiliation nor debaſement in us for ſin: and ſo where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65696:71"/>
as heretofore repentance in believers hath been neceſſary, now it ſhall be prejudicial to ſalvation, and all ſorrow ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. What direct <hi>Antipodes</hi> are theſe to Scripture-directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Hence they repent that ever they did ſo much repent, and look upon their ſorrow for ſinne, as Chriſt upon his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Lord forgive me, for I did not know what I did. But we have not ſo learned the Goſpel. The people of God, when ſinning, are called upon to afflict themſelves, and to mourn: and becauſe the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did not ſo at firſt, though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they did, therefore the Apoſtle threatens to come with a rod unto them. Take heed then of all Doctrines or practices, that may obſtruct the running ſtreams of thy ſoul: Keep thy ſelf alwayes in this ſpirituall ſweat. Take not the Limbeck from the fire, that ſo ſpirituall diſtillations may flow conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</p>

If ſpiritual things were as truly and really apprehended by us, as temporal are, how ſhould we bid all comforts ſtand afar off, even refuſing to be comforted, till Gods favour ſhine upon us!

                  <note place="margin">1 That God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can forgive ſins.</note>Firſt, <hi>That God only can forgive ſins.</hi> This is an incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable property of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.1. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. It is there reckoned as one of his prerogatives: Hence <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. this is made an argument of Chriſts Deity, that by his meer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand he forgave ſin, for this power to forgive ſin, is greater then to create Heaven or Earth, or to work the greateſt mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; Therefore a power to work miracles hath been vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to the Apoſtles, but not of forgiving of ſin, unleſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratively onely. When therefore our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth which is eaſier, <hi>To forgive ſin,</hi> or to ſay, <hi>Take up thy bed and walk</hi>; intending by this miracle to prove that he did alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſin, it is not ſpoken as if this later were greater then the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65696:72"/>
former, but only the curing of the paralytical man, was a more viſible ſign to confirm the other, for when they ſaw that which he commanded accompliſhed upon the mans body, they might well conclude the other fulfilled in his ſoul. Now when we ſay, <hi>God only can forgive ſin,</hi> this is to be extended both to the forgiveneſſe in Heaven, and to that in a mans own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; for the former it is plain, becauſe the injury is done only againſt him, when we ſin; and for the later, it is clear, becauſe he is the Father of Spirits, and ſo can command what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever peace and ſecurity he pleaſeth in the conſcience. We ſee when Friends and Miniſters do pour oil into a wounded ſoul, they feel no benefit or refreſhment, till God ſpeak to the heart. This is notably aſſerted by <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job 34.29. <hi>When he giveth quietneſſe, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?</hi> O therefore with all humble thankfulneſſe acknowledge this great mercy of pardon, if thou art made partaker of it; If the Lord ſhould work miracles for thee, he would not diſplay ſo much power and mercy, as he doth in this forgiveneſſe of thy ſins.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It ſuppoſeth God doth ſee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 That he takes notice of ſin.</note> 
                  <hi>and take notice of ſinne in us, after we have believed:</hi> For how can God be ſaid to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give that which he taketh no notice of? If forgiving be cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſinne, and a blotting it out, then it is ſeen and open to God, and uncancelled till this be done. Suppoſe our Saviour had uſed theſe words in this Petition, <hi>Cover our iniquities, as we cover the ſins of others</hi>; would not that expreſſion have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily implied, That God did ſee them, and look on them, till he covered them? Certainly <hi>Joſeph</hi> did upon a good ground, abſtain from ſin, when he ſaid, <hi>How can I do this, and ſinne against God?</hi> That is, who ſeeth me, and beholdeth me in ſecret, and will be angry with me: But if God take no notice of my ſinne; how can I truly awe my ſelf from ſinne, ſaying, How can I do this evil in Gods eyes? How can I provoke him to anger?</p>
               <p>Let the Application then be, to importune for this mercy,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> of forgiveneſſe, which makes all other things mercy. Health, riches, learning, peace, are mercies, if with theſe there be a pardon of all our ſins: eſpecially be preſſed to ſeek for it, from
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65696:73"/>
this motive which I ſhall only mention at this time, <hi>viz.</hi> That pardon of ſin is the onely ſupport and help in all miſeries and calamities whatſoever. This onely can ſweeten thy pain, thy poverty, thy fears of death. When the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. had ſpoken of Juſtification by faith, and the peace we have thereby with God, inferreth from thence, <hi>We glory in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Alas, there would be little glory, if at the ſame time man be againſt us, and God alſo. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34, 37. when the Apoſtle had gloriouſly triumphed in this priviledge of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and that none could lay any thing to our charge, then he concludeth, <hi>We are more then conquerors.</hi> Again 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18. exhorting the people of God to be ready to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for well-doing, giveth this reaſon, <hi>For Chriſt once ſuffered for ſins, the juſt for the unjust,</hi> &amp;c. So that no miſery or cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity can be joyfully undergone, unleſſe the Lord forgive our ſins to us. In theſe times of warre, while we have been under continual fears of an enemie, vvhat could rightly ſupport us, but remiſſion of our ſins? To have men accuſing and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us; but to have God clearing and abſolving, this can make an Heaven in the midſt of an hell.</p>

And by this means, though Infants are not in themſelves capable of any precept, much leſſe before they were born, which they were to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh in their own perſon, yet they were bound up in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, even before they had an actual being in <hi>Adam,</hi> in whoſe will they were to fulfill that command, for that command was not given to <hi>Adam</hi> as a ſingle perſon, but as an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that habituall ſin, whether remote, or proxime, is forbidden by the Law of God, which requireth not only good things to be done, but alſo that they flow from a clear and pure fountain within, even an entire perfection of the nature; ſo that although infuſed habits of grace come not under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, in reſpect of the infuſing and ingenerating of them, for that is Gods act, and we are not bound to do that, yet they are commanded both before they are infuſed and after; Before, by the Law, which requireth of us, that inward rectitude, which is now loſt; and after they are infuſed, to be diligent in thoſe pious actions, whereby thoſe habits may be preſerved and retained.

Syllogiſm upon our ſelves. So that they do not ſufficiently vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the pure providence of God from ſin, who ſay, God doth will the act, but not the deformity, or the evil of it; for ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth man will expreſly the evil of the act, although in wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that act to which ſin is neceſſarily annexed, it be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively to will the ſin.</p>
               <p>Neither ſecondly is to ſin, to produce ſin, as the proper and immediate <hi>terminus</hi> of our action, for ſin being a privation, or at moſt a relation, it cannot be the immediate effect of any action. Sin is not indeed a meer pure privation, ſuch as blindeneſſe is, but mixt and compounded, ſuch as ſickneſſe is, which hath both the inordinacy, and want of a good temperament, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ill humours in it. So that a man ſinneth by producing or doing that action, to which ſin is annexed. And herein neither do they ſufficiently clear Gods concourſe about ſin, in ſaying it goeth to the material act of ſin, but not to the immediate obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of it. For ſo neither doth man, and indeed ſin being a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or as ſome, a relation, it is impoſſible it ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced any other way, but by that act unto which it is joyned to, as theft is committed by doing that material action, to which that deformity is inſeparably adjoined. Therefore to ſin, is to do a thing deficiently from the Law of God, ſo that God in all thoſe ſeveral acts of his about ſin, whether they be permiſſive or ordinative, is gloriouſly vindicated, becauſe he doth nothing <hi>deficienter,</hi> as falling from that eternal and immutable Law of righteouſneſſe; whereas the Angels and man did, miſſing or coming ſhort of the rule, by which they were to be guided: but becauſe this Diſcourſe is more remote to our preſent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Pardon of ſin, we come to that which doth more nearly concern it.</p>

To omit the many things that are in ſinne, Divines doe acknowledge two things in every ſinne, the <hi>Macula,</hi> or filth, and the <hi>Reatus,</hi> the guilt; which guilt ſome do again di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh into the guilt of ſin, which they call the inward digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and deſert of damnation, which they make inſeparable from ſinne, even as heat is from the fire; and the guilt of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65696:75"/>
which they make ſeparable: For the preſent, let us examine, What is that effect of ſinne, whereby a man when a ſinne is committed is truly denominated a ſinner, for ſeeing Remiſſion is a taking away of ſin in that reſpect, whereby we are adjudged and accounted of as ſinners, it is neceſſary to know what that is, which doth ſo conſtitute a ſinner: As for example, <hi>David</hi> after his adultery, <hi>Peter</hi> after his denial, have contracted ſuch a guilt upon them, whereby they are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſinners, though the acts of their ſins be gone and paſſed; and in this condition they ſtand, till remiſſion or forgiveneſſe come, which takes away their ſins. For the underſtanding of this, conſider this foundation, That every ſin committed by a man, though the ſin be tranſient, and quickly paſſeth away, yet it doth ſtill continue, and is as it were ſtill in acting, till by remiſſion it be removed. And this conſideration is of great practical uſe. A man is apt to look upon his ſins committed a long while ago, as thoſe which are paſſed, and are no more to be thought upon; but you muſt know, that there is ſomething which doth remain after a ſin is committed, which is ſomewaies the ſame with the action of ſin: ſo that not figuratively, but properly the ſin it ſelf is ſaid to continue. Thus the Scripture cals ſomething by the name of ſin, that doth continue, when yet the commiſſion of the ſin is paſt. As <hi>David</hi> many moneths after he had ſinned, praieth God, <hi>To blot out his ſinne:</hi> why, where was his ſin? It was committed long before, and it was a tranſient act, but yet <hi>David</hi> by this doth acknowledge that there is ſomething which doth continue that act of ſin, whereby <hi>David</hi> is as much bound up in his conſcience, as if he had been in the very commiſſion of it. Conſider therefore that till there be a pardon of ſin, though thy ſins have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted fourty or fifty years ago, yet they are continued ſtill, and thou art truly a ſinner, though ſo many years after, as thou waſt at the firſt committing of them. Sin is not taken away by length of time, but by ſome gracious act of God vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed unto us: How juſtly may it be feared, that many a mans ſins do ſtill lie at his doors! Thou art ſtill in thy ſins, and looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as ſo by God; though it may be thou haſt left ſuch ſins many years ago. Thy youthfull ſins it may be, thou haſt left them
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65696:76"/>
along while ago, yet thou art ſtill in them, and they are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued upon thee, till by remiſſion they are taken away. It is not thy other courſe of life and abſtinence from ſin, that makes a ſin not to be, but there muſt be ſome gracious act on Gods part, removing of this. Conſider therefore of it, that thy ſoul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth as polluted and guilty twenty years after a ſin, yea a thouſand of years, if thou couldſt live ſo long, as when it was in the very firſt act of ſin. Remember the action of ſinne doth paſſe away, but not the ſinne; you may therefore ask, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doth the ſin continue ſtill? What is that which makes me ſtill to be reputed of as if I were a ſinner in the very act?

Indeed he grants, That in <hi>Adams</hi> ſin we may well conceive a blot remaining after the ſin was committed, becauſe he was endowed with grace; but now in a man grown up that hath grace, no ſinne that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits takes away his grace, and therefore he is not deprived of that beauty by the blot of ſinne. And as for wicked men, they have no beauty at all in them; and therefore how can ſinne make ſuch a blot in them? There muſt be beauty in them by grace, which is <hi>nitor animae,</hi> the luſtre of the ſoul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be <hi>Macula,</hi> which is the deformity of it. For the right conceiving of this, know, 1. That it is one thing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſuch a defilement and impurity by ſinne abſolutely; and another to acknowledge it ſo, That juſtifying grace, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin muſt take that blot away.

                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:65696:76"/>But in the ſecond place, we may according to Scripture, ſay, not only in <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, but in every ſin we commit there is a blot and ſtain made upon the ſoul, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.20.

Thus the Apoſtle cals ſins <hi>dead works,</hi> Heb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9.14. not in that ſenſe, as if they did bring death to a man, for that the Apoſtle expreſſeth otherwiſe, killing us, when he ſpeaks of the Law; but he cals them <hi>dead works,</hi> becauſe they defile man, as dead carcaſes in the old Teſtament: For the Apoſtle, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. ſpake of cleanſing by the bloud of an heifer, which was to be uſed when a man had toucht any dead thing, which made him legally unclean.

Therefore that which continueth a man a ſinner in Gods account, and is to be removed by remiſſion, is that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to eternall wrath appointed by God; for as ſoon as a man hath ſinned, there doth accrue to God a moral right (as we may ſpeak with reverence) and power, being a Judge, as thereby he may inflict vengeance upon a ſinner; and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ſin is called an offence, becauſe it doth provoke him, who is a juſt Judge, unto anger and vengeance. This then is that, which makes a ſin to continue ſtill as if it were in act, becauſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65696:77"/>
the ſinne committed there is an obligation by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to everlaſting puniſhment, and when this is taken off, then is God ſaid to forgive, and till it be, ſinne is alive, crying for vengeance, as fiercely, as if it were newly committed. So that the act once committed that cauſeth the obligation to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and this obligation continuing, God doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give. When a ſinne is committed it may remain in Gods minde, and in our minde. In our minde, by way of guilt and trouble; as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>His ſin was alwayes before him</hi>; or elſe in Gods minde, ſo that he doth will the puniſhment of ſuch. Now when God doth forgive, he blots ſins out of his minde, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers them no more. He doth not will the obligation of them to puniſhment, being ſatisfied thorow Chriſt, and the party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in him. By all this you may ſee, That after a ſin is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted there remaineth obligation in the will and minde of God to eternal puniſhment, and God when he doth forgive, cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth this debt or obligation.

               <p>Neither ſecondly can ſin be ſaid to be infinite evil, in reſpect of the being of it, for it cometh from finite creatures, who are

not able to do any thing infinite; and therefore ſin is not infinite, as Chriſts merits are infinite, which are ſo, becauſe of the dignity and worth of the perſon, though the actions themſelves had a finite being.

And although the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing of the former Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> What maketh a man a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth make an eaſie and quick way of diſpatching this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Juſtification doth take off that conſideration and reſpect of a ſinner from a man, yet that the whole nature of it may be better underſtood, I ſhall lay down ſeverall Propoſitions, all which will tend to give us much light in this great and glorious benefit of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">From the names of it.</note>And in the firſt place, as we formerly conſidered ſome choice Hebrew words that ſet forth the pardon of ſinne, ſo now let us take notice of ſome Greek words in the new Teſtament, that expreſſe this gracious act of God: for the holy Ghoſt knoweth beſt in what words to repreſent this glorious mercy to us.</p>
               <p>The word that is moſt frequently uſed by the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which in the general, is as much as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe or ſend away, to let alone, to leave, to permit or ſuffer; in which ſenſes the Scripture often uſeth it: and certainly God in this ſenſe doth pardon ſin, becauſe he lets it alone, he leaves it, he meddles no more with it, but handleth the perſon forgiven, as if he never had been a ſinner. But commonly this word is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of abſolving thoſe who are accuſed as guilty, which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in that famous ſentence of <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> who writing to have one <hi>Nicias</hi> ſent to him that was accuſed, uſed this expreſſion, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:65696:78"/>
                  <hi>Nicias, if he have done no wrong, abſolve him, if he have, abſolve him for my ſake, but howſoever abſolve him, or ſet him free.</hi> And in this ſenſe forgiveneſſe of ſins may well be called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but in the Scripture it ſeemeth rather to be an expreſſion from thoſe that are looſned out of their bonds for their debts; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore frequently is applied to the forgiving of debts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.25, 27, 32. and this is more notably ſet down, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18. to preach to captives or priſoners, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, freedom or forgiveneſſe of ſin, and ſo <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſhall be as much as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to looſen bonds, as the word is uſed, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.26. <hi>Acts</hi> 27.40. Therefore howſoever <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks the word to <hi>remit,</hi> to be a metaphor from thoſe who part with, or leave a thing that they might retain, yet it ſeemeth rather to be taken from releaſing of debts, and looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of bonds, in which the conſcience of a ſinner was tied, being bound to anſwer at the Tribunal of God. Hence the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture uſeth ſeveral names to expreſſe pardon of ſin, according to the ſeveral titles that ſin hath in the Scripture. As ſins are <hi>Debita,</hi> Debts, ſo God doth forgive, as they are <hi>Sordes,</hi> a filth and loathſomneſſe, ſo God doth cover them, as they are <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula,</hi> bonds, ſo he doth remit them. As they are debts, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten down in a book, ſo he blots them out: As they make us mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and wretched, ſo he is mercifull and propitious in remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of them.</p>
               <p>A ſecond word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Having forgiven you all treſpaſſes,</hi> Col. 3.13. <hi>Even as Christ forgave us.</hi> Now this word doth excellently ſignifie the fountain, and the effect of pardon. The fountain, that it cometh from the meer grace and favour of God. There is nothing in us to merit or ſatisfie God with. Therefore howſoever there be a neceſſity of faith and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, yea and God will not forgive ſin in perſons grown up, but where theſe are, yet theſe are no meritorious cauſes, nor can they ſatisfie God for all that offence and diſhonour which our ſins have caſt upon him. And this may encourage the broken heart, who feeleth a load of ſin upon it ſelf, and hath nothing to bring unto God: remember the root and fountain of all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe is grace, which is ſo far from ſuppoſing any worth of condignity in thee for pardon, that it rather implieth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And as it doth imply grace thus in the fountain, ſo alſo
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65696:79"/>
acceptableneſſe and joy too in the party, to whom ſin is forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. So that there can be nothing in the world more welcome, or a greater matter of joy, then to bring this glad tidings; and indeed therefore is the Goſpel called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe it prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the glad tidings of Gods love and reconciliation thorow Chriſt with a ſinner.</p>
               <p>A third word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, thus the Publican prayed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.3. Some derive <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe we deſire to look on thoſe to whom we are propitious. But this word doth more immediately relate to the bloud of Chriſt, as the way by which God becomes thus pacified. So that as the other words ſet up the grace of God in pardoning, ſo this the merits and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. In which places the appeaſment of God towards us, is attributed to the bloud of Chriſt. Therefore if we put the former words and theſe together, we may ſee an admirable temperament and mixture of grace and juſtice in forgiving of ſins. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer places exclude Popiſh Doctrines, The later, Socinian bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemies.</p>
               <p>A fourth word may be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to obtain mercy. For although the Scripture apply this to all the benefits and mercies of God, yet <hi>Paul</hi> applieth it more particularly to pardon of ſin, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. and when <hi>Dives</hi> prayed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Father Abraham</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>have mercy on me,</hi> and ſo by conſequent to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from that place of torment. Hence in that form of prayer which <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth by way of ſalutation, there are theſe three words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But this word is more expreſly uſed for this end in the grand Covenant and Promiſe for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.12. <hi>For I will be mercifull to their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> &amp;c. This is ſo comprehenſive a Petition, that it ſeemeth to be a generally received form of prayer in the Church, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, yea the wiſer among the Heathens uſed this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as appeareth by <hi>Arrianus epist. diſſ. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: Now this word ſuppoſeth, 1. The party praying for pardon to look upon himſelf, as in a moſt miſerable and undone eſtate, that no outward calamity or evil lieth ſo heavily upon him, as his ſins do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And then ſecondly, on Gods part, it ſuppoſeth that he doth not only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65696:79"/>
but that even his bowels yearn within him, when he doth forgive. Hence <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.78. they are called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the bowels of mercy. This goodneſſe of God is excellently repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the father of the Prodigal, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.20. Therefore how great a ſinne is unbelief, and refuſing to have good thoughts of God, when God hath manifeſted himſelf thus gracious!</p>
               <p>The laſt word I ſhall mention (though there be others that are uſed) is by way of negation, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. And this is a metaphor from thoſe that caſt up their accounts, and account ſo much upon ſuch an one for debt. Now by this word is ſhewn the terrible nature of ſin, as alſo that howſoever for a while, we may live jollily, care for nothing, and be in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, yet God will one day caſt up his accounts, and charge ſuch and ſuch debts upon us; but if ſo be the Lord will not impute them to us, and account them upon our ſcore, this will be our bleſſedneſſe. And thus you have heard the moſt choice and principal words the holy Ghoſt expreſſeth our forgiveneſſe by. We proceed,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Propoſition.</hi> Lay this down as a foundation,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>That when God doth pardon ſin, he takes it away ſo, as that the party acquitted is no more looked upon as a ſnner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the expreſſions about pardon amount to thus much; even as when one accuſed of theft and murder in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and is legally acquitted by the Judge, he is no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted a thief or murderer. Therefore it is a calumny of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, as if we held, That a man is a ſinner after God hath pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. It is true, we ſay, That ſin doth remain in a man, though he be juſtified, and that ſin hath a deſert of condemnation with it, but where God hath pardoned, there he doth not look upon that man as a ſinner, but as a juſt man. Therefore in different reſpects we may ſay, That pardon of ſin is an utter abolition of it, and it is not an utter abolition of it. It is an utter abolition of it, as it doth reflect upon the perſon, making him guilty, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging him actually to condemnation; in this reſpect a man is as free as if he had never ſinned; but if you ſpeak of the inherency of ſin, and the effects of original corruption, that do abide in all, which are alſo truly and properly ſins; ſo pardon of ſin is not
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65696:80"/>
an utter abolition, and although Chriſt wrought no <hi>ſemiplenam curationem,</hi> as is obſerved, no half-cures upon any diſeaſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but whom he healed, he healed perfectly, yet he works by degrees in the grace of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> as he did perfect the world by ſeverall degrees ſucceſſively, and not (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> thought) all at once. So that this particular, <hi>viz.</hi> That forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is a perfect abolition of ſin in the former conſideration, is of tranſcendent comfort to the believers: and indeed it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that ſin ſhould be forgiven diviſibly, and by parts: ſo a man ſhould be at the ſame time under the favour of God, and under his hatred, which is impoſſible.</p>
               <p>Thou therefore who art a believer haſt cauſe to rejoyce, for this perfect work of remiſſion of thy ſins paſt, wherein nothing more is, or can be done for thy good and conſolation. Do not think it is with God, as with men, who ſay indeed, They forgive with all their heart, yet retain their ſecret, inward hatred, as much as before. Indeed the pain of ſin may roul and tumble in thy conſcience a long while after, though it be forgiven (we ſee ſo in <hi>David</hi>) as the ſea, which hath been enraged by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts and windes, though they be quiet, yet the ſea will roar and make a noiſe a long time after. The heart of a man awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pierced with the guilt of ſin; doth not quickly and eaſily compoſe it ſelf again.</p>

               </p>
               <p>As we ſee among men, a Judge many times through fear or otherwiſe, when Juſtice is obſtructed, doth not call ſuch a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactour to an account, but deferreth it, yet for all that, the man is not acquitted; ſo it is often to be ſeen in Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, There are multitudes of ſinners, who after their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions committed, are not onely without puniſhment, but enjoy great proſperity, and much outward ſucceſſe, yet theſe men are not pardoned, they have no acquittance from God. This hath been ſuch a temptation to <hi>David, Jeremiah,</hi> and others of Gods people, that they have many times ſtaggered through unbelief. But men may have their puniſhments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, their damnation may ſleep or linger, but it is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:65696:80"/>Let not men therefore delude themſelves with vain hopes, as if their ſins were forgiven, becauſe not yet puniſhed: No, there muſt be ſome poſitive gracious act of God to acquit thee, elſe thy ſins are alive to condemn thee. Examine thy ſelf therefore whether thy peace, comfort, plenty, be a fruit of Gods forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance meerly, or of his acquittance. This later is alwayes an act of his gracious mercy: but the other may be a terrible fruit of his hatred againſt thee, inſomuch that thou hadſt better wander up and down like <hi>Cain,</hi> fearing every thing will kill thee, or damn thee, then be in ſuch ſecurity.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And if a believer enter into this conſideration, how will it overwhelm him! So often as God hath preſerved thee from ſuch and ſuch ſins, which thy own heart, or temptations would have inclined thee to, God hath virtually given thee ſo many pardons. That God preſerved <hi>David</hi> from killing <hi>Nabal</hi> and his Family, here was interpretatively as great mercy, as in the expreſſe forgiving of the murder of <hi>

Therefore <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerved well, that as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>By the grace of God I am what I am:</hi> So he might alſo have ſaid, <hi>By the grace of God I am not what I am not.</hi> Though therefore we are not ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>preventing</hi> mercies, as of <hi>poſitive,</hi> yet a due and right conſideration of Gods love in this matter might much inflame our hearts: Say therefore, O Lord, I bleſſe thee, not onely for the pardon of thoſe ſins I have committed, but alſo for thy goodneſſe in preſerving me from thoſe many thouſands, I was prone to fall into, which is in effect, the pardon of ſo many.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now remiſſion of ſin doth wholly lie in removing of theſe two: ſo that when God doth will neither to <hi>puniſh</hi> or to be <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended</hi> with the perſon, then he is ſaid to forgive. We muſt not therefore ſpeak of two kinds of remiſſions, <hi>one</hi> remiſſion of the puniſhment, <hi>another</hi> of the offence and fault; for this is <hi>one</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and God never doth the one without the other. It is true there remain paternal and medicinal chaſtiſements after ſin is forgiven, but no offence, or puniſhment ſtrictly ſo taken.

                  <hi>That ſin in the guilt of it is not remitted by any act that we do, but it is a meer act of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that neither the grace of repentance, or love of God is that, which removeth guilt out of the ſoul, but it is ſomething in God onely. It is the opinion of many Papiſts, That God in pardoning doth onely inable to repent for ſin, and then the guilt of ſinne doth naturally and neceſſarily go away, ſo that there needeth no acceptation from God, or act of remiſſion, but onely an infuſion of grace to repent. But this in the next Sermon ſhall mainly be inſiſted upon, and it is of great practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal uſe, to take us off from having confidence, and truſt in our ſorrow for ſin. For as when a creditor doth forgive his debtor, it is the ſole act of the creditor, not any thing of the debtor: So in pardoning, it is not any thing that we do, though with

never ſo much love, and brokenneſſe of heart, that doth releaſe and untie the bond of ſinne, but it is an act of God onely.</p>
               <p>If you ſay,<note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                  <hi>Why then is repentance and faith preſſed ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, that God doth not forgive without it? For if it be onely an act of Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then it may be done without any work of the ſinner intervening.</hi> But of this in the next place; onely for the preſent take notice,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> That it is not any ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row or retraction of ours, that makes a ſinne either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſible, or actually remitted, but a meer act of Gods, and if all the men of the world were askt this Queſtion, What they mean, when they pray God to forgive their ſins? The ſenſe of all would be, not that they ſhould doe ſomething which would remit them, but that God by his gracious favour would releaſe them. So then, if all theſe particulars be caſt up together, you may clearly conceive, how God doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſin, not by infuſing or putting grace into us, which may expel ſin, as light doth darkneſs, but by his outward grace and favour accepting of us: and therefore we are not to relie upon any thing we do, not to preſume, no not of our godly ſorrow for ſinne, but to look up to Heaven, deſiring God would ſpeak the word, that he would pronounce the ſentence of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>

Though Gods forgiving be not the putting of godly ſorrow, and the working of a broken heart within us, yet we can never obtain the one without the other. The grace and mercy of a pardon is no more eſteemed by us, becauſe we look not upon our ſelves, as ſo many guilty perſons adjudged to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death. Thus the Publican cried out, <hi>Have mercy upon me a ſinner.</hi> What <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaid of the Husbandman, <hi>That it was a pleaſant ſight to him, to ſee the ears of corn bending to the earth, becauſe that was an argument of fruit within.</hi> No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſſe joyfull is it to ſpiritual husbandmen to ſee their people walk with humble, debaſed, broken hearts, through ſenſe of ſin, and not to walk confidently and delicately, like <hi>Agag,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The worſt

                  <note place="margin">How our duty of repentance conſiſts with Gods free grace in remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note>YOu have heard, Pardon of ſin is Gods work only, as alſo his manner of doing it, is not by infuſing grace into us, which takes away the guilt of ſin, but beſides grace ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there is alſo an act on Gods part repealing the ſentence of condemnation againſt us. Now becauſe this may ſeem to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the duty of repentance: and becauſe this is the rock ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have been ſplit upon, not being able to reconcile our duty of repentance, with Gods gracious favour of pardoning. I ſhall ſpeak, though not all, yet as much as relateth to my purpoſe in hand, concerning the duty and neceſſity of repentance, although there be no <hi>cauſality</hi> or <hi>merit</hi> in it, to take away ſin, and this may rightly inform us about the true efficacy of our ſorrow for ſin.</p>
               <p>To open this Truth, conſider theſe Propoſitions:</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:65696:82"/>The Scripture doth abudantly confirm this by precepts and examples. It is indeed diſputed by the Schoolmen (as you have heard) whether God by his abſolute power might not forgive ſin without <hi>Sanctification</hi> of our natures, and the grace of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>; for ſeeing they are two diſtinct mercies, why may not God ſeparate the one from the other? But it is a vain thing to diſpute what God might do, when he hath revealed what he will do. And although we cannot ſay, That there is a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural neceſſity</hi> between Juſtification and Sanctification, ſuch as is between the light and heat in the fire; yet this conjoyning of them together by Gods will and appointment, ariſeth from a <hi>condecency</hi> and <hi>fitneſſe</hi> both to God himſelf, who is an holy God, and to the nature of the mercy, which is the taking and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of ſin away.</p>

                     <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Although the Scripture attribute pardon of ſin to many qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications in a man, yet Repentance is the moſt expreſſe and proper duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scripture ſometimes makes <hi>forgiving of others</hi> a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſpoſition, ſometimes <hi>confeſſing and forſaking of them,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>believing</hi> (though that hath a peculiar nature in receiving of pardon, which other graces have not; and therefore faith obtaineth pardon by way of an inſtrument applying, which other graces do not) But if we ſpeak of the <hi>expreſſe formall qualification,</hi> it is repentance of our ſins, not repentance as it is a meer bare terrour upon thy heart, but as it is ſweetned with <hi>Evangelical</hi> conſiderations. <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, <hi>There was no word ſo terrible unto him, and which his ſoul did more hate, then that (Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.)</hi> But it was becauſe he underſtood not Goſpel-grounds. We read then of ſome places of Scripture, which make God to be the only <hi>Author</hi> of blotting out and pardoning ſin. And again we reade of other places, where God doth this for none, but <hi>the broken and contrite heart.</hi> Now both theſe places muſt not be oppoſed to each other: neither may we ſo dwell upon the one, as to neglect the other; ſo to look upon it as Gods act, as if there were nothing required in us: and again, ſo to look upon that which we do, as if God were not to be acknowledged.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:65696:83"/>To this I ſhall ſpeak more particularly, when I handle the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Juſtification before Faith. As for the <hi>Aſſertion</hi> it ſelf, it is plain by all thoſe places of Scripture, which make repentance requiſite to pardon, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.6. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.30. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.3. The learned D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Twiſſe, Vind. grat. p.</hi> 18. confeſſeth, that there are Arguments on both ſides in the Scripture: Sometimes he ſaith, Pardon of ſin is ſubjoyned to confeſſion and repentance, of which ſort he confeſſeth there are more frequent and expreſſe places; but yet ſometimes remiſſion of ſin already obtained, is made an argument to move to repentance, and he inſtanceth in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> who did abundantly and plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly break out into tears, upon the ſenſe of pardon. But theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are not to the purpoſe, for <hi>David</hi> repented of his wicked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>neſs before <hi>Nathan</hi> told him, <hi>That his ſin was taken away</hi>; and his <hi>penitential Pſalm</hi> was not made ſo much for the firſt pardon of his ſin, as the confirming and aſſuring of him in his pardon. Thus it was alſo with <hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi> But more of this in time.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 4.</note>4. <hi>There is a neceſſity of Repentance if we would have pardon,</hi> both by a neceſſity <hi>of precept or command</hi>; as alſo by a <hi>neceſſity of means and a way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whatſoever is neceſſary, <hi>Neceſſitate medii,</hi> by a neceſſity of means or a way; is alſo neceſſary by a neceſſity of command, though not <hi>è contra.</hi> That repentance is neceſſary by way of a <hi>command,</hi> is plain by the places fore-quoted, and in innumerable other places. I do not handle the caſe, Whether an <hi>actual</hi> or <hi>explicite repentance be neceſſary to ſalvation of every ſinner</hi>; but I ſpeak in the general. It is diſputed, Whether it be a <hi>natural pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,</hi> or a <hi>meer poſitive command</hi>; and if it be a natural or moral command, to which command it is reduced? Thoſe that would have it under the command of, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> as if there were commanded a care of our ſouls, that they ſhould not be damned, are ignorant of the true limits and bounds of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Commandments. Its diſputed alſo, When this time of repentance doth binde? It is a wonder that ſome ſhould limit it only to times of <hi>danger and fear of death.</hi> Certainly this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand binds as ſoon as ever a man hath ſinned, <hi>Venenata inducias non patiuntur,</hi> A man that hath ſwallowed down poiſon, is not to linger, but preſently to expell it. And one that is wounded,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65696:83"/>
who lieth bleeding, doth preſently diſpatch with all readineſſe for Phyſitians, to have his bloud ſtopt: and thus ought men to take the firſt opportunity. Hence in that famous miracle wrought at the pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> not the ſecond or third, but he that ſtept firſt into it was the only man that was healed. As repentance is thus neceſſary by way of <hi>command,</hi> ſo alſo by way of <hi>means:</hi> for the Spirit of God worketh this in a man, to <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie</hi> him for this pardon; So that although there be no <hi>cauſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, condignity</hi> or <hi>merit</hi> in our repentance, yet it is of that nature, that God doth ordain and appoint it a way for pardon: So that the command for repentance is not like thoſe poſitive commands of the Sacraments, wherein the <hi>will</hi> of the Law-giver is meerly the ground of the duty; but there is alſo a <hi>fitneſſe in the thing</hi> it ſhould be ſo: even as among men, nature teacheth, That the injurious perſon ſhould be ſorry, and ask forgiveneſſe before he be pardoned.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Concerning this duty of repentance,<note place="margin">5 Two great practical mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repentance obſerved.</note> 
                  <hi>there are two extream practical miſtakes</hi>; the one is of the prophane, ſecure man, who makes every empty and heartleſſe invocation of mercy, to be the repentance ſpoken of in the Scripture, whereas repentance is a duty compounded of many ingredients,<note place="margin">The firſt of the prophane man.</note> and ſo many things go to the very eſſence, yea the loweſt degree of godly ſorrow, that by Scripture-rules we may ſay, Repentance is rarely to be ſeen any where; for if you do regard the nature of it, it is a <hi>broken and a contrite heart.</hi> Now how little of the heart is in moſt mens humiliations? Men being <hi>Humiliati magis quam hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miles,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaid, humbled and brought low by the hand of God, rather then humble and lowly in their own ſouls. Again, if you conſider the <hi>efficient cauſe,</hi> it is from the Spirit of God, the ſpring of ſorrow muſt ariſe from this hill, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if you conſider the motive, it muſt be becauſe God is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed and offended, becauſe ſin is againſt an holy law, and ſo of a ſtaining and polluting nature.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If you conſider the effect and fruit of repentance, it is an adviſed forſaking and utter abandoning of all thoſe luſts and iniquities, in whoſe fetters they were before chained: ſo that a man repenting and turned unto God, differs as much from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf once a ſinner, as a <hi>Lazarus</hi> raiſed up and walking, differs
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65696:84"/>
from himſelf dead and putrifying in the grave. Do not thou then whoſe heart is not contrite, who doſt continually lick up the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of thy ſin, promiſe to thy ſelf repentance: No, thou art far from this duty as yet.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond of the godly.</note>On the other ſide, There is a contrary miſtake, and that is ſometimes by the godly ſoul, and ſuch as truly fear God, They think not repentance enough, unleſſe it be enlarged to ſuch a meaſure and quantity of ſorrow: as alſo extended to ſuch a ſpace of time; and by this means, becauſe they cannot tell, when they have ſorrowed enough, or when their hearts are broken as they ſhould be, they are kept in perpetual labyrinths, and often through impatience do with <hi>Luther</hi> in ſuch a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Wiſh they never had been made men, but any creatures rather,</hi> becauſe of the doubts, yea the hell they feel within themſelves. Now although it be moſt profitable bitterly to bewail our ſins, and to limit no time, yet a Chriſtian is not to think, Pardon doth not belong to him, becauſe his ſorrow is not ſo great and ſenſible for ſin as he deſireth it. <hi>David</hi> indeed doth not only in his ſoul, but even bodily expreſſe many tears, yea rivers, becauſe of his ſin, and other mens ſins; yet it is a good rule, That the people of God, if they have ſorrow in the chiefeſt manner <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretiativè,</hi> though not <hi>intenſivè,</hi> by way of judgment and eſteem, ſo that they had rather any affliction ſhould befall them, then <hi>to ſin againſt God,</hi> if this be in them, though they have not ſuch <hi>ſenſible intenſe affections,</hi> they may be comforted. When the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>John</hi> makes this argument, <hi>He that loveth not his brother whom he hath ſeen, how ſhall he love God, whom he hath not ſeen?</hi> implieth, That things of ſenſe do more move us, then matter of faith. <hi>David</hi> made a bitter out-cry upon the death of <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi> with ſad expreſſions, <hi>Would to God I had died for thee, O Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolom, my ſon, my ſon,</hi> &amp;c. But when <hi>Nathan</hi> told him of his <hi>Adultery</hi> and <hi>Murder,</hi> though he confeſſed his ſin, yet we reade not that he made ſuch ſenſible lamentation. Thus <hi>Hierom</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of a godly woman <hi>Paula,</hi> that at the death of her children, would be ſo dejected, that ſhe did hardly eſcape death; yet it is not reported that ſhe found ſuch grief for her ſins. So that as in corporal things, a man would chooſe the tooth-ach, rather then a peſtilent feaver, yet a man is more afflicted and pained
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65696:84"/>
at the tooth-ach, or burning of his finger, then at a feaver: So it may be here, a godly man would rather chooſe the loſſe of his children, or deareſt relations, then loſe the favour of God by his ſinne; yet it may be have more painfull grief in the one then the other. Again, it is to be obſerved, That the Scripture requiring ſorrow or repentance for ſin, doth not limit ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, or ſuch a length of time, which if neceſſary, would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been preſcribed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It cannot be denied,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>but that the ancient Fathers have ſpoken hyperbolically of tears and repentance</hi>; which phraſes were the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of that corrupt doctrine in Popery. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth repentance to the fire, which taketh away all ruſt of ſin in us. <hi>Baſil</hi> cals it, <hi>The medicine of the ſoul,</hi> yea thoſe things which God properly doth, are attributed to tears and ſorrow; as if the water of the eyes, were as ſatisfactory as the bloud of Chriſt; his bloud is clean enough to purge us, but our very tears need waſhing. It is true indeed, we reade of a promiſe made to thoſe who turn from their evil wayes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.27. he ſhall ſave his ſoul alive; but this is not the fruit of his repentance, but the gift of God, by promiſe: It qualifieth the ſubject, it hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the priviledge: Even as a man doth by the power of nature diſpoſe and prepare the body to receive the ſoul, but it is the work of God immediately to infuſe it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Though therefore repentance be neceſſary to qualifie the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, yet we run into falſhood,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>when we make it a cauſe of pardon of ſinne.</hi> And thus ignorant and erroneous people do: Ask why they hope to be ſaved or juſtified, why they hope to have their ſins pardoned; they return this anſwer, Becauſe they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, and becauſe they lead a godly life: Thus they put their truſt and confidence in what they have done. But the Scripture, though it doth indiſpenſably command repentance in every one, yet the efficient cauſe of pardon is Gods grace, and the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious is Chriſts bloud: And if repentance come under the name of a cauſe, it can be only of the material, which doth qualifie the ſubject, but hath no influence into the mercy it ſelf. We reade <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. that <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> had many ſins pardoned her, <hi>becauſe ſhe loved much:</hi> But the Parable of a Creditor which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave debts, that is brought by our Saviour to aggravate her
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65696:85"/>
kindneſſe, doth plainly ſhew, That he ſpeaks not of a love, that was the cauſe of pardon of her ſin, but which was the effect of it, Gods love melting her heart, even as the Sun doth ſnow. The higheſt expreſſions that we meet with in Scripture, where par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſinne ſeemeth to be aſcribed to godlineſſe, as a cauſe, is <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.27. <hi>Break off thy iniquities by ſhewing mercy to the poor.</hi> Here we would think, that if a man would on purpoſe hold, that doing of a good work, would be a proper cauſe to remove ſin, he would uſe no other expreſſion. But firſt it appeareth by the context, that <hi>Daniel</hi> giveth not this counſel in reference to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and the pardon of his ſin, ſo as to be accepted with God, but to prolong and keep off that temporall judgement, which was revealed in the viſion, as appeareth by thoſe words [<hi>If there may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.</hi>] And we have the like inſtance in <hi>Ahab,</hi> who prorogued his calamity by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal humiliation. Again, although the Vulgar tranſlate it, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem thy ſins,</hi> yet the Hebrew word doth properly ſignifie, <hi>To break a thing,</hi> as we tranſlate it, and although by a metaphor it be applied to <hi>redeem</hi> and <hi>deliver,</hi> yet that is alwayes of men and perſons, not things, eſpecially it would be ridiculous to ſay, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem thy ſins:</hi> ſo that the meaning is, That whereas before <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> had by injuſtice and oppreſſion done much rapine and violence; now <hi>Daniel</hi> counſelleth him to break off ſuch wicked wayes, by the contrary expreſſions of love and chaſtity: So that this place giveth not any ſpiritual mercy to repentance, as the proper cauſe thereof.</p>
               <p n="8">8. As repentance is thus neceſſary, but not as a cauſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: ſo neither is it required, as that whereby we appeaſe and ſatisfie God; and this all Popery goeth upon, yea and all Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical ſpirits, in their humiliation, that by thoſe afflictions and debaſements of their ſouls, they ſhall ſatisfie God, and make him amends. But this is ſo groſſe, that the more learned of the Papiſts are fain to mitigate the matter, and ſay, <hi>That ſatisfaction cannot be properly made to God by any thing we do, becauſe all we have and do is from God, and therefore there muſt be an acceptation or covenant by way of gift interpoſed, whereby we may be able to ſatisfie.</hi> And then further they ſay, <hi>There cannot be ſatisfaction made to gain the friendſhip of God, which ſin hath violated, but to take away
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65696:85"/>
ſome thing of temporall puniſhment that belongs to ſinne.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The ſcope of the whole.</note>
               </p>
               <p>So that by all this which hath been delivered, we may give repentance thoſe juſt and true bounds, which Gods Word doth aſſign to it, and yet not give more then Gods Word doth. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may we think it a nicety or ſubtilty to make a difference between a qualification, and a cauſe; for if we do not, we take off the due glory that belongs to Chriſt and his merits, and give it to the works we do, and we do make Chriſt and his ſufferings imperfect and inſufficient; and by this we may ſee, in what ſenſe grace inherent or ſanctification doth expel ſin; for if we ſpeak of the filth and pollution of ſin, ſo ſanctifying grace expels it, as light doth darkneſſe, heat doth cold, by a reall mutation and change: So that God in ſanctifying doth no more to expel the ſin, in the filth of it, afterwards; even as the Phyſitian needs to do no more to the removing of the leproſie, then by producing a ſound health in the body. But when we ſpeak of the guilt of ſin, it is not grace ſanctifying within us that doth remove the guilt, but grace juſtifying without us. Inſomuch that although a man after ſin committed were perfectly ſanctified, yet that would not take off the guilt his ſin had brought upon him: So that although that man, needed in ſuch a caſe no further grace of ſanctification to make him holy, yet he needed the grace of remiſſion to take away this guilt. So that the guilt of ſin doth not ceaſe by a natural neceſſity, upon the removing of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſin, but upon a diſtinct and new act of Gods favour in forgiving; for if this were ſo, then Gods mercy in giving a repenting heart, and his mercy in pardoning ſhould not be two diſtinct mercies (which yet are evidently diſtinguiſhed by the Scripture) but the ſame entire mercy. Now although this be true, yet how few do reform their judgements in this point? and thereupon they come to put that upon their grace within them, which belongs to grace without them.</p>
               <p>Uſe of Inſtruction,<note place="margin">

               <p>IT hath been ſhewed, That there is an happy accord between Gods grace in pardoning, and our duty in repenting. In boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of which you have heard the Scripture excludes all merit and cauſality from our repentance, and gives the glory of all to Gods grace, and Chriſts bloud.</p>
               <p>Before I leave this point,<note place="margin">Practical Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> it will be neceſſary to anſwer ſome practical Objections, for there is a great miſcarriage in many about this very duty of repentance. If they be aſked, How they hope to be ſaved? they will reply, by their repentance. Thus they make that their Ark and city of refuge; they look upon that as the brazen ſerpent, and not Jeſus Chriſt. And it is no wonder, if this be ſo among ignorant people, when the moſt learned amongſt the Papiſts, do give ſuch power and merit unto repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Inſomuch that <hi>Vaſques</hi> ſaith, He wonders at thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, who have ſuch low and deſpicable thoughts of the righteouſneſſe in us, as that it ſhould not exclude ſin, without any new favour or pardon of God: as if the enabling us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, did expel the guilt of ſin, as fire doth water, by a natural neceſſity.</p>
               <p>The firſt Objection therefore may be, <hi>To what purpoſe doth God require Repentance, ſeeing it is no cauſe of pardon?</hi>

For howſoever we tranſlate it <hi>(winked at)</hi> as alſo <hi>Beza</hi> doth, yet <hi>Dieu</hi> upon the place ſheweth more probably, that it ſignifieth Gods anger, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation to them, and therefore hid the means of ſalvation from them. This grace is alſo required of the godly ſinning, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9, 1O. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſubtilly, but not ſolidly ſaith, God firſt dedicated repentance in his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> own ſelf; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſaid, <hi>It repenteth me that I have made man,</hi> the name of repentance was not heard. But we know that God cannot in a proper ſenſe be ſaid to repent, becauſe there is no <hi>ignorance</hi> in his underſtanding, or <hi>mutability</hi> in his will.

It is Gods will, to joyn pardon and repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Though there were no more connexion between theſe two, then by that meer appointment of God, we were bound up to do it. As we ſee in the Sacraments, God hath promiſed ſuch ſpirituall grace in the holy uſe and application of ſuch outward ſigns, where there is no naturall connexion at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the grace and the ſign; but the union comes by the meer inſtitution and command of God. Although the conjoyning of pardon with repentance, be more then from a meer poſitive command, there is an <hi>aptneſſe</hi> and <hi>fitneſſe</hi> in the thing it ſelf. Now God in commanding of this, doth not becauſe he needed it, or as if he could not do otherwiſe; for if a man may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give

another, that hath injured him, although he do not grieve or be troubled for ſuch an offence, why may not God, if we ſpeak of <hi>abſolute</hi> power? Thy tears therefore and thy repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, they make not God more happy; neither are they requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for <hi>Gods good,</hi> but for thy <hi>own good.</hi> Neither doth God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them, as if they ſhould make up any defect or inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Chriſts bloud; for alas, if Chriſts bloud be not able to cleanſe away thy ſin, how ſhall thy tears do it? Hence its no leſſe then blaſphemy, which <hi>Rivet</hi> reporteth of <hi>Panigirolla</hi> the Papiſt, who cals it <hi>fooliſhneſſe,</hi> and a grievous ſin to put confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence wholly in Chriſts bloud. Although therefore God puts up thy tears in his bottle, yet if he do not alſo take notice of the bloud of Chriſt, thy ſoul muſt ſtill remain filthy. Do not therefore magnifie thy tears, and undervalue Chriſts bloud. The bloud of the Sacrifice, which repreſented Chriſts bloud, was to be ſprinkled upon the poſts of the door, but not on the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold, it was not to be trampled upon or deſpiſed, no more is Chriſts bloud.</p>

                  <hi>Becauſe hereby a man ſhall experimentally know the bitterneſſe of ſin, as well as the ſweetneſſe of it</hi>; For as God, though Chriſt hath fully ſatisfied his juſtice to take away all puniſhment, doth yet heavily afflict his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for ſin, that ſo they may in their own ſenſe apprehend what wormwood and gall is in ſin; ſo the Lord, though pardon come wholly by Chriſt, yet will give it to none, but to thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, that ſo according to their delight in ſin, may alſo be their bitterneſſe for it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid, <hi>Homo eſt magis ſenſus quam intellectus,</hi> much more is he <hi>ſenſus</hi> then <hi>fides,</hi> more <hi>ſenſe</hi> then <hi>faith,</hi> and what he experimentally doth moſt feel, in that he is moſt affected.</p>

It is therefore fit, that a mans ſins ſhould be a burden, and an heavy trouble to him, that ſo pardon may be the ſweeter, and Gods love the more welcome. When <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren were put in fear, and dealt with roughly as ſpies: after this to know that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was their reconciled brother, did work the greater joy. Again, we ſhall hereby judge the better of Chriſts love to us, his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in his ſoul were more exquiſite then thoſe in his body, when he cried: <hi>My God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> in this was the height of his Agony. Now thou that in thy repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance feeleſt Gods diſpleaſure, art ready to cry out, Why doſt thou forſake me? By theſe throbs and agonies in thy own ſoul, thou maieſt have ſome ſcantling of what Chriſt had in his ſoul: and certainly to think that Chriſt was thus tempted, thus under Gods diſpleaſure for thee, will more indear Chriſt to thee, then that he was made poor, a worm and no man, yea crucified for thee.</p>

By this expreſſion, <hi>David</hi> doth acknowledge, that all the afflictions laid upon him for ſin, were juſt, and therefore God was to be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed howſoever. Thus in repentance a man comes to know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, how low and vile he is, and that if he be ſaved from wrath and hell, it is meerly from Gods good pleaſure; and therefore repentance is a kinde of a revenge upon a mans ſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. The Lord is ſet up in his greatneſs and ſoveraignty, we are made wholly proſtrate.</p>

heart of fleſh, thereby alſo is given a <hi>flexibleneſſe</hi> and <hi>tenderneſſe,</hi> and <hi>aptneſſe to relent,</hi> becauſe God is diſhonoured. As there is in children a natural impreſſion to mourn and relent, when a father is diſpleaſed, ſo that this godly ſorrow floweth from a gracious heart; as a ſtream from the fountain, as fruit from the tree. From this inward principle <hi>David</hi> doth ſo heartily mourn and pray; from this <hi>Peter</hi> goeth out, and weeps bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It is therefore a vain Queſtion to ask, Why a godly man is humbled for ſinne, it is as if you ſhould ask, Why a childe mourneth for the death of his father? That love of God within him, which doth abundantly prevail, and reign there, is like fire that doth melt and ſoften. So that as naturall forms are the principles of actions, which flow from them: Thus is a ſupernatural principle of grace within, the ground of all ſpiritual actions that iſſue thencefrom, but although it flow as a fruit, yet many times this ſtream is obſtructed or dried up.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is in godly ſorrow <hi>an aptneſſe or fitneſſe,</hi>

                  <hi>to be made the means or way wherein pardon may be obtained.</hi> And this is the higheſt our godly ſorrow can attain unto, in reference to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſinne, <hi>viz.</hi> an <hi>ordinability</hi> of it to be ſuch a way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we may finde mercy. And thus we cannot ſay of impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or any other ſin: That God may forgive a man living in his impieties and wicked wayes, for they have no <hi>aptitude</hi> or <hi>condecency</hi> in their natures, to be referred to ſuch an end. We grant therefore that when the Spirit of God doth humble and ſoften a mans heart for ſin, that it works that in a man, which hath a fitneſſe to be uſed, as the means whereby mercy is obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet that hath no merit or condignity in it to purchaſe ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Hence it is that we may not ſay, It is all one whether a man doth repent or not; or that repentance is in a man, as a <hi>ſign</hi> only that God hath pardoned; but we muſt go further, and ſay, it is <hi>the means and way</hi> which God hath a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that a man ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved at the throne of grace, hath two <hi>diſtinct</hi> benefits, for which he is to give God thanks; the one is, that he makes him to <hi>ſee</hi> his ſins, and be <hi>humbled</hi> for them: The other, that being thus humbled, God giveth him <hi>pardon</hi>; for although God hath ordered it ſo, that where the one goeth before, the other ſhall infallibly follow, yet all this is of Gods goodneſſe. He might have commanded repentance in a deep and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken manner, and when we had done all, yet might have had no pardon, and therefore it is no thanks to thy repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but to Gods <hi>grace</hi> that thou doeſt meet with forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

But there is a vaſt difference, becauſe it is enough for ſinne to have an infinite evil in it, becauſe the offence is done againſt an infinite God, and ſo the nature of an offence is according to the object againſt whom it is. As an offence againſt a King or Emperour is more then againſt a private man; ſo that ſtill offences are <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſſe</hi> as the perſons againſt whom they are, be of <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>leſſe</hi> dignity: but now it is otherwiſe in good things that are done by way of ſatisfaction, that ariſeth from the ſubject, not the object: as now repentance, though it be a turning to God, who is infinite, yet that cannot have infinite ſatisfaction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>ſubject</hi> which doth repent is <hi>finite:</hi> Therefore this cleareth the difficulty: offences ariſe according to the <hi>object,</hi> but ſatisfaction encreaſeth according to the <hi>ſubject.</hi> Hence it is, That Chriſt only could ſatisfie, becauſe he only was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite perſon. Otherwiſe if grace or holineſſe could have done it, Angels might have wrought our redemption. Beſides, our repentance And turning to God, cannot be as meritorious of good, as ſinne is of puniſhment, becauſe of that true rule, <hi>Malum meum &amp; purè malum eſt, &amp; meum eſt: bonum meum, neque purè est, neque meum eſt.</hi> Our ſins are altogether, and onely ſins, and they are truly ours: but our good things are neither purely <hi>good</hi> things, nor yet <hi>ours,</hi> but the gifts of God.</p>

               <p>The firſt Doubt is, <hi>What kinde of act in God forgiveneſſe of ſin is?</hi> Whether it be an immanent act in-dwelling and abiding in God, or tranſient, working ſome reall effect and change upon the creature.</p>
               <p>Now in handling of this, I ſhall not trouble you with that perplex Queſtion ſo much vexed by the Schoolmen, <hi>Whether

For on the one ſide, we muſt not hold that there are any <hi>accidents</hi> in God; or that he can be a ſubject recipient of ſuch, becauſe of his moſt <hi>pure and ſimple Eſſence</hi>;<note place="margin">1. There are no accidents in him.</note> ſo that whatſoever is in God is God. And yet on the other ſide, the Scripture doth repreſent God doing and working ſuch mercies and judgements as ſeemeth good to him. Only this ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude of, wherein others with ſome probability diſſent, that Gods <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>will</hi> is the cauſe of all things that are done; ſo that there is not an <hi>executive</hi> power beſides them, whereby he doth this or that; As we ſee there is in man, though an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer wils ſuch a thing to be done, yet that is not exiſtent till he hath wrought it, but now God worketh all things by a meer command of his will, as appeareth <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. God ſaid, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light</hi>; Here was Gods will to have it ſo, no executing power diſtinct from that will. Therefore it is a ſure truth, <hi>De Deo etiam vera dicere periculoſum eſt.</hi> It is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to aſſert things though true of God; and <hi>Tunc dignè Deum aeſtimamus cum inaeſtimabilem dicimus,</hi> then do we rightly eſteem of him, when we judge him above our thoughts or eſteem.

As for example, in Creation, God did not then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to have a will to create: but he had a will from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the world ſhould exiſt in time; and thus it is in Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Sanctification; not that theſe effects are from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but Gods will is: And if you ask, Why, ſeeing Gods will to <hi>create</hi> or <hi>juſtifie</hi> is from <hi>eternity, Creation</hi> and <hi>Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> are not alſo from <hi>eternity?</hi> The anſwer is, becauſe God is a <hi>free Agent,</hi> and ſo his will is not a neceſſary cauſe of the thing, for then it would be immediately, as the Sun beams are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily as ſoon as the Sun is, but it is a voluntary principle, and ſo maketh the effect to be at the time he preſcribeth.

of Gods nature will be overthrown, and thoſe <hi>volitions</hi> of God will be <hi>created entities,</hi> and ſo muſt be created by other new <hi>volitions,</hi> and ſo <hi>in infinitum,</hi> as <hi>Spanheimius</hi> well argueth, only the later part ſeemeth not to be ſtrong or ſufficient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when man willeth, he doth not will that by a new voliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo <hi>in infinitum,</hi> and why then would ſuch a thing fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in God? Beſides its no ſuch abſurdity in the actings of the ſoul, to hold a progreſſe <hi>in infinitum,</hi> thus far, that it doth not determinately pitch or end at ſuch an act. It is one thing to have things <hi>diſtinguiſhed</hi> in God, and another thing for us to <hi>conceive</hi> diſtinctly of them. The former is falſe: The later is true and neceſſary. But with tranſient actions it is otherwiſe, they being the ſame with the effects produced, are in time; And this is a perpetual miſtake in the Antinomian, to confound Gods <hi>Decree</hi> and <hi>Purpoſe</hi> to juſtifie, with <hi>Juſtification,</hi> Gods <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent</hi> action from all <hi>eternity,</hi> with that <hi>tranſient,</hi> which is done in time. Whereas if they ſhould do thus in matters of Sanctification and Glorification, it would be abſurd to every mans experience, whereas indeed a man may as truly ſay, That his body is glorified from all eternity, as that his ſins are forgiven from all eternity. And certainly Scripture ſpeaks for one as well as the other, when it ſaith, <hi>Whom he hath juſtified, them he hath glorified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe two differences, you may ſee, <hi>That pardon of ſin is a tranſient action,</hi> and ſo Juſtification alſo, partly, becauſe it leaveth a poſitive, real effect upon a man juſtified; he that was in the ſtate of hatred, is hereby in a ſtate of love and friendſhip, he hath peace with God now, that once was at variance with him. Now when we ſay, There is a change made in a man by Juſtification, it is not meant of an inward, <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>phyſical</hi> one, ſuch as is in Sanctification, when of unholy we are made holy, but <hi>morall</hi> and <hi>relative</hi>; as when one is made a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, or husband and wife: partly, becauſe this is done to us in time, whereas immanent actions were from all eternity, and therefore it would be abſurd to pray for them, as it is ridiculous for a man to pray he may be predeſtinated or elected. Some indeed have ſpoken of Predeſtination, as <hi>actus continuus,</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued act, and ſo with them it is good Divinity, <hi>Si non ſis prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinatus,

ora ut praedeſtineris,</hi> If thou beeſt not predeſtinated, pray that thou maieſt be; but this is corrupt doctrine, and much oppoſeth the Scripture, which doth frequently commend election from the <hi>eternity</hi> of it, that it was before the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world were laid; whereas now for pardon of ſinne, it is our duty to pray that God would <hi>do</hi> it for us. This being thus cleared, we come to anſwer the next Queſtion depending upon this, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether God doth juſtifie or forgive our ſins before we believe or repent? and our anſwer is negative, That God doth not. Although there are many who are pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that he doth; and ſo they make Faith not an inſtrumental cauſe to apply pardon, but only a perſwaſion that ſin is pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and thus repentance ſhall not be a condition to qualifie the ſubject, to obtain forgiveneſs, but a ſign to manifeſt that ſin is forgiven. This Queſtion is of great practical concernment; and therefore to eſtabliſh you in the truth, conſider theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.<note place="margin">Arguments proving our bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is true, the godly man is predeſtinated, and ſo ſhall be brought out of this ſtate, and the other left in it.

Likewiſe all the places of Scripture, which ſpeak of Gods wrath upon wicked men, and that they have no peace with God, muſt needs be true of all godly men while unconverted. <hi>He that believeth not, hath not life, and the wrath of God abideth on him, and without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Now who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that this is true of <hi>Paul,</hi> while no believer, but an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of godlineſſe? The Pſalmiſt alſo ſaith, <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day</hi>; Was not this true of <hi>Manaſſes</hi> before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion?

                  <hi>of any ſpeciall benefit, there that benefit cannot be ſaid to be enjoyed, till all thoſe things be brought about.</hi> Now the Word of God ſpeaks of ſeveral things required to pardon of ſin. There is the <hi>Grace and mercy of God,</hi> as the <hi>efficient cauſe,</hi> Pſal. 51.1. Iſa. 43.25. Rom. 3.25. 2. There is requiſite <hi>the bloud of Chriſt,</hi> as the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe</hi>; for there can be no remiſſion of ſins without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of bloud, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. 3. There is <hi>Faith</hi> required as an <hi>inſtrumental cauſe,</hi> Act. 26.18. Rom. 3.25. Now although an inſtrumentall cauſe have not that worth or excellency as the efficient and meritorious have, yet it is <hi>as neceſſary</hi> in the way of an <hi>inſtrument,</hi> as the others are in their reſpective cauſalities: ſo that as a man may not from thoſe places, which ſpeak of Gods grace, inferre, therefore remiſſion of ſins is before Chriſts death: So neither may a man argue, becauſe Chriſt died to take away our ſins, therefore theſe are taken away before we believe. So that this Argument may fully eſtabliſh us. We ſee the Scripture ſpeaking of three cauſes cooperant to pardon of ſin, therefore I may not conclude the effect is wrought till all thoſe cauſes be. And as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaks of theſe cauſes, ſo, as you heard, of many qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in the ſubject. Inſomuch that it is ſo far from being a duty to believe our ſins were pardoned from all eternity <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi> to faith and repentance, that we are undoubtedly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they were not. If the King proclaim a pardon to every one that ſhall humble himſelf, and ſeek it out. If the Phyſician prepare a potion, for the patient to receive it, ſhall any man ſay becauſe of thoſe cauſal preparations, that either the one is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, or the other healed before their particular application of thoſe things?</p>

It is a clear truth, That Sanctification of our natures is individually conjoyned one with the other. So that although there be a prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of nature, yet they are together in time. God pardons no mans ſins whom he doth not heal, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.2 A man may be juſtified, and not glorified, but not juſtified and

unregenerated. Then if ſo, a man ſhall be at the ſame time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, and converted, at the ſame time a member of Chriſt, and a member of the devil; and ſo as they ſay, we are juſtified only declaratively in our own conſciences, ſo we ſhall be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, and converted only declaratively. Again, where ſins are pardoned, there is bleſſedneſſe, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, then I may call <hi>Paul</hi> a bleſſed Perſecutor: <hi>Manaſſes</hi> a bleſſed mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, for they had no ſin imputed to them at that time. Beſides thoſe whoſe ſins are pardoned, may boldly go to the throne of grace, and call God Father; all which are contrary to the whole tenour of Scripture, which expoſtulateth with men, for taking his name or words into their mouth, and hate to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: yet a Doctor of this Antinomian ſour leaven, affirmeth <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </gap>, through faith in his bloud, not love of his bloud; and indeed the Apoſtle maintaineth that Goſpel-poſition againſt falſe teachers, <hi>viz.</hi> That we are juſtified by Faith, not by works. The Queſtion was not, Whether the works of the Law did juſtifie us declaratively only, but cauſally. So then by this Doctrine, Faith muſt no more be called the hand, or the eating and drinking of Chriſts body and bloud, but only made a ſign of ſuch mercies.</p>

to the death and obedience of Chriſt.</hi> So that not only our tears, but Chriſts bloud ſhall be excluded from this great favor. The reaſon is plain, Becauſe Gods predeſtination and election is antecedent to Chriſt, yea Chriſt is a fruit of our election: ſo that the Orthodox maintain againſt Arminians, though we be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen in Chriſt, yet not for Chriſt. Chriſt is the meritorious cauſe of Juſtification and Glorification, but not of predeſtination, that is meerly from his own ſelf; ſo that if Gods act of prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinating us be enough to inſtate us into all this favour and love,<note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 7.</note>7. <hi>If (becauſe its ſaid,</hi> Epheſ. 2. <hi>That while we were dead, Chriſt gave himſelf for us: And</hi> Rom. 5. <hi>That he died for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly</hi>) it followeth, <hi>Our ſins are pardoned before we believe, then it will alſo follow, that all mens ſins are pardoned.</hi> For the Texts that ſpeak thus of his dying for the ungodly, and for enemies, make no diſtinction of one from another: And thus a <hi>Judas</hi> as well as a <hi>Peter</hi> is bound to believe his ſins are pardoned. Thoſe that argue againſt all qualifications, and ſay, God requireth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of thee, though lying in thy bloud, muſt needs hold an univerſal promiſcuous pardon of all, and that ſuch a ſin as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is not poſſible; for if I believe that Chriſt died to take away my ſins, though I walk in all diſobedience, yet that is not preſumption, but a duty. It is true the Orthodox call upon thoſe who lie groveling in their ſwiniſh luſts to come unto Chriſt, and to believe in him; but what is that faith? Not a faith that ſins are already pardoned, but a faith relying on him for pardon, which faith alſo at the ſame time cleanſeth and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth the heart. Therefore let us take thoſe general Texts, which ſpeak of Chriſts dying to take away the ſins of enemies; and let any Antinomian give a true reaſon, why one mans ſin is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned rather then another; and although to evade this, they fall into another error, holding Chriſt died for all; yet that will not ſerve the turn, unleſſe they hold, That all men ſhall actually be ſaved, and none damned; for thoſe Texts ſpeak of a benefit
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65696:95"/>
that is actually obtained for thoſe, in whoſe behalf he died. And thus I have produced ſeven Arguments for the antecedency of our Faith and Repentance to our Juſtification, as many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as the fore-quoted Author brings againſt it. Other grounds may be pleaded to this purpoſe, when we ſhall demonſtrate, that all ſins are not pardoned together.</p>
               <p>Uſe, Of Exhortation, To avoid all preſumption, whether it be wrought in thee by thy own carnal heart, or corrupt Teachers,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> and that is, when thou believeſt pardon any other way then in Scripture-bounds; there is a Phariſaical preſumption or Popiſh; and there is an Antinomian or Publican preſumption. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is, when we hope for pardon, partly by Chriſt, and partly by our own works and merits. The other is, when we expect it, though living and walking in ſin. Now it is hard to ſay, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe is more derogatory to Chriſt. The one ſins in the exceſſe, the other in the defect. Be not therefore a Phariſee, excluding Chriſt either in whole or in part from the cauſe of pardon, <hi>Tutius vivimus, quando totum Deo damus</hi>; we live more ſafely, when we give all unto God, and take nothing unto our ſelves. In the next place be not a Publican. Think not to have Chriſt and Belial together; expect not pardon for ſin without repentance of it. The world is filled with theſe two kinde of preſumers: ſome limit Gods grace, and aſſociate their perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances with it. Others extend it too far, and conjoyn their luſts with it. But as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If of works, and of the Law, then there is no grace:</hi> So we may, if of luſts, and prophane impieties, then there is alſo no grace. We are therefore both to avoid ſins, and carnal confidence in our own righteouſneſſe, if we would have Chriſt all in all. In vain did <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> pour out their ſouls with ſo much bitterneſſe, if pardon of ſin may be had without this. It is <hi>Hieroms</hi> obſervation, That in all <hi>Pauls</hi> Salutation, Grace goeth before Peace, for till Gods grace hath pardoned our ſins, we can have no peace, and God doth not pardon, but where he gives repentance. Labour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for that which is indeed the good of thy ſoul, <hi>viz.</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſinne. When the rich man in the Parable, ſpeaking of the corn in his barns, ſaid, <hi>Soul, take thine eaſe, thou haſt much good laid up for thee.</hi> He ſpake as if he had <hi>porcinam animam,</hi>

the ſoul or life of an hog; for, what good is corn and wine to a mans ſoul? Forgiveneſſe of ſin and reconciliation with God; that is the connatural and ſutable good and happineſſe for the ſoul.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Remonſtrants, <hi>Acta Synod. p.</hi> 293. bring ſeverall places out of our Authours, <hi>Lubertus, Smoutius, Piſcator,</hi> and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, wherein they expreſly ſay, <hi>That God doth blot out our ſins, before we either believe or amend our lives, and that this pardon doth antecede our knowledge of God, Faith, Converſion, or Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the heart.</hi> Thus alſo D. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> in the place before quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Pemble</hi> alſo to this purpoſe (<hi>pag.</hi> 24.) <hi>The Elect</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>while unconverted, they are then actually juſtified, and freed from all ſin by the death of Chriſt; and ſo God eſteems of them as free, and having accepted of that ſatisfaction, is actually reconciled to them:</hi> But the falſhood of this will appear in Anſwer to the ſixth Argument. When <hi>Grotius</hi> had diſtinguiſhed of a two-fold remiſſion, a full remiſſion, and a leſſe full remiſſion, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65696:96"/>
this later kinde of remiſſion to be given to impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, abuſing two places of Scripture for this purpoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Rivet</hi> confuteth him, making it a ſure truth, That ſins are not actually remitted, but to thoſe that repent, and ſaith, <hi>Quinam ſunt ii, qui volunt actu remiſſa peccata cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ante converſionem? certè nobis ſunt ignoti.</hi> Who are they that ſay, ſins are actually pardoned before converſion? Certainly they are unknown to us. Although we acknowledge the price of reconciliation and redemption to have been prepared for the elect from all eternity, or in Gods purpoſe and intention remiſſion of ſins to have been ordained for them, even as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, which in his time by Gods grace are to be effected. Thus <hi>Rivet, vind. Apol. p.</hi> 127. If therefore any of our Orthodox Authors have acknowledged a remiſſion of ſins before faith, it hath been in a particular ſenſe to oppoſe the Arminians, who maintain a reconciliability, and not a reconciliation by Chriſts death, and not in an Antinomian ſenſe, as is more largely to be ſhewed in anſwering of their Objection, brought from Chriſts death for enemies and ſinners. Indeed ſome learned and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men ſpeak of a Juſtification before faith in Chriſt our head, as we are accounted ſinners in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> or common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Thus <hi>Alſtedius</hi> in his ſupplement to <hi>Chamier, pag.</hi> 204. when <hi>Bellarmine</hi> arguing againſt the holineſs of the Proteſtants Doctrine, and bringing this for a paradox above all paradoxes, <hi>That I muſt be juſtified by faith, and yet juſtifying faith be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that I am juſt and righteous; which is</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) <hi>beſides and against all reaſon</hi>; He anſwereth among other things, That Chriſt and the elect are as one perſon, and therefore an elect man is juſtified before faith in Chriſt, as the principle of righteouſneſſe before God; and then he is juſtified by faith as an inſtrument, perceiving his juſtification in that righteouſneſſe of Chriſt. So that faith as it goeth to the act of juſtification, is conſidered in reſpect of that paſſive application, whereby a man applieth the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to himſelf, not of that active application whereby God applieth to man the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt: For this application is only in the minde of God.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe the learned <hi>Zanchy</hi> in his Explication of the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65696:97"/>
ſecond Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> upon thoſe words, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. [<hi>And you being dead in ſin, he hath quickned together with Chriſt</hi>] doth in the firſt place diſtinguiſh of a two-fold quickning, One whereby we are freed from the guilt of ſinne, and inveſted with a title or right to eternal life; The other from the power of ſinne, whereby we are made ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally alive to God. The former is Juſtification, the later San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. Now (ſaith he) this two-fold bleſſing is to be conſidered in Chriſt, and in our own perſons. In the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, God did quicken us in Chriſt, when by his death (ſinne being expiated) he freed from guilt all the elect that have been and ſhall be, conſidering them as members in Chriſt their head. In the later reſpect, God doth it, when having given us faith, he gives us alſo remiſſion of ſins, and imputeth Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to us. And afterwards the fore-quoted Author, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this Objection to himſelf, How Chriſt could be ſaid to be freed from the guilt of ſinne, who had no ſin? He anſwereth, The perſon of Chriſt is conſidered two wayes; Firſt, in it ſelf, as God-man, and ſo Chriſt was not bound by any guilt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as appointed head, and ſo repreſenting our perſons. In this reſpect, as God laid our iniquities upon him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. So when they were expiated by his bloud, then was he releaſed from the guilt of thoſe ſins. We might inſtance in other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, but theſe may ſuffice to certifie, that ſome orthodox and learned Divines do hold a Juſtification of the elect in Chriſt their head, before they do believe, yet ſo, as they acknowledge alſo a neceſſity of a perſonal Juſtification by faith, applying this righteouſneſſe to the perſon juſtified. Therefore although this Doctrine paſſe for true,<note place="margin">What the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion above-ſaid may mean.</note> yet it will not ſtrengthen the Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts. Although even the truth of this opinion may modeſtly be queſtioned, unleſſe by being juſtified in Chriſt our head, we mean no more, then that Chriſt purchaſed by way of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Juſtification for us, and ſo virtually we were juſtified in Chriſts death and reſurrection. But the learned men of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſpeak as if God then paſſed a formal Juſtification upon all (though afterwards to be applied) that are elected; even as in <hi>Adam</hi> ſinning all his poſterity were formally to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinners.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:65696:97"/>Now this may juſtly admit a debate,<note place="margin">That ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it ſeemeth but weak, for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt, If there were ſuch a formal Juſtification, then all the elect were made bleſſed and happy, their ſins were not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them: for ſo in <hi>Adam</hi> when accounted ſinners, they are wretched and miſerable, becauſe ſin is laid to their charge.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> And if the elect before they believe or repent were thus happy, how then at the ſame time could they be children of wrath? and ſo God imputing their ſins to them, Can God impute their ſins to them, and not impute them to them at the ſame time? It is true, if we ſay, That Chriſt by his ſufferings obtained at Gods hand, that in time the elect ſhould beleeve and be juſtified, this is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily to be conceived; but it is very difficult to underſtand, how that all our ſins ſhould be at the ſame time done away in Chriſt (who is conſidered as one perſon with us) and yet imputed to us.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2.</note> I do not ſee how this Doctrine doth make our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by faith to be any more then declarative, or a juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in our conſcience only, and not before God, and ſo by believing our ſins ſhould be blotted out in our ſenſe only, when they were blotted out before God by Chriſts death already. And ſo our Juſtification by faith, ſhall be but a copy fetcht out of the Court roll, where the ſentence of Juſtification was paſſed already, whereas the Scripture ſpeaks to this purpoſe, That even before God, and in his account, till we do believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, our ſins are charged upon us, and they are not cancelled or blotted out, till God work thoſe graces in us. Therefore this opinion may ſymbolize too much with the Adverſary; and indeed none of the meaneſt Antinomians <note n="*" place="margin">

do believe: and till they are his Members, he cannot as an head repreſent them. It is true, God knoweth whom he hath ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and to whom in time he will give faith, whereby they may be united to Chriſt, and ſo it's in Gods purpoſe and intention to give Juſtification and Sanctification to all his elect: but theſe being mercies vouchſafed in time, and limited to ſuch qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in the ſubject, I ſee not how they can be ſaid to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Chriſt (before they do believe) otherwiſe then virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and meritoriouſly. It is true, we are all condemned in <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe that was a Covenant made with him and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, ſo that the iſſues thereof fell upon them by a natural and neceſſary way: but it is not ſo in the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do thoſe places, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.5, 6. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.13, 14. prove any more, then that in and through him, we do obtain ſuch mercies there ſpoken off: and although we are ſaid to ſit in heavenly places already, yet that is becauſe of the certain right we have thereunto; in which ſenſe alſo, he that believeth is ſaid to have eternal life; and Chriſt being the firſt fruits doth ſanctifie the whole lump.</p>
               <p>As for that place, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. where Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſpirit,</hi> that makes nothing at all to this Juſtification we ſpeak of. For the meaning is, That Chriſt was declared juſt, and abſolved from all the reproaches caſt upon him, by the ſpirit of God, which was done ſeveral waies, as by the witneſs exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from heaven unto him, by the innumerable miracles he wrought. In which ſenſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. <hi>Wiſdom is</hi> ſaid to be <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of her children.</hi> So that <hi>Act.</hi> 2.22. ſeemeth to be a full Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on this place, <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by ſigns and wonders, which God did by him in the midſt of you:</hi> And this is that Juſtification of himſelf, which Chriſt ſpeaks of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.8. It is true the Apoſtle doth apply that ſpoken of Chriſt to every believer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. by way of allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and the rather, becauſe Chriſt being the head of the elect, it will be made good of them in time, when they do believe: otherwiſe election is not enough to free from preſent accuſation or condemnation, unleſs by faith they be actually in Chriſt, as is to be ſhewed more at large.</p>
               <p>But this is a digreſſion. It is the conſtant opinion of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65696:98"/>
That a man is not juſtified, or hath his ſins pardoned, till he doth beleeve. I have brought Arguments to prove the point, and now addreſſe my ſelf to remove their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
               <p>The firſt is brought from Infants, who are juſtified,<note place="margin">1. Argument f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>om Infants.</note> and yet do not beleeve, therefore before faith ſome are juſtified.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The caſe of Infants is of a peculiar conſideration, and therefore not to be attended unto in moſt Queſtions: yea the Scripture preſſing the things requiſite to ſalvation, as repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot be underſtood of Infants. And <hi>Suarez</hi> argueth againſt Juſtification by faith in the general, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground, <hi>Becauſe Infants are juſtified without it,</hi> ſo that the Argument (if it proveth any thing) would prove a Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation without faith, rather then before faith. Suppoſe a man ſhould argue about glorification, as the adverſary doth about Juſtification. Infants are glorified without fruits meet for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Therefore men grown up alſo may be, How abſurd would that be? Therefore if the concluſion of the Argument were granted, <hi>viz.</hi> Some that do not believe are juſtified, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining it to Infants, the main Queſtion would have no detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The opponent laieth down this concluſion (Reconc. of man with God, <hi>p.</hi> 5.) That mans actual reconciliation to God, requireth previous conditions to be wrought in him by Gods Spirit, before he can be reconciled actually to God; among which he reckoneth believing as the chief. Now I may retort on him thus, Infants are actually reconciled to God, but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants do not believe, Therefore ſome are actually reconciled to God that do not believe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The opponent cannot but know, that there are Learned men, who hold Infants have actual faith, and do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Therefore to them his Argument is of no force. It may very well be thought, that they have actual ſins, not ſuch as are in men grown up, accompanied with reaſon and will; but thoſe immediate motions of original corruption in them. For although original ſin be not <hi>peccatum actuale,</hi> yet it is, <hi>pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum actuoſum,</hi> if it be not an actual ſin, yet it is an active ſin, and therefore may not be thought idle in an Infant. <hi>Austin lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Confeſ. c.</hi> 2. <hi>Vidi ego Zelantem parvulum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved

Now if there be actuall motions of ſin before the uſe of reaſon, why not actuall motions of Gods Spirit. That it is poſſible, <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt makes it without queſtion: all the doubt is, Whether God doth ordinarily ſo to Infants. <hi>Aretius</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by ſome to hold, That <note n="*" place="margin">Neither may this ſeem ſuch a wonder, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> up, the firſt grace is wrought in us as meer pati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ents, our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings &amp; wils no waies antecedently concurring to it; ſo that the grace of God is then wrought in us, without us.</note> even repentance may be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to Infants out of <hi>Joel</hi> 2.16. but the command there is, That parents ſhould bring their children into the publike humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, that by the ſight of them they may be the more fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtirred up to pour out their praiers before God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That which the moſt ſolid Divines pitch upon, is, That Infants have, (I ſpeak not generally, but indefinitely) a ſeed of faith, becauſe they have the Spirit of God and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, otherwaies they could not be ſaved; and by this ſeed of faith, they become members of Chriſt, and that relation which is in their faith to Chriſts merits, is the inſtrument by which they obtain remiſſion of ſin. As for that place, <hi>Faith co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by hearing,</hi> it is to be applyed to the ordinary means of faith, and that in perſons grown up. Neither can I ſay, that an Infant is bound to have actuall faith; for happily in the ſtate of integrity, Infants then, though they had the image of God, yet could not have put forth the actuall exerciſe of graces, and if they could not do it in that ſtate, it is not to be expected they do ſo now.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is not enough for him to prove they are juſtified before they beleeve, but alſo before they be any way united to Chriſt, Let that union be conceived how it can by us. For if a man be juſtified, becauſe he is elected, as his third Argument would prove; then he is to ſhew, that Infants not only before they beleeve, but before they have any union with Chriſt are juſtified, for the election of Infants muſt needs go before their union with Chriſt. And howſoever the opponent quoteth <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> ſaying, That which was wrought in <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, to be a ſingular miracle, yet <hi>Serm.</hi> 14. <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>His ſecond Argument is to this effect.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>He that is in Christ is juſtified. Now a man is in Chriſt, before he doth beleeve, becauſe the tree muſt be good before the fruit can be. Therefore a man muſt be juſtified before he do beleeve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In anſwering this Argument many things are conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It muſt be acknowledged a very hard task to ſet down the true order of the benefits beſtowed upon us by God. The aſſigning of the priority and poſteriority of them is very vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous according to the ſeverall judgements of men intereſſed in that controverſie.</p>
               <p>The opponent (it may be knoweth) that there are ſome, who ſay Chriſt, or the Spirit of Chriſt is firſt in us by way of a moving or preparing principle, and afterwards as a principle inhabiting and dwelling in us; That as ſome ſay, <hi>Anima fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat ſibi domicilium,</hi> the ſoul makes its body to lodge in; it works firſt efficiently, that afterwards it may formally, ſo they ſay Chriſt doth in us. As the ſilk-worm prepareth thoſe ſilken lodgings for her ſelf to reſt in. So that according to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe men, Chriſt, or his Spirit, doth efficiently work in us the act of believing, by which act Chriſt is received to dwell in us. And in this way, Chriſt hath no union with us, till we do believe. He worketh indeed in us before, but not as united to us. Now according to this opinion, the anſwer were eaſie, That we are not in Chriſt, till we do beleeve; Though Chriſt be in us, as working in us, and upon us. Yea faith would firſt be wrought, and then Chriſt with his benefits of juſtification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would be vouchſafed to us; but there are Reaſons why it is not ſafe to go this way. And indeed that <hi>Charta magna</hi> or grand promiſe for regeneration, doth evidently argue, the habits or internall principles of grace, are before the actions of grace, <hi>Ezek</hi> 36.26. God takes away the heart of ſtone, and giveth a new heart, an heart of fleſh, which is the principle of grace, and afterwards cauſeth them to walk in his Commandments, which is the effect of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:65696:100"/>But ſecondly (which doth fully anſwer the Objection) It is true, our being ingraffed into Chriſt, is the root and fountain of faith, and of Juſtification too; but yet ſo, that theſe being correlates (faith and Juſtification) they both flow from the root together, though with this order, that faith is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in order of nature before Juſtification, that being the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to receive it, though both be together in time. Therefore the <hi>major</hi> Propoſition ſhould be thus regulated, He that is in Chriſt doth believe, and is juſtified, or believing is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified; for Juſtification as our Glorification, though it flow from Chriſt, yet it is in that order and time which God hath appointed. Neither is it any new thing in Philoſophy, to ſay, Thoſe cauſes which produce an effect, though they be in time together, yet are mutually before one another in order of nature in divers reſpects to their ſeverall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalities.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is in us, and we in Chriſt, Chriſt is in us, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by way of receiving; and both theſe are neceſſary, as appeareth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. and both are together in time, yet ſo that in order of nature Chriſts being in us is before our being in him, and the ground of all our comfort and fruit, is not, becauſe we are in him, but he in us (even as the branch beareth fruit, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is in the Vine, but becauſe the Vine is in it, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating efficacy to it.) Thus alſo faith and Juſtification are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, yet ſo as one is produced by the other, we are not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, and therefore believe, but we believe and are therefore juſtified.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, This may be retorted upon the opponent, who (as was alleadged before) denieth any actual reconciliation, till we do believe. But may not we ſtrike the adverſary with his own reaſon in this manner? He that is in Chriſt is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reconciled. But we muſt be in Chriſt before we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Therefore we muſt be actually reconciled, before we do believe.</p>
               <p>I paſs over the third, and reſerve the fourth and ſixth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (being all one) for the next Lecture, becauſe in them is matter worthy of a large conſideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:65696:100"/>I come therefore to the fifth Argument,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 5.</note> which is taken from the collation between the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> and ſecond out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18, 19. From whence is argued, <hi>As in the firſt Adam we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſinners before any thing done on our part; ſo in the ſecond Adam, we are to be juſtified before any thing wrought in us.</hi> This the opponent doth much triumph in, but without cauſe, as the anſwer will manifeſt.</p>
               <p>And in the firſt place we cannot but reject thoſe Expoſitors of that text fore-quoted,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> who underſtand us to be <hi>ſinners in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> only by <hi>imitation,</hi> or by <hi>propagation</hi> meerly, as from a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted fountain; but we ſuppoſe it to be by imputation: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> (by Gods Covenant) being an univerſal perſon, and ſo as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, <hi>Omnes ille unus homo fuerunt,</hi> All were that one man. And therefore theſe do not riſe up to the full ſcope of the text, who parallel Chriſt and <hi>Adam</hi> only as two roots, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigens</hi> or <hi>fountains</hi>; for there muſt be a further conſideration of them as two common perſons, for our immediate fathers are a corrupted root, and we are corrupted by them, yet their ſins are not made ours, as <hi>Adams</hi> was. Hence the Apoſtle laieth the whole tranſgreſſion upon one, <hi>as by one mans diſobedience,</hi> &amp;c.

In which ſenſe <hi>Bernard</hi> called it, <hi>Alienum &amp; noſtrum,</hi> anothers ſin and ours: yea, it is ſo farre from being ours by conſent, that if a man on purpoſe ſhould now will that <hi>Adams</hi> ſin ſhould be his, this would not make <hi>Adams</hi> ſin imputed to him, it would be a new actual ſin in the man, it would not be <hi>Adams</hi> ſin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him. Now although all this be concluded upon, yet it
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:65696:101"/>
followeth not, that therefore we are juſtified in Chriſt before we believe. I acknowledge ſome eminent Divines have preſſed this compariſon; but there is a vaſt difference in this very act of imputation, and the ground of it: for ſuppoſing the Covenant at firſt made with <hi>Adam,</hi> all his poſterity by a naturall way are involved in his guilt, and ſo whether they will or no, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to their own acts they are obnoxious to this guilt. Hence all men (none excepted) that are propagated in a natural way are thus corrupted, but in Chriſt we are by a ſupernatural way, and none are made his, but ſuch as beleeve in him; and he doth not repreſent any to God as his members, till they be incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into him by faith, which faith although it be a gift of God, yet by it we are enabled voluntarily to chooſe and embrace Chriſt. Many other differences there are, but I pitch on this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as being fully to my purpoſe in hand. If therefore we were in Chriſt by a natural way, as we are in <hi>Adam,</hi> then antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to any thing wrought in us, we might be partakers of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges by one, as we are of curſes by another.</p>

Some have doubted, Whether Election be an act of love; and therefore have diſtinguiſhed between Dilecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Election, as if Dilection did go before, and Election follow. But certainly the ſame act of God, as it doth will good to the creature, is Dilection, as it willeth it to this rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hen another, is Election. We grant therefore that Election is an act of great love, but its a love of purpoſe or intention, not execution, it is <hi>Amor ordinativus,</hi> not <hi>collativus</hi>; it is a love or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining and preparing of mercies, but not beſtowing them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.

And among men we ſee the purpoſe of giving ſuch a gift is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted love, as well as the gift it ſelf. Now while a man is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the love of Election, and no more, there is no actual Remiſſion of ſin, no acceptance or complacency in his perſon or duties.

Faith doth not make Chriſts merits to be merits, or his ſatisfaction to be ſatisfaction. This ariſeth from the dignity and worth of Chriſt. It would be an abſurd thing to ſay, That faith is the cauſe why God doth accept of Chriſts merits, and receiveth a ſatisfaction
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:65696:103"/>
by him. This were to make the <hi>inſtrumental cauſe,</hi> a <hi>meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe.</hi> The Arminians they make Chriſt to have purchaſed pardon upon condition of believing, which believing they do not make a benefit by Chriſts death; yea they ſay, <hi>Nihil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eptius, nibil vanius,</hi> nothing is more fooliſh and vain then to do ſo. Now this indeed is an execrable errour, to hold Chriſt died only to make a way for reconciliation, which reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is wholly ſuſpended upon a mans faith, and that faith comes partly from a <hi>mans will,</hi> and partly from <hi>grace,</hi> not being the fruit of Chriſts death, as wel as remiſſion of ſins it ſelf. But we ſay a far different thing, Chriſt ſatisfied Gods wrath, ſo that God becomes reconciled, and gives pardon, but in the method and way he hath appointed, which is faith, and this faith God will certainly work in his due time, that ſo there may be an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to receive this pardon.</p>
               <p>For the opening of this, when it is ſaid, Chriſt ſatisfied Gods wrath, this may have a different meaning, either that Chriſt abſolutely purchaſed reconciliation with the Father, whether they believe or no, without any condition at all, as <hi>Joab</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>Abſoloms</hi> reconciliation with <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>Eſther</hi> the Jews deliverance of <hi>Ahaſhu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>roſh,</hi> Or with a condition. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſenſe it cannot be ſaid, becauſe the fruits of Chriſts death are limited only to believers. If with a condition, then either Antecedent, which is to be wrought by us, that ſo we may be partakers of his death, and that cannot be, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>He died for us while ſinners and enemies.</hi> And this is Arminianiſm, for by this means only a gate is ſet open for ſalvation, but it may happen that no man may enter in: or elſe this condition is Concomitant or conſequent, viz. <hi>A qualification wrought by the Spirit of Chriſt, whereby we are enabled to receive of thoſe benefits, which come by his death</hi>; And in this ſenſe it is a truth; and by this, the foundation of the Opponent is totally razed. For Chriſt took away the ſins of thoſe, for whom he died, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled them to God, and this abſolutely, if by it we underſtand any condition anteceding to be done by us: but not abſolutely, if it exclude a condition that is conſequently wrought by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, to apply the fruits of Chriſts death: ſo that the actual taking away of ſins is not accompliſhed, till the perſon
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65696:104"/>
for whom he died be united to him by Faith. Hence the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaks differently about Chriſts death; ſometimes it ſaith, <hi>He died for us ſinners and enemies</hi>; and in other places, <hi>John</hi> 15.13. <hi>He layeth down his life for his friends, and his ſheep.</hi> Joh. 17.19, <hi>He ſaith, he prayeth and ſanctifieth himſelf for thoſe that ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him,</hi> viz. <hi>in a conſequent ſenſe</hi>; for thoſe who by faith ſhall lay hold on his death.<note place="margin">A two fold condition of faith,</note> So that faith hath a two-fold conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the firſt of the time, when ſins are taken away by Chriſts death, and that is, when they believe. 2. Of whom theſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges are true, and that is, of ſuch who do believe. Now all this may be the further cleared, if we conſider, what kinde of cauſe Chriſts death is, to take away our ſins. It is a meritorious cauſe, which is in the rank of moral cauſes; of which the rule is not true, <hi>Poſitâ causâ, ſequitur effectus,</hi> The cauſe being, the effect preſently followeth. This holdeth in natural cauſes, which neceſſarily produce their effects, but <hi>moral</hi> cauſes, work ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the agreement and liberty of the <hi>Perſons</hi> that are moved thereby. As for Example, God the Father, is moved through the death of Chriſt to pardon the ſins of ſuch perſons, for whom he dieth. This agreement is to be made good, in that time they ſhall pitch upon in their tranſaction. Now it pleaſed the Father, that the benefits and fruits of Chriſts death ſhould be applied unto the believer, and not till he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, though this faith be at the ſame time alſo a gift of God through Chriſt. It is good therefore, when we either call Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction abſolute, or ſay, Chriſt died abſolutely, to conſider that <hi>Abſolute</hi> may be taken as oppoſite to a <hi>Pre-requiſite Condition,</hi> which is to be fulfilled by us, ſo that upon this, Election, and the fruits of Chriſts death ſhall depend; or elſe <hi>Abſolute,</hi> may be taken, as it oppoſeth any <hi>Means</hi> or <hi>Order</hi> which God hath <hi>appointed,</hi> as the way to obtain the end; and in this later ſenſe, it would be a grand abſurdity to ſay, Election is abſolute, or Chriſt died abſolutely, for if this were ſo, the prophane Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about Election, would have truth in it. If I be elected, let me live never ſo wickedly, I ſhall be ſaved. And the Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Argument, That every one were bound to believe that Chriſt died for him, though wicked and abiding ſo, would not well be avoided.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:65696:104"/>His laſt Argument is from the unchangeableneſs of Gods love, <hi>If we are not juſtified in his ſight before we believe,</hi>

               <p>In anſwering of this Argument, ſeveral things are conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</p>
               <p>Firſt, It muſt be readily granted, That God is unchangeable,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 
                  <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17. God is there compared to the Sunne, and is therefore called, <hi>the Father of Lights,</hi> but yet is preferred before it, becauſe that hath Clouds ſometimes caſt over it, and ſometimes is in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe, but there is <hi>change, or ſhadow of change with him.</hi> The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens have confeſſed this, and ſo argued, <hi>If God ſhould change, it would be either for better or worſe; for worſe, how could it be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? for better, then God were not abſolutely perfect.</hi> Moſt accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therefore muſt <hi>Vorſtius</hi> his blaſphemy be, who purpoſely pleads for mutability in God.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, As this is eaſily to be confeſſed, ſo the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of thoſe Arguments, brought from the things which God doth in time, and not from all Eternity, have been very weighty upon ſome mens ſhoulders; inſomuch that they thought this the only way to ſalve all, by ſaying, <hi>That all things were from Eternity.</hi> And certainly by the Antinomian Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we may as well plead for the Creation of all things from all Eternity, as that we are juſtified from all Eternity, for all are equally built upon this ſandy foundation, That becauſe the things are done in time, therefore there muſt be ſome new act of will, or love in God, which would imply God is mutable, not loving to day, and loving to morrow; Therefore to avoid this, they ſay, <hi>All is from Eternity. Origen</hi> who was called by an ancient Writer <hi>Centaur,</hi> becauſe of his monſtrous opinions, argued thus, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. As there cannot be a father without a ſonne, or a Maſter and Lord without a poſſeſſion, ſo neither an omnipotent, unleſs there be thoſe things about which this power may be exerciſed. Now although it be true,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:65696:105"/>
That <hi>De Deo etiam vera dicere periculoſum eſt,</hi> becauſe of the weakneſs of our Underſtandings to perceive his infinite luſtre,</p>
               <p>Yet thirdly, It is well cleared by the Schoolmen, That thoſe relations which are attributed to God in time, as a Creatour, Father, or Lord, are not becauſe of any new thing in God, but in reſpect of the creatures; ſo that when the world is created, when a man is juſtified, we ſay, God who was not a Creator before, is a Creator, who was not a Father by grace, is now by grace; not becauſe any new accident is in him, but becauſe there is a new effect in the creatures. Thus, if a man once the childe of wrath, be now a ſon of Gods love, the change is not in God, but in the creature.</p>
               <p>For the better clearing of this, we are to take notice in the fourth place, That it is one thing, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> obſerveth, <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare voluntatem,</hi> to change the Will; and another thing, <hi>Velle mutationem,</hi> to Will a change. By the ſame unchangeable Will, we may Will ſeveral changes in an Object. As the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician without any change of his Will, may will his Patient to take one kinde of Phyſick one day, and another the third: here he wils a change, but doth not change his Will. Thus God with the ſame Will, decreed to permit in time ſuch an elect man to be in a ſtate of ſin, under the power of Satan, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to call him out of this condition, to juſtifie his perſon; here indeed is a great change made in the man, but none at all in God. There is no new act in God, which was not from all Eternity, though every effect of this love of God was not from Eternity, but in time. Hence when our Divines argue againſt Arminians, <hi>That if the Saints ſhould apoſtatize, Gods love would be changeable,</hi> it is meant of Gods love of <hi>Election,</hi> which is an abſolute purpoſe and efficacious will to bring ſuch a man to glory: now although ſuch a decree was free, and ſo might not have been; yet <hi>ex hypotheſi,</hi> ſuppoſing God hath made this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, it doth very truly follow, <hi>That if that Saint ſhould not be brought to glory, God would be changeable.</hi> And beſides this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability, which may be called an immutability of his nature, there is another of his Word and Promiſe, whereby he hath graciouſly covenanted to <hi>put his fear in their heart, that they ſhall
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65696:105"/>
never depart from him:</hi> Now if any of the Saints ſhould totally or finally apoſtatize, Gods mutability would be ſeen in both thoſe reſpects of his <hi>nature or will,</hi> and of his <hi>truth and fidelity.</hi> But the caſe is not the like, when a man at his firſt converſion, is made of a childe of wrath, a childe of grace; partly becauſe there was no ſuch abſolute decree of God from Eternity, that he ſhould be for no ſpace a childe of wrath, but the clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and partly becauſe there is no ſuch word or promiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any unconverted perſon, that he ſhall be in the favour of God; but the Scripture declareth the clean contrary. This duly conſidered, will give a clear reaſon, why it is no good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to ſay, Such a man in his ſins to day, is a childe of wrath; and converted to morrow, is a ſon of grace: Therefore God is changeable. But on the other ſide, if a man ſhould argue, An Elect man received into the ſtate of grace, <hi>may fall totally and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, Therefore God is changed,</hi> would be a ſtrong and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable inference. And indeed for this particular may the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians be challenged, as holding Gods mutability, becauſe they hold, That notwithſtanding Gods decree and purpoſe to ſave ſuch a man, yet a man by his own corruption and default, ſhall fruſtrate God of this his intention. Otherwiſe all know, <hi>Adam</hi> was created in a ſtate of Gods favour, and quickly apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatized into the contrary: ſo that we may truly ſay, <hi>Adam</hi> was one day, (yea hour, as ſome) a childe of Gods favour; and in another of his wrath, yet the change was in <hi>Adam,</hi> not in God, both becauſe God had not made an abſolute Decree from all Eternity for his ſtanding, as alſo becauſe he had made no Promiſe to preſerve him in that happy condition. In this ſenſe 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10. it is ſaid, <hi>Which in time paſt were not a people, but now are the people of God, which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</hi> And whereas the Opponent ſaith, God loved us before we did believe; it is true, with a love of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but many effects of his love are not exhibited till we do believe. He loveth us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo worketh one effect of love in us, that that effect may be a qualification for a new and further effect of love. He loveth us, to make us his friends, and when he hath done that, he loveth us with a love of friendſhip. God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us before he gave Chriſt, for out of that love he gave us
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65696:106"/>
Chriſt, that ſo when Chriſt is given us, he may beſtow another love upon us. Now becauſe it is ordinary with us to call the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of love, love, as the fruit of grace is grace; Therefore we ſay, <hi>In ſuch a time God loved not one,</hi> and afterwards we ſay, <hi>He doth love the ſame,</hi> not that herein is any change of God, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral effects of his love are exhibited. As we call the effects of Gods anger, his anger, <hi>Poena patientis, ira eſſe creditur decernen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> The puniſhment on the offender, is judged the anger of the inflicter: and by this means we ſay ſometimes God is angry, and afterwards he ceaſeth to be angry, when he removeth theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his anger: ſo a man is ſaid to be loved, or not to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved according to the effects of Gods love exhibited in time, and God hath ſo appointed it, that one effect of his love ſhould be a qualification in the ſubject for another, as ſanctification for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification.</p>

ſay, <hi>Pardon me my Lord and King</hi>; but this is to abuſe Proteſtant Authours, for although many of them may make this <hi>part</hi> of the meaning, yet none make it the <hi>only</hi> meaning. <hi>Gomarus</hi> in his Explication of this Petition, doth excellently confute <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator,</hi> for explicating Pardon of ſin by a Metonymy of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, viz. <hi>The ſenſe and feeling of this in our hearts,</hi> and ſaith, That ſuch a ſignification cannot be proved out of any place of Scripture, nor out of the language of any good Authors, and one of his reaſons is this, <hi>Prayer for pardon of ſin would be impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently taken out of the Lords Prayer; for he, who prayeth for the ſenſe and feeling of a thing, ſuppoſeth it already done.

               <p>This alſo <hi>Bellarmine</hi> objecting againſt ſpecial Faith, as if it were a confidence that my ſins are forgiven already, he makes it as abſurd upon this ground to beg for pardon, as it would be to pray, that Chriſt may be incarnated, or made fleſh. <hi>Crocius</hi> in his anſwer to this, <hi>Diſput. de fidei juſtificantis objecto, pa.</hi> 131. ſaith, as you heard before, <hi>That thoſe things indeed uſe not to be prayed for, which are ſo done, that they are never done more; but thoſe things which are ſo done, as that they may be often done again, may be prayed for. The incarnation of Chriſt was once done, and can be no more, but Remiſſion of ſins is ſo done, that it continueth further to be done, and its laſt effect is reſerved for the future. For as often as we ſin, ſo often there is need of Repentance.</hi> So that by his Judgement Remiſſion of ſinne is not like Creation, which once was, and is not reiterated, but conſervation.

Thus <hi>David</hi> although he heard his Pardon proclaimed, yet makes that poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential Pſalm, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. for mercy to do away his ſins, which was by appeaſing his conſcience, and ſatisfying his ſoul with the goodneſs of God: for as a godly man, though he have truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of his ſins, yet upon any ſad occaſion doth reiterate his
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65696:107"/>
Pardon, as <hi>Paul</hi> many times hath his heart-ake for his former blaſphemies and perſecutions; ſo it is neceſſary to have the ſenſe and apprehenſion of his Pardon reiterated to his own comfort and conſolation. There is no mans Aſſurance about Pardon, ſo high and unmoveable, but it many times meeteth with violent aſſaults, and therefore needeth oil to be frequently poured into his wounds, <hi>Comfort, comfort ye my people,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet.) There muſt be an ingemination of the duty, elſe the ſoul at firſt will not hearken.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. This Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on relates to four ſorts of men.</note>In the ſecond place, We may conceive of four ſorts of perſons praying for this Pardon of ſin.</p>
               <p>The firſt is an unconverted and unregenerated man. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he cannot call God Father, and ſo not pray in Faith, yet he is bound to pray. The <hi>Socinians</hi> interpret that compellation, <hi>Our Father,</hi> not actually, but diſpoſitively; as if the meaning were, who art ready and willing to be a Father. But that is not the full meaning of that place. There lieth an obligation upon <hi>unregenerate men</hi> to perform holy Duties, though they cannot do them acceptably. Their impotency to do them, doth not diſoblige from the command to do them. Now its plain, that ſuch a perſon praying for forgiveneſs, doth not pray for the Aſſurance of that which is already paſt (for ſo no ſinne is forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him) but for initial Pardon, which he never yet hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of perſons praying this Prayer, are thoſe that at their firſt converſion humble themſelves, and ſeek unto God for his face, and reconciliation with him. Now thoſe that are thus in their beginnings, and new birth, they can pray in no other ſenſe, but for initial and firſt Pardon; for as that is the firſt time they begin to have ſorrow and brokenneſs of heart; ſo that is the firſt time they begin to partake of Pardon; Pardon of ſin and Faith they are correlates, and ſo are toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>A third rank is of Believers in their progreſs of holineſs and ſanctification, walking without any ſcandal or offence in the wayes of God: They, in this Petition have a two-fold ſenſe, the one an Aſſurance of the Pardon of ſins, that are already forgiven them; and the other is a renewed Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:65696:107"/>
for the renewed infirmities they continually are plunged into.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, There are lapſed Believers, who have fallen into ſome grievous ſins, and thereby have made deſperate wounds upon their own ſouls, and theſe have agonies and pangs of heart, much like their firſt converſion. Therefore its called ſo, <hi>When thou art converted ſtrengthen thy brother,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Peter.</hi> This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery out of the ſinne they were plunged into, was like a new converſion. By ſuch a commotion as this made in the ſoul, there is nothing but darkneſs and confuſion, and they pray for pardon, as if this were the firſt time. They fear all their former wayes to have been hypocriſies. Thus <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 51. prayeth for <hi>the reſtoring of joy to him, that his broken bones may be heaeled</hi>; as alſo for <hi>truth in the inward parts.</hi> Now although ſuch a mans for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſins were indeed forgiven him, yet it is to his ſenſe and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as if it were not ſo, but rather the contrary is feared by him, that Gods wrath doth ſtill abide on him. Hence he prayeth for Pardon in his own judgement, as one who yet never hath been acquitted by God. So that according to the ſeveral conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the perſons prayings, we may ſuppoſe ſeveral ſenſes in the Petition.</p>
               <p>But in the third place, to anſwer the Queſtion, we ſay,<note place="margin">3 Aſſurance of pardon not the only thing prayed for, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by four Reaſons.</note> 
                  <hi>That Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of pardon is not the only thing praied for.</hi> And that for theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We are never to depart from the literall ſenſe of the words, without an evident neceſſity, but the plain undoubted ſenſe is, <hi>That God would forgive our ſins</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> for our Saviour minding brevity in this Prayer, no doubt would ſpeak his ſenſe in the moſt perſpicuous and clear manner that can be. As therefore if Chriſt had ſaid, Make us to be aſſured of the pardon of ſin. The Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian would not have gone from the letter, but preſſed us to that: So on the other ſide, when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Forgive us,</hi> and not Give us the ſenſe of forgivenes, we have cauſe to cleave ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that: and this may be illuſtrated by two further conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, the former of thoſe places where God is ſaid not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, the later of thoſe where forgiveneſs is applied of one man unto another. When the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> how their Land was full of Idols, and both great and mean
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:65696:108"/>
men did humble themſelves before them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.9. prayeth, that therefore God would not forgive them. Can any one make the meaning to be, that God would not give them the aſſurance of their forgiveneſs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.32. The Evangeliſt ſaith, <hi>All other ſins may be forgiven, but that againſt the holy Ghoſt ſhall never:</hi> Now in that ſenſe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins are ſaid to be forgiven, in which ſenſe that is denied to be forgiven: and that is denied to be forgiven, not in reſpect of Aſſurance and Declaration to a mans conſcience only, but really and indeed. Therefore the ſins forgiven are in the like manner forgiven.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2.</note>Again, It is plain, That by Pardon is not meant Aſſurance of Pardon only, becauſe when applied to men, it cannot admit of ſuch a ſenſe. Now the Petition runs thus, <hi>That God would forgive us, as we forgive others</hi>; and there is no man will explain the later forgiveneſs of Aſſurance; and why then the former?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3.</note>Beſides, The equivalent phraſe of forgiveneſs doth evince more then an Aſſurance of Forgiveneſs; for when the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture cals it blotting out of ſinne, it is an expreſſion from Debts, which are, as it were written in Gods book, and therefore till he cancelleth them, they doe remain in their guilt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4.</note>Furthermore, If a ſin be not really pardoned, till a man do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe, then he beggeth for more then Aſſurance; but we have fully proved, That there is no remiſſion of ſin till con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and forſaking of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The inſtance for the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry opinion an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note>As for the above named Authours inſtance of a malefactour who hath received Pardon, may yet upon his coming into the Kings preſence, deſire Pardon, it no wayes advantageth him: For ſuppoſe a Malefactour might the firſt time do ſo, yet experience doth demonſtrate it would argue folly and madneſs in a Malefactour, to doe ſo frequently: Whereas it is our duty daily to begge the Pardon of our ſinnes at the Throne of Grace. To conclude this Point (becauſe we have elſwhere ſpoken to it) This Expoſition doth overthrow the continual uſe of the Word, the equipollent phraſes, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object of Prayer, and departs from the letter of the Text,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65696:108"/>
without any juſt ground at all. Which is againſt the rules of Explication of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>The next Queſtion is of great Practicall Concernment,<note place="margin">Why God doth ſometimes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſin, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting the ſinner vvith it.</note> viz. <hi>Why God doth ſometimes Pardon a ſinne, and yet not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest it to the ſinners heart.</hi> It appeareth by <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm. 51. That when a ſinne is forgiven in Heaven, it is not alſo remitted, and blotted out in a mans conſcience; yet God can as eaſily work the one as the other. If he ſay, Let there be light in ſuch a dark heart; of an Hell, it preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becomes an Heaven. We would judge that by this divine Diſpenſation, as the godly man loſeth much of his comfort, ſo God of his Glory and Honour. But divers Reaſons may be produced for this. As<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, It may be God will teach us hereby,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>That Pardon of ſinne is not a neceſſary Effect of Repentance, but a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gift beſtowed, though not without it, yet not for it.</hi> Though therefore thy ſoul hath been deeply humbled, and is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reformed, yet God ſuſpends the light of his favour upon thy ſoul, that thou mayeſt acknowledge it his Grace, not the merit of thy ſorrow; where Cauſes doe naturally produce an Effect, there it is a Miracle, if the one followeth not the other. If the fire doe not burn, if the Sunne ſtand ſtill; if <hi>Peter</hi> walking on the water ſink not. But it is no wonder, to ſee a true contrite heart without Aſſurance and Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Theſe may be ſeparated, that ſo thou mayeſt be as hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with thy Graces, as if they were not at all. Yea God hath delighted ſometimes in natural Cauſes to work the Effects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, leſt the glory ſhould be given to the inſtruments. Hence he cauſed light to be before the Sunne, and the earth is commanded to bring forth Herbs before any rain, that ſo God may be acknowledged all in all. If God do this in the order of natural things, how much more of ſupernatural? Yet this is not ſo to be preſt, as if therefore God would forgive ſin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance. No, God hath ordered a way inviolably and indiſpenſably, wherein he will vouchſafe his Pardon, and no otherwayes. But although God out of his <hi>meer good will hath inſeparably conjoined Repentance and Remiſſion together,</hi> yet the <hi>Diſcovery</hi> or <hi>Promulgation</hi> of this unto the broken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65696:109"/>
heart, is altogether Arbitrary: And in this, as well as in other things, that ſpeech is true, <hi>The winde bloweth where it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth.</hi> Know therefore by theſe divine Diſpenſations, That though thou doſt repent, Gods forgiveneſs is a meer gift of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, and no natural, neceſſary fruit of thy ſorrow. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſetting Gods gracious Promiſe aſide, whereby he is a Debtor unto his own faithfulneſs, after thy pureſt, and moſt perfect Humilation for ſin, God might refuſe to take thy guilt away.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2.</note>A ſecond Reaſon, Why God though he pardon, may yet deny the manifeſtation of it, is, <hi>Becauſe hereby God would make us feel the bitterneſſe and gall of it in our own hearts.</hi> A Pardon eaſily obtained takes off the burden of the fault. Thus God dealt with <hi>David,</hi> The light of Gods favour doth not preſently break thorow the Cloud, that ſo <hi>David</hi> may feel how bitter a thing it is to ſinne againſt God. As God ſuffered <hi>Iſaac</hi> to be bound, to have wood laid on him, the knife to be lifted up to ſtrike him, in all which ſpace, <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s fear could not but heighten: Thus God alſo will kill and wound thoſe, whom he intends to make alive: he will bruiſe them and break them, that ſo they may judge the ſeeming good in ſin, to be nothing to the real evil that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3.</note>And from this ſecond, iſſueth a third Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> To make us more watchful and diligent againſt the time to come: <hi>Peters</hi> bitterneſs of ſoul, was a ſpecial preſervative againſt the like temptations; as bitter Potions kill the worms in childrens ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks. It muſt needs argue much guilt in Gods people, if after the particular gall and wormwood they have found in ſin, they ſhall be ready to drink the like bitter potion, when ſin preſents it ſelf. Certainly the heart-aches that <hi>Paul</hi> found afterwards, though pardoned, for his former perſecutions, were like a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſword to keep him off from ſuch attempts again; He might more truly ſay, then that Heathen did, <hi>He would not buy repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſo dear.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4.</note>4. By reaſon of the <hi>Difficulty, and ſupernaturall way of believing, it is, that Pardon may be in Heaven, when we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apply it in our Conſciences.</hi> Hence though the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65696:109"/>
be never ſo much for our eaſe, and thereupon infinitely to be deſired, yet the way of believing this, is ſo far above natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which expects Juſtification by works, that the heart of a man hath much ado to cloſe with it. Therefore faith is not like other Graces or Duties (<hi>viz.</hi> Love of God, Humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which have ſome obſcure footſteps in the natural dictates of conſcience, but it is wholly ſupernatural; yea <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of integrity knew not this kinde of believing in the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Mediatour. For as the object of faith, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by revelation, no councel of men or Angels could have exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated ſuch a truth; ſo faith, as it is the hand or organ applying Chriſts righteouſneſs, is a duty not manifeſted by humane light, but wholly from above. And as fleſh and bloud doth not reveal to us, That Chriſt is the Son of the living God, ſo neither that we are to have remiſſion of ſins only by faith in his bloud. Hence the Scripture makes faith the gift of God, which coming from the Spirit into our hearts, meeteth with much contrariety and oppoſition of doubts and unbelief. No wonder therefore if after the heart of a man hath been awakened for ſinne, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſome commotions a long while after: even as the ſea af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tempeſts &amp; winds, though they be allaied, yet for ſome ſpace after roareth and rageth, not leaving its troubles preſently, as you heard before. Though therefore as God pardoneth in Heaven, he offereth it alſo unto our Conſciences, yet we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe and put it off, we will not be comforted, becauſe it is not a comfort flowing in the way we look for, <hi>viz.</hi> by working. And for this reaſon, though <hi>David</hi> heard <hi>Nathan</hi> pronounce his pardon, yet he doth vehemently importune for it afterwards in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 51. as if he had not the leaſt notice of any ſuch mercy to him.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>God defers the notice of Pardon to thee,</hi>

                  <hi>that ſo thou mayeſt be the more able to ſympathize with thoſe that are in the like tempted condition.</hi> For as one end of Chriſts ſuffering in his ſoul, lying in agonies under Gods diſpleaſure, was becauſe he might know how to have compaſſion upon his children in ſuch tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: So the Lord doth exerciſe his people to the ſame purpoſe; and certainly Chriſt accounted this, the tongue of the learned, to ſpeak a ſeaſonable word to a wounded heart. Beſides, hereby
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:65696:110"/>
ſhall we ſpeak the more wonderfully of Gods grace, and his goodneſs, after our deliverance out of thoſe ſtorms. Thoſe that have been in theſe deep waters, ſee the wonderful works of the Lord, and ſo have their hearts and mouths the more opened to celebrate his praiſe.</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Direct.</hi> 1.</note>Firſt, Acknowledge God, and clear him howſoever. Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 51. that thou mayeſt be clear, when thou art judged. If the devils and the damned in hell have no cauſe to complain of God as unjuſt, or too ſevere, then much leſs mayeſt thou who art kept in darkneſs for a ſeaſon only, that afterwards thou mayeſt enjoy the more light. Let not God be the worſe God, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the leſs unto thee, becauſe thou art not yet ſet free out of the bonds of ſin. By being thus humble thou takeſt the way to be filled, whereas impatiency and diſcontent, cauſeth God the more to hide his face.</p>

                     <hi>Direct.</hi> 2.</note>Secondly, Examine thy Repentance, whether that hath been ſo ſound, ſo pure, ſo deep, ſo univerſal, as it ſhould have been. All ſorrow and humiliation for ſin, is not godly Repentance. <hi>Ahabs</hi> tears and <hi>Peters</hi> differ as much as the water of the Sea, which is briniſh and ſalt, and the water of the clouds, which is ſweet. <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 32. acknowledgeth the pain and gripes he had within, becauſe of ſin: and no wonder he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it, and bewail it before God. If therefore God keeps thy heart in many doubts and fears, giving thee no reſt; conſider whether thou haſt caſt all that leaven out of thy houſe, whether every <hi>Achan</hi> within thee be ſtoned or no. It is in vain to cure the wound, as long as any ſplint of the poiſoned arrow lieth within it, or if thou finde no ſin unrepented of, ſearch whether thy formal lazy duties be not the cauſe of all the blackneſs that is in thy heart. We reade in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> that the Churches lazineſs, and her not opening the doors to Chriſt when he knockt, was the cauſe of that ſpiritual deſertion ſhe was plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

The ſtanding pool begets the croaking Frogs, not the running ſtream: and it is the dull, negligent Chriſtian, whoſe heart is filled with ſad fears and doubts, whereas the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Manna and white ſtone is promiſed to him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh.</p>

As <hi>David</hi> many times cals upon his ſoul to truſt in God, and not to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully dejected. How is that woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> commended for her faith? who, though our Saviour called her Dog, and did in effect tell her, ſhe was excluded from pardon, did yet earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſue him, and gave him no reſt, till he gave her reſt. And certainly, this is the nobleſt act of Faith, this is indeed to give glory to God, when in the midſt of all thy fears and guilt, thou canſt relie upon him for pardon; as in wicked men who are filled with Satan, as <hi>Anania<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Again, on the other ſide, A Chriſtian falling into ſuch a groſs ſin, may ſo far be ſwallowed up with ſorrow, as that he ſhall think the whole bond of friendſhip is diſſolved between him and God, that he is caſt out of that ſpiritual Paradiſe he was in, and that God is no more his Father, nor he his childe. It is therefore neceſſary to have a pillar of fire to guide us in this wilderneſs. And that the whole truth of this matter may be underſtood, obſerve theſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>

                     </gap>ſtion.</note>Firſt, <hi>Every ſin, even the leaſt ſin, doth deſerve eternal death.</hi> As appeareth by thoſe general places, <hi>Curſed is every one that abideth not in all things the Law commands,</hi> Gal. 3.10. Now eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin is a tranſgreſſion of the Law. This the Apoſtle ſpeaks uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally of all ſin, without any exception, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>The wages of ſin is death.</hi> And indeed this muſt needs be ſo, if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the leaſt ſinne is an offence againſt an infinite God: and in this reſpect, becauſe God is not a <hi>little,</hi> but a <hi>great God,</hi> ſo every ſin is not little, but a great ſin. Again, if you conſider
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:65696:111"/>
the neceſſity of Chriſts bloud to expiate this, no ſinne can be thought little: for if a man had no ſin in the world, but one of theſe little ones, he could not eſcape eternall wrath, without Chriſts mediation.</p>
               <p>Therefore we cannot ſay any ſin is venial, either from its kinde and nature (as Papiſts diſtinguiſh) ſuch they make to be officious, or jeſting lies; or from the imperfection of the act, ſuch they make thoſe that are committed indeliberately, or out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, without full conſent or knowledge.</p>
               <p>Or from the ſmalneſs of the matter, as to ſteal a farthing, or the like. None of theſe ſins are ſo ſmall, but that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve hell, becauſe they are the tranſgreſſion of the Law of an holy and great God; and our Saviour confirmeth this, when he ſaith, <hi>Of every idle word a man ſhall give an account,</hi> Mat. 12.36. and that phraſe <hi>of giving an account,</hi> is not a <hi>diminutive,</hi> but <hi>aggravative</hi> expreſſion: Our Saviour doth there argue from the leſs to the greater, Thus, If a man muſt give an account for every idle word, much more for blaſphemy againſt the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Take we heed therefore, how we bring down the weight and guilt of the ſinne; here alſo we may ſee, why <hi>Paul</hi> found ſuch a mountain upon him, by ſinful motions only ariſing in his heart.</p>
               <p>There are two places that ſeem to import ſuch a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſins, as if ſome only deſerved hell, and others not. The firſt is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.22. where our Saviour ſpeaking of three degrees of ſin, doth proportionably aſſign three degrees of puniſhment, and the laſt only is guilty of hell fire.</p>
               <p>But the clear Anſwer is, That our Saviour ſpeaks alluſively to thoſe three Courts of Judicature among the Jews, the leaſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment whereof was death; ſo that the firſt Court puniſhed with death, the ſecond, death with a more grievous torment; The third with a moſt grievous. For that our Saviour doth only allude to theſe Courts, and not ſpeak of what faults the Courts puniſhed, is plain; for none can think that the Court put any to death for calling his brother fool. It was murder and ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ins that they puniſhed with capital puniſhments. The other place is, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.15, 17. where the Apoſtle makes a difference
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65696:112"/>
between a ſin unto death, and a ſin not unto death, but that is clearly to be underſtood either of the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt (which in thoſe times, when the ſpirit of diſcerning was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, might eaſily be known) or of ſuch ſin that did plainly diſcover obſtinacy and impenitency accompanying of it, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe no man might pray for another man that hath committed a mortal ſin, if by a ſin unto death, the Papiſt will mean every mortal ſin.</p>
               <p>Lay therefore this foundation, That every ſin is mortal, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its deſert and guilt, howſoever to the godly believing and repenting, no ſin is mortal, but all venial, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to thoſe that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Therefore <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi> obſerves well, That in this caſe, the perſons offending are to be conſidered (whether they be believers) more then the ſins themſelves.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Propoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Howſoever every ſin, even the leaſt, doth thus deſerve eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, yet there is a great difference between ſome ſins and others.</hi> And therefore ſin is not a meer negation, but a privation, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes are, and ſo as one diſeaſe may be more deſperate then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo may one ſin be more hainous then another. The Stoicks thought all ſins alike. And <hi>Cyprian</hi> among the Ancients, is reported by the Learned to have been of that minde. But Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth evidently confute this, <hi>He that delivered me unto thee hath the greater ſin,</hi> John 16.11. So you have the phraſe, <hi>no be worſe then an Infidel,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.8. Thus <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.47. <hi>Iſrael</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>more corrupted,</hi> and to do <hi>more abomination then So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> For although to ſinne be to miſs the mark, yet ſome may ſhoot farre wider from it, then others, one ſinne therefore may be more hainous then another, divers wayes, as Divines ſhew: As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>From the Perſon offending</hi>; if he know the will of God, or if he be in publick place or office.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Object</hi>; If it be ſin againſt God immediately, or man only, as <hi>Eli</hi> ſaid, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. <hi>If one man ſin against another, the Judge ſhall judge him, but if a man ſin againſt the Lord, who ſhall intreat for him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>From the Matter about which</hi>; If it be in the life of a
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65696:112"/>
man, and not in his goods, that thou wrongeſt him. Some alſo may be aggravated from the diſpoſition of the man, the means he enjoyes to overcome ſin from the frequency of it, or defending of it, and the like. Hence ſome ſins are compared to <hi>Camels,</hi> others to <hi>Gnats,</hi> ſome to <hi>Beams,</hi> other to <hi>Moats,</hi> ſome to <hi>Talents,</hi> other to <hi>Farthings.</hi> This then being clear, let us conſider, what difference a true believer ſhould make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe in matter of pardon, and what difference he ſhould not make.</p>
               <p>And in the firſt place,<note place="margin">The Queſtion ſtated in theſe Propoſitions following.</note> he is to make a vaſt difference about
them, <hi>when he ſueth out for pardon.</hi> As</p>
               <p n="1">1. He is to believe Gods wrath is more kindled againſt him, and that his indignation burneth more hotly, when ſuch an ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is committed, then in our daily infirmities.<note place="margin">1. This differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in ſuing for pardon.</note> Thus when <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> had made the Idolatrous Calf, how angry was God both with <hi>Aaron</hi> and the people? How angry alſo was God with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> after his murder and adultery? <hi>David</hi> had continual infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, but God did not break his bones for them, he made not ſuch a breach upon his peace &amp; conſcience, as he did in theſe ſins: Therefore it muſt argue <hi>high prophaneneſs</hi> of ſpirit; if a man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the committing of groſs and loathſom ſins be no more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, then for the continual motions and incurſions which ſinne neceſſarily makes upon us. No, as ſins have a greater guilt in them, ſo Gods wrath is ſtirred up in a more vehement manner againſt ſuch.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a great difference to be made <hi>in reſpect of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and the meaſure of godly ſorrow for it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In reſpect of humiliation.</note> For as the ſin may exceed another, as much as the Camel doth a Gnat; ſo ought the ſorrow as much as an Ocean doth a drop. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> goeth out, <hi>and weeps bitterly</hi>; he did not ſo for every defect, and ſpiritual imperfection in him, as for this abominable Apoſtaſie. We reade alſo of the inceſtuous perſon, as he committed a ſin, that was not ſo much as named among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſo he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted ſuch ſorrow as was ſcarce heard among Chriſtians; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Apoſtle was afraid of him, leſt he ſhould be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with too much ſorrow. Now if for every ſin of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity there ſhould be as much ſorrow and humiliation, as for theſe crimſon and ſcarlet ſins, how would the whole life of man
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:65696:113"/>
be but a continual trouble of ſoul? and in what darkneſs would he live alwayes? Although all thy continual failings ought to be matter of humiliation unto thee, yet when ſuch as theſe ſhall break out, thy ſoul ought to ſet open the floud-gates of thy ſoul. Neither may this be thought a low mercenary way, as if the party ſo humbled did intend a compenſation unto God. But all places of Scripture muſt be regarded, as thoſe which ſpeak of Chriſts glorious grace; ſo alſo thoſe which ſpeak of our duties.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <note place="margin">3. Groſs ſins procure wrath, and hinder the conſolations of Gods Spirit.</note>3. The Spirit of God doth not only in his Word <hi>reveal a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er wrath againſt ſuch ſins, but he doth alſo withdraw all thoſe conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and comforts which were in the heart before.</hi> So that a man thus offending, doth, as it were, bolt himſelf in a dark dungeon, and ſhut out all the beams of the Sun againſt him. Inſomuch that although Aſſurance, and the conſolations of the holy Ghoſt may conſiſt with the weakneſſes, and ſinful infirmities of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yet they do not with the groſs impieties they plunge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into, as appeareth in <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51. who prayeth <hi>for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of that ſalvation he had loſt by his ſin.</hi> The Spirit of God is a <hi>Dove,</hi> and that delighteth not in noiſom buildings. The Spirit of God may be <hi>grieved</hi> and <hi>quenched</hi> in reſpect of the fruits thereof: So that a man thus wounded for ſin, feels a very hell in his heart, admits of no comfort. Neither can it be otherwiſe, for when we refuſe the Spirit of God <hi>ſanctifying,</hi> we preſently repel it <hi>comforting.</hi> If we have not the <hi>heat</hi> of this Sun, neither ſhall we have the <hi>light</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <note place="margin">4. Groſs ſins exclude from the ſociety of the faithful.</note>4. In theſe groſs offences the Spirit of God doth not onely forſake him in reſpect of Conſolation, but its a Command laid upon the Church-Officers, <hi>to cast ſuch an one out of their ſociety,</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. neither may the people of God have <hi>any familiar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> or <hi>acquaintance</hi> with ſuch: now what horror and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling may juſtly ariſe in ſuch a mans heart, who ſhall thus be caſt out of all <hi>gracious Priviledges,</hi> and that by Gods appointment? What darkneſs muſt this work in his heart, when he ſhall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus with himſelf; Its Gods command I ſhould not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Seals of his love; he hath given his Officers charge to pour no oil in my wounds; how can I plead for the grace ſignified, when he denieth me the <hi>Seals</hi> thereof? God hath ſhut
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65696:113"/>
me out like the unclean leper, and whither ſhall I go? Now then, if the Church of God make ſuch a vaſt difference between him and others, and that following the directions of Chriſt. Ought not the perſon offending alſo to judge the ſame things about himſelf?</p>
               <p n="5">5. In ſome kinde of groſſe ſins, although there may be deep humiliation, yet there are many other conditions requiſite,<note place="margin">3 Some groſſ ſins requſte m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus our Saviour alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>If thou remember any man have ought againſt thee, leave thy gift at the Altar, and go and be reconciled.</hi> It is a known ſaying of <hi>Auſtin, Non remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur peccatum, niſi reſtituatur ablatum:</hi> The ſinne is not remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, unleſſe what thou haſt unjuſtly taken be reſtored. And it is a moſt wretched perverting of the ſenſe, which an Antinomian makes (<hi>Reconcil. with God, pag</hi> 90.) that this reconciliation is to be made of man to man, but not true in reſpect of God to man; and whereas the ſame Authour ſpeaks of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> that he did <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve</hi> firſt, and afterwards <hi>made reſtitution:</hi> which (<hi>pag.</hi> 91.) he cals an example beyond all exception; let him the ſecond time conſider <hi>Zacheus</hi> his expreſſion, and he will ſee it nothing to his purpoſe. The words are in the preſent tenſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.8. <hi>Behold Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. and if I have wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any man, I give him four-fold.</hi> Now either <hi>Zacheus</hi> means this of his former life paſt, or elſe he declares his ready and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared will for the time to come; and there are Interpreters of both ſides, and which way ſoever you expound it, it overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the adverſaries tenent. For if it be underſtood of his courſe of life, <hi>formely paſt,</hi> then it goeth clear againſt him. If of his readineſſe of minde for the future, it makes nothing for him. For although by this it will appear, That <hi>Zacheus</hi> did joyfully receive Chriſt before he made <hi>actuall reſtitution,</hi> yet not before he had a preparedneſſe, and reſolution of heart to do it. And certainly <hi>Zacheus</hi> ſpeaking thus to Chriſt, <hi>Behold I give,</hi> cannot but be underſtood, that this penitent frame of heart was upon him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaid ſo. If <hi>Zacheus</hi> ſpeaks this of his former courſe of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:65696:114"/>
life, then he doth manifeſt this not in a way of pride or oftenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to ſee whether Chriſt would command him to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſo that he might be thought to ſay this, for inſtruction ſake, to be directed for the future.</p>

In the Red Sea, the ſtouteſt and moſt valiant Champion was drowned, as well as the meaneſt ſouldier. He is the Lamb that takes away the ſins of the world; and his bloud is ſaid to cleanſe us from all our iniquities. Here is no difference made, from one ſin as well as another. So that although thy great ſins require greater humiliation, yet not a <hi>greater Mediator</hi> then Chriſt is; Thou muſt pour out more tears, but Chriſt needs not pour out more bloud; ſo that in reſpect of Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe applied, the leaſt and the greateſt ſinner are pardoned both alike; neither is it blaſphemy (though the Papiſts judge it ſo) to ſay, <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> are both juſtified alike.</p>

                  <hi>Sins forgiven, covered, not imputed.</hi> It is much to conſider how anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Interpreters have made a difference between the ſins enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated; as if there were divers <hi>kindes,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>degrees</hi> of ſinne enumerated; and hereupon alſo they make a difference between forgiving, covering and imputing, as if one were more then the other; but we are rather to take it according to the Scripture-cuſtome, which doth uſe for amplification ſake, to ſay the ſame thing in divers words, and this is <hi>autology,</hi> but not <hi>tautology.</hi> The difference that is, is from the ſeverall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors that are in the words. As the firſt word doth ſignifie the taking away of ſin, which is a burrhen, bleſſed is he that is eaſed of ſuch a weight. The ſecond, which is covering, doth ſuppoſe the loathſome filthineſſe of ſin in the eyes of God, and therefore by grace is taken out of his ſight. The third, not imputing or reckoning, is a metaphor ſuppoſing ſinne a debt, and God in his account will not ſet it upon our ſcore, ſo that the ſeverall expreſſions are wonderfully comfortable, if ſinne trouble thee as an heavy weight on thee, pardoning is the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and taking off this burden; if ſinne make thee to judge thy ſelf loathſome, thou canſt not endure thy ſelf, pardon of ſin is covering of it; if ſin put thee in ſuch a <hi>debt to God,</hi> that thou knoweſt not how to ſatisfie, pardon is not imputing.</p>

This is as if a man ſhould argue, He is a rich man, becauſe his debts are forgiven, which is a <hi>non ſequitur,</hi> becauſe they are two diſtinct things. This makes <hi>Piſcator</hi> and <hi>Wotton,</hi> with others, to make <hi>justification</hi> to be nothing but remiſſion of ſins, and that imputation of righteouſneſſe, and remiſſion of ſins are the ſelf ſame thing; a man being therefore accounted righteous becauſe his ſins are not imputed unto him. Hence they deny that the Scripture ever ſaith Chriſts righteouſneſſe is imputed unto us, although in ſome ſenſe they grant, it may be ſaid ſo, inaſmuch as by his death for us, he purchaſed remiſſion of ſin, which is our righteouſneſſe. This is to be conſidered of, when we ſpeak of the other part of juſtification, <hi>viz..</hi> imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe. Although they that are for imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſay, The Argument is good, which <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth, becauſe imputing of righteouſneſſe is immediatly contrary to the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſinne; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> might argue <hi>righteouſneſſe imputed,</hi> from <hi>ſinne remitted,</hi> even as we truly argue, The night is not, therefore the day is, becauſe darkneſſe and light are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate contraries, and the ſubject muſt neceſſarily have one of them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, This forgiveneſſe of ſin is deſcribed from the ſubject, in whom it is, <hi>viz.</hi> in him, <hi>in whoſe heart there is no guile</hi>; that is, who doth not cover his ſins by not confeſſing, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting of them, as <hi>David</hi> acknowledgeth he did for a while.</p>

We do not therefore make God to cover ſinne (as an Antinomian ſaith we do) as if a man ſhould cover a thing with a net, where the object is ſtill ſeen, <hi>Honey comb,</hi> pag 57. but as to Gods hatred and revengefull condemnation, ſo it is wholly covered; and therefore thoſe expreſſions of taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, blotting out of ſinne, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do fully imply, that God
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65696:117"/>
giveth not an half pardon, but that he taketh away the offence, and whatſoever puniſhment (properly ſo called) belongs unto it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It doth imply, <hi>That God when he hath thus forgiven, deals with a man as no more in that particular a ſinner.</hi> Therefore <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> after his murder and adultery are waſhed away, he is as white as ſnow in reſpect of thoſe actuall ſinnes; and every true beleever repenting, is bound to beleeve, that God doth this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly and gloriouſly to him, That he is no more in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that loathſome leper and unclean perſon he was.</p>
               <p>It doth imply, <hi>That God by degrees and in his due time will cover the beleevers ſins, as from his own eyes, ſo from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers eyes.</hi> So that the guilt of conſcience, thoſe arrows of the Almighty, ſhall not alwaies ſtick in his heart. Thus as mans love to another, covers a multitude of ſinnes, he will not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, charge or upbraid the party with them; ſo doth Gods love cover the multitude of beleevers ſins committed by them, dealing with them as reconciled perſons, not upbraiding of them but beſtowing all encouraging mercies upon them; ſo that if we improve this phraſe of covering ſin no further, we ſhall ſplit on no rock, and yett he ſoul have as much comfort as it can rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally deſire.</p>

               <p n="1">1. When we dream of ſuch covering of ſinne, <hi>as that ſinne is wholly taken away</hi>; ſo that no reliques of original corruption abide in us. Thus the Papiſts, <hi>We muſt not</hi> (ſay they) <hi>ſuppoſe ſuch a covering as if ſinne were ſtill there, only God will not impute it, but it is ſuch a covering as is a blotting ſinne out.</hi> Now for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual ſinne, we grant covering to be a blotting it out; but for original ſin, in the luſts thereof, We ſay, they are ſtill in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and properly ſins, only covered, becauſe not imputed to them: for the grace of regeneration, though it cut the hair of ſinne, as <hi>Dalilah</hi> did <hi>Samſons,</hi> yet it groweth again, as long as the root is there.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We may not conceive ſinne covered in this ſenſe, <hi>as if we by our ſubſequent good actions did cover ſinne,</hi> ſo ſome have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <hi>holy works</hi> to be the garment that covers our naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

but this would be our covering, and not Gods covering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas the Pſalmiſt attributes it to God, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 85.2. Therefore that Expoſition will not hold, which ſome bring out of <hi>Austin,</hi> explaining this covering of ſinne, as <hi>Emplaſtrum tegit vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> the Plaiſter covers the ſore, by healing of it: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though healing grace accompany juſtification, yet it is not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We may not conceive it ſaid to be covered in this ſenſe, <hi>As if God when he had pardoned, did not yet ſtill retain anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the perſons ſinning, and ſo chastiſe them.</hi> Though this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be much pleaded for, yet Scripture is evident againſt it. <hi>David</hi> had ſin covered, yet God would not let the ſword depart from his houſe. Thus <hi>Job</hi> aweth himſelf againſt ſinne with this conſideration, <hi>That God would ſee it in him, and take notice of it,</hi> Job 10.14. <hi>If I ſinne, thou markeſt me</hi> (God ſeeth ſin in <hi>Job</hi>) <hi>and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity</hi>; and <hi>Cha.</hi> 14.16, 17. he ſaith, God doth watch over his ſin, and ſeal it up in a bag. Let not then the people of God delude themſelves into ſecurity, by any falſe doctrine; and what woful concluſions there are of a godly mans peace, when he fals into a groſſe ſin, I ſhall handle in another Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Neither fourthly, may we conceive of ſin covered, in a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall groſſe manner, <hi>As if there were ſomething interpoſed between Gods eyes and ſinne</hi>; as if a mans face were covered with an hat, or a candle put under a buſhell. The Antinomians ſimilitude is groſſe and carnall, <hi>Honey-comb,</hi> pag. 275. as a man looking thorow a red glaſſe, ſeeth the water all red within it, ſo God looking upon us in Chriſt, ſeeth nothing but the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and no ſin at all; for the reaſon why our ſenſes judge water red thorow a red glaſſe, is, becauſe it depends upon the fitneſſe of a <hi>medium,</hi> and that being indiſpoſed, the eye is decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but God in looking upon us, doth not depend upon any intervening thing; and indeed Gods ſeeing of ſin in this point, is not ſo much an act of his underſtanding, as of his will, decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to puniſh ſin, or not to puniſh it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that this ſimilitude doth no waies hold, for God in this matter of forgiving or puniſhing ſinne, is not to be looked upon as a natural agent, but volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. So that all theſe things rightly underſtood, we may take that

                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1.</note>The firſt is, If ſinne be in the regenerate, yet covered and not imputed, <hi>How will this stand with the omniſciency, truth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of God?</hi> His omniſciency, for he cannot but ſee ſinne if it be there: His truth, for God, muſt needs judge of things as they are; if therefore ſinne be there, he muſt judge it to be there, otherwiſe we make him like the wicked who covers ſin, he will not acknowledge it to be there: Now what truth is this, to ſay of a regenerate man, he is cleanſed and waſhed from all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and yet his evil is in him? This the learned among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts doe much urge, <hi>Pererius, Tiriuus,</hi> &amp;c. At moſt (ſaith <hi>Suarez de justificatione</hi>) it makes remiſſion of ſin to be nothing
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:65696:118"/>
but a remiſſion of the puniſhment, not of the offence or fault. The very ſame is urged by Antinomiſts. Laſtly, How doth it conſiſt with Gods holineſſe; for he muſt needs hate ſinne in whomſoever he findes it; and therefore for the Saints to have ſin in them, and yet God not to impute it to them, ſeemeth a contradiction.</p>
               <p>But to all this the anſwer is eaſie. As for Gods omniſciency, none ſay, but by that God beholds ſinne, where it is; and in that ſenſe, ſinne is not at all ſaid to be covered, for he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all in man. As for his truth, God doth judge as the thing is, for as he ſeeth ſinne, ſo he judgeth ſinne to be in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and according to that eternal rule laid down, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.32, 33<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He chaſtiſeth them with the rod, though he take not his loving kindeneſſe from them; ſo that God doth not judge things o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then they are. And as for his holineſſe, he is not only angry with their ſins, but alſo would proceed to their eternall condemnation, were it not for Chriſt, their ſurety, ſo that their ſins are puniſhed, though not in their own perſons. Neither is this a taking away of ſin only in reſpect of the puniſhment, but of the offence alſo, God being wholly reconciled with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though the corruption (which is removed by ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not juſtification) is by degrees purged away.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Objection is, <hi>How can God ſee ſinne, ſeeing they have Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and there being no ſin in that,</hi>

                  <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God muſt look upon them as in Chriſt, which is without any ſin at all?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The anſwer is, that when we ſay, Chriſts righteouſneſſe is made theirs, it is not to be underſtood ſubjectively,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> as if it were a quality inherent in them (for then indeed God could not ſee ſin in them) but relatively, he is their Mediatour, and by his obedience they are acquitted, ſo that the righteouſneſſe is in Chriſt, but by faith it becomes theirs, not formally, but as the merit for which God doth juſtifie them, and God doth account it to them as theirs; now this is no contradiction to be ſinfull in our ſelves, and yet at the ſame time acquitted by the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of another. It is true, thoſe expreſſions of making Chriſts righteouſneſſe a formall righteouſneſſe, or as others, a materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all righteouſneſſe, and thoſe diſputations, Whether Chriſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:65696:119"/>
or paſſive obedience, both or either of them be imputed to us; hath much darkned the Queſtion: whereas if we conſider of it, as a relative righteouſneſſe performed by our Surety in our ſtead, the matter will be made much clearer: yet I ſpeak not this, as if Chriſts active obedience were not made ours, as in time may be ſhewed.</p>
               <p>I come to the ſecond Obſervation out of the Text, which is,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pardon of ſin duly valued by thoſe only who inwardly feel Gods anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</note>
                  <hi>That thoſe only do eſteem pardon of ſinne as a bleſſedneſſe, who feel inwardly the anger of God for ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> here in this Pſalm, being deeply wounded with the guilt of his ſin, judgeth not his kingdom, his wealth, his conqueſt over enemies an happy thing, but pardon of ſin.</p>
               <p>Now the ground of this is, becauſe ſuch is our cuſtom (though it be our weakneſſe) to eſteem of mercies more <hi>carendo quàm habendo,</hi> by wanting of them, then having of them. The blinde man earneſtly deſireth ſight. The lame man prizeth ſound limbs. A people diſtreſſed with warre, and finding the bitterneſſe of it, commend peace. Thus it is here, a man afflicted and imbittered in his ſoul becauſe of ſin, he doth highly admire forgiveneſs, and accounts thoſe happy that walk in the ſenſe of Gods favour. Though innocency or freedom from ſin may be <hi>majus benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> a greater mercy then pardon and reparation, yet this is <hi>dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius beneficium,</hi> a more ſweet mercy to the ſenſe and feeling of him, who enjoyeth it. Hence that Chriſt and the Goſpel might be exalted, God permitted ſin to be, and the Law is on purpoſe to diſcover ſin, and aggravate it, that Chriſt and his grace may be the more welcome.</p>

If thou hadſt never been a ſinner, thy heart would not have trembled. Is not forgiveneſs making of a ſin not to be, as you have heard?

The only way for a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to make his auditors relliſh and ſavour of Chriſt and grace indeed, is to keep them in a godly ſenſe and apprehenſion of their infirmities. We are not in our firſt converſion only to have throbs and pangs after Gods grace, but alſo this hunger and thirſting after Chriſt, is to be kept up in the progreſſe of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: and therefore as thoſe Miniſters are to be blamed (if any ſuch) that do only preſſe duty, diſcover ſinne, but never ſet forth the fulneſſe of Chriſt: So they alſo are to be blamed, who only preſſe ſuch Texts as manifeſt Gods grace, but never open that iſſue and fountain of all filth that is within us.

What is ſaid of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, is alſo true of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms, <hi>Nunquam Davidis mentem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telliges, niſi prius Davidis spiritum imbiberis.</hi> You can never ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand <hi>Davids</hi> meaning, unleſſe you be poſſeſſed with <hi>Davids</hi> ſpirit. Now that you may be moved hereunto, conſider the motive in the Text, and the means to get it. The motive is bleſſedneſſe; a man is never an happy man, till his ſinnes be pardoned. What makes hell and damnation, but meerly not forgiveneſſe? thy wealth, thy greatneſſe, thy honours, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring that happineſſe to thee which remiſſion of ſins doth. Hence this is the cauſe of all other bleſſedneſſe. And obſerve, here is a great deal of difference between this place, <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſinnes are pardoned,</hi> and thoſe Texts where he is ſaid to be bleſſed that feareth alwaies, or he is ſaid to be bleſſed that walketh not in the waies of the wicked, for in the Text is

ſhewed the cauſe or fountain of bleſſedneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> remiſſion of ſinne; but in other places there is only deciphered, who they are that are bleſſed. A man that feareth is bleſſed, but his fear is not the cauſe of his bleſſedneſſe. A man that liveth godly is bleſſed, but his godlineſſe is not the cauſe of his bleſſedneſſe, but his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin makes him bleſſed in all his graces; Thou art bleſſed, not becauſe thou praieſt, heareſt, liveſt holily, but becauſe God doth forgive all thy ſins and imperfections in theſe duties. If therefore your graces, your holy duties are not the cauſe of your bleſſedneſſe, never think your outward mercies can be. The means to obtain this, is in the Text, by having no guile in the heart, that is, by not hiding our ſins, but repenting of them, and confeſſing them to God: For this (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) every one ſhall pray unto thee in an acceptable time; for this, that is, for this remiſſion, and becauſe thou waſt ſo ready to forgive, when I ſaid, I will confeſſe my ſin. Therefore ſhall every one ſeek to thee; where by the way, let none abuſe that place, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaid he would confeſſe, and God forgave it: <hi>David</hi> did but ſay it, and God pardoned it; ſo ſome have deſcanted upon it.

               </p>
               <p>For this reaſon, <hi>David</hi> praieth God would turn away his eyes, and face from him, even as the ſore eyes deſire to have the light removed, as being unable to bear it.

This Doctrine is worthy of all diligent examination, both becauſe it will be a ſtrong Antidote, to keep Gods people from ſcandalous groſs ſins, as alſo to inform how far in ſuch ſins the people of God make a breach upon their peace with God, and claim to the Covenant of Grace.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The nature of the ſin was a very groſs one, againſt the light of an Heathens conſcience, to deflour his neighbours wife.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It was a treſpaſs againſt his faithful ſervant <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> who was venturing his life to preſerve <hi>David:</hi> This was horrible ingratitude.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This aggravation God addeth, That he had many other wives; and for him, as <hi>Nathan</hi> wiſely reproved him, to go and take the poor mans lamb, who had only that, this was to become very guilty.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Here was great deliberation, and conſultation, how to cover the matter, and to make <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> the father of it. O where is <hi>Davids</hi> heart that it doth not ſmite him all this while?</p>

               <p>Eighthly, His ſin becomes more hainous, in that to colour this, he will have <hi>

               <p>Ninthly, When all this is done, <hi>David</hi> takes <hi>Bathſheba</hi> to wife, delights in her, and rejoyceth with her.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, To make his ſinne out of meaſure ſinful, after theſe horrid ſins committed thus againſt natural light, as well as ſpiritual, we finde no remorſe of conſcience, no trouble of heart, till <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet come and arouſe him.

               <p>And therefore in the ſecond place take notice, what way

God takes to break him, and how much diſpleaſure of God fell upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The degrees of <hi>Davids</hi> repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note>Firſt, <hi>He hath great terrour and trouble upon him,</hi> which he expreſſeth by the moſt exquiſite torment that is, <hi>viz. Broken bones.</hi> It was with him, as if all his bones were brayed and pounced together. Thus fearful is it to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the living God, who even to his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is a conſuming fire. As the Sunne which uſeth to dart forth reſplendent beams of luſtre, by groſſe and thick clouds is darkned and obſcured; ſo <hi>David</hi> who heretofore rejoyced in God, took comfort in his Promiſes, doth now like <hi>Dives</hi> beg for one drop of comfort, and findes a great Gulf between that and him, inſomuch that it cannot come to him, nor he to it. Now what are all <hi>Davids</hi> pleaſures, all his luſtful delights to theſe wounds of his ſoul? Hath he not bought Repentance at a dear rate? Let the godly hear this and tremble, and do no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As he found hell thus within him, <hi>So God was alſo really diſpleaſed, his ſins were uncancelled till he repented.</hi> So that Gods diſpleaſure was not only in <hi>Davids</hi> ſenſe and feeling, but in Gods heart alſo. As the earth of his own heart was like iron, in reſpect of the yeelding any fruit of comfort, ſo the Heavens were like braſſe. God had ſpoke to his ſoul to be like the mountains of <hi>Gilboa,</hi> on which no dew of his favour ſhall fall. Therefore he doth not only pray for pardon, but plenty and iteration of pardon, Multiply to pardon, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. I need par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don again and again, I need a plentiful pardon, becauſe I have ſinned many ſins in one ſin. Now <hi>David</hi> might juſtly be more ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icitous and fearfull about the pardon of theſe ſins, becauſe there was no particular Sacrifice appointed for murder and adultery, but an expectation of vengeance, either from God or man, but this muſt not be ſtretched to the <hi>Socinian</hi> errours, as before I have ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>He found in himſelf a loathſomneſſe, and defiling guilt upon his conſcience, whereby like Adam, he could runne and hide himſelf, that God might not ſee him.</hi> Hereupon he prayeth, <hi>Waſh me, Cleanſe me, Purge me.</hi> O how loathſome and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable was he in his own eyes: if <hi>Davids</hi> Righteouſneſs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65696:123"/>
a menſtruous cloth, or dung by him; what debaſing and abhorring thoughts muſt he needs have of his ſins? He look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon himſelf as the Swine wallowing in mire, and the dog licking up his vomit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>He feeleth a ſpiritual conſumption and languiſh upon him, that he cannot exerciſe any of thoſe graces that he uſed to do.</hi> Therefore he prayeth for a principal or voluntary ſpirit, that with delight and ſtrength he may do Gods will. <hi>David</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth as <hi>Samſon</hi> when his Hair was cut off, thinking to doe ſuch great exploits, as he had before, but he findes his ſtrength gone.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>He diſcovereth a world of Hypocriſie in his heart, and crieth out of that, praying for truth in the inward parts.</hi> He now (probably) fears himſelf for an Hypocrite, queſtions whether any truth of grace be in him at all; and certainly it might juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amaze and aſtoniſh him, to conſider he could do all that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs deliberately in cold bloud, without any remorſe for a long while. This might juſtly plunge <hi>David</hi> into ſuch a Chaos, that he might fear the very pillars and foundations of his ſoul were ſhaken.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>He had loſt all that boldneſſe and liberty ariſing from a good Conſcience, in declaring Gods truth, and reclaiming tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours from their evil wayes,</hi> verſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13. Some have ſaid that <hi>David</hi> in this intervall loſt the gift of Prophecie, and making of <hi>Pſalms.</hi> I cannot tell that; but certainly guilt and ſhame had ſo ſealed up his mouth, that he could not reprove others for murder, adulteries, deſtructive craft, which he himſelf was ſo foully guilty of. It was the Ancients Rule, <hi>Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid dictur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But how could <hi>David</hi> have any boldneſs here, till there was a cole of fire from the Altar to ſanctifie him? So that all theſe things duely pondered, you may ſay, this Sermon is a ſpiritual-Anatomy-Lecture, wherein <hi>Davids</hi> ſin and puniſhment hath been ſo diſſected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, that every wiſe hearer may prevent the like deſperate diſeaſe in himſelf.</p>

briefly the godly may fall into.</hi> And then more largely <hi>of their relation they ſtand unto God after the commiſſion of them, till they repent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to the former, two things are conſiderable:<note place="margin">What ſins Gods children may fall into.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The nature of the ſins they commit. And</p>
               <p n="2">2. The quality of them, whereby they may be differenced from the ſins of reprobates.</p>
               <p>For the former. There is no ſinne (except that againſt the holy Ghoſt) which a juſtified perſon, being left to himſelf, may not fall into, even ſuch ſins, that moral men, by the help of a natural conſcience only would readily abhor. Thus <hi>David</hi> with deliberation and conſent fals into adultery and murder, ſins condemned by Natures Statute-Law: You have <hi>Aaron</hi> guilty of Idolatry: <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren the Patriarchs, as much as lieth in them murdering <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and when they have caſt him away into the pit, they ſit down to eat, which implieth their wonderful ſecurity: and we reade not of their Repentance, till many years after, being awakened thereunto by <hi>Joſeph. Samſon,</hi> he was like one of the Roman Emperors, a compound of vices and virtues, inſomuch that doubt might have been made of his godlineſs, had not the Scripture put him in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of Saints. <hi>Peter,</hi> although it was a paſſion of fear that cauſed his ſinne, yet his ſinne was very dreadful, to lie, ſwear, and curſe, in the denying of Chriſt. This was ſuch a ſinne that <hi>Peter</hi> thought it not poſſible he ſhould fall into it. For firſt at the maids accuſation, by comparing of the Evangeliſts toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he doth not only baſely deny himſelf to be <hi>Peter,</hi> but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>He knew not Chriſt,</hi> yea he knew not what ſhe ſaid: an expreſſion which we uſe about a thing that we are in the higheſt manner ignorant of; and this he doth before all them that ſtood by. In the next place after a little while (which as <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donat</hi> computes, muſt be at leaſt three hours) he denieth Chriſt again: we might have thought that <hi>Peters</hi> heart might have troubled him in that ſpace, but in ſtead of repentance he aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates his crime, with an oath he denied himſelf to be <hi>Peter</hi>; Here was lying againſt his own conſcience, accompanied with perfidiouſneſs againſt Chriſt: Then the third time, a little while after, being accuſed again, he ſtill increaſed his ſin, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65696:124"/>
did not only ſwear, but curſe, that is, devote my ſelf to the horrideſt judgements that can be, if he knew Chriſt, and this he did often, as that phraſe, <hi>He began to curſe,</hi> ſeemeth to imply, and his ſin will yet riſe higher, if that curſing be referred to Chriſt, that he curſed and anathematized him, and all this while though as ſome probably think, he heard the Cock crow, yet he repents not till Chriſt looked upon him, and without queſtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would have denied him as often as the temptation was, had not Chriſt preſerved him.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given you Examples of the hainous ſins of Gods people, which are not to encourage in ſinne, but if duely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, a bridle againſt it. As he ſaid, <hi>Plus debeo Thomae, quam Petro,</hi> he was more beholding to <hi>Thomas</hi> doubting, then <hi>Peter</hi> believing, becauſe by <hi>Thomas</hi> his doubt, Chriſts Reſurrection was more confirmed: So in ſome ſenſe, we may more acknowledge Gods Wiſdome and Goodneſs in his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens fals, then in their Graces; for hereby we are to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in our ſelves at our own weakneſs, be more careful againſt ſinne; Obſerve the way they took for pardon, and admire Gods goodneſſe, who doth not utterly caſt off his prodigal children.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee there is no kinde of crime, which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, through their own neglect, may not fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And as for that other Queſtion, Whether they may not frequently commit the ſame ſins? We have examples in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for the Affirmative, onely the greater Doubt is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after a thorow and deep Humiliation they may relapſe in the ſame ſins? But although we ſcarce have any inſtances of ſuch in the Scripture, yet Gods command upon us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a brother ſeventy ſeven times offending, if he repent, may keep up the heart of ſuch a ſinner againſt deſpair, becauſe goodneſſe and love is in him as in the Ocean; in us, as in the ſtream only.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſins of Gods people in what kinde to be ranked.</note>The ſecond thing conſiderable is, <hi>What kinde of ſins theſe are?</hi> whether they may be called <hi>ſins of infirmity,</hi> though ſo atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in their nature, or raigning ſins?

doth induſtriouſly aſſert, <hi>That all the ſins which elect Believers fall into, are ſins of infirmitie.</hi> Thus he cals <hi>Davids</hi> and <hi>Peters:</hi> His main ground is, <hi>Becauſe every regenerate man hath a two-fold principle within, the fleſh and the ſpirit, both which fight one against the other: by which means they are never carried out to a full conſent and purpoſe in any ſin they commit.</hi> Hence he denieth they can be called raigning ſins, or ſins againſt conſcience, that waſte conſcience, or that are from reſolved purpoſe within. He giveth an inſtance from <hi>Jonah,</hi> and the Mariners; We know the Mariners had not any intent at firſt to throw <hi>Jonah</hi> into the Sea; again they rowed and uſed all their utmoſt endeavour to preſerve him: Laſtly, they pray to their gods, if poſſibly, they may not be neceſſitated to drown him. Now in all this, the Mariners, though they did throw him into the Sea, with their will and conſent, yet they did it very unwillingly alſo. Thus, ſaith he, <hi>Jonah,</hi> in this reſpect, is like Chriſt, or grace in the hearts of Gods people. And firſt, the people of God have no purpoſe to caſt him out. Again, they uſe their diligent care in temptations not to do it. Laſtly, they beſeech and importune God they may never fall ſo foully: Therefore if at any time they are overtaken, it is with an unwilling willingneſs. Thus he. Neither is it any marvel if he judge ſo; When <hi>Bucer</hi> thought an <hi>Elect man, ever before ever he be converted, doth not ſin with that full conſent as reprobate wicked men do, but have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny motions to the contrary.</hi> Now although <hi>Peter</hi> in his denial of Chriſt, might be thought with unwillingneſs and reluctancy to do what he did, yet it is hard to ſay, <hi>David,</hi> who ſo delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and plotted to accompliſh his wickedneſs, did it not with ſome full conſent at that time. And it may ſeem hard to call all the ſins of the godly, ſins of infirmity; Therefore others will grant them the name of raigning ſins, but with this limitation, that this is not a total raigning: ſin raigneth as a tyrant over them, not as a King; and although at ſome times, as in <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, there be no actual reſiſtance made, becauſe all <hi>the actual exerciſe of Grace</hi> is ſuſpended, yet the ſeed of God doth in time revive again, and ſo doth caſt out that uſurper: So then the concluſion is, That the groſs ſins, which ſome regenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons do commit, may be ſaid to be ſins accompliſhed with a full
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65696:125"/>
conſent and delight, and for the time, no actual reſiſtance made by the regenerate part, and ſo far may be called raigning ſins, but becauſe God hath promiſed to blow up thoſe ſparks of grace in the godly, in his due time; therefore they raign but as tyrants, and that for a while, not as Kings, which then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is, when ſins are cuſtomarily committed with an antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and conſequent conſent.</p>

Now <hi>Davids</hi> was in a more groſs ſin againſt the light of nature, whereas <hi>Sauls</hi> was againſt a poſitive command of God only, and was a ſin on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe forbidden, not from itſelf, yet God ſheweth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the one, and not to the other. Certainly, though Gods grace be the great reaſon of the difference, yet <hi>Saul</hi> ſinned with more contempt and ſlighting of God, then <hi>David</hi> did. There was a more bitter root in one then the other.</p>

It is true, we ſee <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> after their wickedneſs commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, cried out, <hi>They had ſinned,</hi> but yet it was only for temporal motives, fearing the loſs of their honours or fame, and at moſt, out of a ſlaviſh fear of Gods wrath, not from any love of him, or faith in him.</p>
               <p>The Uſe is, If <hi>David</hi> lie thus in his gore,<note place="margin">

You ſee that the ſnakes, and other poiſonous creatures, which lie lurking in the holes of ground, when the ſeaſon is cold, do yet crawl abroad under the hot Sun-beams. And ſo thoſe ſins which thou ſuppoſeſt crucified in thee, may revive upon a warm temptation. <hi>Peter</hi> could not be perſwaded he ſhould ever be plunged into ſuch foul perfidiouſneſs, he thought all the men in the world would ſooner do it then he. Now to prevent theſe ſcandals, hearken alwayes unto the motions of Gods Spirit. While the Cock croweth, do thou go out and weep bitterly; while the Angel ſtirreth the pool, do thou preſently ſtep in: and if thou art at any time overtaken, continue not in the ſin, return preſently. The Candle newly put out, if preſently blown upon, may be kindled again. The longer in the ſin, the more ſenſleſs and ſtupid thy heart will grow; and know that of <hi>Bernard</hi> to be true, <hi>Illud eſt cor durum, quod non trepidat ad nomen cordis duri,</hi> That is an hard heart, which doth not tremble at the name of an hard heart.</p>

For although</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is a neceſſity of Faith and Repentance, that ſins be at firſt pardoned, yet that they ſhould continue or abide pardoned, there is no neceſſity of Faith; and therefore none are damned for paſt ſins pardoned, upon a defect of new
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65696:126"/>
Faith and Repentance, when new ſins are committed.</hi> The School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men handle this Queſtion, and generally deny, That ſins par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned ever are imputed again, unleſs in a certain reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> as far as by-paſt ſins are virtually contained in the following ſin, as if by a new ſin a mans ingratitude is ſo great, that he becomes as guilty, as if he had all his former ſins incumbent on him. But whatſoever mens judgments are, the Scripture-expreſſions about pardon of ſin, which are, <hi>The remembring of them no more, The blotting of them out, and throwing them into the bottom of the ſea, &amp;c.</hi> do plainly evidence, That God when he pardons a ſin, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons it abſolutely, and for ever, ſo that it ſhall never live again to condemn him here or hereafter.</p>
               <p>There are two places of Scripture, that ſeem to give a check to this Doctrine. The firſt is, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24, 26. where God ſaith, <hi>If a righteous man turn away from his righteouſneſſe, and commit iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his righteouſneſſe ſhall not be mentioned, but he ſhall die in his ſin. Quid clarius?</hi> ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ith <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> What is more clear then this place? Hence this is ſtrongly inſiſted upon by Papiſts, <hi>Arminians, Lutherans,</hi> as the <hi>Achilles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to this place, theſe Anſwers are given,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Prophet ſpeaks not of a truly righteous man, but a phariſaical, bragging man, who hath a conceit of his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, without any reality at all; and ſuch a feigned righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs may quickly melt away; but this may ſeem too much forced (though learned men inſiſt on it) partly, becauſe the oppoſition is made of a righteous man to one really wicked; partly, becauſe it is ſuch a righteouſneſs, which if a man had continued in, would have ſaved him, he ſhould have lived by it. Others therefore ſay, The expreſſion is only conditional, and by ſuppoſition, if he do this, which doth only imply a <hi>poſſe,</hi> if a man be left to himſelf, not an <hi>eſſe,</hi> or that indeed he will do ſo; yea God uſeth theſe conditional comminations, as a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified means to keep a righteous man from falling. This is a good Anſwer: but there are others with whom I joyn, that ſay, The Scripture doth here conſider a man as of himſelf, and what he is in his own power, not what he is by a Covenant of Grace (which is only <hi>per accidens,</hi> and <hi>ex hypotheſi</hi>) a meer extrinſecal and accidental thing to a man. And now, ſpeak
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:65696:127"/>
of a godly man thus, we may ſay, that he may fall, and loſe the favour of God; for although in reſpect of Gods predeſtination and Covenant of Grace, he cannot, yet that is meerly external, and from without. So that the Scripture ſpeaks of a godly man, ſometimes in reſpect of his external, relative condition, as ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and federated: Thus he is made unchangeable in reſpect of his ſtate. Again, in other places it ſpeaks of him, in reſpect of his internals, and what is dwelling in him; and in this ſenſe, <hi>He that ſtands, must take heed lest he fall.</hi> And that this is the right interpretation, is plain by the oppoſition in a wicked mans eſtate; for there ſaith the Text, <hi>If the wicked leave his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and do that which is righteous, he ſhall live.</hi> Here is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Grace at all; Can any from hence infer therefore, a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man without Gods Grace, is able to turn to God? No. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places demonſtrate the neceſſity of that. So that it is plain, theſe Texts do not at all relate to any thing external and extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal to a man.</p>
               <p>The next place urged for the return of ſins pardoned, is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.32, 34. where in the Parable, The Maſter is ſaid to forgive a ſervant all his debt, but becauſe the ſame ſervant ſhewed not the like compaſſion to a fellow-ſervant, his maſter was wroth with him, and charged all the debt he had forgiven, upon him again. By which it may appear, That if we after our ſins are forgiven, do thoſe things that are very diſtaſteful to God, he will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our former ſins againſt us. But the ſcope of the Parable, which is the right key to open it, is not to ſhew, That God will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſins pardoned for new ones committed, but to manifeſt, That forgiveneſs of others is a neceſſary qualification to be forgiven by God; and that we may not believe God will forgive us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we forgive others: and this is clear from the concluſion of the Parable, <hi>ver.</hi> 35. <hi>So will not my heavenly Father forgive you, unleſſe you from your hearts forgive one another.</hi> Beſides, every paſſage in a Parable is not argumentative, but the chief inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only.

The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Divines expreſſed it well in the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> by a leper, who was ſhut out from his own houſe, ſo that although he had a right to his houſe, yet he had no claim by any law to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his houſe: So though a godly man have a right to pardon of ſin, yet he cannot claim this as due to him, as long as the guilt of ſin abideth on him. Hence that is expounded, <hi>Purge me with hyſop,</hi> as an alluſion to the leper, who in ſuch a manner was cleanſed, not that this ſtate is to be conceived a third eſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a ſtate of Juſtification and Condemnation, but a ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the benefits of the former. In which ſenſe a godly man juſtly caſt out by Church-officers for a ſin, is ſaid to have his ſins bound in Heaven. And in this reſpect <hi>Zanchy</hi> ſaith, he doth, <hi>Quodammodo excidere à gratiâ Dei,</hi> and that they are made, <hi>quaſi inimici,</hi> as it were enemies. Thus <hi>Perkins</hi> alſo, Upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of ſuch ſins, ſaith he, God turneth the effects of his grace, into the effects, <hi>cujuſ dam odii,</hi> of a kinde of hatred to their ſins, ſo that <hi>quodammodo fiunt inimici Dei.</hi> Now that the terrour of this condition may more faſten on the godly to make them cautelous againſt ſuch fals, let us conſider what particulars this general doth include.</p>
               <p>And firſt it ſuppoſeth a preſent unfitneſs for the Kingdom of Heaven, or any gracious Priviledge. There is no aptitude or preparation in a godly man ſo lapſed, for comfort or ſalvation: but like the unclean man is to ſtand aloof off from all this. Now how woful is this to conſider, that ſuch a man, who had Gods gracious Scepter alwayes held out, to bid him come into his preſence, muſt now finde the doors and gates of mercy for a ſeaſon ſhut upon him! Now the Maſter of the feaſt may ſay to him, <hi>How cameſt thou in here without a wedding Garment?</hi> When <hi>David</hi> ſate not according to his cuſtom at the Kings Table, it
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65696:128"/>
was excuſed, he had uncleanneſs upon him. Alas, it is a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mans aggravation of this guilt, why doth he not apply the Promiſes as formerly? Why is he not had into the Spouſes Wine-cellar? Alas uncleanneſs is upon him. As Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Mary, Touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended</hi>; we may apply otherwiſe, the Promiſe of Grace, Chriſt ſaith to thee, Touch me not, lay not hold upon me, for thou art not yet riſen out of thy filth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As there is no aptitude for gracious priviledges, <hi>So alſo</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>God doth now change all his dealings and adminiſtrations towards them.</hi> Thoſe effects of love, delight, comfort, aſſurance and ſweetneſs they had, are now turned into the bitter effects of wrath, diſpleaſure, trouble and grief of ſoul, ſad pangs and convulſions of conſcience, ſo that they have no peace with God nor themſelves. Thus their ſins ſwallow them up like <hi>Jonahs</hi> Whale, and they are, as it were, in the bottome of hell. God is really offended and diſpleaſed with them, hereupon their conſcience doth truly and ſadly accuſe them: And all this being ſet home by Gods Spirit convincing of them of ſin in all the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of it, O the groans and agonies their ſouls muſt needs conflict with! This <hi>David</hi> doth evidently teach us in what he felt upon him. Hearken then to <hi>Davids</hi> cryings and groanings, and take you heed how you abuſe the Grace of God, either doctrinally or practically to a ſecure committing of groſs ſinne. Be ſure (if ye belong to God) your ſinne will finde you out; and no Doctrine of free Grace, will be Altar or Sanctuary ſafe enough for you to hide your ſelves in. God who was the God of all conſolation, is now the God of all ſorrow and fear. Thou thinkeſt on him, and thy meditations are not ſweet but trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Now its not the Spirit of God, that ſeals and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, but of Conviction and Humiliation. Now Chriſts bloud, which thou deſpiſedſt, doth ſpeak bitter things againſt thee. A drop of Gods anger fals into the conſcience of a godly man thus awakened, like a drop of ſcalding lead into a mans eye. O what comfort do thoſe pleaſures, thoſe luſts now afford him? Now he may ſay of them, as ſhe of her husband, <hi>Thou art a bloudy husband.</hi>

Though there be a Well of Salvation, yet thou haſt no bucket to draw out of it. As long as a godly mans heart ſtands thus averſe from God, and hath a purpoſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſin, all the Promiſes are like a fountain ſealed up, and a Garden encloſed. He is in a worſe condition, then the wounded man in the way to <hi>Jericho,</hi> for not only the Prieſt and the Levite (the Moral Law) paſs by him, but even the good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> Chriſt and the Promiſes pour no oil into his wounds. All the while he applieth comforts to his ſoul, and ſupports himſelf with hopes of Gods favour, he liveth upon ſpiritual robbery. And he can with no more truth (if we ſpeak of the actual uſe and application) ſay of the Promiſes, then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of the world, and the glorious things thereof, <hi>All theſe are mine.</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. <hi>By this they incur the guilt of eternal damnation.</hi> There is a two-fold guilt, as ſome diſtinguiſh, one <hi>potential</hi> (which by others is <hi>Reatus ſimplex,</hi> a <hi>ſimple guilt</hi>) another <hi>actual</hi> (which by others is <hi>Reatus redundans in perſonam,</hi> a guilt falling upon the perſon. Now it is upon all ſides agreed, That by thoſe ſins he deſerveth eternal damnation. And therefore a godly man ſo offending, ought to bewail the forfeiture he hath made. If God ſhould deal with him according to that ſtrict rule, <hi>Curſed be every one that abideth not in all the things that the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi>; where ſhould he appear? But may we not ſay, they have an actual guilt obliging them to eternal wrath, not abſolutely, but conditionally, till they take the means appointed by God for their pardon? I ſee not but in a ſound ſenſe this may be ſaid, for God doth not will to them ſalvation, while they abide in that ſtate, though at that time he wils to give them ſuch effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Grace, that thereby they ſhall recover, and ſo remove that gulf which is between them and God. So that at the ſame time God doth will to give them grace to repent and recover, and yet he doth not will ſalvation to them, till they do recover. Here is
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:65696:129"/>
no contrariety in Gods will, becauſe though this be about the ſame perſon, yet not in the ſame reſpects: for Gods will not to give ſalvation while in ſuch an eſtate, and to give Repentance that he may come out of that eſtate, do no wayes oppoſe one another; and becauſe of this later mercy, it is, that we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſay, <hi>There is no condemnation to thoſe that are in Chriſt Jesus.</hi> Their ſins are never imputed to them for their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but there is a conditional obliging of them, till they ſue out their pardon. So that it is here, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did with <hi>Abiathar</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 Kin. 2.26. <hi>Thou art</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>worthy of death, but I will not at this time put thee to death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Becauſe of this guilt and demerit of ſin, it is, that our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> do ſay, That if ſuch an one, <hi>David</hi> (for example) <hi>ſhould die before theſe ſins be repented of, he would be damned</hi>; For if you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a juſtified perſon to perſevere alwayes in groſs and vile ſins without reformation, you may as well ſuppoſe him to be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Hence there is, as ſome obſerve, a two-fold impoſſibility, There is an impoſſibility that <hi>David</hi> elected and juſtified ſhould be damned; There is alſo an impoſſibility, that <hi>David</hi> a murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and an adulterer ſhould without Repentance be ſaved; but God by his powerful grace will untie this knot by a certain and infallible recovery out of his ſins, for that is a perpetual and ſure rule, <hi>Election hath obtained,</hi> Rom. 11. otherwiſe, ſpeak of <hi>David</hi> as in that ſtate before Repentance, we may ſay, if he had died in it, he would have been damned. Thus <hi>Beza, Twiſs,</hi> &amp;c. Yet Gods grace which was ſo potent at the firſt to raiſe out of the grave of ſin how much rather if life be in us, will it quicken us to turn unto God?</p>
               <p n="6">6. From hence further it ariſeth, <hi>That he needeth a particular</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 
                  <hi>Juſtification in reſpect of that guilt, which is to be done away.</hi> Some Orthodox and learned Writers, <hi>Abbot</hi> and others, diſtinguiſh of a two-fold Juſtification, one univerſal, whereby a man is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely received into the grace and favour of God, becoming his Son. A ſecond is particular, whereby ſins are remitted to them that are already made the children of God, without which, they would fall from their firſt benefit of ſonſhip, The one is called, <hi>Justificatio ſimplicitèr.</hi> The other, <hi>Secundùm quid:</hi> and this particular Juſtification they make to be often repeated. Thus
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:65696:130"/>
                  <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> Rom. 3. <hi>Lapſis poſt Juſtificationem repetitâ denuò Juſtificatione per fidem condonari.</hi> Thus <hi>Bucer, Defenſio, pag.</hi> 85. acknowledgeth an iteration of Juſtification after we repent, and ariſe from more grievous ſins. Others call it not a particular Juſtification, but an application of that univerſal Juſtification. And certainly Juſtification doth denote the ſtate of a man, but ſeeing the Remiſſion of ſuch ſins doth not put them into a new eſtate (for they never fell from that) we cannot ſo properly call it Juſtification, and I know not any place where the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture cals it ſo, and it would be very hard to ſay, That Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is re-iterated as often as ſin is pardoned. Though there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there may be ſome difference in the words, yet the matter it ſelf is clear, <hi>viz.</hi> There is a neceſſity of the removing of this guilt, that ſo the perſon offending may be brought into Gods favour again.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 7. Seeing all this is true, then it followeth, <hi>That ſuch a man ſo offending muſt renew an act of Faith and Repentance.</hi> So that the former acts of faith and godly ſorrow, will not diſcharge or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit from the new ſins committed. Therefore laſtly, it is a moſt dangerous errour in practice, to hold, That after a known ſinne committed, the firſt thing a believer is to do, before Repentance or Humiliation, is to believe that that ſin is already pardoned. Thus a late Writer, <hi>Cornwell</hi> in a Treatiſe called <hi>Goſpel-repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> wherein he labours to prove, That a believer entred into the Covenant of Grace, upon the commiſſion of an actual known ſin, ought to believe the actual pardon of that ſin, before he actually repent of the ſame. Now although this is to be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when we handle Faith and Repentance, yet thus much we may ſay, That this Doctrine muſt needs be very unſound; for firſt, There is no ſin actually pardoned before Repentance, as at large I have ſhewed; and no ſin is pardoned before it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as in the next Queſtion is to be ſhewed. So that it would be abominable preſumption, yea and falſhood to believe ſuch a thing. Hence ſuch a perſwaſion as this, God hath or will pardon my ſins, can bring no comfort or peace to our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence till we repent; for a Scripture perſwaſion is, That God enabling me to repent, and to uſe the means, will vouchſafe pardon, and in this only can I have comfort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beſides, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:65696:130"/>
makes the laſt work of Faith, the firſt; for upon a known ſin committed, Faith is to be exerciſed, firſt, in the threatnings of God, to believe thoſe due to him. In the next place, Faith is to relie upon Chriſt for pardon, that he may receive remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins; for as <hi>Rivet</hi> and <hi>Perkins</hi> urge well, There is no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don offered on Gods part, or received on mans, till he do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and then when theſe acts are done, God doth many times incline the ſoul to believe the ſin is pardoned. But the pardon of ſin muſt be received by a direct act of Faith, before we can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it is pardoned by a reflex. But this is more largely to be confuted.</p>
               <p>Now the Objection may be,<note place="margin">Why the guilt of new groſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt, <hi>That Juſtification is an act of God meerly, it is not our act.</hi> We are ſaid to be juſtified, and God he doth juſtifie. Now <hi>Opus Dei non poteſt irritum fieri per opus hominis,</hi> Thoſe acts of God which he doth, we cannot make void, but he ordereth them for their time and continuance, as he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider, <hi>That ſin doth not expel the Grace of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, efficiently, or phyſically,</hi> as darkneſs doth light, or cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs heat, but <hi>meritoriouſly</hi> by way of deſert. Now God doth not with us according to our deſert; when he entered into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace with us, he ſo appointed it, that no ſin ſhould break the league of friendſhip, whereas if he had pleaſed he might ſo have appointed it, that the leaſt ſin ſhould have diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this bond; and if ſin did expel the Grace of Juſtification ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, the leaſt ſin would have done it. But now, if it was wholly at Gods pleaſure to make this ſtate diſſoluble or indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble; and if ſo, then that neither great ſins, or leſs ſhould break it; and this makes us to wonder, how <hi>David</hi> in his adultery and murder could be juſtified, becauſe we prepoſſeſs our ſelves with this principle, That ſin doth by a natural neceſſity expel the grace of God, whereas many Schoolmen are bold to determine, That <hi>de potentiâ abſolutâ,</hi> God might pardon ſin, though there were no Repentance, or infuſed grace at all in a man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That a particular, partial guilt, is not the immediate</hi>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:65696:131"/>
                  <hi>oppoſition to univerſal Juſtification of the perſon, unleſſe it were to abide in him.</hi> Juſtification of a mans perſon will keep him from being actually condemned, though not from the guilt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. As a guilty perſon, thrown into priſon, is kept from the uſe of his houſe, goods, and all comforts, but he is not depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of them, till he be actually condemned: ſo a believer falling into groſs ſins, is deprived of the uſe of all ſpiritual comforts, but not caſt out of the right of them, becauſe he ſhall never actually be condemned.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Three things laid down by way of conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note>Having premiſed this, I come to lay down the grounds, that ſins are not pardoned to a juſtified perſon, before they be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and repented of, and therefore it is dangerous preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to believe ſuch a thing.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, That God when he pardons <hi>ſins paſt</hi> to thoſe that repent, <hi>He forgiveth all them together.</hi> God doth not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſome, and leave out others. Thus the gracious Promiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. of remembring our iniquities no more, and blotting them all out, is to be thus farre univerſally interpreted, that all thoſe ſins which then are found in the lives of believing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſhall be removed and taken away. All paſt ſins are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven together. And the ground of this Truth is two-fold, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe the ſame Grace and love of God which moveth him to blot out one, will alſo ſtirre him up for the other. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if it were not ſo, God would have love to a man as his friend, and hatred to him as an enemy, at the ſame time; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Remiſſion is Reconciliation with God, and therefore every obſtacle muſt be removed, partly this ariſeth from the nature of Repentance, for where that is truly for one ſin, it is alſo for all other ſins, and then the guilt of all muſt needs be taken away.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, We muſt grant, <hi>That to ſpeak properly, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing future to God, and thoſe things that are not yet to us, they are preſent to him</hi>; For he calleth things that are not, as if they were;
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65696:132"/>
but although it be thus with God, yet we are not to conceive of things any other wayes, then according to that manner of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation, whereby things decreed from Eternity are produced to act in time; and certainly, as ſins future to us are preſent to him, ſo Repentance alſo future to us is preſent to him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods Decree for Remiſſion, was alſo for Repentance, and both are preſent to him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This muſt be granted, <hi>That although future ſins are</hi>

                  <hi>not pardoned, before committed, yet by the Covenant of Grace, God will ſo preſerve, that as ſins are committed, ſo Grace will be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that no ſin ſhall actually condemn us.</hi> And this may be the virtual Remiſſion of future ſins, which ſome ſpeak of. So that although a juſtified perſon may not believe that his ſins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, which he ſhall commit, yet he may believe that God will keep him by his power through faith to ſalvation, and that if he fall in ſin, God will renew Repentance in his ſoul; and our peace of conſcience doth not ſimply ariſe from hence, That God will pardon our ſins, but that he will ſo preſerve us from evil, and lead us into every good duty, that ſo pardon may be vouchſafed unto us.</p>
               <p>Theſe things explained, I come to lay down the Arguments,<note place="margin">The Queſtion held negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon theſe grounds.</note> 
                  <hi>Why none ſhould preſume, that becauſe of his Juſtification, all future ſins not committed, or preſent ſins not repented of, are forgiven unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt ground is from thoſe places which <hi>preſume and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily</hi>

                  <hi>ſuppoſe ſinne to be committed, before it is pardoned.</hi> One place is brought by ſome learned men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. Whom God hath ſet forth a Propitiation, to declare his Righteouſneſs for the Remiſſion of ſins that are paſt. Here (ſay they) Remiſſion of ſins through Chriſts bloud, is reſtrained to ſins paſt; and upon this ſome argue, Therefore future ſins are not remitted. Thus, as I take it, argue <hi>Peter Martyr, Hiperius, Domnam</hi>; but it is more probable, that by ſins paſt are meant thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted before Chriſt came into the world.

                  </gap>, in <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30. Therefore I leave this, and urge one or two places more, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 2.1. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father.</hi> Here we ſee is interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ſin, and a way for Remiſſion; but how? upon a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſin is, <hi>If any man.</hi> Ezek. 18.22. ſpeaking of a wicked man that turneth to God, and now ſhall ſurely live, he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it thus, <hi>All his tranſgreſſions that he hath committed ſhall not be mentioned to him.</hi> Obſerve, All that he hath committed, not all that he ſhall commit.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond ſort of Arguments, is from <hi>the expreſſions Gods word uſeth about Pardon</hi>; All which do ſuppoſe, That ſinne goeth before, and that God doth not antidate his Pardon. Such as theſe are, <hi>Remember not iniquity.</hi> Now although this be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unto God improperly, yet the very ſenſe of the word ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, That ſins were precedent, and how God by his grace will remember them no more. So the phraſe to blot out, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth ſin was already regiſtred in Gods book. Men do not uſe to forgive Debts before they be. Throwing them into the ſea, what doth this imply? but that ſins did appear before, and that in a terrible threatning manner. <hi>Covering of ſin,</hi> How can that be underſtood, if ſin be not with ſome loathſomnes? Thus we might inſtance in all the expreſſions uſed by Scripture to repreſent Pardon.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, This truth may be proved <hi>from the neceſſary qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations required in thoſe that have Pardon,</hi> which cannot be unleſs a man have already committed the ſin, as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>If we confeſſe our ſins, he is faithful to pardon.</hi> Now confeſſion is alwayes of a thing already extant. How abſurd would it be, for a man to go and confeſs the ſins he will commit? This would rather be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence then humiliation; look over all the confeſſions made by
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65696:133"/>
the people of God for themſelves, or in the behalf of others, as <hi>Davids, Ezrahs, Nehemiahs, Daniels,</hi> and you ſhall obſerve them all limited to ſins that have been done, never extended to what they ſhall commit. Thus in the old Teſtament, when any had ſinned, they offered ſacrifices. There was no ſacrifice appointed for a future ſin, but only for that which was already committed. Thus to pardon is required <hi>forſaking of a mans ſin,</hi> Prov. 28.13. Now how can a man be ſaid to forſake that which is not, to leave that which is future? eſpecially, as you have heard, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is commanded as the way wherein only pardon may be had, now how can repentance be about that which is to come? Can a man repent of any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hing but what is paſt? The two Greek words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to be wiſe and underſtand after the fact is done, and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>reditus,</hi> a turning again to thoſe whom we have offended, make it as clear as the Sun, that there is no pardon of ſin before committed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>There is no promiſe in all the word of God, made for</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                  <hi>the pardon of a ſin before it be committed and repented of.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Word of God give no ſuch encouragement, what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is it to make a faith, that all ſins are pardoned, the Goſpel-faith? for grant that ſuch a thing were true, and to be beleeved, <hi>viz. That all ſins are pardoned,</hi> yet that could not be the Goſpel-faith, for the Goſpel-faith is juſtifying faith: now the object of juſtifying faith, is not <hi>ens complexum,</hi> a propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuch as this is, All my ſins are pardoned; but <hi>ens incomplexum,</hi> a ſingle object, which is Chriſt himſelf, received and applied by faith, I am not juſtified by beleeving my ſins are pardoned, but by relying upon Chriſt for pardon; But this by the way. The ſtrength of the Argument lieth in this, God hath made no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for the pardon of a ſin before it be committed and repented of. Therefore none may either beleeve or claim ſuch a thing. The grand charter or priviledge for pardon, as it is laid down in the Covenant of Grace, is contained in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. which is alſo repeated, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.12. Now this Covenant of Grace, as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth pardon of ſin, ſo alſo a new heart, and actual exerciſe of grace, ſo that they ſhall walk in all Gods waies. Now the way wherein pardon is to be had, is repentance and faith. We muſt not therefore conceive of the Covenant of Grace, as promiſing
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65696:134"/>
pardon and forgiveneſs, without any qualification in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: this would contradict other places of Scripture. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Covenant of Grace ſome things are promiſed abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, ſuppoſing nothing to go before, ſuch are regeneration, the working of faith in us, giving his holy Spirit to us, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt. 2. There are many priviledges in the Covenant of Grace, and thoſe are given, where God hath wrought ſome former effects of his grace, and ſuppoſe them to be: ſuch are Juſtification, pardon of ſin, increaſe in grace, Glorification, all theſe things are promiſed in the Covenant of Grace, but made good where there are the former effects of Gods grace wrought in them. We do not theref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re ſay, God doth not pardon ſin, unleſs repentance go before, as if God needed repentance, as if he could not do it without repentance, as if repentance made God the better, or made him amends. Theſe are idle calumnies caſt upon this Doctrine in ſome Pamphlets. But only God hath appointed one effect of his grace before another in order, and he will not vouchſafe one before he hath wrought the other. As for inſtance, God hath appointed no unclean thing ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of heaven, God will not give glory where he hath not given grace. If one ſhould tragically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim upon this, This is to make God need our graces, This is to make grace meritorious with God, This is to be a Papiſt, a Formaliſt, to make men reſt in themſelves; you would preſently judge this a vain, weak cavill: No leſs is it, when we are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thus, for holding God will not forgive ſin but to thoſe that believe and repent. It is not for any worth in what we do, but becauſe God will have an order and a method in his graces, Juſtification where Repentance is, Glorification where Holineſs is.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, If a man may believe his ſins are pardoned, before they be committed, and ſo before repented of, <hi>then he may have full joy and unſpeakable boaſting in God, while he lieth wallowing in the midſt of ſins.</hi> The reaſon of the conſequence is this, By ſuch an act of faith, we have peace with God, and we glory in him. This floweth, as a proper effect of faith, though it do not alway follow, yet it may follow, and happily it is our weakneſs,

The Adverſary ſeeth the neceſſity of this conſequent, and therefore is not afraid to ſay, <hi>That a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied perſon, even when ſin is moſt prevalent, and the heart moſt har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, yet then can glory in Jeſus Chriſt, with a large heart, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth into thanksgivings.</hi> Cornwel <hi>of Goſpel-Repentance,</hi> pag. 125. How contrary is this to <hi>Davids</hi> experience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. who, while he humbled not himſelf for his ſin, found nothing but terrour and trouble in his own ſoul? And certainly this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine muſt be very diſtaſtfull to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>very gracious heart, which ſhall make faith and aſſurance in the glorious effects of it, ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably concording (as it were) with great and grievous ſins. And let the Adverſary ſhew ſuch an inſtance in all Scripture. For as for his example in <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. who found himſelf cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated unto ſin, doing the things he would not, yet giving thanks to God through Jeſus Chriſt: this is clean contrary to him, for <hi>Paul</hi> did greatly humble himſelf, and was deeply ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this tyranny of ſin, which made him cry out, <hi>O miſerable man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of ſin.</hi> So that we cannot with any colour call him an hardened ſinner, <hi>Somni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um narrare vigilantis eſt,</hi> ſaid <hi>Seneca</hi>; and to complain of ſin, eſpecially in the firſt motions and ſuggeſtions of it, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, argues a tender life of grace in him. No leſs abſurd is it, to bring <hi>Habakkuk</hi> to patrocinate this great errour, for although he ſaid, <hi>He would rejoyce in God, and glory in his ſalvation,</hi> Hab. 3.8, 9. in the midſt of Gods judgements upon the publike: yet this doth not ſuppoſe any perſonal grievous ſins he was fallen into.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, If ſins be pardoned thus before committed and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> of, then <hi>it would be in vain to pray for forgiveneſs of ſin, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is already paſt.</hi> This Argument (as before was ſaid) <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus</hi> urged againſt <hi>Piſcator,</hi> explaining that Petition [<hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our ſins</hi>] for the ſenſe and aſſurance of it only in our hearts. It is true, we may pray for a thing that is paſt, thus far, for the continuance of it, but not for the thing it ſelf. Although there can hardly be an inſtance in all Scripture given of ſuch a Petition. We do not reade of any prayer in Scripture that God
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:65696:135"/>
would elect us, and predeſtinate us, yet that might admit of the ſame interpretation which they give for pardon of ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> To make us more aſſured and perſwaded of it in our own hearts. Hence when God ſpeaks of pardon of ſins, he uſeth many times the future tenſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. <hi>I will forgive their iniquities,</hi> which if pardoned before, would be very difficult to ſay; even as hard, as if God ſhould ſay, I will predeſtinate and elect ſuch men. It is indeed often ſaid, That when we pray for pardon of ſin, we pray for the ſenſe and feeling of it; but let ſuch that interpret ſo, give any parallel place for ſuch a ſenſe, yet we deny not (as before hath been ſaid) but reductively this may be included in that Petition.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, If a mans future ſins be already pardoned in a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified man, <hi>then in a reprobate man, all his future ſins are actually condemned.</hi> The conſequence is firm upon that rule, <hi>Eadem est ratio contrariorum,</hi> there is the ſame reaſon of contraries. Therefore if a mans future ſins be pardoned before they be committed, then a reprobate mans ſins ſhall be puniſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be. Now how contrary is this to Gods diſpenſation revealed in the Scripture? Where can we finde any one man puniſhed for a future ſin? Were not all the ſins men are affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for in Gods Word, becauſe they had done them, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were to do them? Indeed the Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. ſometimes makes the deſires and luſts of the ſoul after ſin, to be the ſin it ſelf, but that is becauſe they are the proxime and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate cauſe of ſuch a ſin; but we are now ſpeaking of future ſins, that it may be as yet have no preparation at all for them in any cauſe.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>That God pardons ſins future,</hi> by the ſame we can prove, <hi>it is becauſe of repentance future.</hi> So that ſtill no ſin will be forgiven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance. For ſuppoſe that were a true rule to ſtand upon, Gods internal will to pardon is an immanent act, and therefore from all eternity, will it not as well follow, Gods internal will to give repentance, is an immanent act, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore repentance is from all eternity. If another be a true rule, That God hath given us all pardon from eternity, only we have the ſenſe of it, and manifeſtation in our own ſouls; may
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:65696:135"/>
we not then ſay, that we had the grace of repentance from all eternity, but it is declarative in time in our own ſouls? For although juſtification be Gods act, and repentance ours, yet we are paſſive in the infuſion of this, as well as juſtification. I ſpeak not of repentance as an act (which cannot ſo properly be ſaid to be infuſed) but of the frame of the ſoul. If a third rule ſhould be true, That therefore ſins are pardoned becauſe the Covenant of Grace ſaith, it will pardon all; Doth not this hold alſo for repentance, ſeeing in the Covenant God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to give a repenting heart? Laſtly, If God may be thought changeable, becauſe now he pardons, and once he did not; will it not as well hold, becauſe he now gives grace to ſuch a man to repent, and once he did not?</p>
               <p>To conclude therefore, it followeth with an equal neceſſity, That if future ſins are forgiven before they be committed, That God alſo did accept of future repentance before it was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or elſe if repentance be not received by God, till actually performed; ſo neither is ſin forgiven, till actually committed and repented of.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us, <hi>That we make not any Doctrine about grace in the genious and natural conſequence of it, to encourage or harden to ſin.</hi> If the grace of God which hath appeared to teach thee to deny all ungodly luſts, make thee love them the more; If becauſe you are under grace, ſin hath therefore dominion over you; If there be goodneſs with the Lord, and therefore you do not fear him: then know all things work contrary to their nature, and Scripture-directions. All Goſpel-grace is a cleanſing, purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, refining property; it is fire to get out the droſs; it is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to waſh away the filth; it is oyl to mollifie the wounds of the ſoul; it is wine to make the heart glad, and rejoyce in God.

But what ſin is not poſſible (except that againſt the holy Ghoſt) even to a regenerate man? Take heed then, leſt thou love the Goſpel, becauſe it hath alwaies glad tidings, and thou canſt not abide the precepts or threatnings, becauſe they ſpeak hard things to thee. <hi>There may be a carnal Goſpeller, as well as a Popiſh Legalist.</hi>

               <p>THe Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in this exhortatory diſcourſe of his to the Jews, deals like a wiſe Phyſitian:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Diſcovering the danger of the diſeaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Applying an effectual remedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The diſeaſe is that hainous ſin the Jews were guilty of, in kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Chriſt, the Prince of life. Which ſin is aggravated by a threefold antitheſis:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They delivered up, and denied Chriſt in the preſence of Pilate, when he would have acquitted him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They denied him, though he was an holy and juſt One.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>They deſired a murtherer to be releaſed rather then him.</hi> This is their ſin.</p>
               <p>In the next place, you have the remedy preſcribed in two words, <hi>Repent and be converted. Repent,</hi> that denotes a <hi>change in the heart:</hi> and <hi>to be converted,</hi> an <hi>alteration in the outward converſation,</hi>

                  </gap>, which is to be underſtood reciprocally, Turn your ſelves, or be turned. This exhortation doth not ſuppoſe free-will in us, it only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noteth our <hi>duty,</hi> not our <hi>ability.</hi> Neither is <hi>Grotius</hi> his aſſertion better then <hi>Semipelagianiſme,</hi> when he compareth the will of a man to the <hi>mother,</hi> and grace to the <hi>father,</hi> ſo that as children are named after the father, and not the mother: thus good actions are denominated from grace, not free-will: for in our converſion free-will is neither a totall or partiall cauſe preope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or cooperant, but the paſſive ſubject recipient of that <hi>Vim gratiae vorticordiam,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> called it, the <hi>heart-changing</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of grace. This duty of repentance is urged from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable conſequent. <hi>Piſcator</hi> cals it <hi>effectu utili,</hi> the effect of converſion, which is, that your ſins may be blotted out. It is not an inference of cauſality, but of conſequence. <hi>Blotting out,</hi> is (as you heard) from merchants that expunge their debts, or the Scribe that raceth out thoſe letters which ought not to be in the paper, or the Painter that defaceth thoſe lineaments, which ſhould not be in the Picture.</p>
               <p>In the next place, you have the time, when theſe ſins ſhall be blotted out (that is) when the times of refreſhing ſhall come, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, is uſed <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.15. Some do not underſtand this, nor that expreſſion, <hi>The times of reſtitution of all things, verſ.</hi> 21. of the day of judgement, but of that preſervation the elect ſhould have, when the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be. Hence it is, that they expound the day of the Lord ſo much ſpoken of in <hi>Peter,</hi> and other places, which is ſaid to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the beleevers, of that time when God came to deſtroy <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but there is no cogent reaſon to go from the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved interpretation, which maketh the <hi>day of judgement</hi> to be the times of refreſhing to the godly, for ſo indeed it is, becauſe then they are eaſed from all thoſe troubles and oppreſſions they lay under in this world. Hence our Saviour cals it, <hi>The day of our redemption,</hi> upon the coming whereof they are to lift up their heads.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:65696:137"/>The Obſervation is,</p>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>The Scripture not only in this priviledge of remiſſion of our ſin,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <hi>but in others alſo, makes the complement and fulneſs of them to be at the day of judgement.</hi> Redemption is the <hi>totall ſumme,</hi> as it were, of all our mercies, and we are partakers of it in this life, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. Yet the Scripture cals the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when we ſhall riſe out of our graves in a peculiar and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent manner, the day of redemption, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.30. becauſe at that day, will be the utmoſt and laſt effects of our redemption. Adoption, that alſo is a priviledge we receive in this life; yea a learned man (<hi>Forbes</hi> in his book where he hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the order of Gods graces) makes adoption (as I take it) to be the firſt, and to go before juſtification, yet the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. calleth the laſt day, the day of adoption. Hence 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. the Apoſtle, though he ſaith, <hi>We are now the ſons of God,</hi> yet he ſaith it doth not appear what we ſhall be, becauſe the glory God at the laſt day will put upon us, is ſo farre tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent and ſuperlative to what now we are. Thus <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.28. the laſt day is alſo called the day of regeneration unto the people of God, yet in this life they partake of that grace, but becauſe then is the full perfection and manifeſtation of it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture cals it, the day of regeneration. Even as the Apoſtle, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.33<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> applieth that paſſage of the Pſalm to Chriſts reſurrection, <hi>This day have I begotten thee,</hi> becauſe then was ſuch a ſolemn and publique declaration, that he was the Son of God. No marvel then, if the Scripture do alſo call the day of judgement a time, when ſins ſhall be blotted out, becauſe then is the publique abſolution of the godly; and according to phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65696:137"/>
motions receive their names from the term to which they tend.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Howſoever Juſtification be ſaid to conſiſt in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, yet there is a great difference between the one and the other; for Juſtification beſides the pardon of ſin doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note a ſtate that the ſubject is put into, <hi>viz. A ſtate of favour,</hi> being reconciled with God. Hence it is, that this ſtate cannot be reiterated often, no more then a wife after that firſt entrance into the relation is frequently made a wife. In this ſenſe, the Scripture alwaies ſpeaks of it, as connoting a ſtate or condition the ſubject is put into, as well as a peculiar priviledge vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to ſuch. It is true, There are indeed learned men, who think Juſtification may be reiterated, as you heard, <hi>Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> and <hi>Bucer.</hi> Others call it a continued action, as conſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But although there is a continuance of Juſtification, and the godly are preſerved in that eſtate, yet we cannot ſay, God doth renew Juſtification daily, as he doth pardon of ſin. There are ſome that think the Scripture gives a ground for a ſecond Juſtification, or the continuing and encreaſing of it, and bring thoſe places, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6, 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.11. The learned and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Interpreter <hi>Ludovicus de Dieu,</hi> in <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. of the <hi>Romans, verſ.</hi> 4. largely pleadeth for a two-fold Juſtification; The firſt he makes to be the imputing of Chriſts righteouſneſs to us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by faith, which is altogether perfect, and is the cauſe of pardon of ſins: The ſecond he makes an effect of the former, whereby through the grace of God regenerating, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable unto that love in part, and are day by day more and more juſtified, and ſhall be fully ſo when perfection comes: of which Juſtification he ſaith theſe texts ſpeak, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.21, 24. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.37. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.32. This two-fold Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation he makes to differ <hi>toto coelo</hi> from the Papiſts, whoſe firſt is founded upon the merit of congruity, the ſecond upon the merit of condignity. But the diſcuſſing of this will be more proper in the other part, <hi>viz.</hi> of imputed righteouſneſs. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſeemeth to hold Juſtification a frequent and continued act, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>contra Julianum, cap.</hi> 8. <hi>When we are heard in that prayer [For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our ſins] we need</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſuch a remiſſion daily, what progreſs ſoever we have made in our ſecond Juſtification.</hi> He ſpeaks
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65696:138"/>
alſo of a Juſtification <hi>hujus vitae,</hi> which he cals <hi>minorem</hi> the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer; and another <hi>plenam</hi> and <hi>perfectam,</hi> full and perfect, which belongs to the ſtate of glory, <hi>Tract.</hi> 4. <hi>in Joannem lib. de ſpiritu &amp; lit. cap. ultim.</hi> But the more exact handling of this will be in the place above-mentioned. It ſeemeth more conſonant to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, if we ſay, That Juſtification is a ſtate we were once put into, which is not repeated over and over, as often as ſin is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given; neither can it admit of increaſe or decreaſe, ſo that a man ſhould be more or leſs juſtified, for even <hi>David</hi> while he was in that ſtate of ſuſpenſion, was not leſs juſtified, though the effects of Juſtification were leſs upon him. It is true, in ſome ſenſe learned men ſay, Juſtification may increaſe, <hi>viz. extenſivè,</hi> not <hi>intenſivè,</hi> as they expreſs it, by way of extenſion, when more ſins are pardoned, not intenſively in its own nature. Even as the ſoul of a man in its information of the body, admits of no increaſe intenſively, but it doth extenſively, the more the parts of the body grow, the further doth its information extend. But of theſe things more in their proper place.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>Howſoever an abſolution ſhall be compleated at the day of judgement, yet our justification ſhall not abide in ſuch a way, as it is in this life.</hi> Now our Juſtification is by pardon of ſin, and a righteouſneſs without us imputed to us, which is inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally applied by faith, but this way ſhall then ceaſe; for having perfect righteouſneſs inherent in our ſelves, we ſhall need no covering. It is true, the glory and honour of all this will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound upon Chriſt, and he ſhall not be the leſs glorified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath then brought us to the full end of all his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. I know ſome may doubt whether any righteouſneſs, but that which is infinite can pleaſe God, and therefore as ſome think the Angels were accepted of God through Chriſt, though perfect: ſo it may of the Saints in heaven; but I ſee no ground for this. This ſeemeth to be undoubted, That the way of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by faith in Chriſt, ariſeth becauſe of our imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſinfulneſs remaining in us, and therefore is <hi>juſtificatio viae,</hi> not <hi>patriae,</hi> a juſtification of us in our way, not when we come to our home.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Although pardon of ſin be compleated at that great day, yet this is not to be underſtood, <hi>as if Gods pardon of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65696:138"/>
any ſin were imperfect, and ſomething of ſinne did ſtill remain to be done away.</hi> No, thoſe expreſſions of forgivenes of ſin in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, denote ſuch a full and plenary pardon, that a ſin cannot be more remitted then it is. But becauſe we commit new ſinnes daily, and ſo need pardon daily, Therefore it is that we are not compleatly pardoned till then. As alſo becauſe the perfect par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don we have here, ſhall then ſolemnly and publikely be declared to all the world.</p>
               <p>Theſe things thus premiſed,<note place="margin">Wherein the compleatneſſe of the pardon of ſin at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> I come to ſhew the grounds or particulars, wherein our pardon of ſinne is thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated.</p>
               <p>And firſt, <hi>In our ſenſe and feeling:</hi> For howſoever God pardon a ſinne perfectly, yet our faith which receiveth it, is weak. This Jewell is taken with a trembling and ſhaking hand.<note place="margin">1. In our ſenſe of that pardon</note> Hence it is that we have not full faith and confidence in our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. We may ſee this in <hi>David,</hi> though <hi>Nathan</hi> told him his ſinnes were forgiven him, yet his faith was not ſo vigorous and powerfull, as wholly to apply this to his own ſoul; and therefore he had much anguiſh and trouble of heart afterwards; But now, at the laſt day, all theſe fears, diffidence and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, will be quite removed out of our hearts. There ſhall be no more diſturbance in our ſouls, then there can be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the higheſt heavens, we ſhall then have ſuch a gourd as no worm can devour. Our ſouls ſhall not then know the meaning of ſitting in darkneſſe, and wanting Gods favour. There will then be no complaints, <hi>Why hath the Lord forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me?</hi> Well may Gods children be called upon to lift up their heads, when ſuch a redemption draweth nigh; and well may that day be called <hi>the times of refreſhment,</hi> ſeeing the people of God are ſo often ſcorched with the fiery darts of Satan.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Pardon of ſin will at that day be perfected.<note place="margin">2. In the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of all effects of pardon.</note> 
                  <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the effects of pardon, will then be accompliſhed, and not ſo much as any ſcars remain, the wound will be ſo fully healed.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God doth fully pardon ſin, yet the effects of this are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laied, many chaſtiſements and ſad afflictions are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone: howſoever, death it ſelf, and the corruption in the grave muſt ſeize upon juſtified perſons; now theſe are the fruit of ſin,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:65696:139"/>
and howſoever the ſting of theſe be taken away, yet they are not wholly conquered, till that laſt day, Then therefore may we juſtly ſay, <hi>Sin is pardoned,</hi> when there ſhall be no more grave, no more death, no more corruption, but all ſhall be ſwallowed up in immortality and glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3. Then no more iteration of pardon.</note>Thirdly, Then, and not till then may we ſay, remiſſion of ſins will be compleated, <hi>becauſe then ſhall no more iteration of pardon be.</hi> Here in this life, becauſe the root of corruption a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in us; there are daily pullulant branches of ſinnes, and ſo frequent guilt is contracted, whereby as we have daily ſores, ſo we need daily plaiſters. It is with originall corruption in us, as in that Tree in <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.14, 15. although the branches be cut off, yet the ſtump is ſtill in the earth, and that ſprouts out too faſt by the temptations that are alwaies by it. Hence it is that we alwaies pray, <hi>Forgive us our ſins,</hi> and becauſe of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But then this Petition ſhall wholly ceaſe, then there will be no ſerpent to ſting us, nor will the eye of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying faith to look upon the brazen ſerpent exalted be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary any more. The Lord will not only wipe away the tear of wordly grief, but alſo of godly ſorrow at that time. Then, and not till then, will it be true, <hi>That God ſeeth no ſin in his children.</hi> Then will the Church <hi>be without wrinkles,</hi> or <hi>any ſpot within her.</hi> In this reſpect it is, the Church of God p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4. Then juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication ſhall be perfected.</note>Fourthly, At that day will pardon of ſin only be compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if you conſider <hi>the nature of juſtification. For what is that, but an overcoming the accuſing adverſary, and clearing of us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt every charge?</hi> Now this is moſt eminently and fully done in thoſe laſt aſſizes. The Syriack word to <hi>juſtifie,</hi> is alſo to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer</hi> and overcome, becauſe when a man is juſtified, he overco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth all thoſe bils and indictments which were brought in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; now this is manifeſtly done in the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when God ſhall before men and Angels acquit and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve his people: and if the Apoſtle ſay in this life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.7. of a godly man dead in Chriſt, he is juſtified from his ſins, <gap reason="foreign">

in reſpect of ſanctification, that ſin doth not conquer him, but he ſinne, how much more will this be true at that day, when all the guilt and filth of ſin ſhall be totally removed? Oh what a glorious conqueſt will that be over ſin, hell and the devil, when the Judge of the whole world, ſhall pronounce them free from all ſinne, and command them to enter into his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſt!</p>

               <p>Firſt, Thoſe places of Scripture, which ſpeak of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of the reall objects, and perſonal: Of the reall; as when it's ſaid, <hi>A man muſt give an account of every idle word,</hi> Mat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12.36. 2 Cor. 5.10. an account muſt be made for every thing done in the body.

               <p>Furtther, Many wicked mens ſins and godly mens are ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together, and there cannot be a judgement of diſcuſſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding that of condemnation, unleſſe godly mens ſinnes alſo be produced.</p>
               <p>In ſumme, They think this conduceth more to the ſetting up of Gods juſtice, the exaltation of his mercy; neither (ſay they) will this breed ſhame to the godly, for in heaven they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their ſins committed on earth, but without any grief or trouble, yea with joy and thankfulneſſe to God, becauſe deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them. <hi>Quando<expan>

to Gods goodneſſe, that the ſins of the godly ſhould then be publiſhed, for theſe grounds following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From the judicial proceſſe, where Chriſt cals the <hi>bleſſed of his Father to inherit the Kingdom prepared for them</hi>; and then enumerateth only the good works they had done; no queſtion they had many ſins and failings, but God takes no notice of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This agreeth beſt (they ſay) with thoſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Scripture concerning pardon, <hi>viz.</hi> that God blotteth them out, that they are thrown into the bottom of the ſea.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The godly are ſaid not to come into judgement, and there is no condemnation to them, yea, they have already life everlaſting.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Chriſt is their bridegroom, their friend, their advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and how ill becoming would it be one in ſuch relations, to account or lay open their ſins?</p>
               <p>Which of theſe opinions is trueſt, is hard to ſay, neither of them have cogent arguments, and the Scripture doth not expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly decide the queſtion, yet the negative ſeems to have more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability on its ſide.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Great love and grace of God through Chriſt in pardoning: And there is this one peculiar thing well obſerved about this woman in the hiſtory, that whereas divers others addreſſed themſelves to Chriſt for corporal mercies, this only cometh for ſpiritual, even for remiſſion of her ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">An Entrance into the Text, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the hiſtory.</note>For the better underſtanding of the text, let us briefly conſider the hiſtory; and firſt the woman is deſcribed by her quality in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, <hi>a ſinner,</hi> not in a common ſenſe as all are, but in a more notorious manner; and therefore thoſe that mitigate her fault, out of ſome reverence or honour to her, do not ſo much <hi>encreaſe her honour</hi> (as <hi>Maldonat</hi> upon the place well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth) as detract from <hi>Christs honour:</hi> for the Phyſicians skill is moſt commended, where the diſeaſe is more deſperate. That ſhe was a known <hi>great ſinner,</hi> appeareth, in that the Phariſee wondred at Chriſt, becauſe he would have any commerce with her. Whether this woman was <hi>Mary, Lazarus</hi> his ſiſter or no, is hotly diſputed by Commentators, but impertinent to my ſcope. In the next place you have her great repentance expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, wherein for the generall you may ſee the Apoſtles duty accompliſhed, <hi>as ſhe had given her members to be members of iniquity, ſo now of righteouſneſſe,</hi> inſomuch that ſhe is the true looking-glaſſe of an humble convert. Her humiliation is deſcribed: 1. In bringing of a box of oyntment to anoint his feet; not his head (ſay ſome) becauſe ſhe thought her ſelf ſo
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:65696:141"/>
unworthy, ſhe brought indeed an outward <hi>viſible box of oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but ſhe had another <hi>inviſible and ſpiritual one,</hi> even a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite and broken heart. 2. She ſtands behinde Chriſt (as being loathſom in her own eyes) <hi>and waſheth his feet with her tears</hi>; which muſt ſuppoſe that to be true in her, which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>viz. Her head to be a fountain of water,</hi> but as long as her heart was ſuch a <hi>fervent limbeck,</hi> it was no wonder to ſee ſuch precious diſtillations: <hi>Chryſologus</hi> upon this fact of hers, ſaith, <hi>The Heavens are wont to water the Earth with rain,</hi> but <hi>ecce nunc rigat terra Coelum,</hi> here the earth watereth Heaven. Laſtly, The debaſement of her ſelf further appeareth, in making her Hair, heretofore the inſtrument of her pride and wantonneſs, now a <hi>Towel</hi> to wipe his feet. In the third place, Chriſts love towards her is remarkable, and in the general it is ſo great, that the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee puffed up with his own pride, was <hi>offended at it,</hi> not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, Firſt, That though ſhe had been a ſinner, yet now ſhe manifeſted Repentance. And ſecondly, That every commerce and communion with a ſinner is not forbidden, but that which is of incouragement or conſent unto his ſin: but our Saviours was like the communion of a Phyſician with the Patient to heal and cure: Hence our Saviour touched the leper, whom he heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet was not unclean, becauſe he touched him to reſtore him to health: But as the people murmured becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> married a Blackmore, ſo the Phariſees grudged, becauſe Chriſt ſhewed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to ſinners; but <hi>Moſes</hi> indeed could not make the Blackmore white, whereas Chriſt doth purifie the defiled ſoul. Now our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour doth aggravate his love to her; Firſt, by a diligent enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of thoſe ſeveral acts of ſervice, which ſhe had exhibited to him, not mentioning any of her former ſins; and all this he doth with an Antitheſis, or oppoſition to that carriage which the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee had preſented him with. 2. To convince the Phariſee, he declareth a Parable, that ſo from his own mouth the Phariſee may judge her love to Chriſt to be greater then his. In the laſt place his grace to her is further declared, by pardoning her ſins though ſo hainous, which pardon is firſt declared unto the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee in my Text, and afterwards to the woman her ſelf.</p>
               <p>In my Text is the firſt promulgation of her pardon; now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the words have ſome difficulty, and the later part is

                  </note> two Queſtions are briefly to be reſolved: Firſt, When this womans ſins were pardoned? And the Anſwer is, <hi>That as ſoon as ever ſhe repented in her heart of her evil wayes, and believed in Chriſt, her ſins were forgiven her</hi>; for ſo God doth promiſe; and this was before ſhe came to Chriſt, but ſhe cometh to Chriſt for the more aſſurance of Pardon, and not only ſo, but that he ſhould authoritatively abſolve her from her ſinne; for Chriſt did more then declare her ſins pardoned, as appeareth by the ſtanders by, who with wonder made this queſtion, <hi>v.</hi> 49. <hi>Who is this that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth ſins alſo?</hi> Whereas to declare the forgiveneſs of ſin only, any Miniſter may do, as we read of <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.13. So that her ſins were pardoned by God before, at the firſt time of her Faith and Repentance, but now Chriſt as the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, doth particularly abſolve her, and that in her own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, therefore he bids her, <hi>Go in peace.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Here is a great and vaſt difference between theſe two: many Papiſts are for the later, the Proteſtants generally for the former, and there is this cogent reaſon for it, for that Chriſt doth not ſpeak of Repentance, or Love which ſhould go before, and be the cauſe of the pardon of ſins, is plain by the Parable he brings of a Creditor, who forgave one Debtor more, another Debtor leſs: hereupon our Saviour asked the Phariſee, <hi>Which of them will love him moſt? Simon anſwered, I ſuppoſe him to whom most was forgiven:</hi> Now of ſuch a love our Saviour ſpeaketh, when he mentioneth the woman, which is clearly a love of <hi>Gratitude, Becauſe much was forgiven</hi>; not an antecedent love of <hi>merit,</hi> to procure pardon; ſo that as from her actions of anointing and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing his feet, by way of <hi>a ſign or effect,</hi> we gather her Faith and Love of Chriſt; ſo by her Faith and Love as <hi>by a ſign and effect,</hi> it may be gathered, that her ſins are forgiven her. But you may ask, How could ſhe come to know her ſins were forgiven, before
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:65696:142"/>
Chriſt told her? I anſwer, By the promiſe of God made to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true Penitent and Believer: though this aſſurance of hers was imperfect, and therefore admitted of further degrees, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as then all this Repentance and Humiliation was not that ſinne <hi>might be forgiven,</hi> but from Faith that they <hi>were forgiven:</hi> We may obſerve this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the ſenſe and apprehenſion of pardon of ſins already obtained,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This is a practical truth of great concernment. And for the opening of it, take notice of this diſtinction, as a foundation,<note place="margin">A two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>fold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> apprehenſion of Gods love in pardoning,</hi> whereby we grieve, that we ſhould deal ſo unkindely with ſo good and gracious a God: This, though more rarely, yet is ſometimes ſpoken of in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as firſt in this woman, who out of the apprehenſion of Gods love in pardoning ſo much to her, did pour out her ſoul in all wayes of thankfulneſs. After this manner alſo was <hi>Davids</hi> Repentance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. for he was thus deeply affected after <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> had told him, <hi>His ſin was taken away:</hi> Although it doth appear by the <hi>Pſalm</hi> alſo, that he had not as yet that ſenſe of pardon, which did quiet his conſcience. This kinde of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was alſo in <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. 1 Cor. 15.8, 9. in which places the Apoſtle remembring his former ſins, confeſſeth them, and acknowledgeth thereby his unworthineſſe of all that grace and favour he had received; ſo that the Apoſtle doth not there humble himſelf that he may obtain mercy, but becauſe he had obtained mercy. The moſt eminent inſtance of this kinde of ſorrow and ſhame, is <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.62, 63. where God promiſeth to eſtabliſh his Covenant with them, and then mark the event of this, <hi>That thou may<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>So then both theſe kindes of Humiliations are to be owned and practiſed; and therefore it is a falſe and dangerous error to acknowledge no other kinde of Repentance then the later: The Papiſts will not acknowledge this later Humiliation at all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deny all Faith and Aſſurance that a believer may have of his ſins in particular: And others, that there is only this later, and therefore the fore-mentioned Author, in his Treatiſe of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-repentance,</hi> makes this only Goſpel-repentance: but as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-faith is not that reflect act of the ſoul in a man, whereby it is perſwaded that Chriſt is his, but a direct act of taking and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt to be ours: ſo a Goſpel-repentance is not that mainly whereby we are humbled, becauſe we receive Gods love to us in pardoning, but principally in that loathing of our ſelves to obta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Properties, do repreſent them as <hi>grounds of duty, as well as of conſolation,</hi> Pſal. 130.4. <hi>There is forgiveneſs with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared:</hi> Mark that expreſſion [<hi>There is forgiveneſs with thee:</hi>] which implieth forgiveneſs to be in God as <hi>in a fountain,</hi> and therefore he doth eaſily, and plentifully forgive; but leſt any Spider ſhould ſuck poiſon out of this ſweet flower, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>That thou mayeſt be feared</hi>; here is no incouragement to ſecurity. Thus <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. there is a gracious Promiſe of God to his children, that they ſhall fear him and his goodneſs. As it is Gods glorious Property to work good out of evil, ſo it is a moſt deviliſh quality to work evil out of good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Promiſes of God, they alſo require an holy and humble walking,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. The Apoſtle having in the Chapter before mentioned thoſe glorious Promiſes in the Covenant of Grace, That he would be our God, and we his ſons and daughters, makes this inference, <hi>Having thoſe promiſes, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God:</hi> So that here is no danger, as long as we keep cloſe to the genuine uſe of the Scripture. Thus alſo <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. <hi>Grieve not the Spirit of God, whereby ye are ſealed,</hi> &amp;c.

The more gracious then we perceive God to us, the more humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and debaſement we finde in our ſelves. Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.17. <hi>If ye call on the Father, who without reſpect of perſons judgeth all men, paſs the time of your ſojourning here in fear.</hi> To make therefore doubting, a duty and meritorious, as ſome Papiſts have done, is to betray great ignorance of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture motives.</p>

That this perſwaſion of pardon doth inflame much to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, appeareth <hi>from the nature and ſtate of thoſe who are in it.</hi> They are ſons, Now by experience we ſee, that in an ingenuous ſon, the more apprehenſion there is of his fathers tender love and kindeneſs to him, the more obſequious and ſerviceable he is; Can we think that the fathers great love to his prodigal ſon, was not like coals of fire poured on him to melt and thaw him? We rather ſee jealouſies and ſuſpitions of love to breed hatred at laſt. Hence diffidence worketh deſpair, and deſpair hatred of God: It is therefore a ſpecial duty lying upon the people of God, to entertain good thoughts of God, and to be perſwaded of his loving kindeneſs to them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the people of God do yet mourn and abhorre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their ſins, though perſwaded of the pardon of them, ariſeth from the ſincerity and uprightneſs of their heart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they hate ſin as ſin, and grieve for the diſhonour they have put upon God. It is indeed lawful, yea a duty to repent of ſin, that it may be pardoned, becauſe the Scripture propounds this as a motive and incouragement to the duty: And it is a vain thing, to affect more high and ſpiritual ſtrains then the Scripture. But Humiliation of ſin, when pardoned, and after the knowledge of the pardon, doth evidently diſcover an upright heart, that the diſhonour of God is more trouble and grief to him, then his own puniſhment and deſtruction. Whereby it is, that hedoth ſo accuſe and condemn himſelf for dealing ſo wretchedly and frowardly with ſo gracious a God.</p>
