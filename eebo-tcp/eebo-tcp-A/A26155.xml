         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AMong the many Excellencies of this
pious Collection of Hymns, (for
which so particular a Value has
been set upon it, by the Church of God in
all Ages,) This is not the Least, that the true
Price of Duties is there justly stated; Men
are call'd off from resting in the Outward
Shew of Religion, in Ceremonies and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Observances; and taught rather to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
(that which was meant by these things,
and to which they were design'd to lead,)
sound, inward Vertue and Piety.</p>
            <p>The several Composers of these Hymns
were <hi>Prophets;</hi> Men, whose Business it was,
not onely to foretell Events, for the Benefit
of the Church in succeeding Times; but to
correct and reform also what was amiss
in the present Race of Men, with whom
they liv'd and convers'd: To preserve a
foolish People from Idolatry, and false Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
To rescue the Law from corrupt
Glosses, and the superstitious Uses which were
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59549:3"/>
made of it: And to put Men in mind of
(what they were so willing to forget) that
Eternal and Invariable Rule, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these <hi>Positive</hi> Duties, and would be after
e'm, and was to be observ'd even Then in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to 'em.</p>
            <p>The Discharge, I say, of this part of the
Prophetick Office, taking up so large a room
in the Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> has been one reason,
(among many others) why they have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
so highly esteem'd of: Because we are
from hence furnish'd with such an Account
of things, as takes off the Exceptions of
those unreasonable Men, who run down all
reveal'd Religion, as a <hi>Pretence</hi> and a <hi>Trick,</hi>
from what they imagine they see of it, in
that of the <hi>Jews.</hi> The whole of which they
first suppose to lie in Outward Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and then easily perswade themselves,
that God could never be the Authour of
such a mere Piece of Pageantry, and Empty
Formality: That it could never be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Divine Nature, to delight to be
worship'd by a Company of wild and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>Which Objection of Theirs we should not
know what to say to, unless we could prove
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59549:3"/>
out of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> and other parts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick
Writing, that the <hi>Jewish Religion</hi>
was something more than bare Outside and
Shew.—And that Inward Purity, and Spiritual
Devotion was a Duty Then too, as well as
Now.</p>
            <p>One great Instance of this Proof is in the
words now before us, which are taken out
of a Psalm of <hi>Asaph's,</hi> written on purpose to
set out the weakness and worthlessness of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Performances, when compar'd with
more vital and substantial Duties.</p>
            <p>To enforce which Doctrine, God himself
is brought in as delivering it. <hi>Hear, O my
People, and I will speak: O</hi> Israel, <hi>and I will
testifie against thee: I am God, even thy God.</hi>
The Preface is very solemn, and therefore
that which it ushers in, we may be sure, is
of no common Importance. <hi>I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
thee for thy Sacrifices, or thy Burnt-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
to have been continually before me.</hi> That
is, I will not So reprove thee, as if These were
the Only, or the Chief Things I requir'd of
thee. <hi>I will take no Bullock out of thy house,
nor He-goat out of thy folds.</hi> I prescrib'd
thee not Sacrifices for my Own sake, because
I needed 'em: <hi>For every Beast of the Forest is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59549:4"/>
mine, and the Cattle upon a thousand Hills.</hi>
Mine they are, and were, before ever I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Thee to offer 'em to me; so that
(as it follows,) <hi>If I were hungry, yet would I
not tell thee, for the world is mine, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
thereof.</hi> But can ye be so gross and Sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
as to think me liable to Hunger and Thirst<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as to imagine that wants of <hi>that</hi> kind can
touch me? <hi>Will I eat the Flesh of Bulls, or
drink the Blood of Goats?</hi>—Thus does he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulate
severely with 'em, after the most
graceful manner of the Eastern Poetry. The
Issue of which is a plain and full Resolution
upon the Case, in those few words of the
Text.—<hi>Offer unto God Thanksgiving.</hi> Would
you do your Homage in the most agreeable
way? would you render the most accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Services? <hi>Offer unto God Thanksgiving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The use I intend to make of these words
is, from hence, to raise some Thoughts, about
that very excellent and important (but
much neglected) Duty of Praise and
Thanksgiving: A Subject not unfit to be
discours'd of at this Time; whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
either the more than ordinary Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that appears a-late in Mens Tempers, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the practice of This (or any other)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59549:4"/>
part of a warm and affecting Devotion;
The Great Occasion of setting aside This par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Day in the Kalendar, some years ago:
Or the Fresh Instances of mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which God even Now has been pleas'd to
bestow upon us. Answering at last the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Fastings,</hi> by which we have
besought him so long for the Establishment
of Their Majesties Throne, and for the
Success of their Arms: and giving us at
length an Opportunity of appearing before
him, in the more delightful part of our
Duty; <hi>in the voice of Praise and Thanksgiving,
among such as keep Holy days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Offer unto God Thanksgiving.</p>
            <p>Which that we may do, let us enquire first
what is meant by offering Praise and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
unto God, and then how reasonable it
is, that we should do so.</p>
            <p>Our Enquiry into what is meant here, will
be very short: For who is there, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
any thing of Religion, but knows;
that to offer Praise and Thanks to God is,
to have a lively and devout Sense of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
and of his Benefits; to recollect
'em with Humility and Thankfulness of
heart; and to express these Inward Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59549:5"/>
by suitable Outward Signs of 'em;
by reverent and lowly Postures of Body, by
Songs and Hymns, and Spiritual Ejaculations:
either Privately or Publickly; either in the
Customary and Daily Service of the Church,
or in its more Solemn Appointments, upon
extraordinary occasions. This is the Account
which every Christian easily gives himself
of it; and which therefore it would be
needless to enlarge upon. I shall only take
notice on this Head; that Praise and
Thansgiving do, in strictness of Speech, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
Things somewhat different. Our <hi>Praise</hi>
is properly terminated on God, on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his natural Excellencies and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
and is that, by which we give Honour
to all his several Attributes; but <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi>
is a narrower Duty, and Imports on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
a grateful Sense and Acknowledgment
of past Mercies. We praise God for all
his glorious Acts, of every kind, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
either us, or other men; for his very
<hi>Vengeance,</hi> and those Judgments which he
sometimes sends abroad in the Earth: But
we thank him only for the Instances of his
<hi>Goodness;</hi> and for Such only of those, as We
our selves are concern'd in. This, I say, is what
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59549:5"/>
the Two words strictly mean: but since the
Language of Scripture is generally less ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act;
and uses either of 'em often, to express
the other by, I shall not therefore think my
self obliged, in what follows, thus nicely
always to distinguish 'em.</p>
            <p>Now the great <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Praise or Thanksgiving, and Our seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Obligations</hi> to it will appear; if we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
consider it <hi>absolutely</hi> in it self, as the
Debt of our Natures; or <hi>compare</hi> it with
other Duties, and shew the Rank it bears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
'em: Or set out, in the last place,
some of its peculiar <hi>Properties</hi> and <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,</hi>
with regard to the devout Performer
of it.</p>
            <p>Praise and Thanksgiving, consider'd ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
in themselves, are, I say, the Debt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the very Law of our Nature. We had
such Faculties on purpose bestowed on us,
as made us fit to satisfie this Debt, and to
obey this Law: And they therefore never
work more naturally and freely, than when
they are thus employ'd.</p>
            <p>'Tis one of the oldest pieces of Reasoning,
that Philosophy has acquainted us with;
and which has ever since been taught and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59549:6"/>
kept up by the wisest Men of all Ages, that
the Original Design of making Man was,
that he might Praise and Honour Him that
made him.</p>
            <p>Whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> God had finisht this goodly-Frame
of things we call the World, and put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the several parts of it, according to the
Skill of his infinite Wisdom, in exact Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
Weight, and Measure; there was still
wanting a Creature in these lower Regions,
that could apprehend the Beauty, Order, and
exquisite Contrivance of it:- that from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
the Gift, might be able to lead
it self up to the great Giver; and do Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to all his Attributes.</p>
            <p>Every Thing indeed, that God made, did,
in some Sence, glorifie its Author; inasmuch
as it carried upon it the plain Mark and
Impress of the Deity; and was an Effect
worthy of that first Cause from whence it
flow'd: And Thus might the <hi>Heavens</hi> be said,
at the first moment in which they stood forth,
<hi>To declare his Glory, and the Firmament to
shew his Handy work.</hi> But this was an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
and an improper Glory: The Sign
signify'd to no purpose here Below, where
there was no Body to take notice of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59549:6"/>
Man therefore was fram'd to supply this
want; en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed with Powers fit to find out, and
to acknowledge these unlimited Perfections:
and then put into this Temple of God, this
Lower World, as the Priest of Nature, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
up the Incense of Thanks and Praise for
the mute and the insensible Part of the
Creation.</p>
            <p>This I say has been the Opinion all along
of the most thoughtful Men down from
the most Ancient Times: And tho' it carry
no Demonstration in't, yet is it what we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but agree to, if we will but allow that
Man was made for some End or Other; and
that he is capable of perceiving that End.
For then, let us search, deliberate, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
never so much, we shall find no other
Account of him, that we can rest upon so
well. If we say he was made purely for the
good Pleasure of God, and because He
would have it so, this is, <hi>in effect,</hi> to say,
that he was made for no End; or for none
that we can discern.</p>
            <p>If we say again, That he was design'd as
an Instance of the Wisdom, and Power,
and Goodness of God, this indeed may
be the Reason of his <hi>Being</hi> in general;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59549:7"/>
For 'tis the common Reason of the Being
of every thing besides. But it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
why he was made <hi>such</hi> a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ng as he
is, a reflecting, thoughtful, inquisitive Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
The <hi>particular</hi> Reason of this must be
drawn from the Praise and Honour that was
to be given to God by him, if we will have
any Reason at all of it.</p>
            <p>This therefore is the Debt and Law of
our Nature. And it will more <hi>distinctly</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be such, if we consider the two Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Faculties of our Mind, The <hi>Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and the <hi>Will,</hi> apart; in both which it is
deeply founded: in the Understanding, as in
the Principle of Reason, that owns and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
it; in the Will, as in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Gratitude and Return, which vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
constrains us to pay it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reason</hi> was given us as a Rule and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to value things by: by the help of
which we were to proportion our Esteem
of every thing, according to the Degrees of
Perfection and Goodness that were in it. It
cannot therefore, if it does its Office at all,
but apprehend. God as the best and most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
being; it must necessarily own and give
him the Honour of his infinite Perfections.

by <hi>confessing</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>acknowledging</hi>
him; by <hi>ascribing</hi> to him what is his Due:
And as far as This Sence of the word goes, 'tis
impossible to <hi>think</hi> of God without praising
him. For it depends not on the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
(on a sound and uncorrupted Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
I mean) how it shall apprehend
things, any more than it does on the Eye,
how its Objects shall appear to it.</p>
            <p>The Duty takes a further and surer hold
of us, by the means of our <hi>Will,</hi> and that
strong bent towards <hi>Gratitude,</hi> which the
Authour of Nature has fix'd there. There
is not a more active Principle, than This, in
Man; and That surely which deserves its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Force, and should set all its Springs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,
is God; that Great and Universal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactour,
from whom we receiv'd every
thing, we either are or have; and to whom
we can possibly repay nothing, but our
Praises, or (to speak more properly on this
Head, and according to the strict Import of
the Word) our Thanksgivings. <hi>Who hath
given to God</hi> (says the great Apostle in his
usual Figure) <hi>and it shall be recompenc'd unto
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59549:8"/>
him?</hi> A Gift it seems always requires a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
—Nay, but <hi>of him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Authour; <hi>through him,</hi> as the Preserver and
Governour; <hi>to him,</hi> as the End and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<hi>To whom therefore</hi> (as it follows) <hi>be
Glory for ever,</hi> Amen!</p>
            <p>Gratitude consists in an equal Return of
Benefits, if we are able; or of Thanks if we
are not. Which Thanks, therefore must rise
always as the Favours receiv'd are in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
great, and the Receiver incapable in
Degree of making any other Sort of Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.
Now since no Man has benefited God
at any Time, and yet every Man in each
Moment of his Life, is continually benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by him; what strong Obligations must
we needs be under to thank Him?</p>
            <p>'Tis true, our Thanks are really as little
worth to him, as any other kind of Return
would be: In themselves indeed they are so;
But his Goodness has made 'em, otherwise:
He has declar'd he will accept 'em in lieu of
the vast Debt we owe. And after that, which
is fittest for us to dispute how they come
to be an <hi>Equivalent,</hi> or to pay 'em?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59549:8"/>
It is therefore the Voice of Nature, as
far as Gratitude it self is so, that the Good
Things, we receive from above, should be
sent back again thither in Thanks and Praises;
<hi>As the Rivers run into the Sea; to the place</hi>
(the Ocean of Beneficence) <hi>from whence
these Rivers came, thither should they return
again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have consider'd the Duty <hi>absolutely,</hi>
we are now to <hi>compare</hi> it with others, and
to see what Rank it bears among 'em. And
Here we shall find, that among all the Acts
of Religion immediately addressed to God,
this is much the Noblest, and most Excellent.
And indeed, if what has been laid down be
allow'd, That the end of Mans Creation was
to praise and glorifie God, it must needs be
so. For That cannot but be the most noble
and worthy Act of any Being, which is the
very End and Design of it. Other parts
of Piety, such as <hi>Confession</hi> and <hi>Prayer;</hi> were
not Originally design'd for Man, nor Man
for Them: They imply <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Want,</hi> with
which the <hi>State of Innocence</hi> was not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Had Man continu'd in That, his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
had been all paid to Heaven in pure Acts
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59549:9"/>
of Thanksgiving. And he had had nothing
to do, but to enjoy the Goods of Life, as
Nature directed, and to praise the God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that bestowed 'em. But being fallen from
Innocence and Abundance; having contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Guilt, and forfeited his Right to all sorts of
Mercies; Prayer and Confession became ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
for a time, to retrieve the Loss, and
to restore him again to that State, where
he should be able to live without 'em. These
are fitted therefore for a lower Dispensation:
before 'em in Paradise, there was nothing
but Praise; and after 'em too, there shall be
nothing but that in Heaven. Our perfect
State did at first, and will at last consist in
That: and therefore That is the Excellence
and the Honour of our Nature.</p>
            <p>'Tis the Same Argument, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
hath us'd for the preference of Charity,
to Faith and Hope, and every Spiritual Gift.
<hi>Charity faileth not,</hi> says he; that is, is not a
Vertue useful only in this Life, but will go
along with us also into the next:—<hi>But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be Prophecies, they shall fail; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be Tongues, they shall cease; whether
there be Knowledge, it shall vanish away.</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59549:9"/>
These are Gifts of a Temporary Advantage,
and shall all perish in the using. <hi>For we know
in part; and we prophesie in part</hi>—Our present
State is imperfect, and therefore what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to That, and onely That, must be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
too. <hi>But when that which is perfect is
come, then that which is in part shall be done
away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same Argument, we see, that sets
Charity above the rest of Christian Graces,
will give Praise also the Pre-eminence over
the other Parts of Christian Worship; and
we may conclude our reasoning therefore,
as He does his: <hi>And now abideth Confession,
Prayer and Praise; these three: But the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
of these is Praise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is so certainly on other Accounts, as well
as this: Particularly, as it is the most <hi>disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested</hi>
part of our Religious Service, such
as has the most of God, and the least of our
selves in it, of any we pay: And therefore
approaches the nearest of any to a pure, and
free, and perfect Act of Homage.</p>
            <p>For, though a good Action does not grow
immediately worthless by being done with
the Prospect of Advantage, as some have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59549:10"/>
strangely imagin'd; yet it will be allow'd, I
suppose, that its being done without the
Mixture of that End, recommends it so much
the more, and raises the Price of it. <hi>Does
Job serve God for nought?</hi> was an Objection
of Satan's, which imply'd, that those Duties
were most valuable, where our own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
was least aim'd at: And God seems, by
the Commission he then gave him to try
Experiments upon <hi>Job,</hi> thus far to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
his Plea.</p>
            <p>Now our Acknowledgments and Requests
are purely for our selves: our own. Interest
is the direct Aim of them. But Praise is a
generous and unmercenary Principle, which
proposes no other End to it self, but to do,
as is fit for a Creature endow'd with such
Faculties, to do towards the perfectest and
most beneficent of Beings; and to pay the
willing Tribute of our Honour there, where
the Voice of Reason directs us to pay it.</p>
            <p>God has indeed annexed a Blessing to the
Duty, and when we know this, we cannot
chuse in the Act of Praise, but have some
Regard to it. However that is not our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Aim in it, nor was it the first Motive
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59549:10"/>
that stirr'd us up to it. Had it been so, we
should naturally have had Recourse unto
Prayer, and breath'd out our Desires in
That Form which most properly belongs to
them.</p>
            <p>In short, Praise is our most Excellent
Work; a Work common to the Church
Triumphant and Militant, and which lifts
us up into a Communion and Fellowship
with Angels. The Matter of it is always the
Perfection of God's Nature; and the Act it
self, is the Perfection of Ours.</p>
            <p>I come now, in the last Place, to set out
some of its peculiar <hi>Properties and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,</hi>
which recommend it to the Devout
Performer. And First—</p>
            <p>It is the most <hi>pleasant</hi> part of our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
It proceeds always from good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and a Chearful Temper of Mind;
and it cherishes, and promotes it mightily in
us. <hi>For it is good to sing Praises to the Lord,</hi>
(says One, whose Experience in this Case, we
may rely upon) <hi>for it is pleasant, and Praise
is comely.</hi> Prayer and Penitence are the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guageof
the Indigent and the Guilty; the
Breathings of a Sad and a Contrite Spirit:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59549:11"/>
               <hi>Is any afflicted? let him pray:</hi> But—<hi>Is any
merry? let him sing Psalms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The most natural and lively way of
Mens expressing the Mirth of their Hearts, is
in a Song. And Songs are the very Language of
Praise, Appropriated peculiarly to this End in
Religion, and scarce of any other Use in it.
Indeed the whole Composition of this Duty
is such, as throughout speaks Ease and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to the Mind.</p>
            <p>It proceeds from <hi>Love,</hi> and from <hi>Thank:
fulness:</hi> From <hi>Love,</hi> the very Fountain of
Pleasure; the Passion, which gives every thing
we do or enjoy, its Relish and Agreeableness.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Thankfulness,</hi> which involves in it
the Memory of past Benefits; the actual
Presence of them to the Mind, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
Enjoyment of 'em.</p>
            <p>And as its <hi>Principle</hi> is, such is its <hi>End</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
For it procureth Quiet and Ease to the
Mind, by doing somewhat towards satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Debt, which it labours under; by
delivering it of those Thoughts of Praise and
Gratitude; those Exultations it is so full of;
and which would grow uneasie and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to it, if they were kept in: If the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59549:11"/>
Thankfull <hi>refrain'd, it would be Pain and Grief
to him:</hi> But then, then is his <hi>Soul satisfy'd
as with Marrow and Fatness, when his Mouth
praiseth God with Joyfull Lips.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is another great Effect of Praise, that it
enlarges the Powers and Capacities of our
Soul; turning 'em off from little and low
things, upon their Greatest and Noblest Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
the Divine Nature; and employing
'em in searching out all the Wonders of
it. We see what difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Man and Man; such, as there is
hardly greater between Man and Beast: And
this proceeds all from the different Sphere of
Thought which they Act in, and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Objects they converse with. The
Mind is Essentially the same in the Peasant
and the Prince, the Forces of it naturally
equal in the untaught Man, and the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher:
Only the one is busied in mean
Affairs, and within narrower Bounds; the
Other Exercises himself in Things of weight
and moment: And This it is, that puts the
wide distance between 'em. Noble Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are to the Mind, what the Sun-beams
are to a Bud or Flower: They open and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59549:12"/>
unfold; as it were, the Leaves of it; put it
upon exerting and spreading it self every
way; and call forth all those Powers, that
lie hid and locked up in it. The Praise and
Admiration of God therefore brings this
Advantage along with it, that it sets our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
upon their full Stretch, and improves
'em to all the Degrees of Perfection, of which
they are capable.</p>
            <p>It (farther) Promotes in us, an exquisite
Sense of God's Honour; and an high Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Mind, at every thing, that openly
profanes it. For what we value and delight
in, we cannot with Patience hear slighted or
abus'd. Our Own Praises, which we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
putting up, will be a <hi>Spur</hi> to us to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Glory of God in every Other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of it: and will make us set our Faces
against all open and avow'd Impieties. Which
methinks should be consider'd a little by those
Men, who can be silent under the foulest
dishonours done to Religion, and its great
Authour. For tamely to hear God's Name
blasphemed by Others, is no very good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that we have been us'd to Honor and
Reverence him in good earnest, Our selves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:59549:12"/>
It will (beyond all this) work in us a
deep Humility; and a Consciousness of our
own Imperfections. Upon a frequent At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to God and his Attributes, we shall
easily discover our own Weakness and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiness:
Our swelling thoughts of ourselves
will abate; and we shall see and feel, that
we are lighter, to be laid in the Ballance,
than even Vanity it self. And This is a Lesson,
which, to the most part of Mankind, is, I
Think, very well worth learning. We are
naturally Presumptuous and Vain; full of
Ourselves, and regardless of every thing
besides: Especially, when some little Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Privileges distinguish Us from the
rest of Mankind; then, 'tis odds, but we
look into Ourselves with great degrees of
Complacency; and are wiser and better
every way, without doubt, than <hi>seven Men,
that can render a Reason.</hi> Now nothing
will contribute so much to the Cure of
this Vanity, as a due Attention to God's
Excellencies, and to the Praise of 'em.
By comparing These with our Own, we shall
learn <hi>not to think of our selves more highly
than we ought to think of Ourselves; but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59549:13"/>
to think soberly:</hi> We shall find more satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in looking upwards, and humbling
Ourselves before Our common Creator, than
in casting Our Eyes downward with Scorn
upon our Fellow-Creatures, and setting at
nought any part of the Work of his
Hands. The vast distance we are at, from
Real and Infinite Worth, will astonish us
so much, that we shall have no Mind to
value Ourselves on those lesser Degrees of
Pre-eminence, that Custom, or Opinion, or
some little accidental Advantages have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Us over other Men.</p>
            <p>I shall mention but one Use of it more,
and 'tis This; That a conscientious Praise
of God will keep Us back from all
false and mean Praises, all. Fulsome and
Servile Flatteries, such as are in use among
Men. Praising, as 'tis commonly manag'd,
is nothing else but a Tryal of Skill upon
a Man, how many good Things we can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
say of him. All the fine Characters that
ever were made, are heap'd together, and
thrown into One, for His sake. And no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whether it belongs to him, or not; so
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59549:13"/>
there be but enough on't. Which is one
deplorable Instance (among a thousand) of
the Baseness of humane Nature; its small
regard to Truth and Justice; to Right, or
Wrong; to what is, or is not to be prais'd.</p>
            <p>But He, who has a deep Sense of the
Excellencies of God upon his Heart, will
make a God of nothing besides: He will
give every thing its just Encomium, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
where Honour is due; and as much
as is due; because it is his Duty to do
so: but the Honour of God will suffer him
to go no further. Which Rule, if it had
been observ'd, a Neighbouring Prince, (who
now, God be thanked, needs Flattery some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than ever he did) would have
wanted a great deal of that Incense that
has been pay'd him.</p>
            <p>Upon these Grounds does the Duty of
Praise stand, and these are the Obligations
that Tye us to the Performance of it.</p>
            <p>'Tis the End of our being, and the very
Rule and Law of Our Nature; flowing
from the Two great Fountains of humane
Action, the Understanding and the Will,
naturally, and almost necessarily. It is the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59549:14"/>
most Excellent part of our Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
enduring to Eternity, when the rest are
to be done away; and pay'd even Now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the frankest manner, with the least regard
to Our own Interest. It recommends it
self to us by several peculiar Properties,
that Belong to it: As it carries more Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in it, than all other Kinds of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as it enlarges and exalts all the
Powers of the Mind; as it breeds in Us an
exquisite Sense of God's Honour, and a
Willingness to promote it in the World:
as it learns us to be Humble and Lowly
Ourselves; and yet preserves us from the
Baseness of Flattery, from bestowing mean
and undue Praises upon Others.</p>
            <p>A great deal more might be said for it,
if This were not sufficient: For no Subject
affords more Room for our Praises, than the
Praise of God it self, if we had leisure to
pursue it.</p>
            <p>I shall now shut up the Arguing part of
this Discourse, with a short Application to
Two sorts of Persons; the <hi>Careless,</hi> and the
<hi>Profane.</hi> One of which Neglects the Practise
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59549:14"/>
of so Important a Duty, and the other lives
in Defiance of it.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Neglect</hi> in this Case, is certainly the
Grossest that can be: 'Tis (we see) the
Neglect of our Duty, our Honour, our
Interest, and our Pleasure all at once. 'Tis
to omit doing that which we were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
sent into the World to doe: And
without doing which, all the other Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of Life are but one continued Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence.
That, which we have so many
Obligations to doe, and no Excuse for lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
undone: For Praise is within every
Man's Reach: There is no One but has it
in his Power to be Thankfull.</p>
            <p>God commanded the <hi>Jews</hi> to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
his Sovereignty and Beneficence, by
Sacrifices, a Costly and a Troublesome way
of Worship. Of Us he requires onely the
Cheap and Easie Offering of Our Thanks and
Praises—And shall we not pay it? Alas! we
do not! Every thing proves an hindrance
to us in the way to this our Bounden Duty
and Service: We are too idle or too busie
to attend upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59549:15"/>
And even when we find Leisure enough;
yet how cold and how insensible are we
whilst 'tis going forward! <hi>We draw nigh unto
him with our Lips</hi> (perhaps) <hi>but our Hearts
are far from him.</hi> And do we then know
what it is to praise God becomingly? Do
we remember how the great Teacher of
Thanksgiving summons up every One of his
Faculties to assist him in it? <hi>Praise the Lord
O my Soul! and all that is within me, praise
his holy Name!</hi> 'Tis a Work that will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<hi>all that is within us,</hi> that will call for
all the Application, and Vigor, and Warmth
that we can possibly bestow upon it Cold,
unmov'd Praise, is no Praise! the Sacrifice
of it can be no longer acceptable than 'tis
burning.</p>
            <p>To those Men who live in the <hi>Contempt</hi>
of this Duty, we have also something to
say, if they would but hear us. They are
generally such, as pretend a high Sense of
the Dignity of humane Nature, and bear
no small Respect to their own Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
Now, though Other Parts of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Worship should happen to be too mean
and low for such great Minds to take up
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59549:15"/>
with; yet This, methinks, might deserve
to be thought equal to 'em.</p>
            <p>Let Confession and Prayer go only for the
Arts of Whining and Begging, and be as
much beneath 'em as they imagine, yet
surely Praise has something so great and so
noble in it, that they cannot look down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it. 'Tis a Subject fit for the most en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd
Capacities to dwell on; and such an
One, as even Those would certainly find
themselves rais'd and improv'd by.</p>
            <p>If it were possible for These Men to have a
Relish of any thing of this Kind, we would
desire 'em to make the Trial: To take the
<hi>Te Deum</hi> into their Hands, and to read it
attentively; and then tell us truly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they did not find their Minds fill'd,
and their Affections strangely rais'd by the
Images they met there: Whether they did
not perceive themselves to be somewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
themselves, in the using it. And all this
done by that Majestick Plainness and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of Thought that goes through
it! Unadorn'd by Words! Unenliven'd by
Figures! 'Tis the Matter alone which
supports the Expression: And because that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59549:16"/>
Matter is pure, genuine Praise, therefore is
it so lofty and so moving.</p>
            <p>But alas! we speak in vain! The Men
who are bold enough to slight a Duty of
this Rank and Character, will easily slight
every thing that can be offer'd to bring
'em to it. All we can say to 'em is, that
as God made 'em for his Glory, so, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they will render it to him or not, he
will certainly serve the Ends of that Glory
upon 'em, one way or another. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if they will not freely Praise him for
his Goodness in this World, they shall sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whether they will or no, contribute to
the Praise of his Justice in the Next.</p>
            <p>Thus have I attempted to set out the
great Reasonableness of this Duty, and to
stir You up to the Practice of it. And
certainly, it was never more reasonable,
than on This Occasion, when we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate
such Past Mercies, and feel such
Present Ones. The Restoration of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
and of all those Blessings in Church
and State, that came along with it; The
Re-establishment of the Beauty of Praise in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59549:16"/>
our Sanctuary; The Return of Peace and
Plenty; Of Learning, and all the Arts of
Civil Life; The Reducing us from Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Rage into Order and Friendliness,
and making Us a Nation at Unity in it self;
Lovely at home, and Terrible abroad:
These were such sound and substantial
Blessings, as will wear well; and, though
done a great while ago, will yet deserve a
great while hence a Place in our Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars.
Neither Love to our Country, nor
the Honour we bear to Those who Rule
over Us; neither Our Gratitude to God,
nor our Good-will towards Men will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
such Wonders of Providence to slip out
of our Minds; or the Day, in which they
were brought about, easily to grow Old
upon Us.</p>
            <p>The Benefits we then receiv'd were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
exceeding great, and would justly
claim a larger Share in our Present
Thoughts, had not the Goodness of God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
'em off a little from thence, by calling
'em to the Acknowledgment of New Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Kindnesses.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:59549:17"/>
For behold what Glorious Things the
Lord has again done for Us! Blessing Their
Majesties Forces with a great and signal
Victory over the most haughty and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
of Enemies. A Victory—so Early, so
Compleat, and so Cheaply purchased, that
we have Reason to hope, it may fix the
Fortune of the War, and put an End to the
Destructions of the Destroyer: To whom,
we trust, God has now said, as he did once
to the Sea it self. <hi>Hitherto shalt Thou come, and
no further; and here shall thy proud Waves be
stay'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Blessed be God! who did not utterly
cast out our Prayers, and our Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
but delaid only to Answer 'em, till a
Day of Salvation, till an acceptable Time;
when the Mercy would be dearer to Us,
and his Goodness more remarkably seen in
the bestowing it!</p>
            <p>When we were Alarm'd with Invasions
from abroad, and Conspiracies at home;
when Men threatned to swallow us up
quick: When Success was now so requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to preserve the Honour of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to support Their Majesties Throne, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59549:17"/>
to strengthen the Hands of Their Allies;
Then did He appear, and own Our Cause;
Then was the God of Hosts, our Strength,
and our Shield.</p>
            <p>Surely, <hi>There is no End of that Goodness,</hi>
which continues thus to pursue us! Which
vouchsafes to establish to Us, and to our
Posterity those Blessings, under which we
have been so unthankful, and so ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
already! and to give us fresh Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of Praise, which I hope we shall make
better use of!</p>
            <p>Let us therefore, <hi>Offer unto God Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving!</hi>
and not That only, but <hi>Ourselves</hi>
also, our Souls and Bodies, to be a Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Holy and Lively Sacrifice: Let us ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him the Fruit of our Lips, and the
Obedience of our Lives! that these Blessings
may not prove a Curse to us; but that He
may still be Our God, and we may be His
People!</p>
            <p>To him with the Son, and the Holy Ghost,
be all Honour, Praise and Glory, hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
and for Evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
