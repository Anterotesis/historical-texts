         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALL people ſubject to Princes, are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned as Free-men by their Prince and certain other particular Lords of Lands and Liberties; who not by the Princes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion but by antient Lawes or Cuſtom have Inheritance and Tenements; or elſe they are by one Prince and his Miniſters commanded, which Miniſters have not by Law, or Ordinance, any Authority or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of themſelves, but being like to the people (baſe men and ſlaves) they command only by Commiſſion in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces name; and the Authority of thoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters doth ceaſe at the Princes pleaſure, ſo that the people doe not acknowledg any ſuperior but the Prince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> nor owe any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to other mean Lords: So as all the people ſtand without propertie in Lands or Goods; for example, the Empire of Turky and the Weſt Indies.</p>
            <p>The Provinces of this Monarchie are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to ſundrie Magiſtrates or Miniſters,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60768:8"/>
and they altered and removed at the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces pleaſure; but it is otherwiſe in a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie Royal, becauſe the Monarch is there accompanied with many mean Lords<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> And albeit thoſe mean Lords are Subjects unto the Prince, yet have they particular Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants who may not without juſt cauſe be diſpoſſeſſed by the Prince; and thoſe people having had dependency of their Lords and their Anceſtors, do ever beare unto them a certain naturall love and dutifull reſpect: who ſo therefore compareth theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities, ſhall perceive, that to Conquer a State Signioril there is great difficultie; but being conquered, it may eaſily be maintained for the difficultie to conquer ſuch a State, proceedeth from the lack of mean Lords to call in and aſſiſt the Prince that doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade: who therefore deſireth to ſubdue a Nation thus governed, muſt of force aſſault, all the people, and rather truſt in his own ſtrength then the aide of the Country.

            <p>MOnarchies Royal, are for the moſt part antient and hereditary, and conſequently eaſie to be governed. For it is ſufficient for the Prince to maintain the old Laws, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>and on occaſion temporize with thoſe accidents that happen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſuch a State cannot be taken from the Prince without exceſſive force; and if it be, it ſhall be ſoon recovered. Example, <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if a Monarchie newly conquered, be annexed unto an old, and not properly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, then is it with much more difficulty maintained.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for that men naturally inclined to variation are eaſily induced <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o take arms againſt him that newly governeth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, every new Prince is forced to exact aſwell upon thoſe Subjects that joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him as thoſe that did reſiſt him, and therefore ſhall offend both.

               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt to extinguiſh the race of him that was anciently Prince.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to continue all Lawes and Cuſtomes in the former force; for ſo ſhall the Subject find nothing altered but the Prince, and therefore will ſoon reſt conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and the rather if that new Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie and the antient dominion of the Prince be of one Language: But if the people be of a contrary Language and humor, then to hold it, there needeth great induſtrie and fortune: in that caſe the beſt way is that the Prince ſhould inhabit there, as well to incounter all inconveniences proceeding from the Subject, as to preſerve the people from oppreſſion of his own Miniſters. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way is to ſend thither certain Colonies, and plant them in fit places, or elſe to ſettle ſome gariſons both of horſe and foot; but Colonies are leſs chargeable to the Prince: As for the people inhabitant (who muſt neceſſarily remove, they being a ſmall number and diſpoſſeſſed) they cannot have power to offend: for in that caſe, this Rule or Maxime ſhall be found true, that men muſt be either kindly intreated<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> or with all extremity oppreſſed; becauſe of light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries they may be revenged, but of utter oppre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60768:9"/>
A Third way to hold a conquered domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is, to cheriſh and defend the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors of little power, and oppreſs or keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe that are moſt potent; and above all to take order that no forraign Prince or power doe enter; for it is ever to be looked for, that ſo many of the nation as are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, either for ambition or feare, will be ever readie to bring in ſtrangers; and to conclude this matter of Principalitie annexed, I ſay it behoveth every Prince poſſeſſed of ſuch a State, never to increaſe the power of any potent neighbor, never to oppreſs thoſe that are of ſmall power, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to permit any forraign potentate to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but ever to plant Colonies and Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or elſe to make that dominion his cheif habitation.</p>

               </gap> few or none ſhall hardly diſobey him.

            </p>
            <p>Theſe aſſiſtants may be properly divided into Counſellors and Miniſters; the one to adviſe, the other to execute: without Counſel, no Kingdom, no State, no private houſe can ſtand; for, experience hath proved that Common weals have proſpered ſo long as good counſell did governe, but when favor, fear, or voluptuoſneſs entred, thoſe nations became diſordered; and in the end ſubject to ſlavery: <hi>Quiddam ſacrum profecto eſt conſultatio.

            <p>Counſellors are men ſpecially ſelected to give advice to Princes or Commonwealths, as well in peace as in war: the chief qualities required in ſuch men, are Fidelity and Knowledg; which two concurring do make them both good and wiſe, and conſequen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The election of Counſellors is and ought to be chiefly among men of long experience, and grave years; for as youth is fitteſt for action in reſpect of corporal ſtrength; ſo elder folk having felt the force of every fortune, and obſerved the courſe of worldly proceedings do ſeem moſt meet for conſultation:

Likewiſe to be conſtant and not to varie in opinion, either for feare or favor, is very commendable: Alſo as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty in giving Counſel eſcheweth all offences, and gaineth good will; ſo ſecrecy is the beſt and moſt ſecure meanes to govern all publick affairs: <hi>Res magnae ſuſtineri non poſſunt ab <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

many times impeacheth publick proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.

               </gap> a multitude have part, the execution ought to be otherwiſe, and as it were at an inſtant, which may haply ſeem terrible, but in effect is not. <hi>Frequens vindicta paucorum odium reprimit, omnium irritat. Sen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another meanes to ſatisfie a people offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded is to puniſh the Miniſters of cruelty, and with their blood to waſh away the common hatred. <hi>Piaculares publici odii victimae. Plin.</hi> By this King <hi>David</hi> did appeaſe the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next cauſe of diſcontent cometh of Impoſitions under which word is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended all levies of mony, a matter no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pleaſing to people, as that which they eſteem equall to their own lives. <hi>Pecunia anima &amp; ſanguis eſt mortalibus. Plaut.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, to remove hate conceived of this cauſe, there is nothing better then publick expoſtulation of neceſſity: for what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth or Kingdom can be without Tributes? <hi>Nulla quies gentium ſine armis, nec arma ſine ſtipendiis, nec ſtipendia ſine Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butis haberi queunt, Tac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond remedy againſt Hate for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions is to make moderate Levies and rare. For as <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperor was wont
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60768:30"/>
to ſay, a Sheep ſhould be fleeced not flead. <hi>Qui nimis emungit, elicit ſanguin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m. Tac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, alſo to eſchew the offence of People it behoveth the Prince to have a vigilant eye on Informers, Promoters, and ſuch fiſcal Miniſters, whoſe cruelty and covetous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings do oftentimes occaſion great hate; but this miſchief may be, though hardly, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred, either by chooſing honeſt Officers, or (proving otherwiſe) not only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine them but to uſe them as ſpunges, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primendi poſt qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m biberint. Suet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all impoſitions or Taxations, no cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty or force ought to be uſed, the ſecond cauſe to kindle hate: and to meet with that miſchief, nothing is better then to proceed moderately, and without extremity. <hi>Ne Boves ipſos, mox agros, poſtremò corpora ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitio aut poenae tradant, Tac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth remedy is the Princes own parſimony, not giving ſo largely to private perſons as thereby to be forced to take from the multitude. <hi>Magnae opes no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt help againſt hate is in taxation to proceed equally, indifferently, and without favor or reſpect; and that the Aſſeſſors of Taxes may be elected of the meaner ſort of people. <hi>Populus maximam fidem rerum ſuarum hab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theſe are the cheifeſt rules whereby to eſchew hate; but impoſſible it is for any Prince or Miniſter utterly to avoid it; for being himſelf good, he incurreth the offence of all bad folk: if he be evil, good men will hate him; this danger therefore Wiſe and Vertuous Princes have little regarded: becauſe hate may be gained as well by good as evil doing. <hi>Odia qui nimium timet, reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare neſcit. Sen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One other means to remove this error, is, to reward the good and well deſerving Subjects; for no man can think him cruell that for love to Vertue uſeth Auſteritie: which wil appear when he beſtoweth boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The other Vice which indangereth the State of Princes, we call Contempt, being a certain baſe and vile conceipt, which ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth into the Subjects, ſtrangers or ſervants, of the Prince and his Proceedings; for the Authority of a King may be reſembled to the powers of mans mind, whereunto the hands, the feet, the eyes, do by conſent obey. <hi>Vires imperii in conſenſu obedientium ſunt Livi.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The firſt way to ſuppreſs Sedition, is Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and excellent perſwaſion, which oftentimes worketh great effects among the multitude; chiefly when it proceedeth from ſome reverend and grave perſon, for his wiſdom and integrity of life honored: For the Prince himſelf is not to take this office in hand, unleſs neceſſity ſo inforce: <hi>Integra autoritas principis majoribus remediis ſervetur.

            </p>
            <p>If perſwaſion cannot prevail, then force muſt compel: But before ſuch violent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, uſe art and cunning either to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the people, or at leaſt to diſunite them; and rather if the Prince do offer fair and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is lawful alſo in ſuch caſes for Princes to uſe ſubtilty; and the ſame not prevailing, to waſh away the ſtain thereof with Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency: For when Arms are laid down, and

            </p>
            <p>The laſt cauſe of Sedition we named Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, which is a certain violent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, exceeding the Laws of God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The difference between Kings and Tyrants is this; the one imployeth arms in defence of Peace, the other uſeth them to terrifie thoſe of whom his cruelty hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved hate: <hi>Auferre, trucidare, raper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Remedies of theſe Miſchiefs which proceed from the violence of ſuch a Prince, are Perſecution or Patience. Many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſpirits have uſed the firſt; perſwading themſelves rather to die, then endure the ſight of a Tyrant. Alſo the <hi>Grecians</hi> did think it a ſervice acceptable to murther the perſon of ſuch an impious Prince. <hi>Graeci <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Nevertheleſs, in Chriſtian conſideration the other courſe is to be taken: Let pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence therefore incounter this miſchief; for ſeeing all Kings, as well the bad as the good be ſent by God, they muſt be indured. <hi>Res eſt gravis occidere regalem ſtirpem.

            </p>
            <p>Perſecution is not onely perilous, but for the moſt part infortunate: For thereof pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent revenge is taken by that Prince that ſucceedeth. <hi>Facinoris <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For as Fire, Floods, and other inevitable Plagues are neceſſarily to be ſuffered: So evil Princes in their covetouſneſs and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ought to be patiently indured, becauſe their office is to command, and ſubjects muſt obey. <hi>Indigna, digna habenda ſunt, Rex quae facit.

            <p>Ambaſſadors, Negotiants, and generally all other Miniſters of mean fortune, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with Princes and Superiors, muſt uſe great reſpect, ſhewing themſelves rather ceremonious then preſumptious, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their obligation great, for the

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avor and grace, they find in thoſe which might command them.</p>
            <p>It is no wiſdom ever to commend or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the actions of men by their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; for oftentimes ſome enterpriſes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by good Counſel, end unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and others unadviſedly taken in hand, have happy ſucceſs. Who ſo then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth inconſiderate Counſels for their fortunate event, thereby encourageth men to jar and diſcomfort the wiſer ſort to ſpeak what they know, and by experience have proved.</p>
            <p>In Actions publick and every other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great moment, the beginning is well to be conſidered: For afterwards it lieth not in our power, without diſhonor to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon what was begun.</p>
            <p>The time doth not always ſerve, nor is apt occaſion always offered to enterpriſe what we would; yet who ſo doth expect every opportunity, ſhall either attempt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, or if he do, the ſame for the moſt part turneth to his own diſadvant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
            <p>When any reſolution is taken, either with over-great haſte, or too much affection, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom it receiveth good ſucceſs: For he that doth the one, hath no leiſure to conſider; the other tranſporteth the minde ſo as it
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60768:50"/>
cannot conceive more then that which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently preſſeth.</p>
            <p>To theſe we adde others, I mean ſome of them that have leiſure, and are void of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, yet for want of natural capacity, or for continual negligence in their doings, never bring any thing well to paſs.</p>
            <p>Who ſo deſireth to be beloved in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, muſt reſt content with that which men do give, and the Laws allow him to take: So ſhall he neither incu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Laws, and Religion, may not in any well governed State be diſ-joyned; for every one of them in particular maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them all united.</p>
            <p>In actions of War, courage and conduct are of great neceſſity; yet all good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment conſiſteth in uſing the Vertues Moral; and in handling the matter of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Policy, it is fit to imitate the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of antient and approved Captains.</p>
            <p>Among Mortal Men, there is nothing more common then to believe the eſtate of one man to be better then an other; for hereof it cometh, that every one endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth rather to take from others with travel, then to enjoy his own with reſt.</p>

            <p>Whenſoever a man is ſo dangerouſly diſtreſſed, as either proceeding or ſtanding, he liveth in like peril, then doth it behove him in any wiſe, to reſolve upon action. The reaſon is, that ſo long as nothing is done, the ſame accidents that cauſed his dangers, do ſtill remain in their former force; but if he endeavor to enterpriſe ſomewhat, either he may meet with means to make him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, or at the hardeſt, ſhew himſelf of ſo great courage and wit, as he dare and can attempt a way to do it.</p>
            <p>It ſeemeth a thing of great difficulty, or rather impoſſible for any Prince or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to eſchue the evil ſpeech and bad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of men; for if they be good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, then they incur the backbiting of leud perſons; if evil, then will all good men exclaim againſt them.</p>
            <p>All Commonwealths ought to deſire peace, yet it is neceſſary ever to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the war; becauſe peace diſarmed, is weak, and without reputation: Therefore

For otherwiſe doing, whenſoever the Prince ſhall want means to pay, the Subjects like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe will fail of good will to ſerve. But he that faithfully loveth, doth neither in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity become arrogant, nor in contrary Fortune retire, or complain of the ſmall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor he findeth: For (till death) love and life remain at the Princes Commandment.</p>

            <p>Greatly are Princes deceived if in the election of Miniſters they more reſpect their own particular affection, then the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the perſon elected.</p>

But this worlds corruption, and our frailty is ſuch, as eaſily and often for our particular intereſt we incline to the worſt; which was the cauſe that wiſe Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers found out reward and puniſhment: the one to incite men to good, the other to fear them from being evill.</p>
            <p>A Tyrant indeavoreth to maintain his Eſtate by three means. Firſt, he practiſeth to hold all Subjects in extream awe, and to be baſely minded, to the end they ſhould want courage to take arms againſt him. Secondly, he kindleth diffidence and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord among the great men; thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move occaſion of conſpiracy and combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Laſtly, he holdeth them diſarmed and idle, ſo as they ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Subjects in love and obedience: for in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the end, they ought not, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the other they cannot attempt any thing contrary to the governors will and their duty.</p>
            <p>The Laws and Ordinances of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale made at the beginning thereof when men were good, do often prove unprofitable when they are become evill; and therefore new Laws are made according to the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which happen.</p>
            <p>The diſcontent or diſorder of people is ever occaſioned by the inequality of their goods, becauſe the poorer ſort would be made equall to the rich: but the offence that grows among great men is the deſire of honor; for they being equal, do indeavor to aſpire to equall authority.</p>
            <p>A Prince that deſireth by means of his Ambaſſador to deceive an other Prince, muſt firſt abuſe his own Ambaſſador, to the end he ſhould do and ſpeak with more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, being indeed perſwaded that the intent and meaning of his Maſter is ſimple which happily would not, were he privy that his Princes meaning were to diſſemble. This courſe is alſo commonly holden by thoſe that by imployment of a third perſon would perſwade any thing fained or falſe.</p>

treaty of Peace or League of Amity, the Promiſes, Vowes, and Oathes of Princes are of great effect; yet becauſe fidelity in a man is not ever certain, and time doth daily offer occaſions of variation, there is no aſſurance ſo ſecure and good as to ſtand ſo prepared as the Enemy may want able means how to offend.</p>
            <p>To reſolve in matters doubtfull, ot anſwer requeſts which we are not willing to grant, the leaſt offenſive way is not to uſe direct denial, but by delaies prolong the time and ſo in place of effect, afford good expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

            <p>Albeit great troubles and continual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity ſeem inſupportable; yet is there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more dangerous, then ouermuch proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity; and being preſſed by new appetites, they diſturb their own ſecurity.</p>

            <p>That Peace ought to be deſired which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth ſuſpition, which aſſureth us from perill, which bringeth quiet certain, and acquitteth us of expences: But when it worketh contrary effects, it may be called

a dangerous war covered with the name of deceitfull truſt, not unlike a perilous poyſon miniſtred in lieu of a wholſom Medicine.</p>
            <p>The effect of things, and not externall ſhow or ſeeming, ought to be regarded; yet it is incredible what great grace is gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by courteous ſpeech and affability: the reaſon whereof is as I ſuppoſe that every man beleiveth he doth merit more then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he is worthy, and conſequently hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth himſelf injured when ſoever he findeth men not to afford him like eſtimation.</p>
            <p>Men ought in any wiſe, to refrain to doe or ſay any thing which may offend, for which reſpect it were great folly either in preſence or abſence to utter diſpleaſing ſpeech unleſs neceſſity inforceth.</p>

            <p>In giving Council divers things are to be obſerved; but amongſt them are two of moſt importance. Firſt, it behooveth, that he who is Counſelled ſhould be wiſe; for ſeeing Council is nothing elſe but a certain conſiderate diſcourſe of things to be done or not done, if he who is to take Council be not of diſcretion, then will he refuſe all good advice offered, and rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ncline to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60768:55"/>
that which his own fancie affecteth becauſe the want of Judgement draweth him to take pleaſure in vain things; and as one incapable of what is good and true, will follow that which is evil and falſe: ſo on the other ſide if he that giveth Council be not faithfull, then will he a Thouſand waies diſguiſe and diſſemble the truth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently miſcarry the mind of him that is Counſelled: yea in the end utterly abuſe him.</p>
            <p>The affairs and proceedings of the world are ſo variable and accompanied with ſo many chances and changes, as impoſſible it ſeemeth to judge what is beſt: therefore experience enformeth, that the conjectures of the moſt wiſe prove vain and uncertain. I therefore miſlike the Judgment of thoſe men, that will let ſlip opportunity of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent good (though it be ſmall) for feare of a future evill, notwithſtanding it be greater, unleſs the evill be very near at hand, or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. For if that doe not follow which is feared, then wilt thou repent to have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that which was deſired.</p>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60768:55"/>
the reaſon is, that men having at the firſt given credit to common report, do make thereof ſo deep an impreſſion as afterwards without great difficulty cannot be removed.</p>
            <p>The Bodies of Men, Munition, and Mony may juſtly be called the ſinews of War, yet of them the two firſt are more neceſſary, for Men and Arms have means to find Mony and Meate: but Mony and Meate cannot ſo eaſily find Soldiers and ſwords.</p>
            <p>One wiſe Generall having but a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, is more to be feared and eſteemed then twenty Commanders of equall Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: for they being commonly of divers humors, or judging diverſly, do never, or very rarely what is to be done, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently loſe much time before any reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be taken.</p>
            <p>A Prince of mean force ought not in any wiſe to adventure his Eſtate upon one daies fight: for if he be victorious he gaineth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but glory: but if he loſe, he is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruined.</p>
            <p>The moſt part of men are delighted with Hiſtories, for the variety of accidents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained: yet are there few that will imitate what they read, and finde done by others; being perſwaded that imitation is not only hard but impoſſible, as though the Heavens and Men were changed in their

Motion or Order, and Power, which they anciently had.</p>
            <p>The Nature of men is ſuch as will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devor any thing good, unleſs they be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thereunto: for where liberty abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, there confuſion and diſorder follow. It is therefore ſuppoſed that Hunger and Poverty make men induſtrious: but good Lawes inforce them to be honeſt; for if men were of themſelves good, then Laws were needleſs.</p>
            <p>There are two kinds of Adulation: The Firſt proceedeth from a ſubtil malice: The Second cometh by an ordinary uſe of converſation; the one tendeth to profit and deceiving; the other hath no further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign then a reſpect or fear to offend. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the moſt honeſt are in ſome ſort bound. Whoſo bindeth himſelf to flattery, doth thereby bewray his intent, either to gain, or not to loſe that he hath. For the perſon flattered is alwaies ſuperior to him that doth flatter, or at leaſt one as may in ſome ſort ſtand him in ſtead. It may therefore be inferred that only men of baſe and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition, and ſuch as cannot help or hurt, be free from flatterers. And contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe magnanimous and fortunate folke, proud men and ſuch as content themſelves with their preſent eſtate, are ſeldom found to be flatterers.</p>

Every wiſe Prince doth preſuppoſe that times of trouble may come, and that all ſuch occaſions he ſhal be forced to uſe the ſervice of men diverſly qualified.

            <p>In ancient times Princes and Governors were wont when peace and ſecurity were moſt like to continue, to find or fain occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to draw their Subjects to fear, to the end that doubt might move them to be more carefull of their own weldoing; for well they knew it a general defect in men to be reachleſs, and never willing to uſe induſtry; unleſs by neceſſity they were conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>All Hiſtories do ſhew, and wiſe Polititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do hold it neceſſary, that for the well governing of every Commonweal it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooveth to preſuppoſe that all men are evil, and will declare themſelves ſo to be when occaſion is offered; for albeit ſome inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience doth lie hid for a time, it proceedeth from a covert occaſion, which for want of experience was not found untill time the Mother of Truth diſcover it.</p>

Neutrality is always a thing dangerous and diſallowable, becauſe it oftendeth all parties: He that is ſtrong looketh to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in his greatneſs; and he that is weak not being defended, holdeth himſelf offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: the one is not aſſured from Foes, and the other holdeth no friends.</p>
            <p>Albeit neutrality procure preſent quiet and ſecurity, during the troubles of others; yet after the ſamefalleth out a diſadvantage, becauſe it entertaineth a certain falſeneſs, and ſo in ſhort ſpace will be perceived; not unlike thoſe men that borrow upon uſury; for albeit they enjoy a certain time, without trouble or charge, yet the ſame being ſpent, and the day of payment come, they then feel the great danger which their ſhort plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure hath purchaſed.</p>

in all our deliberations to conſider what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience is leaſt, and chooſe that, as the beſt: for to find all perfect, void and ſecure of ſuſpect or imperfection, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>

            <p>It is often, or rather ever ſeen, that the force of Leagues not uſed in their firſt heat, becomes cold; becauſe Suſpition ſoon enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, which in ſhort ſpace will deſtroy what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was concluded, and may not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out long time be rejoyned.</p>
            <p>The power of Ambition which poſſeſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the mindes of men, is ſuch, as rarely or never ſuffereth them to reſt: The reaſon thereof is, That nature hath framed in them a certain diſpoſition to deſire all things, but not to obtain them; ſo as our deſires being greater then our power, thereof followeth diſcontent and evil ſatisfaction. Hereof alſo proceedeth the variation of Fortune; for ſome men deſiring to get, and others fearing to loſe that they have gotten, do occaſion one man to injure another, and conſequently Publick Wars do follow; by means whereof, one Countrey is ruined, and an other inlarged.</p>
            <p>Princes of great power, and cheifly thoſe that are Inhabitants of the North, having many Children, were wont to be much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the Wars, as well to win unto
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60768:59"/>
themſelves honor, as alſo to get poſſeſſions for their Sons; which manner of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings did oftentimes remove ſuch diſturbance as the plurality of Brethren bringeth. Theſe and other reaſons induced Princes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt War againſt thoſe Kingdoms, which in their opinion ſeemed eaſily conquered, or whereunto they can pretend litle; for by colour thereof they may the rather juſtifie their proceedings.</p>
            <p>When a Prince deferreth to anſwer an Ambaſſador, it proceedeth from ſome of theſe reſpects; either becauſe he will take time to reſolve himſelf of ſomewhat where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he doubteth, or that he intendeth covert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deny that which is demanded, or that he eſteemeth not the Prince that doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or that he diſdaineth the perſon by whom the demand is made, or elſe that he intendeth to hear from his own Miniſters to be better reſolved: Wherefore a diſcreet Negotiator ought in ſuch caſes to conſider which of theſe reaſons move the Prince where he is employed, to entertain him with delays, and make his diſpatch according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

            <p>Whoſo deſireth to govern well and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, it behoveth him to have a vigilant eye to the proceedings of great Princes, and to conſider ſeriouſly of their deſigns: For it is a matter of ſmall difficulty to live in peace with him who deſireth our amity, and provideth for others that endeavor to offend us.</p>
            <p>The intelligences that Princes ſtudy to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, are procured by divers means: Some are brought by report, ſome vented by converſation and ſounding, ſome by means of eſpials; but the moſt ſure and credible accurrents, are thoſe which come from Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, cheifly thoſe that either for the greatneſs of their Prince, or their own Vertue, be of moſt reputation. For thoſe men converſing daily with great perſonages, and pondering diligently their Manners, Words, Wiſdom, and the order of each mans proceedings, yea, of the Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, may with commodity attain unto mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

            <p>A dangerous thing it is in all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths by continual puniſhing, to hold the mindes of Subjects in ſuſpition; for
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60768:61"/>
men ever fearing their ruine, will (without reſpect) determine to ſave themſelves, and as men deſperate, attempt innovation. All capital executions ought therefore to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted ſuddenly, and as it were at one inſtant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The intent of every wiſe Prince that maketh War, either by election or ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to gain and hold what is gotten: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to uſe the matter ſo as thereby he may inrich himſelf, and not impoveriſh his own people or Countrey.</p>
            <p>He that inlargeth his Dominions, doth not always increaſe his power; but he that increaſeth in force as well as in Dominion, ſhall thereby grow great; otherwiſe he gaineth no more then is ſhortly to be loſt, and conſequently he ruineth himſelf: For who ſpends more in the War, then he gains by Victory, loſeth both labor and Coſt.</p>
            <p>Every Prince and Commonwealth muſt above all things take heed, that no neceſſity how great ſoever, do perſwade him to bring into his Dominion any Auxiliary Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; becauſe the hardeſt conditions the enemy can offer, are more eaſie then is ſuch a reſolution.</p>
            <p>A Prince ſheweth his ruine at hand, whenſoever he beginneth to break the Laws
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60768:61"/>
and Cuſtoms, which are antient, and have been long time obeyed by the people of his Dominion.</p>
            <p>That Prince which careth to keep himſelf ſecure from conſpiracy, ought rather to fear thoſe to whom he hath done over-great favors, then them whom he hath much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured: For theſe want opportunities, the other do not; and both their deſires are as one; becauſe the Appetite of commanding<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is always as much or more then the deſire of revenge.</p>
            <p>Whenſoever a Prince diſcovers a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, he muſt well conſider the quality thereof, meaſuring the force of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators with his own; and finding them many and mighty, the knowledge thereof is to be diſſembled, until the Princes power be prepared to oppoſe them; otherwiſe he hazardeth his own ſecurity.</p>
            <p>It hath been by long experience found better to ſend one General to an Army, though he be of mean ſufficiency, then to give the ſame Authority to two or more excellent perſonages with equal Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>He that coveteth to be over-much loved, often times becomes contemptible; and he that endeavoreth to be over-much feared, is ever hated: And to hold the mean between
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60768:62"/>
them, cannot be exactly done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nature will not ſo permit.</p>
            <p>Whoſo aſpireth to any dignity, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve himſelf to endure the envy of men, and never to be moved for any offence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againſt him, though they that be offended, be his dear Friends: Neither ſhall he for the firſt affront or encounter, relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh his hope; for he that conſtantly maketh head againſt the aſſault of Fortune, ſhall after with facility arive where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned.</p>
            <p>In giving Council to a Prince or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and therewith deſiring to eſchue danger and offence, no other mean is to be taken then that the Counſellor ſhall without paſſion or perſwaſion pronounce his opinion, and never to affirm any thing as a reſolution, but with modeſty to defend that he ſpeaketh; ſo as the Prince which follows his advice, may ſeem to do it vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, and not forced by the importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of him that gave the Council.</p>
            <p>A diſcreet Captain being in the Field againſt the enemy, of whoſe vertue he hath had no proof, ought firſt by light skirmiſhes to feel of what vertue he is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe any general adventure, to the end that Terror or Fame ſhould not daunt nor diſcourage his own Soldiers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:60768:62"/>
Albeit Fraud be in all actions deteſted, yet is the ſame in Martial enterpriſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and glorious: For that Captain who compaſſeth his deſigns by wit or ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem, is no leſs commended then he that vanquiſheth the Enemy by violence and Force.</p>
            <p>In times of extremity, when reſolution muſt be taken for the having or utter loſſe of the State, then no regard is to be had of Juſtice or Injuſtice, Mercy or Cruelty, Honor or Ignominy, but rather ſetting aſide all reſpects, that courſe is to be follow which defended the lives and liberties of men.</p>
            <p>Whoſo deſireth to know what will be hereafter let him think of that is paſt; for the World hath ever bin in in a circular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution: Whatſoever is now, was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore and things paſt or preſent are no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſuch as ſhall be again: <hi>redit orbis in orbem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Prince that deſireth to obtain any thing at the hand of another, muſt if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble urge a ſuddain anſwer, and lay before him that is moved, a neceſſity to reſove preſently, giving him to underſtand that denial or delaies may breed a perilous and ſuddain indignation.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more difficult, doubtful and dangerous then to attempt Innovation:
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60768:63"/>
for he that taketh in hand an enterprize of ſuch quality, maketh all thoſe his Enemies which lived well under the old order, and findeth them cold defenders that affect his novelties, which coldneſs proceedeth chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of incredulity; for men are not eaſily induced to beleeve a new thing till experience hath proved it to be good.</p>
            <p>There is no art nor other knowledg ſo ſeemly and neceſſary for a Prince as the Art Military with the ordinances and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline thereof: for that is the only skill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in him that commandeth, and ſuch a vertue as doth not only maintain them that are born Princes, but often advanceth pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men to that dignity.</p>
            <p>The deep impreſſions which old injuries make in the minds of great men cannot with new benefits be razed out; it is alſo to be remembred that injuries be done all together: For they offend the leſſe, and wil be forgotten the ſooner; but benefits ſhould by little and little be beſtowed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o ſhal the memory of them long continue.</p>
            <p>A ſmall pleaſure or diſpleaſure preſently done, doth move more then a great good turn beſtowed in times paſt; for the taſte of things preſent doth make a deeper impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the minds of men, then doth the memory
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60768:63"/>
of things paſt, or expectation of things to come.</p>
            <p>It is a matter of ſmall difficulty to ſound the diſcont ntment of other men. For every one doth willingly tell the well and ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of friends, and likewiſe how much or how little foes can do, if we have pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to hear, which patience is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all good ſpeed; but he that delighteth to ſpeak much, and hear little, ſhall ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form others more then he himſelf can learn.</p>
            <p>Among other dangers which a Prince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth by being diſarmed, the greateſt is, that thereby he becometh contemptible; for no compariſon there is between men armed and them that are diſarmed: and no reaſon there is that he that is armed ſhould yield obedience to him that is diſarmed, neither is it like that a Prince diſarmed can be ſecure from his own Subjects armed.</p>
            <p>A Prince ignorant of Martial knowledg, among other misfortunes cannot be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or truſted of his own Soldiers; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooveth him therefore as well in time of peace as war to exerciſe arms, which may be done by two meanes; the one by action of body, the other by contemplation of mind. The body may be exerciſed in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hawking, and ſuch like paſtimes;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60768:64"/>
thereby to be made apt to endure travel: his mind likewiſe may be informed by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Hiſtories, and the conſideration of actions performed by excellent Captains, obſerving the occaſion of their victories or loſſes to the end he may imitate the one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and eſchew the other.</p>
            <p>He that doth not as other men do, but endeavoureth that which ought to be done, ſhall thereby rather incur peril then preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for whoſo laboreth to be ſincerely perfect and good, ſhall neceſſarily periſh, living among men that are generally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
            <p>A Prince that uſeth liberality to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, ought not to regard the infamy of Miſerable, becauſe his parſimony will in time enable him to be liberal, and ſo may declare himſelf to be, having by parſimony increaſed his power, and therefore without impoſing upon the people, may defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from all ſuch as will make war; ſo ſhall he uſe liberality to all them from whom he taketh nothing, who are infinite; and uſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerlineſs to thoſe only to whom he giveth, who are but few.</p>
            <p>There is nothing that conſumeth it ſelf like to liberality; for if it be long uſed, it taketh away the meanes to continue it, and conſequently doth make men poor and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60768:64"/>
baſely minded: or elſe to eſchew poverty they ſhall be forced to extortion and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come odious.</p>
            <p>It is better to incur the name of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous (which is a ſcandal without hate) then with deſire to be accounted libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, deſerve the infamie of oppreſſion (an ignominy accompanied with hatred.)</p>
            <p>A Prince ought to be ſlow in believing, and adviſed in proceeding; he ſhould alſo beware not to make himſelf over much fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but in all his actions ſhew great wiſdom tempered with curteſie; ſo ſhall not over much confidence induce him to be careleſs, nor over much diffidence render him intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>Whoſo obſerveth, ſhall ſee that men of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, leſs reſpect him whom they love, then him whom they fear. For love is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by a certain reciproque obligation, which becauſe men are evill, uſeth to be by every occaſion of profit broken. But fear is continued by a certain dread of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which never faileth.</p>

And that Prince is by victory impoveriſhed when the enemy notwithſtanding he be victored can ſtill maintain himſelf, and the ſpoyls and poſſeſſions are not taken to the uſe of the Prince victorious, but imparted unto his Soldiers. For then may he be thought in his own looſing infortunate, and in victory unhappy; for if he be vanquiſhed, then

And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in vain do they labor, that go about by ſuit to ſtir them to pity, by gifts to gain them, or by threats to fear them.</p>
            <p>Who ſo is perſwaded that any Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal can continue diſunited, doth greatly deceive himſelf: True it is, that ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions do maintain the Eſtate, but other do indamage the ſame They which do harm, are ſuch as with Sects and Pertakings be accompanied; they which help without Sects and Pertakings be maintained. A wiſe Governor therefore, albeit he cannot ſo

It is therefore to be noted, that the Citizens of every E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, may aſpire to Reputation, either by private or publick means. Reputation by publick means, is gained chiefly in the War, either by obtaining victory in ſome Battel, or ſurpriſing of ſome City; or elſe by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming ſome Ambaſſage d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, Factions, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings do grow: And as Reputation thus gained is dangerous, ſo the other without Faction is profitable; becauſe the ſame is founded on Common welfare, and no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate profit: And albeit among Citizens of this ſort, will oft ariſe great hate, yet want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing followers for their particular profit, the State ſhall not be indangered, but rather ſtrengthned; for every man endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring to deſerve well, will hold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf within the bounds of Civil life, and by Vertuous Merits labor to be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>

            <p>The beſt means which wiſe Captains can uſe to make their Soldiers reſolute, is to take from them all hope, which reſolution may alſo be increaſed with the love of our Country and confidence in the Captain: for confidence groweth by the valor of men, and Diſcipline in former Victories, and truſt repoſed in the leader. The love of our Country is naturall, but the aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There is nothing of ſo great force to hold an Armie united, as the reputation of the Captain, which proceedeth only from his vertue; for neither Dignity nor Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity without Valor can work that effect.</p>
            <p>The firſt care that a Captain muſt have, is to hold his Soldiers well puniſhed and paied; for where payment faileth, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought not to be inflicted: and conſequently
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60768:69"/>
no reaſon it is to puniſh him for robbery, whom want of pay enforceth to ſhift; but where the Soldier is payed, and not puniſhed (offending) then will he without reſpect become inſolent towards his Captain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is a cuſtom very honorable not to promiſe more then thou wilt aſſuredly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme: yet true it is that whoſoever is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied (though juſtly) doth reſt illcontented; for men indeed are not governed by reaſon: otherwiſe it is for him that promiſeth: and ſo good promiſes ſhall ſtand in ſtead of performance; beſides that, he may find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe enough, becauſe the moſt part of men are ſo ſimple, that faire words alone have power to abuſe them, cheifly when they proceed from a perſon of Reputation and Authority. The beſt way therefore is not to promiſe preciſely, but entertain the Suitors with anſwers general, and full of good hope: yet not ſuch as ſhall directly and abſolutely bind.</p>
            <p>The greateſt and moſt material diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that uſe to ariſe between the Nobility and People, are cauſed by the diverſity of humors, the one laboring to command, the other endevoring not to obey; ſo as all troubles and diſorders in every Commonweale
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60768:70"/>
do thereof receive nutriment.</p>
            <p>The City which is maintained rather by Factions then Lawes, ſo ſoon as one Faction is become ſtrong and without oppoſition, the ſame of neceſſity muſt be divided in it ſelf: for thoſe particular cauſes which were at the firſt taken, are not of force enough to maintain it.</p>
            <p>It is the nature of men not to indure any diſcom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>odity, unleſs neceſſity do thereunto enforce them: which may apparently be perceived by their habitations; for as the feare of Warr draweth them to places of ſtrength (for their defence) ſo that perill being paſt, they do for the moſt part remove themſelves to inhabit Countries of more commodity and profit.</p>
            <p>It may ſeem ſtrange, and no even meaſure (yet approved by experience) that where many of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap> but great and grievous crimes be rewarded. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, where many receive wrong, few ſeek revenge. For injuries univerſal, are with more patience then particular offences en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.</p>
            <p>All or the greateſt part of men that have aſpired to riches or power, have attained thereunto either by force or fraud: and without they have by craft or cruelty gained,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60768:70"/>
to cover the foulneſs of their fact, they call purchaſe as a name more honeſt. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he that for want of will or wit uſeth not thoſe means, muſt reſt in ſervitude and poverty. The reaſon thereof is that as nature hath laid before men the chief of all fortunes, ſo ſhe diſpoſes them rather to Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine then honeſt Induſtrie, and more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to bad then good endeavors: hereof it cometh, that one man eateth an other, and he that is weakeſt muſt alwaies goe to the worſt.</p>
            <p>Where neceſſity forceth, boldneſs is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Wiſdom, and in great enterpriſes perill is not to be made accompt of. For thoſe attempts that begin with danger, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies end with honor, or reward; alſo from one perill there is no way to eſcape, but by entring into another.</p>
            <p>A wiſe man ought not to deſire to inhabit that County where men have more Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity then Lawes. For indeed that Country deſerves to be deſired where every one may ſecurely enjoy his own; not that, where with facility it may be taken away; and that friends for feare to loſe their own, are inforced to forſake them.</p>
            <p>Some Magiſtrates either by over great zeale or ignorance take a courſe of Rigor, which being for the preſent favored, they
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60768:71"/>
are ever the more imployed, as men meet to extirpate inconveniences.</p>
            <p>But thereby the Subjects are often drawn into deſperation, and conſequently have recourſe unto armes, as their uttermoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. In this caſe a wiſe Prince for appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the people is forced to diſallow his Miniſters, and ſometimes alſo to inflict pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick puniſhment.</p>
            <p>A Prince naturally ſuſpicious, and having about him perſons inclined to envie, is eaſily induced to miſtruſt thoſe men that have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him with moſt ſufficiency: which dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they cannot eſchew, becauſe they who are worthieſt commendation are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times envied by ſuch perſons as have acceſs unto the Prince.</p>
            <p>Who ſo cannot endure both envy and hate, muſt re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rain to enterpriſe great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: for great honors being deſired of many, it behooveth him that aſpireth unto them, to be for his dignity envied, and for his Authority hated; which Authority albeit the ſame be well uſed, yet they who hate or envie (perſwading themſelves it might be better handled) indeavor to oppreſs that power, as fearing it will be worſe.</p>
            <p>Among other things which worketh the inconveniences of Commonweales, Ambition
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60768:71"/>
and Deſperation are cheif; of both, Deſperation is worſt: for Ambition may attend occaſion; Deſperation will not, as that cannot endure delaies. Hiſtorians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to write the actions of men, ought to ſet down the ſimple truth, and not ſay any thing for love or hatred: alſo to chuſe ſuch an opportunity for writing as it may be lawful to think what they will, and write what they think, which is a rare happineſs of the time.</p>
            <p>In commending or diſallowing the actions of men it is a courſe very requiſite to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the beginning, the proceeding, and end: ſo ſhall we ſee the reaſons and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of things, and not their bare events only, which for the moſt part are governed by fortune.</p>
            <p>It is a matter of much neceſſity, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man, and chiefly a Prince ſhould in his firſt actions, give ſome teſtimony of Vertue; for falling at firſt into obloquie, doe he well or ill, all is ill taken.</p>
            <p>The Cuſtome of the Common people is to judge rather by their eyes then by their eares: which is the cauſe they allow more of external ſhew then inward vertue: and true it is, where excellency of mind, and beauty of body concur, the commendation due to ſuch a perſon is far the greater.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60768:72"/>

            </p>
            <p>A Prince or great perſonage that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly endureth adverſity deſerveth great praiſe: yet greater commendation is due to him that beareth himſelf modeſtly in his happineſs. For miſeries are oft born with patience, but felicity corrupteth.</p>
            <p>To be deſcended of Princes or great Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, is a matter of meer fortune, and ſo to be eſteemed: but adoption proceedeth from the Judgment of men; therefore ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth incorrupt and ſeldom abuſed.</p>
            <p>It hath been long obſerved, and is a rule which rarely faileth, that he ſhall be ever ſuſpected of the Prince in poſſeſſion, whom men acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pt worthy to be a Prince in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
            <p>It hath been a uſe very ancient to give credit to Aſtrologers, and other ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who by their ſtar-learning or blind di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination, take upon them to tell of things to come. The reaſon thereof is that the moſt part of men beleive that ſooneſt which they leaſt underſtand; And if they ſee the event of a prediction though it hapneth by meer chance to fall out according to that was premiſed, thereupon they ſettle ſo firme an impreſſion, as albeit many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faile, yet the good conceipt of their cunning cannot be removed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:60768:72"/>
Liberality is a vertue which gaineth love, but much are they deceived whom riot in lieu thereof abuſeth. To caſt away and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume is ſoon learned, but to give in good order few have the skill.</p>
            <p>In time of ſuddain mutiny, conſpiracy, and offence of people, the wiſeſt reſolution is not to oppoſe force to prevent fury, but rather give ſpace for the bad to amend, and the good to conſent: for treaſons prevaile on the ſudden, but good Council gathers forces by leaſure.</p>
            <p>Mature deliberation ought ever to be uſed, but when armes are to determine, ſpeedy execution is the beſt: becauſe no delay in that enterpriſe is fit which cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended before it be ended.</p>
            <p>Who ſo is pleaſed to obſerve the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of men in Authority, ſhall obſerve that ſome of them hold a plain courſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect: others projecting for time to come do forecaſt how to hold their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent good fortune or at leaſt to eſcape dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: for they miſtruſting preſent proſperity and fearing a change, prepare beforehand ſome private friends to oppoſe againſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick hatred: whereof may be inferred, that no care is taken of innocency, but every one ſtudieth how to paſs without puniſhment.</p>

            <p>It is a matter of no great moment, yet alwaies worthy the noting, that any exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior behavior, or garment preſenting pride or greatneſs, chiefly in perſons lately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, though no man be thereby intereſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or injured, doth move in others a certain offence: for the nature of man is ſuch, as beholdeth the new proſperity of others with an envious eye, and wiſheth a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of fortune nowhere ſo much as in thoſe we have known in equall degree with our ſelves</p>
            <p>In all enterpriſes of Warr, (if preſent neceſſity doth not otherwiſe require) lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and deliberation ought to be uſed; for often it ſufficeth in lieu of Wiſdom, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

courteſie and Chriſtian profeſſion, that men are far more mindful of injuries done unto them, then of benefits received by them. The reaſon thereof is, that Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs is accompted a burden, but Revenge is ſweet, and reckoned a great gain.</p>

            <p>The ſucceſs of the War cheifly dependeth on the Reputation of the Prince, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining, the vertue alſo of the Soldiers fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: Likewiſe the fidelity of the people
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60768:75"/>
decayeth, and their money to maintain the War, ceaſeth; contrariwiſe, the courage of the enemy is increaſed, they that ſtood doubtful become reſolved, and every diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty augmenteth.</p>
            <p>The Authority which Princes give, is chiefly in reſpect of Wiſdom and Valor: Yet true it is, that for the moſt part, they accompt them the wiſeſt men that can beſt accommodate themſelves to their humor.</p>
            <p>The greateſt diſtreſs and difficulty which can come to any Army, doth proceed of theſe cauſes: Want of money, ſcarcity of victuals, hatred of people, diſcord of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, diſobedience of Soldiers, and their flying to the enemy, either of neceſſity or freewil.</p>
            <p>A Prince or great Magiſtrate having long maintained the reputation of Wiſdom and Vertue, muſt take heed that no raſh or dangerous reſolution do taint the Honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Fame of his former life: For to be t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with anger againſt his own profit, is lightneſs; and to eſteem ſmall dangers more then great, is want of judgment.</p>
            <p>A Prince or Perſon of great eſtate, muſt be wary not to inure the conceit of double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dealing: For little ſincerity and truſt is looked in his actions, of whom there is an opinion of craft and falſhood conceived.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:60768:76"/>
Experience hath always proved, that whatſoever the moſt part of men deſire, rarely cometh to paſs: The reaſon hereof is, that the effects of Humane actions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly depend on the will of a few; and their intentions ever differing from the greater number<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the end and ſucceſs cannot be other then as pleaſeth the few that are to direct them.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more dangerous then to enterpriſe a War, or other actions of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance upon popular perſwaſion; for ſuch expectations are vain, and ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns fallible: Alſo the Fury of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is great, when danger is little or far off; but perils growing great and near, their courageth quaileth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as they whoſe Paſſions have no rule or meaſure.</p>
            <p>It is ſtrange to ſee how apt men are to doubt diſpleaſure threatned by enemies, cheifly when they draw near; for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do naturally over-much fear dangers at hand, and eſteem leſs then is fit of things preſent: Alſo to make ſmall accompt of thoſe that are far from them, becauſe divers remedies may be hoped as well by time, as other accidents.</p>
            <p>The offenſive words or anſwers of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, proceeding from great Princes, ought never to admit diſpleaſure into the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60768:76"/>
mindes of them againſt whom they are ſpoken: For having by Speech uttered a great part of Choler, the edge of their Deeds becomes the calmer, and more eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed: Such is the condition of noble and generous Spirits.</p>
            <p>To judge right of other mens merit, ſeems of great difficulty; for time and tryal is thereto required; alſo it is not eaſie to anſwer the expectation of men, but oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inconſiderate, and not meaſured in due proportion.</p>
            <p>It is a part of great diſcretion to divide the ſeaſons of Affairs and Vacations: For as it fitteth well a Prince or Perſon of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in times of Audience and Judgment, to be grave, heedful, and auſtere: So thoſe Offices performed, all ſhew of authority and ſad looks ought to be ſet apart; for by that means, neither courteous behavior ſhall detract from the Reverence due to his place, nor ſeverity diminiſh the love which to his Behavior appertaineth.</p>
            <p>Magiſtrates muſt look into all things, but not exact all things to rigor. Light faults may be pardoned, but great offences ſeverely corrected; yet not always proceeding to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, but oft contented with repentance. To be bitter in rebuking is alſo fit for a Magiſtrate, ſhewing himſelf ſowre to the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60768:77"/>
bad, and ſweet to the good; framing both Countenance and Condition according to the merit of men; and be perſwaded that it is more honeſt to offend, then to hate.</p>
            <p>Soldiers muſt be encouraged in all For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes to ſtand reſolved, and not to be dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any paſſed miſadventure; ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a time and opportunity of revenge; which commonly cometh to paſswhere mens mindes are united: For common danger muſt be repelled with union and concord.</p>
            <p>Among other reaſons wherewith Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are encouraged, Neceſſity and Diſtreſs doth oft inforce them: For as men of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue perform the actions of Arms for Honor, ſo the coward muſt do them for his ſecurity.</p>
            <p>All Enterpriſes attempted by Arms, are honorable; but thoſe that are done in Countreys remote, are more praiſable: For the leſs they be in knowledge, the greater is the glory to atchieve them.</p>
            <p>To be truly and faithfully loved, is a thing greatly to be deſired; for Terror and Fear are weak works of Affection: For they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, he that ceaſeth to fear, will ſoon begin to hate; and as they that by force are kept under, obey with ill will; ſo they that govern without Line juſtly, rule againſt Right.</p>
            <p>Some men either deſerving to be accompted
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60768:77"/>
of excellent wiſdom, or ſingular in that skill whereof they make pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is a matter of much difficulty, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impoſſible for any Prince to maintain the Law, Civil or Military without ſeverity: For where men hope to be eaſily pardoned, there are they apt to offend. Contrarily where mens actions are preciſely fitted, there do they live in over great aw, and Hatred doth always accompany ſuch Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The beſt courſe therefore is to puniſh offences ſeverely, and reward vertuous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits liberally; ſo ſhall Fear be converted to reverend reſpect, and none have cauſe to complain: For as it lies in each mans power to ſhun offending, ſo is it in their power alſo to deſerve well, and merit reward.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever after mature deliberation, hath reſolved what courſe to hold in the Action he hath in hand, muſt not after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent or fear any difficulty: For ſuch thoughts would break the vigor of the Minde, and impeach the proceedings of that which was
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60768:78"/>
reſolved. And albeit ſome differences do happily ariſe, yet muſt he believe that every other courſe would have been accompanied with the ſame or greater impediments.</p>
            <p>Yong men for the warmneſs of their Blood, and for not having before-time been deceived by Fortune, more willingly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe Actions rather honorable then ſevere. But old men as well for that their heat is cooled, as alſo for having attempted many things in vain, make choice of Enterpriſes ſevere rather then thoſe that are followed with Fame and Glory.</p>
            <p>The greatneſs of one Prince is nothing elſe but the ruine and diſtreſs of another: Likewiſe his ſtrength is the weakneſs and oppreſſion of others.</p>
            <p>Some Conqueſts are of ſuch quality, as albeit a victorious Captain merit triumphal Honor; yet a modeſt refuſal becomes his greater glory.</p>
            <p>The Dignity of Magiſtrates is not aſſured without Arms; for when Obedience fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, no other means is left to continue a people united.</p>
            <p>As willing Obedience in Subjects is the Princes ſtrength, ſo is the ſame their own ſecurity: For as by the Princes Authority the people are governed, ſo by their conſent he is maintained.</p>

Three things men covet with immoderate deſire, Lands, Riches, and Honors; but as ſeldom they compaſs their full content, ſo are they for the moſt part to endure a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny far other then they wiſhed.</p>
            <p>Strange it is, yet by experience proved true, that in time of danger, Fortune or (rather Deſtiny) ſo much amazeth the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of wiſe men, as ſeldom they conceive what reſolution is beſt to be taken.</p>
            <p>No great Free-City can long continue quiet, unleſs the ſame be uſed to foreign aſſaults: For wanting foes without, ſome inward enmity will ariſe, not unlike to ſtrange bodies of men, which being ſecure from external injury, are nevertheleſs by their own poiſe oppreſſed.</p>
            <p>As every Pilot of ordinary skill knoweth in calm and quiet Seas to direct the courſe of his Ship; ſo every Governor of capacity doth underſtand how the affairs of State are in peaceable times to be handled: But when Tempeſts are, and Subjects bent to Sedition; the one requires an excellent Sailer, the other the aid of ſome excellent Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>It oft happens, that publick Duty is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to private Friendſhip; ſo as we are either forced to omit the Offices due to our Countrey, or draw our deareſt friends into danger: In which caſe we are to prefer

publick reſpect, before particular Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The nature of baſe people is ſuch, as either they obey ſlaviſhly, or command in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolently: For liberty being the mark where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at they aim, is by them of that quality, neither moderately deſired, nor diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continued; and always there are ſome ſeditious Leaders to be found, who of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order are inclined to kindle the ire and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of ignorant people. <hi>Dux rebu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Great heed is to be taken, that no Citizen
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60768:80"/>
or Subject, be ſuffered to aſpire to ſuch greatneſs, as cannot be forced to obey the Laws; and no order there is of more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, then that every man of what quality ſoever, may be without reſpect accuſed and judged.</p>
            <p>For conſervation of particular Greatneſs and Dignity, there is nothing more noble and glorious, then to have felt the force of every Fortune.</p>
            <p>It is the quality of wiſe men onely, to know how to uſe Proſperity, and never to truſt too much to the favors of preſent Happineſs. A man well adviſed in his Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, beareth not himſelf towards others either proud or violent; nor muſt he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his own preſent felicity, for the Day knows not what the Night bringeth: He onely is to be reputed a man, whoſe minde cannot be puft up by proſperity, nor deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any adverſe Fortune.</p>
            <p>Men of Cholerick humor are eaſily moved with inſolent Speeches, but wiſe men laugh them to ſcorn.</p>
            <p>The way whereby a Prince eſchues the hate of Subjects, is, hot to take from them their Lands or Goods; yet albeit the blood of ſome few be tainted, unleſs the ſame be accompanied with Confiſcation (which a Prince is rarely forced to uſe) it ſeldom cauſeth him to become odious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:60768:80"/>
A Rule moſt certain it is, that he who commands any thing unpleaſing, muſt by ſevere means cauſe it to be obſerved; and who deſireth to be obeyed, muſt know how to command: And he onely knows how to command, that doth compare his own force with thoſe that are to obey; wherein find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a proportion, then he may boldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, otherwiſe forbear.</p>
            <p>In Actions of difficulty great courage is to be uſed, and who ſo compaſſeth any thing by violence, cannot maintain it by mildneſs, nor command by affability: He therefore that is of nature ſoft, ſhould do beſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain all extraordinary commands, and in matters ordinary imploy the vertue of his milde ſpirit; becauſe ordinary puniſhments are not imputed to the Prince or his Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, but to the Laws and Ordinances of State.</p>
            <p>When Neceſſity preſſeth, deſperation is deemed Wiſdom, and generous mindes do not accompt of danger, becauſe thoſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts which begin with peril, do for the moſt part end with glory.</p>
            <p>He that endeavors to be good among many that are evil, or will uphold that which thoſe labor to pull down, of Force worketh his own undoing. All Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

diſorder to order again; for Nature having made all worldly things variable, ſo ſoon as they have attained their utmoſt perfection and height, they muſt deſcend; ſo from good they fall back to evil, and from evil they return to good. War begets quiet, quiet idleneſs, idleneſs diſorder, diſorder ruine; likewiſe ruine order, order vertue, vertue glory and good fortune.</p>
            <p>Wiſe men have obſerved, that Arms were before Learning, and Captains before Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers; for good and well regulated Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies having gained victory, eſtabliſhed reſt and ſecurity, whereof the Study of Letters and Liberal Sciences enſued.</p>
            <p>That Country deſerveth to be loved of all men, which loves all men indifferently, and not that Countrey which reſpecting the beſt part, advanceth a few: No man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is to be blamed, if for ſuch cauſe he deſire rather to abandon then embrace his Countrey.</p>
            <p>Commonwealths are Bodies mixt, yet have they of Bodies ſimple ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance: And as in theſe, many infirmities grow, which without violent Medicines can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cured; ſo in the other many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs ariſe, which a good and godly Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſhould offend to leave uncured, though therein be uſe both force and fire.</p>

Thoſe Wars be moſt juſt which are moſt neceſſary; and thoſe Arms are moſt merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful where no hope of help remains but in them onely.</p>
            <p>In Actions which promiſe either publick glory, or private honor, men may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably perſwaded to adventure life and living, becauſe great hope there is to die with Reputation, or live to recover that Peace which War hath conſumed: But where men are no leſs oppreſſed by inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Commanders, then by inſolency of Foes, there is the calamity doubled, and of two evils the danger of War ſeemeth leaſt; for that hath end, the other is infinite.</p>
            <p>Who ſo perſwades himſelf to be no leſs eſteemed in evil then good Fortune, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: For promiſes made, during diſtreſs, are rarely performed, unleſs the ſame neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity continue.</p>
            <p>The intent of every Prince, or other State that makes War, is to inrich himſelf, and impoveriſh the enemy: Neither is Victory for other occaſions ſought, nor the poſſeſſions of the enemy to other end deſir'd, then to make themſelves mighty, and their enemy weak. It follows then, that ſo oft as the victory impoveriſhes them, or the gains weaken them, either they paſs or come ſhort of that mark whereat the War was aimed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:60768:82"/>
Ancient and wel-governed Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths were wont by their Conqueſts to fill the Treaſuries with Gold and Silver, to give reward to Soldiers, to ſpare the people from Tributes, to make Triumphs and Publick Feaſts: But in later times the Wars have uſed, firſt, to conſume the Treaſure, and after impoveriſh the people without aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them from their enemies.</p>
            <p>A Prince or State that leaves promiſes unperformed, by reaſon of unexpected im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, and for no ill intent, ought not to be blamed: Neither are ſuch accidents any juſt cauſe or colour why friends ſhould abandon their confederates.</p>
            <p>Where Magiſtrates govern juſtly, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects obey dutifully; where private perſons grow rich, and Princes enlarge their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; there is the Commonwealth bleſſed, and the people fortunate.</p>

               </gap>00 years, when the popular State of <hi>Athens</hi> endured not one hundred. Example, the laws of <hi>Sparta</hi> made by <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> and the Laws of <hi>Athens</hi> by <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Whoſo taketh in hand to frame any State or government, ought to preſuppoſe that all men are evil, and at occaſions will ſhew themſelves ſo to be. Example, the envy of the people of <hi>Rome</hi> to the Nobles, and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency towards them appeared not ſo long as the Kings governd; but the <hi>Tarquins</hi> being baniſhed, opportunity was thereby of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd that the malice of the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther became diſcovered.</p>
            <p>The divers honors of the Nobility and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60768:83"/>
people, the one deſiring to command, the other not to obey, are the cauſe of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual troubles, unleſs ſome third mean there be of more authority then either, to bridle the force of both. Example, The Kings in <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> expulſed, forthwith aroſe much mutiny, and could not be ſuppreſt till the <hi>Tribum Plebis</hi> were created; whoſe authority wrought the ſame effect which the Kings had done.</p>
            <p>Some States endeavor to enlarge their dominions, and ſome others labour only to maintain that eſtate they antiently poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt. Example of the firſt was the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> of the ſecond <hi>Sparta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All States deſiring to live at liberty, think fit that every man ſhould be permitted to accuſe any Citizen that offendeth, which manner of proceeding works two excellent effects: Firſt that the people ſhould not dare for fear of accuſing to attempt ought againſt the State; or if they do, they ſhall be preſently and without reſpect puniſhed. Secondly by liberty of accuſing, every man hath meanes to utter the offence wherewith he can charge others, which he could not; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were lawfull to take ſuch an ordinary courſe, and conſequently be driven to ways extraordinary, particular revenge, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingin forreign forces. Example, <hi>Coriolanus</hi>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:60768:84"/>
and <hi>Appius, Claudius</hi> at <hi>Rome, Lucannone</hi> at <hi>Chinſi, Franciſco Valeri</hi> in <hi>Florence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A accuſations are in every State neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo ſlanders are dangerous, and worthy of puniſhment; the difference betwixt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations and ſlanders, is, that the one is publickly performed before Magiſtrates, with good proofs and Witneſſes to maintain the truth of the accuſation; but ſlanders are as well publickly performed as diſperſed in ſecret and places of repair without Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Juſtification, ſo as every man may be ſlandered, but few are orderly accuſed. Example, <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> accuſed by <hi>L. Virginius; Furius Camillus,</hi> ſlandered by <hi>Manlius Capitoliuus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The only meanes to ſuppreſs Slander is, to give authority to ſome perſons of repute to compel every ſlanderer to become an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer; and if the accuſation prove true, then to reward the accuſer, or at leaſt not to puniſh him. Example <hi>Manlius</hi> the ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of <hi>Camillus</hi> for his untrue information puniſhed.</p>
            <p>A rule moſt certain and aſſured it is, that every Kingdom and State at the firſt well framed, or after well informed, doth take the perfection thereof from the wiſdom of ſome excellent man, who ought not to be blind though in a matter of great moment
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60768:84"/>
he happily uſeth ſome extraordinary vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenc or proceedings; for he that employeth force to mend and not to mar, deſerves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. Example, <hi>Romulus, Lycurgus, Cleomenes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There lives no man ſo ſimple or wiſe, ſo wicked or well diſpoſed, but prefers thoſe perſons that are praiſable, before thoſe that are blamable: notwithſtanding for that well near all men are beguiled in diſcerning what indeed is good, deeming that honorable which in truth is otherwiſe; they ſuffer themſelves either willingly or ignorantly to be carried into a courſe which merrits ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infamy then commendation. Example, every man wiſheth himſelf <hi>Timoleon</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſilaus,</hi> rather then <hi>Dionyſius</hi> or <hi>Phalaris;</hi> rather a <hi>Titus</hi> or <hi>Trajan,</hi> then <hi>Caligula</hi> or <hi>Vitellius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who reads Hiſtories treating of great Actions ſhall perceive that good Princes indeed are more ſecure and better defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the love of the People, and Fidelity of Counſellers, then were they that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained many Legions and Men of War. Example, of all thoſe Emperors which raigned after <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us</hi> the greateſt number were for their vices taken and ſlain, only <hi>Galba</hi> and <hi>Pertinax</hi> excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted who were good Emperors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:60768:85"/>
A Prince of great knowledge both in Armes and Wiſdom ſo firmly ſetleth the foundation of Government, as albeit his ſucceſſor be of the leſs vertue; yet may he be maintained even by the memory of his predeceſſor: but if it happen that the third Prince prove not more like the firſt then the ſecond, then all that is paſt goeth to ruine. Example, The Martial Valor of <hi>Romulus</hi> was the cauſe that <hi>Numa</hi> might governe ſafely in peace: which <hi>Tullus</hi> could not have done, had he bin unlike to <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi> nor ſhould <hi>Bajazet</hi> Emperor of <hi>Turky</hi> have enjoyed the ſtate of his Father <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> and left the ſame to his poſterity, if <hi>Selim</hi> his ſon had not been more like to his Grandfather then to <hi>Bajazet</hi> his Father.</p>
            <p>The ſucceſſion of two excellent Princes, cheifly if they be of long life, works won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous effects: the like is ſeen in Optimacies or Popular States, where the Governors ſucceſſively elected be men of great vertue and underſtanding. Example, The firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> his Son, rhe ſecond in the Conſuls of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In every State where Soldiers are not, the fault thereof proceeds from the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors. Wiſe Princes were therefore wont even in times of Peace to cauſe warlick exerciſes
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60768:85"/>
to be uſed; for without them the moſt warlick nations become not only ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in Martial knowledge, but alſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate. Example, <hi>Pelopida<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>No Prince or State well adviſed, hazards his whole eſtate upon the valor of ſome few perſons, nor ought to ſtrength of ſtraight places where the Enemy is to paſs. Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Tully</hi> King of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; <hi>Metius</hi> King of <hi>Alba,</hi> condiſcended that three of their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility for either ſide choſen ſhould enter Combate, and that Nation which were victorious ſhould command the other. <hi>Francis</hi> the French King going to recover <hi>Lombardy,</hi> was by the <hi>Switzers</hi> attended into two or three places in the Mountains, hoping there to repulſe him, but the King taking another way, paſſed ſecurely and prevaild.</p>
            <p>Every State well governed doth reward men of good merit, and puniſh all offenders; and if any perſon of good deſert ſhall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be a delinquent, the ſame man ought notwithſtanding his former ſervice, be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht. Example, The ſame <hi>Horatio</hi> that in Combat gained the victory againſt the <hi>Albani,</hi> having inſolently ſlain his own
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60768:86"/>
ſiſter, was notwithſtanding his egregiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Every wiſe man having performed any great ſervice to his Prince or Country, ought to be content with ſuch recompence as it ſhall pleaſe the Prince or Country to beſtow: meaſuring the ſame according to the Power of the giver, and not the merit of him that receiveth. Example, <hi>Horatius Cocles</hi> for having loſt his hand in defence of the bridge of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Mutius Scaevola</hi> ſuffering his hand to be burnt for his attempt to kill King <hi>Porſenna,</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with a ſmall portion of Land; and <hi>Manlius</hi> that defended the <hi>Capitoh</hi> from the <hi>Galleys,</hi> had no greater reward then a little meaſure of meale.</p>
            <p>Ingratitnde is a vice ſo natural and Common, as not only private perſons, but Princes and States alſo either through co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſnes or ſuſpition are therewith infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Example, <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> proclamed Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, was chiefly aided by <hi>Antonius Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and by his helpe prevailed againſt <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius;</hi> in reward of which ſervice <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>

removed him from the command of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and gave that honor to <hi>Mutianus.

            <p>All Errors that great Captains commit, are either wilfull or ignorant, towards the one and the other of which offenders to uſe greater lenity then the quality of their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deſerves, ſeemeth neceſſary: for men of honor ſuffer nought by the infamy which evill ſervice doth bring. It is alſo to be conſidered that a great Captain being cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with many cares, cannot proceed in his actions couragiouſly if he ſtand in daily doubt to be puniſht for every error that hapneth. Example, <hi>Sergius</hi> and <hi>Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>onſequently their offence is wilful and worthy of capital puniſhment. Likewiſe when <hi>Varro</hi> by his ignorance, received an overthrow by <hi>Hannibal</hi> at <hi>Cann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Whenſoever an inconvenience ariſeth within or without the State, it ſeems a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution more ſure to diſſemble the knowing thereof, then to ſeek by ſudden violence to ſuppreſs it. Example, <hi>Coſmo de Medices</hi> having gained extraordinary reputation in <hi>Florence,</hi> the Citizens imagined, that to ſuffer the ſame to increaſe, was dangerous, and therefore they baniſhed him: Which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream proceeding, ſo offended the friends of <hi>Coſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The like hapned in <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>Caeſar</hi> for his vertue, much admired and followed, became afterwards to be feared<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In every Republick, an exceſſive Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity given to one or two perſons for long time, proveth dangerous, cheifly when the
<pb facs="tcp:60768:87"/>
ſame is not reſtrained. Example, The Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip given to <hi>Caeſar</hi> for life, was an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to oppreſs the Liberties of the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> The ſame effect was before that time like to follow the <hi>Decemvirat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> to prolong the time of his Dignity.</p>
            <p>The Ambition of Men is ſuch, as rarely they will obey when formerly they have commanded; neither do they willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of mean Office, having before ſate in higher place: Yet the Citizens of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed States, did not refuſe as well to obey as command. Example, The victory the <hi>Romans</hi> obtained againſt the <hi>Veienti, Q. Fabius</hi> was ſlain, having the year before been Conſul: Nevertheleſs he then ſerved in meaner place under <hi>C. Manilius,</hi> and <hi>M. Fabius</hi> his own Brother then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more ſtrange, yet by experience proved true, That men in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Fortune be much grieved, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity alſo diſcontented; which is the reaſon, that not being forced to fight for neceſſity, they will nevertheleſs contend for Ambition; and that humor doth as well poſſeſs thoſe that live aloft, as others whom Fortune holdeth down. Example, The people of <hi>Rome</hi> having by the Authority of the <hi>Tribunes</hi>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:60768:88"/>
obtained to make themſelves ſecure from oppreſſion of the Nobility, forthwith required, That the Honor and Office of State might be alſo imparted unto them. The like Ambition moved them to have their part of Lands by force of <hi>Lex Agragia,</hi> which was at laſt the overthrow of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> liberty.</p>
            <p>It ſeemeth that people diſpleaſed with ſome Innovations hapned in the State, do ſometime without juſt Reaſons complain of thoſe that govern: Not unlike to a ſick man who deemeth that the Phyſician, not the Fever, is the cauſe of his grief. Example, The people of <hi>Rome</hi> were perſwaded that the Ambition of Conſuls was the cauſe of continual War, therefore required that no more Conſuls ſhould be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> yet were they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that certain <hi>Tribunes</hi> ſhould command with like Authority, ſo was nothing altered in the Government but the Governors title, which alone did content them.</p>
            <p>Nothing can corrupt and alter the nature of man ſo much, or ſo ſoon as the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate deſire of Honor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in ſo much as men of honeſt mindes and vertuous inclinations are ſometimes by Ambition, drawn to abuſe that goodneſs whereunto they are inclined. Example, <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> having lived long an enemy to the Multitude, hoping by
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60768:88"/>
their aid to continue his Authority of the <hi>Decemviri</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> became their Friend, and disfavored the factions of great men. Likewiſe <hi>Q. Fabius</hi> a man of ſingular ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, being alſo called to that dignity by <hi>Appius</hi> ſelf, adulterated his nature and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came like unto him.</p>
            <p>Seldom or never is any people diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without juſt cauſe; yet if happily they be asked whereof their offence proceedeth, many times for want of ſome fit man to pronounce their grief, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>and ſilent. Example, The <hi>Romans</hi> at the death of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi> were gathered together armed upon Mount <hi>Sacr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ople, and confer with the Senate.</p>
            <p>A great Folly or rather meer Madneſs it ſeemeth to deſire any thing, and tell before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand that the end and purpoſe of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is evil; for thereby he ſheweth reaſon why it ought not to be granted. Example, The <hi>Romans</hi> required of the Senate that <hi>Appius</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Decemviri</hi> ſhould be delivered into their hands, being deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to burn them all alive.</p>
            <p>The firſt part of their requeſt ſeemed
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60768:89"/>
reaſonable, but the end thereof unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>A courſe very dangerous it is in all States, by continual accuſing and puniſhing, to hold the Subject in doubt and daily fear: For he that ſtands always looking for ſome trouble, becometh careleſs and apt to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt innovation.

vowed that the tenth part of the pillage ſhould be offered to <hi>Apollo;</hi> but the Senate ſuppoſing that the people would not conſent to ſo great a Contribution, ſtudied to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with that vow, and to pleaſe <hi>Apollo</hi> and the people alſo by ſome other means: Whereat the people ſhewed themſelves openly offended, and willingly gave no leſs then the ſum formerly decreed.

            <p>The multitude of baſe people is naturally audacious and apt to innovation; yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be directed by ſome perſons of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and Wiſdom, rarely do they joyn in any action of great import.

            <p>A Republick deſirous to extend the bounds thereof, muſt endeavor to be fully furniſhed with Inhabitants, which may be done both by Love and Force: Love is gained by ſuffering ſtrangers to inhabit the City ſecurely; and Force compels people to come thither, when other Cities and Towns near at hand be demoliſhed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced: And impoſſible it is without this order of proceeding, to enlarge any City or make the ſame of greater power. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, The <hi>Romans</hi> to enlarge their City demoliſhed <hi>Alba,</hi> and many other Towns, and therewith alſo entertained all ſtrangers courteouſly: So as <hi>Rome</hi> grew to ſuch great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A Commonwealth that conſumes more Treaſure in the War, then it profits in Victory, ſeems to have rather hindred then honored or inriched the State. A wiſe Captain therefore in his actions, ought as well to profit the Republick, as to gain to himſelf glory. Example, the Conſuls of <hi>Rome</hi> did ſeldom deſire Triumph, unleſs they returned from the War loaden with Gold, Silver, and other rich ſpoils fit to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Common Treaſury.</p>
            <p>All Foreign Wars with Princes or other States taken in hand, be either for Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Deſire of glory, or elſe for neceſſity. Examples, the <hi>Romans</hi> for their Ambition conquered many Nations, with intent onely to have the obedience of the people; yet did they ſuffer them to hold poſſeſſion of their Houſes, and ſometimes they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to live onely with their old Laws. Likewiſe <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great endeavored to ſuppreſs many Princes for his glory, but did not diſpoſſeſs the people, nor kill them.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> That Money makes the War ſtrong, and is the force and ſinews thereof; as though he who hath moſt Treaſure, be alſo moſt migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but experience hath apparently ſhewed the contrary.

            <p>Every League made with a Prince or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick remote, is weak and rather aideth us with Fame then Effect, and conſequently deceiveth all thoſe that in ſuch Amity repoſe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60768:93"/>
Confidence. Example, The <hi>Florentines</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſaulted by the King of <hi>Naples</hi> and the Pope, prayed aid of the French King, who being far diſtant, could not in time ſuccor them; and the <hi>Cedicini</hi> deſiring aid of the <hi>Capuani</hi> againſt the <hi>Samnits,</hi> a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of no force, were deceived.</p>
            <p>A Prince whoſe people is well armed and trained, ſhall do better to attend his enemy at home, then by invaſion to aſſault his Countrey: But ſuch Princes whoſe Subjects are diſarmed, had need to hold the enemy aloof. Example, The <hi>Romans,</hi> and in this age the <hi>Swiſſes,</hi> being well armed, may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the War at home; but the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> being not ſo well furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, did ever uſe to ſeek the enemy.</p>
            <p>The Plurality of Commanders in equal Authority, is for the moſt part occaſion of ſlow proceeding in the War. Example, There was at one time in <hi>Rome</hi> created four <hi>Tribuni Militares</hi> with authority of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, <hi>viz. T.

            <p>A Victory obtained by any great Captain
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60768:93"/>
with the Authority of his Princes Commiſſion, Counſel, and Directions, ought ever to be imputed rather to the wiſdom of the Prince, then the valor of the Captain: Which made the Emperors of <hi>Rome</hi> to permit no Captains (how great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his victories were) to Triumph, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time the Conſuls had done; and even in thoſe days a modeſt refuſal of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph was commended. Example, <hi>M. Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> having gained a great victory againſt the <hi>Tuſcans,</hi> was both by the conſent of the Senate and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> admitted to Triumph; but the refuſal of that Honor proved his greater glory.</p>
            <p>All they that from private eſtate have aſpired to Principality, either by Force or Fraud become thereunto, unleſs the ſame be given, or by inheritance deſcended: Yet it is rarely ſeen, that Force alone prevaileth, but Fraud without Force oft times ſufficeth. Example, <hi>Agathocles</hi> by ſuch means became Prince of <hi>Syracuſa; John Galeazzo</hi> by abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Uncle <hi>Barnabas,</hi> gained the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Lombardy;</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> circumven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Cyaxares</hi> his Mothers Brother, and by that craft aſpired to greatneſs.</p>
            <p>Sudden Reſolutions are always danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and no leſs peril enſueth of ſlow and doubtful delays. Example, When <hi>Hieron</hi>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:60768:94"/>
Prince of <hi>Syracuſa</hi> died, the War even then being in great heat between the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> they of <hi>Syracuſa</hi> conſulted, whether it were better to follow the Fortune of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Carthage.</hi> In which doubt, they continued until <hi>Apollonides</hi> a chief Captain of <hi>Syracuſa</hi> laid before them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>To govern a State is nothing elſe but to take ſuch order as the Subjects may not, or ought not offend; which may be done, either by removing from them all means to diſobey, or by affording them ſo great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, as reaſonably they ought not to change their Fortune; for the mean courſe proveth dangerous. Example, the <hi>Latins</hi> being by the valor of <hi>Camillus</hi> overcome, yeelded themſelves to endure what puniſhment it pleaſed the <hi>Romans</hi> to inflict.</p>
            <p>An ingenious and magnanimous anſwer being made unto wiſe Magiſtrates, doth oft obtain both Pardon and Grace. Example, When the <hi>Privernates</hi> had rebelled, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60768:94"/>
were by force conſtrained to return to the obedience of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they ſent certain of the City unto <hi>Rome</hi> to deſire pardon; who being brought before the Senate, one of the Senators asked the <hi>Privernates,</hi> what puniſhment themſelves did think they had deſerved: The ſame, quoth they, which men living in freedom, think they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of.

            <p>All Caſtles, Fortreſſes, and Places of ſtrength, be made for defence either againſt the enemy or Subject: In the firſt caſe they are not neceſſary, in the ſecond dangerous. For thereby the Prince may at his pleaſure take occaſion to inſult upon the Subject<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> when much more ſeemly he might ſettle his eſtate upon the love and good affection of Men. Example, The Caſtle of <hi>Millan</hi> made by Duke <hi>Franciſco <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

               </gap>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:60768:95"/>
that ſo ſoon as that City was aſſaulted, the enemy with facility did poſſeſs it.</p>
            <p>That Prince or Potentate which builds his Severity rather upon the truſt he hath in Fortreſſes, then the love of Men, ſhall be deceived: For no place is ſo ſtrong, as can long defend it ſelf, unleſs by the love and aid of Men it be in time of neceſſity ſuccored. Example, Pope <hi>Julio</hi> having drawn the <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivoli</hi> out of <hi>Bologna,</hi> built there a ſtrong Caſtle; the Governor thereof robbed the people, and they therewith grieved, in a ſhort time took the Caſtle from him. So after the revolt of <hi>Genoa, Lewis</hi> the Twelfth came to the recovery thereof, and builded there the ſtrongeſt Fortification of <hi>Italy,</hi> as well for ſite as the circumſtances inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnable. Nevertheleſs the Citizens rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and within ſixteen moneths the French were forced to yield the Caſtle and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Octavio Fragoſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To build Forts upon places of ſtrength, either for defence of our own, or to hold that which is taken from others, hath ever proved to ſmall purpoſe. Example, The <hi>Romans</hi> having ſuppreſt the Rebellion of the <hi>Latins</hi> and <hi>Privernates;</hi> albeit they were people Warlike, and lovers of Liberty; yet to keep them Subject, built there no Caſtles, nor other places fortified: And the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60768:95"/>
               <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> did not onely forbear to fortifie the Towns they conquered, but alſo left their cheif City of <hi>Sparta</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walled.</p>
            <p>The neceſſity or uſe of Fortification, is onely upon Frontires or ſuch principal pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where Princes make their Habitation; to the end the fury of ſudden aſſaults may be ſtaid, and time for ſuccor entertained: Otherwiſe, example, the Caſtle of <hi>Millan</hi> being made to hold the State in obedience, could not ſo do either for the houſe of <hi>Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi</hi> or <hi>France. Guido <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>baldo,</hi> Duke of <hi>Velin,</hi> driven from his Dominion by <hi>Caeſar Borgia,</hi> ſo ſoon as he recovered his Countrey, cauſed all the Forts to be demoliſhed: For by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience he found the love of Men was the ſureſt defence, and that Fortifications pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed no leſs againſt him then for him.</p>
            <p>The cauſes of Diviſion and Faction in every Commonweal proceed moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Idleneſs and Peace, and that which uniteth, is Fear and War.

            <p>The means to uſurpe an eſtate disjoynted is firſt before Arms be taken, to become as it were an Arbitrator or a friend indifferent; and after Arms be taken, then to ſend mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate aid to the weak ſide, as well to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the War between the Factions, as alſo to conſume the ſtrength both of the one, and the other, yet in no wiſe to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy any great forces, for thereby either party may diſcover the intents to ſuppreſs them. Example, The City of <hi>Piſtoia</hi> fallen into diviſion, the <hi>Florentines</hi> took occaſion ſometimes to favor the one, and ſome times the other, that in the end both ſides weary of the War, voluntarily yeilded to their devotion. <hi>Philippo Viſcount,</hi> hoping ſundry times by occaſion of Faction to oppreſs the <hi>Fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the Spaniards being come, found no forces at all to joyn with them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wanting victual, offered compoſition. The <hi>Florentines</hi> finding the Enemy diſtreſſed grew inſolent and refuſed peace, whereof followed the loſs of <hi>Prato,</hi> and many other inconveniencies.

            <p>The denial or delay of Juſtice deſired in revenge of injuries either publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately offered, is a thing very dangerous to every Prince or other State, for that the party injured doth oft by indirect meanes though with hazard of his country and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſeek ſatisfaction: Example, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint which the <hi>Galli</hi> made againſt the <hi>Fabii</hi>

who ſent Ambaſſadors in favor of the <hi>Toſſani,</hi> not being heard, nor any puniſhment inflicted upon them for fighting againſt the Law of Nations, was the cauſe that the <hi>Galli</hi> were offended with the States, whereof followed the ſack of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the delay of Juſtice in <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging the inceſtuous oppreſſion of <hi>Atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> to <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> was the motive to murther that King.</p>

            <p>Honor may ſometime be got as well by the loſs as gaining of victory. Every man knoweth glory is due to the Victor, and we deny not the ſame priviledge to the vanquiſhed, being able to make proof that the loſs proceeded not from his default. Neither is it diſhonorable to violate thoſe promiſes whereto the neceſſity or diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of War inforceth. And forced promiſes which concern a whole State, are not binding, and rarely or never kept, nor is the Breaker thereby to receive diſgrace. Example, <hi>Poſthumus</hi> the Conſul having made a diſhonorable peace with the <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nits,</hi> was by them with his whole Army ſent home diſarmed. Being arived at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Conſul informed the people they were not bound to perform the baſe conditions he was compelled to yield unto; albeit, he and thoſe few that promiſed, were bound to perform them. The Senate thereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to ſend him priſoner to <hi>Samno,</hi> where he conſtantly proteſted the fault to be onely his own; wherefore the people by that peace incurred no diſhonor at all: And For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſo much favored <hi>Poſthumus,</hi> as the <hi>Samnites</hi> were content preſently to return

him to <hi>Rome;</hi> where he became more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for loſing the Victory, then was <hi>Pontius</hi> at <hi>Samno</hi> for having won the victory.</p>

            <p>A Prince deſirous to obtain any thing of another, muſt if occaſion ſo permit, urge his demand ſo earneſtly and preſs for ſo ſudden and preſent anſwer, as he who is preſt may not have leiſure to conſider how to excuſe himſelf in denial.

            <p>When a multitude offendeth, all may not be puniſht, becauſe they are too many: to puniſh part and leave the reſt unpuniſht, were injurie to the ſufferers; and to thoſe that eſcape, an encouragement to offend again;

            <p>In all Monarchies the Senate or privy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Council is or ought to be compoſed of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of great dignity, or men of approved wiſdom and underſtanding.

            <p>Many Princes Ancient and Modern have uſed to ſelect out of their Council, two or

three or four at moſt to whom only they did impart their affairs. Example, The Emperor <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had <hi>Maec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The alteration of old Laws or introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of new, are in all States very dangerous, notwithſtanding any appearance of profit or publick utility, which moved wiſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors to decree, that ancient Lawes once eſtabliſhed might never be called in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Example, The <hi>Athenians</hi> decreed that no Law ſhould be propounded to the people without the conſent of the Senate: the like uſe is obſerved in <hi>Venice</hi> where no Petition is prefered to the Senate but by advice of the Sages; and among the <hi>Locrians</hi> the Cuſtom was that whoſoever preſented any new Law to be confirmed, ſhould come with a halter about his Neck, and be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hanged if his requeſt were rejected; alſo <hi>Lycurgus</hi> to prevent the alteration of his Lawes, did ſweare the people of <hi>Sparta</hi> to obſerve them untill his return, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon retired himſelf into voluntary exile, with intent never to returne.</p>
            <p>When neceſſity or good reaſon moves Innovation or Abolition of Laws, a courſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60768:102"/>
more ſecure it is to do it rather by degrees then ſuddenly. Example, The <hi>Romans</hi> finding the Laws of the twelve Tables un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, ſuffered them to be obſerved or neglected at diſcretion, but would not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly ſuppreſs them for fear of calling other Laws into contempt: ſo did they continue 700 years, and were then caſſed by <hi>Ebutius</hi> the <hi>Tribune.</hi> But <hi>Agis</hi> King of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> deſirous to revive the Laws of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> long diſcontinued, enforced all men to bring in their evidence and writings to be cancelled, to the end a new partition of Lands and Goods might be made, which ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and violent proceeding proved ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, that it moved a dangerous ſedition, wherein he was depoſed and with his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Friends put to death; which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample haply moved the <hi>Venetians</hi> not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing againſt the Authority of <hi>Auguſtino Barberino</hi> their Duke: but after his death, and before the Election of <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dono,</hi> the <hi>Signiory</hi> publiſht new Ordinances detractive from the <hi>Ducal</hi> Anthority.</p>
            <p>Whoſo hath won to himſelf ſo great Love and Affection, as thereby to become maſter of the forces, and at his pleaſure commands the Subjects apt for Armes, may alſo without right or title aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the whole Eſtate. Example, <hi>Hugh</hi>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:60768:103"/>
               <hi>Capat</hi> a Subject to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> being greatly honored by the Soldiers, found means thereby to prevent Charles Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> of the Crown, being right heire by deſcent from <hi>Charlemaine.</hi> And albeit the Families of the <hi>Paleologi, Ebrami</hi> and <hi>Turcani</hi> be of the blood Royall and Right Heires to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, when the <hi>Ottaman</hi> Line ſhall faile; yet it is like that the cheif <hi>Baſſa</hi> having the love of the <hi>Janiſaries</hi> will uſurpe the State, becauſe the <hi>Paleologi</hi> and other Competitors be far from the <hi>Turks</hi> perſon, poor and without means to purchaſe the Soldiers favor.</p>
            <p>A Commander General in Armes, ought upon paine of great puniſhment be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, not to imploy or retain any forces longer then the time of his Commiſſion. Example, The <hi>Dictators</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> were in this point ſo preciſe, as never any of them dared to tranſgreſs the time prefixed, till <hi>Caeſar</hi> obtained that dignity ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in him for life: which was the cauſe of his uſurpation of the State. Alſo the <hi>Thebans</hi> commanded, that if the General of their Army did hold his forces one day longer then the time prefixt, he ſhould thereby incur danger of death: which Juſtice was executed upon <hi>Epaminondas</hi> and <hi>Pelopidas.</hi>

Baniſhment of great Lords, or Citizens of great Reputation, hath bin in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces diverſly uſed: for in the one, they were inforced only to abſent themſelves without further infliction; in the other, Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was accompanied with Confiſcation, a courſe of great danger. Example, In <hi>Argos, Athens, Epheſus,</hi> and other Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> the Citizens puiſſant in Friends, Vertue or Riches, were many times baniſht for envy or feare, but never or very rarely forced to abſent themſelves longer then Ten years; and that without loſs of goods, which was the cauſe that never any of them War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt the Country: but <hi>Dion</hi> being baniſht <hi>Syracuſa</hi> by <hi>Dyonyſius Junior,</hi> and <hi>Coriolanus</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> did make mighty Wars againſt their own Country. The like was done by the <hi>Medici</hi> in <hi>Florence.</hi>

            <p>Honorable and Magnanimous men were wont, not only to enterpriſe great Acts, but alſo to ſuffer patiently al injuries which Foes or Fortune could expoſe them to: as reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that no Calamity was ſo great as to make their minds abject, or to forget the dignity appertaing to perſons vertuous: Example. After the defeat of the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ia,</hi> the <hi>Galli</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the Victory even to <hi>Romes</hi> Walls: whither being come, and finding the gates
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60768:104"/>
open, without any ſigne of reſiſtance they entred the Streets, where all honorable Palaces were alſo unſhut, which cauſed the <hi>Galli</hi> greatly to doubt. Nevertheleſs looking into the houſes, they found in every of them a Senator ſet in a Chaire of State, and in his hand a Rod of Ivory; his perſon was alſo veſted with Robes of dignity, which Majeſtick ſpectacle did marvelouſly amate the <hi>Galli</hi> not having before that time ſeen any ſuch Reverend ſight; and therefore did not only refrain to offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, but highly admired the <hi>Roman</hi> Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, cheifly in that Fortune. Nevertheleſs at length a rude <hi>Gall</hi> hapned with his hand to touch the white beard of <hi>M. Papyrius,</hi> whereat he taking great diſdain ſtruk him with his Rod, in requitall whereof the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian ſlew <hi>Papyrius,</hi> and by that example all the other Senators and perſons of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity were alſo ſlain.</p>
            <p>Albeit the knowledge and ſtudy of Letters be both commendable and neceſſary in all well regulated States; yet if under ſo honeſt pretence, idleneſs enter, ſuch abuſes muſt ſeaſonably be foreſeen and removed. Example, When <hi>Diogenes</hi> and <hi>Carneades</hi> two excellent Philoſophers, were ſent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors from <hi>Athens</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Nobility that before diſpoſed
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60768:104"/>
themſelves to Arms, allured with their Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and marvellous wiſdom, began with great admiration to follow them: and in lieu of Armes, turned their endeavors to the ſtudie of Letters, which the wiſe <hi>Cato</hi> diſcerning, procured the Senate to decree that (to eſchew all inconveniences which ſo honeſt idleneſs might breed) no philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſhould from thenceforth be received into <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Honor due to Magiſtrates was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently much regarded, and contrarywiſe all irreverent and undutifull behavior with great ſeverity puniſht. Example, The Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of <hi>Rome</hi> degraded a Citizen only for having yawned loud in their preſence: and another called <hi>Vectius</hi> was ſlain in the field for not doing due reverence to a Tribune when he paſt by him It is alſo obſerved, that the ſon of <hi>Fab. Maximus</hi> when he was <hi>Cenſor,</hi> meeting his Father on horſeback, and ſeeing the Serjeants affraid to ſpeak to him to diſmount, did himſelf command him ſo to do, which Command the Father cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and willingly obeyed, ſaying, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick power muſt give place to Publick Authority.</p>
            <p>Tyrannous Princes having incurred the univerſal hate of people, found no meanes ſo meet to preſerve them from Popular fury,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60768:105"/>
as to execute or deliver into their hands their own cheef Minions and intimate Counſellors. Example, <hi>Tiberius</hi> delivered to the People his favorite <hi>Seianus: Nero, Tig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>llinus. Henry</hi> King of <hi>Swede</hi> committed to their fury his beſt beloved ſervant <hi>George Preſton; Caracaella</hi> cauſed all his flatterers to be ſlain that had perſwaded him to kill his brother<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> The like was done by <hi>Caligula,</hi> whereby he eſcaped himſelf.</p>
            <p>A Prince that rewards or pardons a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that kills another Prince, albeit by that means he is aſpired to Soveraignty, ſhall thereby both incur great danger and hate, and encourage men therein to attempt the like againſt himſelf Therefore wiſe Princes have not only left ſuch ſervices quite unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced, but alſo moſt ſeverely puniſhed them. Example. The Emperor <hi>Severus</hi> put all thoſe to death that conſented to the murder of <hi>Pertinax;</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> the great executed him that ſlew <hi>Darius,</hi> as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring that Subject that would lay violent hands on his Prince, notwithſtanding he were an enemy. Likewiſe <hi>Uitellius</hi> put to death all the Murderers and conſpirators a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Galba;</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi> executed his Secretary <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> for the Murder of <hi>Nero,</hi> although he inſtantly deſired his aid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:60768:105"/>
The vertuous and vitious examples of Princes incite Subjects to imitate the ſame Qualities; which rule never or very rarely fails. Example, <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt King of <hi>France,</hi> and other Princes in divers ages and places, had great eſteem of Learned Men; and forthwith all the Princes, Nobles, Nobility, and Clergy, diſpoſed themſelves ſo earneſtly to ſtudy, as before that time had not been ſeen ſo many and ſo great a number of Learned Men, as well in Tongues as Sciences. Contrariwiſe, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, otherwiſe a Prince of great vertue, by his immoderate uſe of drinking, did draw the greateſt number of his Court and people alſo to delight in drunkenneſs. The like effect followed the exceſſive intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> King of <hi>Amaſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt and not the leaſt conſiderable, is to obſerve how great effects Devotion and Contempt of Humane glory worketh in the mindes not onely of private perſons, but of Kings and Princes alſo, who have oft a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned worldly Profit, Honor, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to embrace the contemplative retired life.
