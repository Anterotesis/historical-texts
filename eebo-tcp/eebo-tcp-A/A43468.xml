         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E must needs be a man of very slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
observation and acquaintance in
the World, who is surprised and
startled at the news of Plots and
Conspiracies against Princes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
and managed by the restless
Emissaries of the Church of <hi>Rome.
There is no new thing under the Sun,</hi>
says the Wise-man. And as to
the present case, we may defie the greatest Villain of
the whole Order of the <hi>Iesuits</hi> to form any design,
however black and execrable, barbarous and inhumane,
which shall be any other than the unavoidable result
of their avowed Principles, which we may gather from
their Writings, and the repetition of their known Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises,
which stand upon record in the Histories of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ages. This Truth has been convincingly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
by our Protestant Writers in both the parts of it:
Insomuch that the <hi>Romish</hi> Factors, instead of denying
the Charge, have begun to save us all further trouble,
by giving fresh proof of it themselves; and by a late
Traiterous design against His Majesties Person and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
have endeavoured to confirm our Assertions
by a sad and direful Experience; as thinking perhaps,
that new Massacres are the most effectual course to stop
the cry of the old; and that the readiest way to silence
their Adversaries, is, to make them Instances of the
truth of the Accusation.</p>
            <p>It is not the design of these Papers, to give an account
of the discovery of the late Plot, but onely to present
the Reader with the Narrative of another, against His
Majesties Royal Father of Blessed Memory, so exactly
resembling this which now lies under examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that it can hardly be call'd another, being
<pb facs="tcp:94478:3"/>
nothing else but the same thing acted over again, onely
with the necessary alteration of circumstances of Time,
Place, and Persons.</p>
            <p>I will not here undertake to make out the Parallel,
which is so obvious to be discerned in almost all the
Circumstances of the Story. The onely use I shall at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
make of it, is briefly this, <hi>viz.</hi> From hence to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
who were the chief promoters of the late
Troubles, and the most pernicious enemies to that
Royal Martyr: The Sectaries indeed were the most
visible and notorious, but they were neither the onely
nor the principal Actors in the Conspiracy. The <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits</hi>
can never sit out, when such great Transactions,
as Rebellions and Regicide, are going forward. And
however the Papist and Fanatick are of contrary Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
Interests, and Inclinations; yet it is natural
enough, that they may both conspire (though with a
different intent) to promote and carry on the very same
design.</p>
            <p>We have here a full discovery made to us, where our
danger lies; nor are the <hi>Roman</hi> practises ever the less
mischievous, though usually managed in a way more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
and undiscerned. What is now secretly practised in
Colledges and Corners, shall (when ever opportunity
serves them) be openly acted in the face of the Sun.
What has been once done, may be done again. And let us
not flatter our selves, that we can have any security
from that sort of men, who can readily break through all
Obligations of Gratitude or Religion, for propagating
their Cause, though by a Massacre, or a Powder-plot, by
the Murder of a King, or the Subversion of a Kingdom.
The Lord in his mercy awaken us to see our danger, and
in his good time make us a way to escape it; and grant,
that <hi>we may all, in this our day, know the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
unto our peace, before they be hid from our eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94478:3"/>WHo and what the Author of this <hi>Discovery</hi> was; who
the chief active Instruments in the Plot; when, and
where they assembled; in what vigorous manner they
daily prosecuted it; how effectually they proceeded in it; how diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
it is to dissolve or counter-work it, without special diligence, the
Relation it self will best discover: Whose verity, if any question,
these Reasons will enforce belief:</p>
            <p>First, That the Discoverer was a chief Actor in this Plot, sent
hither from <hi>Rome</hi> by Cardinal <hi>Barbarino,</hi> to assist <hi>Con</hi> the Popes
Legat in the pursuit of it, and privy to all the particulars therein dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the horrour and reality of the Conspiracy so troubled
his conscience, as it engaged him to disclose it, yea, to renounce that
bloody Church and Religion which contrived it, though bred up in,
preferred by it, and promised greater Advancements for his diligence in
this design.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That he discovered it under an Oath of Secrecie, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to confirm every particular by solemn Oath.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That he discovers the Persons principally employed in this
Plot, the places and times of their secret Conventions, their manner
and diligence in the pursuit of it, with all other circumstances, so
punctually, as leaves no place for doubt.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The principal Conspirators nominated by him, are notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
known to be fit Instruments for such a wicked design.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Many particulars therein have immediate relation to the
King and Archbishop, to whom be imparted this Discovery, and durst
not reveal any thing for truth, which they could disprove on their
own knowledge.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Sir <hi>William Boswel,</hi> and the Archbishop, if not the
King himself, were fully satisfied that it was real, and most important.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Some particulars are ratified by the Archbishops testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
in the Memorials of his own Life, written with his own
hand some years before; and others so apparent, that most intelligent
men in Court or City, were acquainted with them whiles they were
acting, thoughignorant of the Plot.</p>
            <p>The first Overture and larger Relation of the Plot it self, were both
writ in <hi>Latin,</hi> as they are here Printed, and faithfully translated word
for word, as near as the Dialect will permit. All which premised, the
Letters and Plot here follow in order.</p>

            <head>Sir William Boswels first Letter to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
concerning the Plot.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>May it please your Grace,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe offers (whereof your Grace will find a Copy here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed)
towards a further and more particular discovery,
were first made unto me at the second hand, and in speech,
by a friend of good quality and worth in this place: But soon after,
(as soon as they could be put into Order) were avowed by the
principal Party, and delivered me in writing by both together;
upon Promise and Oath, which I was required to give, and gave
accordingly, not to reveal the same to any other man living but your
Grace, and, by your Grace's hand, unto his Majesty.</p>
            <p>In like manner they have tied themselves not to declare these
things unto any other but my self, until they should know how
his Majesty and your Grace would dispose thereof. The Principal
giving me withall to know, That he puts himself and this Secret
into your Grace's power, as well because it concerns your Grace
so nearly, after his Majesty, as that he knows your wisdom to guide
the same aright; and is assured of your Grace's fidelity to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Person, to our State, and to our Church.</p>
            <p>First, Your Grace is humbly and earnestly prayed to signifie his
Majesties pleasure (with all possible speed) together with your
Grace's disposition herein, and purpose to carry all with silence from
all, but his Majesty, until due time.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When your Grace shall think fit to shew these things
unto his Majesty, to do it immediately, not trusting to Letters, or
permitting any other person to be by, or in hearing; and to entreat
and counsel his Majesty, as in a case of Conscience, to keep the same
wholely and solely in his own bosome, from the knowledge of all
other Creatures living, but your Grace, until the business shall be
clear, and sufficiently in his Majesties and your Grace's hands to
effect.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Not to enquire or demand the names of the parties
from whom these overtures do come, or any further discoveries and
advertisements in pursuit of them which shall come hereafter, until
due satisfaction shall be given in every part of them. Nor to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray
<pb facs="tcp:94478:4"/>
unto any person but his Majesty, in any measure or kind,
that any thing of this nature, or of any great importance is come
from me.</p>
            <p>For as I may believe these overtures are verifiable in the way
they will be laid; and that the parties will not shrink: So I make
accompt, That if never so little a glimpse or shadow of
these informations shall appear by his Majesties, or your Graces
speech or carriage unto others, the means whereby the business
may be brought best unto tryal, will be utterly disappointed:
And the parties who have in Conscience towards God, and devotion
to his Majesty, affection to your Grace, and compassion
of our Countrey, disclosed these things, will run a present and
extream hazard of their persons and lives. So easily it will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured
(upon the least occasion given upon his Majesties or your
Graces parts) who is the discoverer: By what means, and how he
knows so much of these things; And where he is. These are the
points, which together with the offers, they have pressed me espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to represent most seriously unto your Grace.</p>
            <p>For my own particular, having most humbly craved pardon of
any errour or omissions, that have befaln me in the managing of
this business, I do beseech your Grace to let me know,</p>
            <p>First, Whether, and in what order I shall proceed hereafter with
the parties?</p>
            <p>Secondly, What points of these offers I shall chiefly, and first put
them to enlarge and clear?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What other points and enquiries I shall propose unto
them? And in what manner?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, How far further I shall suffer my self to hear and
know these things?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Whether I shall not rather take the parties answers, and
discoveries sealed up by themselves, and having likewise put my
own seal upon them, without questioning or seeing what they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
so to transmit them to his Majesty or your Grace?</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Whether I may not insinuate upon some fair occasion,
That there will be a due Regard held of them, and their service,
by his Majesty and your Grace: When all particulars undertaken
in these general offers, and necessary for perfecting the discovery and
work intended, shall be effectually delivered to his Majesty or your
Grace?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94478:5"/>Upon these Heads, and such other as His Majesty or your Grace
shall think proper in the business, I must with all humility beseech
your Grace to furnish me with instructions, and warrant for my
proceedings, under his Majesties hand, with your Graces attestation,
as by his Majesties goodness, and Royal disposition is usual in
like cases.</p>
            <p>May it please your Grace to entertain a Cypher with me upon
this occasion; I have sent the Counterpart of one here inclosed:
In the vacant spaces whereof your Grace may insert such names
more, with numbers to them, as you think requisite.</p>
            <p>If these overtures happily sort with his Majesties and your Graces
mind, and shall accordingly prove effectual in their operation, I
shall think my self a most happy man, to have had my oblation in
so pious a work for my most gracious Sovereign and Master: More
particularly, in that your Grace, under his Majesty, shall be, <hi>Opifex
rerum, &amp; mundi melioris origo.</hi> Which I shall incessantly beg in
my prayers at his hands, who is the Giver of all good things, and
will never forsake, or fail them, who do not first fail, and fall from
him: The God of mercy and Peace. With which I remain
evermore</p>
            <p>I have not dared to trust this business
(without a Cypher) but by a sure hand,
for which I have sent this bearer, my
Secretary, Express, but he knoweth
nothing of the contents hereof.</p>

            <p>The Archbishops Indorsment with his own hand.</p>
            <p>Rece. <hi>Octob. 14. 1640. Andreas ab Habernfeld,</hi> his letters sent
by Sir <hi>W. Boswel</hi> about the discovery of the Treason. I conceive
by the <hi>English-Latin</hi> herein, that he must needs be an <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
with a concealed and changed name. And yet it may be
this kind of <hi>Latin</hi> may relate to the <hi>Italian;</hi> or else he lived
some good time in <hi>England.</hi> The declaration of this Treason I
have, by his Majesties special command, sent to Sir <hi>W. Boswel,</hi>
that he may there see what proof can be made of any particulars.</p>

                     <p>ALL my senses are shaken
together, as often as I
revolve the present
business; neither doth
my understanding suffice (to
conceive) what wind hath
brought such horrid things, that
they should see the Sun-shine
by me. For besides expectation,
this good man became known
unto me, who when he had
heard me discoursing of these
<hi>Scottish</hi> stirs, said, that I knew
not the Nerve of the business,
that those things which are
commonly scattered abroad, are
commonly superficial. From
that hour he every day became
more familiar to me, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
my dexterity here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
with a full breast poured
forth the burdens of his heart
into my bosome, supposing that
he had discharged a burden of
Conscience wherewith he was
pressed. Hence he related to me
the Factions of the Jesuites, with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94478:6"/>
which the whole earthly world
was assaulted, and shewed, that
I might behold how, through
their poison, <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
were devoured, and both
of them maimed with an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>le
wound. That the same
Plague did creep through the
Realms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
the matter whereof, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in the adjacent Writing,
he discovered to me. Which
things having heard, my bowels
were contracted together, my
loins trembled with horrour,
that a pernicious gulph should
be prepared for so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of Souls. Which words
moving the Conscience, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
the mind of the man:
he had scarce one hour conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
my admonitions, but he
disclosed all the secrets, and he
gave free liberty that I should
treat with those whom it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
that they might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
thereof; I thought no
delay was to be made about
the things. The same hour I
went to Mr. <hi>Boswel,</hi> the Kings
Leger at the <hi>Hague,</hi> who being
tied with an Oath of secresie to
me, I communicated the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to him; I admonished him
to weigh these things by the
Ballance, neither to defer, but
act, that those who were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
might be speedily succou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
He, as becomes an honest
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94478:6"/>
man, mindful of his duty, and
having nearer look'd into the
business, refused not to obey the
monitions. Moreover, he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
caused, that an Express
should be dispatched; and sent
word back again, what a most
acceptable Oblation this had
been to the King and your
Grace; for which we rejoyced
from the heart, and we judged,
that a safe and favourable Deity
had interposed it self in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
whereby you might be
preserved.</p>
                     <p>Now that the verity of the
things related might be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
some principal Heads of
the conspiracy were purposely
pretermitted, that the knowledge
of them might be extorted
from the circumvented Society
of the Conspirators.</p>
                     <p>Now the things will be spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
and safely promoted into
act, if they be warily proceeded
in at Bruxels. By my advice,
that day should be observed
wherein the Packet of Letters
are dispatched, which under the
Title of, To Monsieur <hi>Strario</hi>
Arch-deacon of <hi>Cambray,</hi> tied
with one cover, are delivered
to the Post-master; such a Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
may be secretly brought
back from him, yet it will be
unprofitable, because all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
Letters are written Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteristically.
Likewise another
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94478:7"/>
Packet coming weekly from
Rome, which is brought under
this subscription, To the most
Illustrious Lord, Count <hi>Rossetti,</hi>
Legat for the time; these are
not to be neglected. To whom
likewise Letters writ in the
same Character are included.
That they may be understood,
<hi>Read</hi> is to be consulted with.
The fore-named day of dispatch
shall be expected: In <hi>Reades</hi>
house an accumulated Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
may be circumvented;
which succeeding, it will be
your Graces part to order the
business. The intestine Enemy
being at length detected by
Gods grace, all bitterness of
mind which is caused on either
side, may be abolished, delivered
to oblivion, deleted and quieted,
the Enemy be invaded on both
parts. Thus the King, and the
Kings Friend, and both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
near to danger, shall
be preserved, delivered from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
danger.</p>
                     <p>Your Grace likewise may
have this injunction by you, if
you desire to have the best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
given you by others, <hi>That
you trust not over much to your
Pursevants, for some of them live
under the Stipend of the Popish
Party.</hi> How many Rocks, how
many <hi>Scylla's,</hi> how many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
<hi>Charibdes</hi> appear before
your Grace; in what a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94478:7"/>
Sea the Cock-boat of your
Grace's life, next to Ship-wrack,
is tossed, your self may judge;
the Fore-deck of the Ship is spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
to be driven to the Harbour.</p>
                     <p>All these things (I whisper)
into your Grace's ear, for I know
it bound with an Oath of Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.
Therefore by open name I
would by these presents become
known to your Grace.</p>

the tumbling down of his
Excellent Majesty from his
Throne, is intended. Now
least the Discourse should be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
with superfluous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
we will onely premise
some things which are meerly
necessary to the business.</p>
               <p>They may first of all know,
that this good man, by whom
the ensuing things are detected,
was born and bred in the Popish
Religion, who spent many years
in Ecclesiastical dignities. At
length being found fit for the
expedition of the present Design,
by the Counsel and mandate of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94478:12"/>
the Lord Cardinal <hi>Barbarino,</hi>
he was adjoyned to the assistance
of Mr. <hi>Cuneus (Cun)</hi> by whom
he was found so diligent and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
in his Office, that hope
of great promotion was given to
him. Yet he, led by the instinct
of the good Spirit, hath, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be, contemned sweet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and having known the
vanities of the Pontifician Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
(of which he had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
been a most severe defender)
having <hi>likewise noted the malice
of those who fight under the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
banner, felt his Conscience to
be burdened; which burden that
he might ease himself of, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
his mind to the Orthodox
Religion.</hi> Soon after, that he
might exonerate his Conscience,
he thought fit that a desperate
Treason, machinated against so
many souls, was to be revealed,
and that he should receive ease
if he vented such things into the
bosom of a friend: which done,
he was seriously admonished by
the said friend, that he should
shew an example of his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and charity, and free so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
innocent souls from imminent
danger. To whose monitions
he willingly consented, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
the following things to
be put in writing, out of which
the Articles not long since tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to your Grace, may be clearly
explicated and demonstrated.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:94478:12"/>1. First of all, that the hinge
of the business may be rightly
discerned, It is to be known, that
all those factions with which all
Christendom is at this day sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
do arise from the Jesuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
offspring of Cham, of which
four Orders abound throughout
the world.</p>
               <p>Of the first Order are Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticks,
whose office it is to take
care of things promoting Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>Of the second Order are Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians,
whose office it is by any
means to shake, trouble, reform
the state of Kingdoms and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks.</p>
               <p>Of the third Order are Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
whose property it is to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
themselves into Offices
with Kings and Princes, to insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
and immix themselves in
Court businesses, bargains and
sales, and to be busied in civil
affairs.</p>
               <p>Of the fourth Order are Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligencers
(or Spies) men of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
condition, who submit
themselves to the services of great
men, Princes, Barons, Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Citizens, to deceive (or
corrupt) the minds of their
masters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Society of so many Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
the Kingdom of England
nourisheth: for scarce all Spain,
France and Italy, can yield so
great a multitude of Iesuits, as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94478:13"/>
London alone: where are found
more than 50 Scottish Iesuits.
There the said Society hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
to it self a seat of iniquity,
and hath conspired against the
King, and the most faithful to
the King, especially the Lord
Archbishop of Canterbury, and
likewise against both Kingdoms.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For it is more certain than
certainty it self, that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
Society hath determined
to effect a universal Reformation
of the Kingdom of England and
Scotland. Therefore the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the end necessarily
infers a determination of means
to the end.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Therefore to promote the
undertaken Villany, the said So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
dubbed it self with the
Title of, <hi>The Congregation of
propagating the Faith;</hi> which
acknowledgeth <hi>the Pope of Rome
the Head of the Colledge, and</hi>
Cardinal Barbarino <hi>his Substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
and Executor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The</hi> chief Patron of the
Society at <hi>London,</hi> is the Popes
Legat, who takes <hi>care of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness;
into whose bosom, these
dregs of Traytors weekly depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
all their Intelligences.</hi> Now
the Residence of this Legation
was obtained at <hi>London,</hi> in the
name of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pontife, by
whose meditation it might be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for Cardinal <hi>Barbarino,</hi> to
work so much the more easily
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94478:13"/>
                  <hi>and safely upon the King and
Kingdom.</hi> For none else could so
freely circumvent the King, as
he who should be palliated with
the Popes Authority.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Master <hi>Cuneus</hi> did at that
time enjoy the Office of the
Popes Legat, a universal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of the conjured Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and a serious Promoter of
the business; whose secrets, as
likewise those of all the other
Intelligencers, the present good
man, the Communicator of all
these things, did receive and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite
whether the business re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cuneus</hi> set upon the chief
men of the Kingdom, and left
nothing unattempted, by what
means he might corrupt them
all, and incline them to the
Pontifician Party: he enticed
many with various incitements;
<hi>yea, he sought to delude the King
himself with gifts of Pictures,
Antiquities, Idols, and of other
vanities brought from</hi> Rome;
<hi>which yet would prevail nothing
with the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having entred familiarity
with the King, he is often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
at</hi> Hampton-Court, <hi>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
at</hi> London, to undertake the
cause of the Palatine, and that
he would interpose his Authority,
and by his intercession persuade
the <hi>Legat of Colen,</hi> that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine</hi>
in the next Diet to treat
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94478:14"/>
of Peace, might be inserted into
the Conditions; which verily he
promised, but performed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
He writ indeed, that he
had been so desired by the King
concerning such things; <hi>yet he
advised not that they should be
consented to, lest peradventure
it might be said by the</hi> Spaniard,
<hi>that the Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>had pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronized
an Heretical Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Cuneus</hi>
smelling from the Archbishop,
most trusty to the King, that
the Kings mind was wholly
pendulous (or doubtful) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
that he would move
every stone, and apply his forces,
that he might gain him to his
Party: certainly confiding, that
he had a means prepared. For he
had a command to offer a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
Cap to the Lord Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
in the name of the Pope
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that he should
allure him also with higher pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
that he might corrupt his
sincere mind. Yet a fitting oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
was never given, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he might insinuate himself
into the Lord Archbishop (for
the Scorpion sought an Egg)
Free access was to be impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Earl and Countess of
<hi>Arundel,</hi> likewise by Secretary
<hi>Windebank.</hi> The intercession of
all which being neglected, he
did flie the company or familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Cuneus</hi> worse than the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94478:14"/>
plague. He was likewise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
by other of no mean
rank, well known to him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet was he moved.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Another also was assayed,
who hindred access to the dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
wickedness, Secretary
<hi>Cook;</hi> he was a most bitter ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> from whom
he intercepted access to the
King; he entertained many
(of them) according to their
deserts, he diligently enquired
into their Factions; by which
means, every incitement, breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a magnetical <hi>(attractive)</hi>
power to the Popish Party, was
ineffectual with him; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was so dear unto him that
might incline him to wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Hereupon being made
odious to the Patrons of the
Conspiracy, he was endangered
to be discharged from his Office;
it was laboured for three years
space, and at last obtained.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithstanding there
remained on the Kings part a
knot hard to be untied; for the
Lord Archbishop, by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
interposed himself as a
most hard Rock.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Cuneus</hi> had understood,
from the Lord Archbishops
part, that he had laboured in
vain, his malice, and the whole
Societies, waxed boyling hot.
Soon after Ambushes began to
be prepared, wherewith the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94478:15"/>
Lord Archbishop, together with
the King, should be taken.</p>
               <p>Likewise a Sentence is passed
against the King (for whose
sake all this business is disposed)
because nothing is hoped from
him, which might seem to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Popish Religion (but
especially, <hi>when he had opened
his mind, that he was of this
opinion, that every one might be
saved in his own Religion, so as
he be an honest and pious man.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. To perpetuate the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
undertaken, the criminal
execution at <hi>Westminster,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by some Writings of Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
gave occasion of the first
fire: which thing was so much
exasperated and exagarated by
the Papists to the Puritans, that
if it remained unrevenged, it
would be thought a blemish to
their Religion. The flames of
which fire, the subsequent Book
of Prayers encreases.</p>
               <p n="9">9. In this heat, a certain
Scotish Earl, called <hi>Maxfield,</hi> if
I mistake not, was expedited to
the <hi>Scots</hi> by the Popish Party;
with whom two other Scotish
Earls, Papists, held correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency:
he ought to stir up the
People to commotion, and rub
over the injury afresh, that he
might enflame their minds, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
them to Arms, by which
the hurtful disturber of the Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
liberty might be slain.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:94478:15"/>10. There, by one labour,
snares are prepared for the King;
for this purpose the present busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was so ordered, that very
many of the <hi>English</hi> should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to the <hi>Scots;</hi> That
the King should remain
inferiour in Arms, who <hi>(there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon)</hi>
should be compelled
to crave assistance from the
Papists; which yet he should
not obtain, unless he would des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
into conditions, by which
he should permit; Universal
liberty of the exercise of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Religion; for so the affairs
of the Papists would succeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their desire. To
which consent, if he should shew
himself more difficult, there
should be a present remedy at
hand: For the Kings son grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now very fast to his youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
age (who is educated from
his tender age, that he might
accustom himself to the Popish
Party) the King is to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched:
<hi>For an Indian Nut
stuffed with most sharp poyson, is
kept in the Society (which</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus
<hi>at that time shewed often to
me in a boasting manner) wherein
a poyson was prepared for the
King: after the example of his
Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. In this <hi>Scottish</hi> Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the <hi>Marquess</hi> of <hi>Hamelton,</hi> was
often dispatched to the <hi>Scots</hi> in
the name of the King, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpose
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94478:16"/>
the Royal Authority,
whereby the heat of minds might
be mitigated, returned not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
as often without
fruit, and without ending the
business: <hi>His Chaplain at that
time repaired to us, who commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
some things secrely with</hi>
Cuneus. Being demanded of
me in jest, <hi>Whether also the Iews
agreed with the Samaritans?
Cuneus</hi> thereunto answered;
Would to God all Ministers were
such as he: what you will, may
be hence conjectured.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Things standing thus,
there arrived at <hi>London</hi> from
<hi>Cardinal Richelieu,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas
Chamberlain,</hi> his Chaplain and
Almoner, a <hi>Scot</hi> by nation, who
ought to assist the Colledge of
the confederated Society, and
seriously to set forward the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to leave nothing unattempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
whereby the first heat might
be exasperated. For which service
he was promised the reward of a
Bishoprick. He cohabited with
the Society four moneths space;
neither was it lawful for him
first to depart, until things suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
according to his wish,
he might be able to return back
again with good news.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Sir <hi>Toby Matthéw,</hi> a
Jesuited Priest, of the Order of
Politicians, a most vigilant man
of the chief heads, to whom a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94478:16"/>
bed was never so dear, that he
would rest his head thereon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing
his body with sleep in
a chair for an hour or two, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day nor night spared his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations;
a man principally
noxious, and himself the Plague
of the King and Kingdom of
<hi>England;</hi> a most impudent man,
who flies to all banquets, and
feasts, called or not called!
never quiet, always in action
and perpetual motion! thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself into all conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
of Superiors; he urgeth
conferences familiarly, that he
may fish out the minds of men,
what ever he observeth thence,
which may bring any commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
or discommodity to the
part of the Conspirators, he
communicates to the Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat:
The more secret things he
himself writes to the Pope, or to
Cardinal <hi>Barbarino.</hi> In sum, he
adjoyns himself to any mans
company; no word can be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
that he will not lay hold on,
and accommodate to his party.
In the mean time, what ever he
hath fished out, he reduceth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Catalogue, and every Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
carrieth it to the General
Consistory of the Jesuites Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
which secretly meets toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Province of <hi>Wales,</hi>
where he is an acceptable guest.
There counsels are secretly ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered,
which are most meet for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94478:17"/>
the convulsion of the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astick
and Politick estate of both
Kingdoms.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Captain <hi>Read,</hi> a Scot,
dwelling in <hi>Longacre-street,</hi> near
the Angel-Tavern, a Secular
Jesuite, who for his detestable
office performed (whereby he
had perverted a certain Minister
of the Church, with secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements
to the Popish Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with all his Family, taking
his Daughter to Wife) for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
obtained a Rent or
Impost upon Butter, which the
Countrey people are bound to
render to him, procured for
him from the King, by some
chief men of the Society, who
never want a spur, whereby he
may be constantly detained in
his office. In his house the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the whole Plot is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
where the Society which
hath conspired against the King,
the Lord Archbishop, and both
Kingdoms, meet together, for
the most part every day; but
on the day of the Carriers (or
Posts) dispatch, which is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
<hi>Friday,</hi> they meet in
greater numbers; for then all
the Intelligencers assemble, and
confer in common, what things
every of them hath fished out
that week; who that they may
be without suspicion, send their
secrets by <hi>Toby Matthew,</hi> or
<hi>Read</hi> himself, to the Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94478:17"/>
he transmits the compacted
Packet, which he hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from the Intelligencers, to
<hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With the same <hi>Read,</hi> the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
brought from <hi>Rome</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited,
under seigned Titles and
Names, who by him are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to all to whom they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain:
for all and every of
their names are known to him.</p>
               <p>Upon the very same occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Letters also are brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
under the covert of Father
<hi>Philip,</hi> (he notwithstanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ignorant of things) from
whom they are distributed to the
Conspirators.</p>
               <p>There is in that very house
a publick Chappel, wherein an
ordinary Jesuite consecrates, and
dwells there. In the said Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
Masses are daily celebrated
by the Jesuites; and it serves for
the baptizing of the Children of
the house, and of some of the
Conspirators.</p>
               <p>Those who assemble in the
fore-named house, come fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in Coaches, or on Hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
in Lay-mens habit, and
with a great train, wherewith
they are disguised, that they may
not be known; yet they are Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,
and conjured Members of
the Society.</p>
               <p n="15">15. All the Papists of <hi>England</hi>
contribute to this Assembly, lest
any thing should be wanting
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94478:18"/>
to promote the undertaken de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.
Upon whose Treasury, one
Widow, Owner of the Houses
wherein Secretary <hi>Windebank</hi>
now dwelleth, dead above <unclear>three</unclear>
years since, bestowed four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand English pounds;
so likewise others contributed
above their abilities, so as the
business may be promoted unto
its desired end.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Besides the foresaid
Houses, there are also Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
kept in other more secret
places, of which verily they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide
not even among themselves,
for fear lest they should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.
First, every of them
are called to certain Inns, (one
not knowing of the other) hence
they are severally led by Spies
to the place where they ought
to meet, otherwise ignorant
where they ought to assemble, lest
peradventure they should be
surprised at unawares.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The Countess of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi>
a strenuous She-Champion
of the Popish Religion, bends all
her Nerves to the Universal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;
whatsoever she hears
at the Kings Court, that is done
secretly or openly, in words or
deeds, she presently imparts to
the Popes Legat, with whom
she meets thrice a day, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in <hi>Arundel-house,</hi> now at
the Court, or at <hi>Tart-hall.</hi> He
scarce sucks such things by the
Claw.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:94478:18"/>The Earl himself, called now
about three years since, this
year ought to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

things, concerning the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</p>
               <p>With gifts and speeches, the
Jesuits watch diligently to their
Masses.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Greenwich</hi> at the Earls
costs, a Feminine School is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
which otherwise is a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery
of Nuns; for the young
Girls therein are sent forth hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and thither into Foreign
Monasteries beyond the Seas.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> of the Kings Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,
most addicted to the
Popish Religion, is a bitter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of the King: He reveals all
his greatest secrets to the Popes
Legat; although he very rarely
meets with him, yet his Wife
meets him so much the oftner,
who being informed by her
Husband, conveys secrets to the
Legat. In all his actions he is
nothing inferiour to <hi>Toby Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew:</hi>
it cannot be uttered how
diligently he watcheth on the
business.</p>
               <p>His Sons are secretly instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in the Popish Religion;
openly they profess the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
The eldest is now to
receive his Fathers Office, under
the King which shall be: a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
Hat is provided for the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94478:19"/>
other, if the Design shall suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
well.</p>
               <p>Above three years past, the
said Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> was to be sent
away by the King to <hi>Morocco:</hi>
but he was prohibited by the
Society, lest the business should
suffer delay thereby.</p>
               <p>He is a Patron of the Jesuits,
for whom, for the exercise of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
he provides Chappels
both at home and abroad.</p>
               <p>Secretary <hi>Windebank,</hi> a most
fierce Papist, is the most unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the King of all men,
who not onely betrays and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals
even the Kings greatest se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
but likewise communicates
Counsels, by which the Design
may be best advanced. He at
least thrice every week con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseth
with the Legat in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturnal

thinks fit to be known; for
which end, he hired a house near

the meeting is facilitated.</p>
               <p>The said Secretary is bribed

others, who have sworn unto
this Conspiracy, are all most
vigilant in the design. Some of
these are enticed with the hope
of Court, others of Political
Offices; others attend to the
sixteen Cardinals Caps that are
vacant, which are therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
idle for some years, that
they may impose a vain hope on
those who expect them.</p>

aforesaid Society was my Lord
<hi>Gage,</hi> a Jesuit Priest, dead above
three years since. He had a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
adorned with lascivious
Pictures, which counterfeited
prophaneness in the house; but
with them was palliated a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery
wherein fourty Nuns
were maintained, hid in so great
a Palace. It is situated in <hi>Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street,</hi>
which the Statue of a
golden Queen adorns. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Jesuits have bought all this
Street, and have reduced it into
a Quadrangle, where a Jesuitical
Colledge is tacitly built, with
this hope, that it might be
openly finished, as soon as the
universal Reformation was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</p>
