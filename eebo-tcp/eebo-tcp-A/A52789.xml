            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THESE Lives of <hi>Cornelius Nepos,</hi> which I now Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent your Lordſhip in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> have had the good Fortune to ſurvive in their Original (the <hi>Latin)</hi> ſeventeen hundred years: And tho the Obſervation of the Excellent Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> be very Ingenious, <hi>That Time is like a
<pb facs="tcp:99884:3"/>
River, which bears up the Stubble and ſuch light things, but lets the more weighty and ſubſtantial ſink;</hi> yet muſt this be taken for a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, and as ſuch is only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the Abuſes which the Authority of precedent Ages, as well as other Humane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, is and may be ſubject to. For to ſuppoſe, that thoſe things which have paſt the Teſt of the wiſeſt and ſevereſt Ages, have at laſt nothing of intrinſic value in themſelves, but owe the long poſſeſſing of Fame to a Hit of Fortune, to the Humour or tame Obſequiouſneſs of a long Succeſſion of Admirers, is ſo bold an Attempt upon the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Mankind, that he that makes it <hi>muſt either have much of the God, or a great deal of
<pb facs="tcp:99884:3"/>
the Fool;</hi> By invincible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to demonſtrate the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes of the Learned World in all its Stages, requires a Soul of a Divine Perſpicacity, clear from thoſe Incumbrances that have miſguided the Proſpect of other Mortals. To oppoſe a ſingle capricious Opinion to the collected Force of ſo many Men's Judgment, looks like the Hero in the Play, or the Knight-Errant in the Romance; who with two Legs and two Arms, Fights and Routs whole Millions. I do not (My Lord) Apologize for our Author, as if He need beg a Bleſſing from Antiquity, or want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Teſtimonials of Precedent Ages to ſupport his Credit; had he been Written in this time He is Tranſlated, there is worth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb facs="tcp:99884:4"/>
in Him to recommend Him to all Lovers of Hiſtory. <hi>Cornelius Nepos</hi> Liv'd in an Age, that had the greateſt Taſte of Good Senſe of any poſſibly ſince the Creation. Eloquence did not then conſiſt in the gaudy Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Metaphors, or the forc'd acuteneſs of a ſhort cut Period, but Good Senſe naturally and cleanly Expreſs'd, was the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and his Court in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd. Our Author cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed pretend to the Politeneſs of <hi>Cicero,</hi> but yet He has nothing but what is Manly and Strong; and if my weak Judgement informs me right, there runs through his Writings a Gentile Vein of ſpeaking unaffectedly, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares Him a Man remov'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the <hi>Pedant</hi> or <hi>Plebeian.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99884:4"/>
Here it muſt be Confeſt, He is now and then rough in the Period, and negligent in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; but the judicious <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian</hi> allows this to be ſometimes a Beauty; and 'tis the opinion of moſt Critics, that if there be any fault in <hi>Tully</hi> himſelf, 'tis that He is too Set and Formal in his Stile. There are ſome Faces that are very exact in the Symmetry of their Parts, and the mixture of Colour, and yet they are not pleaſing; While on the other Hand, there are others in which Nature ſeems to have made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Miſtakes; Eloquence is only the Beauty of Language. in which a too formal obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of Exactneſs is diſguſtful. There is as much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Gentile practiſe of
<pb facs="tcp:99884:5"/>
Rhetorick, and the heavy Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity that ariſes purely from the attendance upon its Rules, as there is between the Gentile Addreſs of a Gentleman, and the fulſome Compliment of a School-Maſter. Such is his Stile, that it ſeems to give <hi>Cornelius Nepos</hi> a pretence to the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of your Lordſhip, whoſe Anceſtors have reflected greater Honor upon Learning and Learned Societies, than They could ever receive from them. 'Tis in the Great Name of the <hi>Bartu's,</hi> we meet the two great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Ornaments of Mankind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd, Learning and Nobility; and in that Generous Noble Blood, not only Honor, but Wiſedome are convey'd. The reaſon <hi>Petronius Arbiter</hi> gives,
<pb facs="tcp:99884:5"/>
why good Senſe and true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon were in his Age in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, is, <hi>Becauſe every Man muſt fiſh with ſuch baits he thinks will take,</hi> but ſays the ſame Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Author, <hi>We have loſt the generous Palate;</hi> Had your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Liv'd in that time, there could have been no occaſion for this general Complaint. In your Lordſhip a <hi>Virgil</hi> or a <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> might have found an <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> or <hi>Maecenas,</hi> who did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive the Compliments of thoſe Great Men, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood their Worth. Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has in ſhort drawn the Greateſt Heroes that <hi>Athens, Sparta, Thebes, Corinth,</hi> and even <hi>Afric</hi> it ſelf could boaſt, and 'tis to Him that <hi>Rome</hi> does owe its <hi>Atticus.</hi> It often happens, that a
<pb facs="tcp:99884:6"/>
Prince is better repreſented by his Coyns, then by his Statues; ſo without detracting from the juſt praiſe of others, <hi>Nepos</hi> may poſſibly give as lively an Idea of an <hi>Alcibiades</hi> or <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> as thoſe who have drawn out their Deſcriptions to a greater length; For as in Mens Faces, ſo in their Actions, there are certain pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Airs that diſtinguiſh one from another; if you hit theſe, you give the Character as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, as if your Canvaſs was as large as the Object, and you took in every Hair. The deſign of Hiſtory is to inſtruct by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and Correct the Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Life; to Trace out the Roads by which Great Men arriv'd at Fame, and the Rocks they have ſplit againſt. All the
<pb facs="tcp:99884:6"/>
reward We can pay to defunct Virtue, is a grateful Remembrance of it, and Vice is a Deteſtation to Poſterity. <hi>Phocion's</hi> Beneficence will be an Eternal Monument: <hi>Eumenes</hi> his unſhaken Loyalty to the Poſterity of his Prince will never be forgotten: And <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades</hi> his tender Paſſion to an ungrateful Country, will laſt as long as Senſe remains in the World. Such Examples may afford Your Lordſhip's leiſure Hours a Divertiſement, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pretend to Direct. The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of your own Family is a Treaſure of Greatneſs and Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, which affords Inſtances (of both Sexes) for every Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Duty of Life. And here we cannot enough Admire the inimitable Gallantry of <hi>Katha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99884:7"/>
Dutcheſs of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> whoſe Zeal to the Proteſtant Religion at leaſt came up to the Example of the moſt Primitive Confeſſors; who ſupported all the Variety of Her numerous Afflictions with the Meekneſs of Her own Sex, and the Courage of Ours: While every Country prov'd more Hoſpitable to that Admirable Lady than Her own; and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves oblig'd to Reverence that Virtue which we could not Bear. Nor need I inſtance in thoſe Heroes of your Family, to whoſe Noble Atchievments the Great <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was ſo highly obliged, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> owe ſo great a part of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Nor perhaps was the very attempt of Civilizing <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99884:7"/>
an undertaking of leſs Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry and Spirit, ſince 'tis eaſier to Create then Reſtore. When at length the unhappineſs of an Headſtrong Nation recall'd them from Forreign to Domeſtick Wars, with how much Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, how much Loyalty did the Heroick <hi>Lindſey</hi> eſpouſe his Royal Maſters Intereſt! He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed both the Allurements and Forces of a Faction, then almoſt Irreſiſtable, and receiv'd the Aſſaults of the Rebellious Army, as unmov'd as an <hi>Iſthmus</hi> does the ſhock of conteſting Waves. He oppos'd his Perſon to the moſt eminent Dangers in the Defence of oppreſs'd Majeſty, and dyed like one that had a true value for Life, and knew how advantageouſly a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
<pb facs="tcp:99884:8"/>
of Life were chang'd for an Immortality of Fame.</p>
            <p>To be Nobly Born is (My Lord) queſtionleſs one of the greateſt worldly Happineſſes kind Heaven beſtows; and Nature for ſeveral Ages ſeems to prepare and refine the Blood of a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that She may at laſt work out and introduce one Perfectly Great Man. That this is Your Lordſhips Caſe we have reaſon to beleive, in whom all the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that are thriftily divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, are United. Well then may <hi>Cornelius Nepos</hi> be Proud of Your Lordſhip's Name to Lead up his Horoes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect thoſe that were, while they liv'd, the Patriots of their Country.</p>
            <p>Each Virtue takes its propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Exigences of time
<pb facs="tcp:99884:8"/>
and Place. He that ſtands upon the ſecure Shore, and undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly views the ungovern'd rage of the Ocean, does not, on this account, deſerve the Praiſe of a Valiant Man; but He is the Maſter of true Courage, that all the time ſedately ſtemms the Ship; endeavors to be ſafe, yet fears not to meet Death in its moſt dreadful ſhape. Amongſt the polluted ſpawn of Pamphlets which have crawl'd about du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this Ferment of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, there have been a few who have compared it to a Ship toſs'd by dangerous Waves. Let the deſign of theſe Parable-Makers be what it will (as in moſt of them it has been bad enough) yet the ſimilitude is to the purpoſe; and Your Lordſhip
<pb facs="tcp:99884:9"/>
has had no ſmall ſhare in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this leaky Veſſel from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. 'Tis an obſervation too well known among Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, <hi>That the Virtue of a Prince may ſometimes turn to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;</hi> of which we have had a ſad Example in the Bleſſed Martyr <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, <hi>Who Suffer'd, and Dyed for being Good; and the ſame Jews that acted that ſad Tragedy, deſigned a ſecond up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Son of his Loyns and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritor of His Vertues;</hi> As if they were reſolv'd by repeated Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, to revoke that Axiom of the Moraliſts, <hi>That the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral effect of Benevolence and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even in this World, is a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal Love and Felicity;</hi> and ſo it is in all except the Fanatick, whom both the Father and
<pb facs="tcp:99884:9"/>
Grandfather of our Gracious Prince, aſſures Us, <hi>that no Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit can oblige.</hi> And really the Fanatick is no more to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within the general Rules of Reaſon than the Brute; becauſe as this acts according to the inſtinct of its Nature, which often carries it contrary o the principles of a Rational Creature, ſo the Fanatick is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the giddy Impulſe of <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> which has abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of more points then the Compaſs. This is that Monſter who ever ſince His Majeſties Happy, Happy Reſtoration, has endeavour'd to lay an open and eaſie way to the Deſtruction of the Government, by endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by their unreaſonable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies to make the chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of It Contemptible to the

People. They have been indeed, like cunning Artiſts, a long while heating and preparing the matter; and in Seventy-eight, when they found the Bent and Byaſs of the People work'd into a Temper, then it was, that <hi>Corah</hi> ſhew'd Himſelf and pronounc'd, <hi>That the Prince and the Prieſt had donſpir'd together againſt our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi> This carry'd on under ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretences, put the People into a fit of down right Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and when the Zealous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum was made on that ſide of the imaginary point of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs whence Popery was to come, the Fanatick had juſt planted his Colours on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary part of our City. 'Tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to confound a Man and make Him (if poſſible) to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear being in the ſame Claſs of

Nature with theſe ſort of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, to conſider the unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Whims in their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. All that dyed for Dr. <hi>Titus</hi> his Plot with their laſt breath aſſerting their Innocence were not believ'd, becauſe, <hi>Popery allow'd Diſpenſations for Lying, and could eaſily elude, not only the Dictates of</hi> Chriſtianity <hi>but of Nature too;</hi> And now it comes to the Fanaticks turn to Hang, one would think on ſuch an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they ſhould not only ſing <hi>Hopkins</hi> very heartily, but ſpeak true too; and yet all theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Gentlemen that dy'd, having, in part at leaſt, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd the matter of Fact for which they were Condemn'd, tho they ſeem to deny the Guilt of it, the Brethren matter it not; and yet could theſe beleive, that
<pb facs="tcp:99884:11"/>
a Mad-man with a Fire-ball up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a pole, ſet <hi>London</hi> into flames.</p>
            <p>My Lord, we had felt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal effects of this mixture of Villany and Madneſs, had not the moſt Wiſe Conduct of His <hi>MAJESTY</hi> (aſſiſted by ſuch Loyal and Courageous Hands as Your Lordſhips) deliver'd Us from the Dreadful Precipice, which we ſaw and trembled at. The Fable of the Viper, which the kind Country-man having warm'd into Life, ſtung its Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor, was by Antiquity thought to expreſs Ingratitude in its higheſt Extent. The Faction outgoe this; They hiſs at and wound a Prince, who is not only ſo far their Redeemer, as that He reſtor'd them to Life <hi>when they were Dead in Law and Juſtice,</hi> but ſhew'd Himſelf
<pb facs="tcp:99884:11"/>
of that Forbearance and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, that He ſeem'd to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate whither he had beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge their Inſolence, or fall Himſelf. Such extraordinary Goodneſs deſerv'd the Expence of all the Miracles Heaven could lay out for its Deliverance!</p>
            <p>We who are happy in living near Your Lordſhip, felt the warm Influence; The ſame Plague of Republican Principle, which had infected the Capital City of this Fortunate Iſland had gain'd too great a Party among the Citizens of this place. The very Men that eat Our Bread were keenly prepar'd to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded thoſe Sacred Seats which ſupport them, and have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually reſcued both them and their Predeceſſors from Beggary. Affronts are not to be meaſur'd
<pb facs="tcp:99884:12"/>
by the real Loſs we undergo, but that uneaſineſs of Spirit they bring upon the Men that ſuffer them; To be ſlighted by a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior is a thing we may calmly (tho with ſome grief) ſubmit to; to be neglected, contemn'd, and trod upon by an Inferior, who depends upon Us for his very Breath, is ſo inſufferable Uſage that nothing but the Meekneſs of a Primitive Confeſſor could forgive it.

            <head>THE LIFE OF CORN. NEPOS.</head>
            <p>THere is no part of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Learning ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally Advantageous to Mankind, as Hiſtory. It reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cues our Anceſtors from Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion; It can Inſtruct and Delight the Preſent and Future Ages. We are oblig'd by all the Laws of Natural Religion, to preſerve our Relations as long as poſſibly we can: Even then when their Lives are ſcarce worth the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when Old Age has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd them uſeleſs both in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and Private Capacities, by the nauſeous Methods of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
<pb facs="tcp:99884:14"/>
we endeavour to keep them among us. And certainly our Piety ſhould not end at the Grave; but employ it ſelf in ſecuring all that remains of them. Urns and Pyramids can only preſerve their Aſhes; which are, even to the moſt curious Obſerver, undiſtinguiſhable from thoſe of other Men. Pictures and Medals repreſent only their outward Lineaments; which are often not unlike in Fools and Wiſe-men. But Hiſtory gives an Account of their Nobler Parts; their Wit, their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and their Virtue: And the Reader hath, what will be no inconſiderable part of our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the other World, the Converſation of all the Great and Good Men of paſt Ages.
<pb facs="tcp:99884:14"/>
And their Examples will prove to him far greater Incentives to Virtue than all the grave and ſerious Precepts of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. They aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Boldneſs and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of a Legiſlator, lay down rigid and ſevere Rules of Life, treat us with jejune and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted Notions, which few Perſons can underſtand, much leſs deduce to practice: But the the force of Example is intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible to the meaneſt Capacities. We Read, and Admire; and, having naturally an Itch after Glory, purſue the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods our Forefathers ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully proceeded in.</p>
            <p>But tho Hiſtory in General be ſo Pleaſant and Inſtructive, yet certainly Biography is more
<pb facs="tcp:99884:15"/>
Eminently ſo. The General Hiſtorian is wholly taken up in giving the Relations of Great and Glorious Exploits; of the Riſe and Fall of Empires and Great Men. You have <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> at the <hi>Granic,</hi> and <hi>Ceſar</hi> in the Fields of <hi>Pharſalia:</hi> But an account of their daily Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, of the Menage of their Eſtate, their Behaviour to their Friends and their Family, their Government of their own Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is below the Dignity of the Subject; and if the Author ſhould oblige us by an uſeful Digreſſion (it may be, of more real Advantage than the whole Series of the Hiſtory) it would be call'd by the Men of Art, an impertinent Excreſcence; and the whole Work be eſteem'd
<pb facs="tcp:99884:15"/>
Monſtrous, that in one part ſo ſwells beyond the lawful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. As the poor Poet is Damn'd in <hi>Horace,</hi> that becauſe he had got a delicate Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> was reſolv'd to inſert it into his Poem, tho wholly impertinent to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
            <p>Yet certainly the Hiſtory of theſe Actions, tho of a meaner nature, is infinitely more uſeful. The other, 'tis true, are more Heroical and Illuſtrious, extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fit objects for our Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but uſually unimitable. They do indeed raiſe our Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but then they debauch our Reaſon: For, as the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs of thoſe who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd themſelves in the uſe of Spirituous Liquors, can after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb facs="tcp:99884:16"/>
admit of no wholeſom Diet: So, after theſe Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Accounts of Knights and Giants, all ſober and ſound Senſe proves Nauſeous to us.</p>
            <p>In the General Hiſtory, we ſee the Hero at the Head of an Army, or in a Triumph; but by what Steps and Degrees he rais'd Himſelf to this Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we are unacquainted with; which would yet more improve and delight the Reader. The Acquiſition of Glory, is like that of Money: The greateſt Art conſiſts in getting a Stock at firſt; which afterwards, if manag'd with an ordinary Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, encreaſes prodigiouſly.</p>
            <p>Biography is indeed of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and confin'd Nature; ſince it reſpects only the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:99884:16"/>
of particular Perſons, and is not oblig'd to give the whole Proceſs of an Expedition. And therefore, ſince the <hi>Mithridatic</hi> War was manag'd by <hi>Sylla, Lucullus,</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, an accurate Deſcription of it is not to be expected from the Biographer. But then the General Hiſtorian is as imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the Lives of particular Perſons; takes them only as they fall in his way, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not inſiſt long upon them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tranſgreſſing the Laws of a Methodical Hiſtory. But the Biographer attends his Hero from the Cradle to the Throne: Shews him at firſt, it may be, mean and contemptible, deſpis'd and depreſs'd, till at laſt by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Induſtry he breaks thro
<pb facs="tcp:99884:17"/>
all Impediments, and in deſpite of Envy and Detraction, mounts Himſelf above his peeviſh Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. He accompanies him in his Retirements, gives his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to his Friend and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, acquaints you with his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements, lays aſide the State and Grandeur, the Pomp and Parade, draws the Scene, and ſhews you the Man himſelf, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of his Gaudy or Formal Dreſs. And then, whereas the General Hiſtorian, like a falſe Courtier, takes notice of him only in his Greatneſs; and when he becomes unfit for Service in the Camp or the Senate (as ſome ill Maſters do their worn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Servants) deſerts him; Bio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy ſtill waits upon him, tho diſcarded the Court; and tells
<pb facs="tcp:99884:17"/>
you with what Courage and good Grace he bears the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts of his ungrateful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, his Sickneſs, and Death it ſelf. Which certainly (unleſs you read Hiſtory as Ladies do Romances) you would as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly be inform'd of, as his Gallantry in the hotteſt Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 'Twere eaſie to enlarge upon this ſubject, were I to write a Panegyric of Biography, and not the Life of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Hiſtorian.</p>
            <p>Among Authors of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there is ſcarce any ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable as <hi>C. Nepos;</hi> who has had the good Fortune to pleaſe the moſt Judicious Critics of all Ages; but in this is ſtrangely unhappy, That having been ſo induſtrious in Immortalizing
<pb facs="tcp:99884:18"/>
other Men, and having wrote a particular Volume of the Lives of Hiſtorians, he himſelf has been almoſt forgotten, and we have very little left us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him. Nay, and to add to the Misfortune, even this very Treatiſe, of the Lives of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Generals, which is the only one left us of his numerous Writings, hath by ſome very ill Judges been attributed to an obſcure perſon, one <hi>Aemilius Probus,</hi> who liv'd in the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Age of <hi>Theodoſius.</hi> But of this below.</p>
            <p>He was born in <hi>Hoſtilia,</hi> a Village depending upon <hi>Verona;</hi> whereof <hi>Pliny, Antonine</hi> in his Itinerary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make mention; and is at this day ſubject to the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction of <hi>Verona. Verona</hi> lies near the <hi>Po;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99884:18"/>
upon which account <hi>Pliny</hi> calls our Author <hi>Podi Accola:</hi> It is ſituated likewiſe in that part of <hi>Italy</hi> which the <hi>Romans</hi> (for to us 'tis otherwiſe) call'd <hi>Italia Tranſpadana,</hi> that part of <hi>Italy</hi> which is on the other ſide the <hi>Po:</hi> So that <hi>Catullus,</hi> in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of his Excellent Poems to <hi>C. Nepos,</hi> might very juſtly call him an <hi>Italian.</hi> But becauſe the ſame Country was call'd <hi>Gallia Togata</hi> (or that part of <hi>Gall</hi> wherein Gowns, the <hi>Roman</hi> Habit, were worn, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Gallia Braccata,</hi> ſo nam'd from the Garments of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Inhabitants) <hi>Auſonius,</hi> alluding to <hi>Catullus's</hi> foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Epigram, tells his <hi>Paca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> That he had found a more Learn'd and Obliging Patron
<pb facs="tcp:99884:19"/>
than <hi>Gall</hi> furniſh'd <hi>Catullus</hi> with. But theſe two Poets may be eaſily reconcil'd, conſidering that the ſame place was, with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reſpects, reckon'd part both of <hi>Gall</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> Now, that <hi>Nepos</hi> was a <hi>Veroneſe,</hi> was the conſtant opinion of that City, where in the Senate-Houſe his Statue was erected among thoſe of the Illuſtrious Men born there. <hi>Elios Vinetus</hi> would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed perſwade us, that there is nothing of certainty when <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos</hi> was born; but beſides the conſtant Tradition of the City of <hi>Verona,</hi> and that his Statue was plac'd among thoſe of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronian</hi> Writers, (which certainly would ſatisfie any man of a tolerable ingenuity) we have the Authority of <hi>Leander, Alber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
<pb facs="tcp:99884:19"/>
Paulus Merula,</hi> and of the Learn'd and Illuſtrious <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Becellus,</hi> Chancellor of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Territories of <hi>Verona</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a delicate thin Air; the Soil as healthful, as well water'd, and ſupply'd with Fruits of all kinds, as moſt places in the World; as if it were deſign'd by Nature for the Country of Great and Witty Men. 'Tis not impoſſible for a great Genius to proceed from an unhealthy and boggy Soil, where the Air as well as Water ſtagnates, and is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted: But 'tis very improbable there ſhould. <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar</hi> were born in <hi>Boeotia,</hi> but not one eminent Writer more, as we hear of. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> came from <hi>Rotterdam;</hi> and yet the greateſt
<pb facs="tcp:99884:20"/>
Judg of the laſt Age was pleas'd to ſay of <hi>Gretſer, 'Tis a Witty Man for a German.</hi> And if we conſider the dependance which our Souls have upon our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as to their operations, we need not wonder, that thick and foggy Airs ſhould ſo ſeldom be bleſs'd with extraordinary Men. 'Tis certainly a mighty Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to be Born in a place emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for Wit and Learning; where great Examples daily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before us, and raiſe in us a generous Emulation to equal or ſurpaſs them. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it is, that Cities have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come famous for ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Excellence; and Wit, as ſome Herbs, if once rooted in a ground, cannot without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty be got out. <hi>Verona</hi> has
<pb facs="tcp:99884:20"/>
indeed produc'd as great Wits, and as Learn'd Men in all Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, as any City perhaps in the World. Here were born the two <hi>Plinies, Macer</hi> the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanic Poet, <hi>Vitruvius</hi> the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, and (in a later Age) that Prodigy of Wit and Learning <hi>Hieronymus Fracaſtorius,</hi> the beſt Phyfitian, Mathematician, and Poet of his Age.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Nepos</hi> was Born in a Place famous for polite Learning, ſo likewiſe in an Age when Wit and Elegance of Stile were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to their utmoſt perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in that Age which the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics call, <hi>The Golden Age of Elc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</hi> There is no queſtion, but <hi>Junius</hi> the Rebel, <hi>M. Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the Dictator, <hi>Menenius Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi> ſo famous for Reconciling
<pb facs="tcp:99884:21"/>
the <hi>Patricians</hi> and <hi>Plebeians,</hi> did make Orations to the People; tho not ſo fine ones as Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans aſcribe to them. They were certainly Men of incomparable Valour and of ſound Senſe; but they had only a good unpoliſh'd rough Eloquence, and with that attain'd their Ends upon a People rude and illiterate; and wanted only a <hi>Grecian</hi> Education, to render 'em the greateſt Wits in their Age. But as the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire began to extend it ſelf into <hi>Greece,</hi> and People admir'd the Oratory of that Nation, the <hi>Roman</hi> Language was daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd. It at firſt became neat and clean, the Words and Phraſes proper and eaſie, not florid, much leſs ranting and fuſtian. This is that which is ſo admirable in
<pb facs="tcp:99884:21"/>
the ancient Comedies, of which <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence</hi> are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now left us; which as <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> well obſerves, our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes have endear'd to us; we admire them the more, becauſe we have none elſe left us to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire. In the Eloquence of that Age, there was nothing affected, nothing of Paint and Daubing, but pure Natural Beauty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debauch'd, and preferable upon account of its Native ſimplicity to all the ſwelling Rhetoric of ſome after Ages. But at laſt the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtyle was Illuſtrated with Tropes and Figures; which, if Modeſtly made uſe of, are the real Ornaments of a ſtyle, but if us'd with Imprudence, become nauſeous, and more like the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a Mad-man than an
<pb facs="tcp:99884:22"/>
Orator. In this Golden Age, the <hi>Romans</hi> had rais'd themſelves to the utmoſt pitch, they had gone as far as Prudence would permit them; which when their immediate Succeſſors endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to ſurpaſs, they ſwell'd into Bombaſt, and their Wit was more like an Hydropic Tumor, than a Natural Plumpneſs. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> brought this diſeaſe of ſtyle into <hi>Italy;</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Oration for <hi>Archios</hi> the Poet, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the Barbarous and Greaſie Wit of that Nation. And yet there are ſome Men who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and prefer <hi>Martial</hi> to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus,</hi> between whom there is as wide a difference, as betwixt the ſordid Drollery of a Buffoon and the Ingenious Raillery of a Gentleman. They have had a
<pb facs="tcp:99884:22"/>
greater eſteem for the Heat of <hi>Lucan,</hi> than the juſt Greatneſs of <hi>Virgil.</hi> But the beſt Judges rather pity theſe miſtaken Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, that diſpute with them.</p>
            <p>Now to be conſiderable in ſuch an Age as this, to be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely eſteem'd and Careſs'd by the greateſt Perſons in it, is an infallible Argument of the real Excellence of an Author. When <hi>Cicero, Catullus, Atticus, &amp;c.</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as Witneſſes, it muſt needs be a vile <hi>Ignoramus</hi> Jury that will not find the Bill. <hi>Catullus,</hi> the moſt accurate and delicate Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammatiſt that ever writ, dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his Poems to him. <hi>Cicero</hi> was his moſt intimate and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Friend; there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Intercourſe of Letters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them. <hi>Sueton</hi> in his Life
<pb facs="tcp:99884:23"/>
of <hi>Julius Ceſar</hi> takes notice of a Letter from <hi>Cicero</hi> to <hi>Nepos,</hi> and <hi>Lactantius</hi> quotes an Epiſtle of <hi>Nepos</hi> to <hi>Tully.</hi> Nay their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolary Commerce was ſo great, that <hi>Macrobius</hi> makes mention of the ſecond Book of Epiſtles from <hi>Tully</hi> to <hi>Nepos.</hi> His intimacy with <hi>Atticus</hi> is evident from the Life of <hi>Atticus,</hi> here annex'd to his Lives of Excellent Generals; for <hi>Atticus</hi> himſelf was ſo far from being one, that he never engag'd in the War either for <hi>Caeſar</hi> or <hi>Pompey,</hi> and yet had the good Fortune (which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive very few of that Humour ever met with) to be Honour'd, eſteem'd, and unmoleſted thro the whole courſe of his Life.</p>
            <p>He left many Learned and Curious Works behind him,
<pb facs="tcp:99884:23"/>
which the injury of time hath depriv'd us of; and we have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt enough left us to ſee the greatneſs of our loſs in the reſt. He was Author of a Book, which he call'd his Chronicle, wherein (in three diſtinct Volumes) he gave an account of thoſe three great Intervals of time, which Hiſtorians ſo much talk of, The Obſcure and Uncertain, the Fabulous, and the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Ages of the World. As to the firſt and ſecond, <hi>Tertullian</hi> informs us, that <hi>Nepos</hi> affirms, there never was any <hi>Saturn</hi> but what was a Man; and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonius</hi> tells his Pupil the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that he ſent him <hi>Titianus</hi>'s Fables, and <hi>Nepos</hi>'s Chronicles, which were not much unlike 'em; and <hi>Catullus</hi> in his Preface
<pb facs="tcp:99884:24"/>
to his Poems, tells us, that <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos</hi> did <hi>Omne Aevum tribus explicare chartis.</hi>

            <p>Beſides this great Work, he writ the Lives of Illuſtrious Men, of which twenty-two, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> are tranſmitted to us; and likewiſe the Lives of the <hi>Roman</hi> Hero's (as is evident from his Life of <hi>Hannibal)</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Kings. But what thro the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Forreign Nations, and the Ignorance and careleſsneſs of Superſtitious Monks, who let them ly and rot unobſerv'd in their Libraries, we have only their Titles from other Authors, which had the good fortune to ſurvive. <hi>Aemilius Probus</hi> hath by ſome Critics bin ſuppos'd to be the Author of the Lives of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
<pb facs="tcp:99884:24"/>
Generals; But 'tis a palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſtake occaſion'd by an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigram prefix'd to ſome antient Manuſcripts of this Author, wherein <hi>Probus</hi> commands his Book, if the Emperor <hi>Theodoſius</hi> enquire after the Author, to tell Him it is one <hi>Probus.</hi> But then it follows, <hi>Corpore in hoc manus eſt Genetricis Avique Meique, viz.</hi> that his own hand, his Mothers, and Grandfathers were concern'd in the work. Whence 'tis clear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond contradiction, that this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> was only a Tranſcriber. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, can <hi>Robortellus</hi> who writ a Treatiſe of the Art of Criticiſm, or any Man of common Learning and Senſe, perſwade himſelf, that this wretched Poet could be the Author of this moſt delicate and
<pb facs="tcp:99884:25"/>
Judicious peice of Hiſtory. But from the cleanneſs and terſneſs of Expreſſion may undeniably be evinc'd, that the Author of this Book liv'd in the Age of <hi>Julius</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> and beſides all this there are forty places in the Lives themſelves that prove <hi>Nepos</hi> was their Author, and liv'd in the Age aforeſaid, for which if you pleaſe conſult <hi>Lambin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Nepos</hi> hath not bin more abus'd by aſcribing his Works to other Men, than in making him the Author of ſome peices wholy Unworthy of him. Thus the Book of Illuſtrious Men, which uſually was ſaid to be <hi>Pliny's,</hi> but is really <hi>Aurelius Victor's,</hi> ſome Critics Father upon our Author, and the Tranſlation of <hi>Dares</hi> the <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi> is ſaid to be his: But the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:99884:25"/>
ſtyle it ſelf is ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince any Judicious Reader. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos,</hi> in the Judgement of ſome Men liv'd after the Nativity of our Lord, but if you conſider how Celebrated he was for his Learning in the days of <hi>Catullus, Cicero</hi> and <hi>Atticus,</hi> you will find no great reaſon to ſubſcribe to their opinion.</p>

            <p>I <hi>Do not doubt (my</hi> Atticus) <hi>but a great many will cenſure this way of Writing, not only as frivolous, but unworthy the Perſons of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Men, when they ſhall read theſe little Memoires related of them; As who was the Maſter that taught</hi> Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas <hi>Muſick; and that it was reckon'd amongſt his chief Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that He had an handſome way of Dancing, and ſung skilfully to the Flute. But this is the opinion only of thoſe who being ignorant of the</hi> Grecian <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, think nothing right but what ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quadrates with their own Manners; but if theſe would but once Learn, that things Decent and Vncomely do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with the ſame Aſpect of Honeſty
<pb facs="tcp:99884:28"/>
and Turpitude to all Perſons, but that every-thing ought to be meaſur'd by the Inſtitutions of our Anceſtors; it will ſuppreſs their admiration, that in Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating the Vertues of the</hi> Grecians <hi>we have followed their Cuſtoms; for it was not objected as a Scandal to</hi> Cimon, <hi>who was one of the Greateſt Perſonages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the</hi> Athenians, <hi>that he Married his half Siſter which his Father had by a former Lady; ſince it was a familiar uſage, that obtein'd amongſt the reſt of the Citizens, tho it breakes in upon our ways of Living, and is counted Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It was a thing highly applauded in</hi> Greece, <hi>that young Lads were Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, and had many Rivals in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural pleaſure; and at</hi> Lacedaemon <hi>there was not a Widow, tho of the Nobleſt Extraction, but would act her part in a Comedy, and take Money for it; In the ſame</hi> Greece, <hi>likewiſe it was matter of ſingular Triumph, to be proclaim'd a Conqueror in the Olympick Games; and yet to come forth upon the Stage, and be a ſpectacle of diverſion to the People,
<pb facs="tcp:99884:28"/>
was not look'd upon by that Nation as any ways opprobrious; all which things notwithſtanding kindle our Averſion, as being partly downright Infamous, and partly below the Dignity of our Characters, and very far from being ſeemly or becoming; on the contrary, a great many actions carry with us the impreſſion of Decorum, which are thought very lewd by them; As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, what</hi> Roman <hi>bluſheth to lead his Wife to an Entertainment? And what Mother of a Family will not reſide in the moſt frequented part of her houſe, and contribute her ſhare of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at a Publick Feaſt? And yet 'tis much otherwiſe practis'd in</hi> Greece, <hi>for there they never come to any jolly Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, unleſs invited by their near Relations; and are never ſeen but in the moſt inward Apartments, which they call from thence (Gynoeconitis) the Chamber of the Women; and no one's approaches were permitted thither, but of thoſe, who gain'd acceſs by the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, either of Blood or Affinity; but
<pb facs="tcp:99884:29"/>
the bulk of the Volume will not let me run through any more Examples of this kind; and Expedition calls upon me to give the laſt hand to thoſe things which I have begun; therefore we will come cloſe to the purpoſe, and in this Book draw to your view the Lives of theſe Illuſtrious Commanders.</hi>

               <head>THE LIFE OF <hi>MILTIADES.</hi>
               </head>
               <byline>Done into <hi>Engliſh</hi> by Mr. <hi>Tullie,</hi> M. A. of <hi>Queen's</hi> College, <hi>Oxon.</hi> and Sub-Dean of <hi>York.</hi>
               </byline>
               <p>WHEN <hi>Miltiades,</hi> the Son of <hi>Cimon,</hi> an <hi>Athenian,</hi> had got himſelf a great and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Name, as well for his own native modeſty, as by the ancient and renown'd Family whence he was deſcended; and was now arriv'd at thoſe years which were ſufficient to confirm his Fellow-Citizens in the high opinion they always had of him: It happen'd, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> were upon a new project of Conquering and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99884:30"/>
Colonies to the <hi>Cherſoneſe.</hi> And <note place="margin">The <hi>Thracian Cherſoneſe,</hi> or <hi>Peninſula.</hi>
                  </note> ſince the deſign was generally applauded, ſeveral being come in Volunteers to offer their ſervice in the Expedition, it was thought fit to depute ſome of them to go to <hi>Delphos,</hi> and there conſult the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> about the choice of a General. For at that time the <hi>Thracians</hi> were Maſters of thoſe Countries, who were not to be diſpoſſeſs'd but by force of Arms. When they were arriv'd at <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos,</hi> and had addreſs'd themſelves to the Oracle, the Anſwer it return'd was po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive and expreſs in the choice of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiades;</hi> whom if they would elect, <hi>they ſhould be ſucceſsful in their Undertaking. Miltiades</hi> confirm'd in his Command by ſo great an Authority, ſets Sail for the <hi>Cherſoneſe,</hi> with a ſelect Band of men; and touching upon <hi>Lemnos</hi> in his Road, would willingly have reduc'd the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of that Iſland under the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> requiring them immediately to ſurrender themſelves. But they laugh'd at the demand, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, <hi>That yes they would, when he ſhould Sail from home to</hi> Lemnos <hi>with a Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Wind;</hi> which is contrary to them who come from <hi>Athens</hi> to thoſe Coaſts. But <hi>Miltiades</hi>'s Affair would not admit of delay, and therefore without any
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99884:30"/>
farther attempt, he ſteer'd his courſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly for the <hi>Cherſoneſe,</hi> where he ſafely arriv'd. And having, in a ſhort time, defeated the Forces of thoſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and made himſelf Maſter of the <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneſe,</hi> he fortified the moſt convenient places of it with Caſtles and Citadels, and planted all the Country with his own Soldiers, whom he enrich'd with the booty of frequent Excurſions. Nor had Fortune a greater ſhare in the ſucceſs of this Expedition then his own prudence. For having routed the Enemy's Forces by the Valour of his own, he manag'd the whole concern of the Victory with the greateſt Equity imaginable; and made the <hi>Cherſoneſe</hi> the place of his Reſidence. <hi>For he acted as King amongſt them, tho he had not the Title;</hi> and yet ow'd not his Power ſo much to the Abſoluteneſs of his Command as to the Juſtice of his Actions. For notwithſtanding the greatneſs of his Fortune, he was ready to do any acts of kindneſs for his Country-men the <hi>Athenians.</hi> By which means he eſtabliſh'd his Authority not only in the Hearts and Affections of the <hi>Athenians</hi> who gave it him, but of thoſe alſo over whom he was to exerciſe it too. And having thus ſetled the Government of his late Conqueſt, he comes back to <hi>Lemnos,</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:99884:31"/>
and (by virtue of his former Compact with the Inhabitants) demands the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendry of their City into his hands: <hi>For they had promis'd to yeild themſelves up to him when he ſhould Sail from Home to</hi> Lemnos <hi>by a North Wind; which was now perform'd from his Habitation in the Cherſoneſe.</hi> The <hi>Carians</hi> who then inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the Iſland, tho they little expected ſuch a demand of the performance of a jocular promiſe, yet were forc'd to comply and quit the Iſland; not ſo much out of the ſenſe of any obligation they conceiv'd themſelves to lie under, as of the power and great ſucceſs of the Enemy whom they were to encounter. Nor was he leſs happy in reducing thoſe other Iſlands, call'd <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clades,</hi> under the <hi>Athenian</hi> Dominion. In thoſe days <hi>Darius,</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> King, reſolving upon a War with the <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> built a Bridge upon the <hi>Danube,</hi> for the paſſing over of his Army, and gave the chief Command of it, and of their reſpective Cities, to the Forces which he had rais'd in <hi>Ionia</hi> and <hi>Aeolis. For he went upon this ground, that it would be the beſt Expedient to keep the</hi> Greeks <hi>who inhabited</hi> Aſia, <hi>in ſubjection during the War, to entruſt their Friends and Country-men with the Command of his Towns, who could expect no Quarter if
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99884:31"/>
he chanc'd to be defeated.</hi> Amongſt the reſt of theſe Governors was <hi>Miltiades;</hi> who, when he had continual news brought him of the ill ſucceſs of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Arms againſt the <hi>Scythians,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the Commanders of the Bridge, <hi>Not to baulk ſo fair an opportunity of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Greece <hi>from the</hi> Perſian <hi>Yoke;</hi> alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That if</hi> Darius <hi>and his Forces were but defeated now, not only all</hi> Europe <hi>would be free from the apprehenſions of his Arms for the future, but that the poor</hi> Greeks <hi>likewiſe who inhabited</hi> Aſia <hi>would be reſcued from the ſlavery they underwent, and the dangers they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to from their</hi> Perſian <hi>Maſters; and that if the Bridge were but demoliſh'd, the Deſign muſt of neceſſity take effect, and the</hi> Perſians <hi>periſh either by the Sword or Famine in a few days.</hi> When ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Company had join'd with, and ſeconded <hi>Miltiades, Heſtiaeus Mileſius</hi> crav'd leave to diſſent from them, object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That tho it might be expedient for the generality of the People to be freed from their ſubjection to</hi> Darius, <hi>yet it could by no means be ſo to them, who bore Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand under Him: That their power and interest was imbark'd in the ſame bottom with</hi> Darius<hi>'s Empire; which if once overthrown, their Employs muſt expire
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99884:32"/>
with it, and they ſuffer by the hands of their own Fellow-Citizens. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he was ſo far from concurring with them, that for his part he thought it highly their intereſt that the</hi> Perſian <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire ſhould be upheld and eſtabliſh'd.</hi> When <hi>Miltiades</hi> underſtood by the ſenſe of the Company, that the point would be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd againſt him, and eaſily imagining, that of ſo many who were privy to the Conſult, ſome would certainly come in and inform the King of the Plot, He thought it his ſafeſt way to leave the <hi>Cherſoneſe,</hi> and return to <hi>Athens.</hi> And tho indeed the majority of the Cabal thought not fit then to concur with him in the Deſign, yet was it a generous propoſal in him, in that he rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the Liberty of his Country than his own private Intereſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Darius,</hi> after his return from <hi>Europe</hi> into <hi>Aſia,</hi> being advis'd by his Council to try if he could reduce <hi>Greece</hi> under his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, fitted out a Fleet of Fifty Sail of Ships in order to that deſign; whereof he made <hi>Datis</hi> and <hi>Artaphernes</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and gave them the Command of 200000 Foot, and 10000 Horſe; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the affront that the <hi>Athenians</hi> had put upon him in aſſiſting the <hi>Ionians</hi> in the taking of <hi>Sardis,</hi> and putting the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99884:32"/>
Garriſon to the Sword, as the ground and occaſion of the War againſt them. The <hi>Perſians</hi> landing at <hi>Eubaea,</hi> immediately made themſelves Maſters of <hi>Eretria,</hi> and ſent the Inhabitants of the Country into <hi>Aſia</hi> to <hi>Darius.</hi> From thence they march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as far as <hi>Attica,</hi> into the Fields of <hi>Marathon,</hi> which is but about ten miles from the Town. The <hi>Athenians,</hi> tho they were in a great conſternation at the near approaches of ſo powerful an Enemy, yet ſolicited they none but the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> for their Aſſiſtance; to whom they diſpatch'd <hi>Philippus</hi> (one of thoſe Couriers whom they call'd * <hi>Hemerodromi)</hi> to acquaint them what urgent occaſions they had for their ſpeedy <note place="margin">Stout young Fellows, who were diſpatch'd abroad upon State affairs, and perform'd their Errand with great expedition</note> Relief. In the mean time they choſe ten Great Officers to command the Army, whereof <hi>Miltiades</hi> was one; amongſt whom it was hotly debated, <hi>Whether it were more adviſable for them torely upon the ſtrength of the Town, or to march out and fight the Enemy. Miltiades</hi> preſs'd them with greater earneſtneſs then any of the reſt, to pitch their Tents as ſoon as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they could; <hi>for that by this means the Citizens would be excited to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more bravely, when they ſaw how highly their Valour was rely'd upon; and the Enemy's Advances would be retarded,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99884:33"/>
when they ſhould obſerve with what a ſmall handful of men they reſolv'd to fight them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> There were none who actually aſſiſted the <hi>Athenians</hi> in this juncture but the <hi>Plataeans,</hi> who ſent them a thouſand men, which made them completely ten thouſand ſtrong; a ſmall number, but fir'd with a wonderful deſire to be in Action. <hi>Miltiades,</hi> by this Counſel of his, became more conſiderable then his Collegues; for 'twas upon the great Authority his Advice had amongſt them, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> march'd their Forces out of the Town, where they encamp'd conveniently, and the next day after, at the foot of an Hill, join'd Battel with all the Courage imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and the advantage of a new ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, on their ſide: For they had block'd up the paſſages with Trees in ſeveral places, to the intent, that they might both be ſhelter'd by the tops of the Mountains, and that the Trees in the way might hinder the Enemies Horſe from breaking in upon them. <hi>Datis,</hi> tho he ſaw that the <hi>Athenians</hi> had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly the advantage of the place, yet relying upon the vaſt odds he had in the number, and conſidering alſo, that the <hi>Spartan</hi> Auxiliaries were not yet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, reſolv'd to engage them; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly led up an hundred thouſand of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99884:33"/>
his Infantry, and ten thouſand Horſe, with which he gave them Battel; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Valour of the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſo far exceeded that of their Enemies, that they defeated ten times the number of their own Forces; and ſo affrighted the <hi>Perſians,</hi> that they never offer'd to make towards their Camp again, but fled to their Veſſels. Than which Fight never certainly was any thing more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly great and glorious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For never did ſo ſmall an handful of men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer ſo numerous and powerful an Army. And here it may not be improper to remarque, what <hi>Miltiades</hi> had for the Reward of ſo great an Action; whereby we may perceive, <hi>how the ſame Humour and Genius runs thro all Bodies Politic.</hi> For as the Marks of Honour which the <hi>Romans</hi> formerly fix'd upon the braveſt Men, were very rare and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and for that reaſon more ſignally honourable; tho now indeed they are grown common and extravagant: So we find it was anciently amongſt the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> for this great <hi>Miltiades,</hi> to whom all <hi>Greece</hi> as well as <hi>Athens</hi> ow'd their ſafety, had only this Honour done him, that when the Fight at <hi>Marathon</hi> was painted in the Gallery call'd <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99884:34"/>
exhorting his Soldiers, and giving Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel to the Enemy. And yet the ſame People, after they had enlarg'd their Territories, and became once corrupted with the Bribery of their Magiſtrates, decreed no leſs then three hundred Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues to the Honour of <hi>Demetrius Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lereus.</hi> After this Engagement at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rathon,</hi> the <hi>Athenians</hi> made him Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of a Fleet of Seventy Sail of Ships, to make War upon thoſe Iſlands which had aſſiſted the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> Several whereof ſubmitted without reſiſtance, and ſome he took by aſſault. Amongſt the reſt that held out was the Iſland <hi>Parus,</hi> a rich and arrogant People, whom when he couldby no means per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade to a Surrendry, he landed his men, made his Works about the City, and depriv'd them of all ſupplies; and had by the help of Sconces gradually made his approches ſo near to the Walls, that he was juſt upon the point of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Town, when there happen'd, I know not how, a Grove of Trees to be fired a far off in the Continent in the night time; which as ſoon as it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by the Burgers and the Beſiegers, they both imagin'd that it was ſome Sign which was given by the Scouts to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Fleet: whereupon the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd

became leſs inclin'd to a Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry; and <hi>Miltiades</hi> fearing a ſudden onſet from the Royal Navy, ſet fire to his Works, and return'd to <hi>Athens</hi> only with the full number of Ships they had at firſt given him the Command of.

                  </gap> ſo enrag'd the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that they impeach'd him of Treaſon againſt the State, <hi>That when he might have took</hi> Parus, <hi>he was Brib'd from proſecuting the Deſign by the King of Perſia.</hi> He was at this time laid up of the Wounds which he had receiv'd in the Siege, and therefore becauſe he was not in a capacity of anſwering for himſelf, his Brother <hi>Tiſagoras</hi> appear'd for him. When the whole Evidence was giv'n in againſt him, the Crime was not found Capital, but he was fin'd however fifty Talents; which was as much as was expended in Equipping the whole Fleet. And being non-ſolvent, was caſt into Priſon, where he died. But tho the buſineſs of <hi>Parus</hi> was the pretext, yet was it not the real cauſe of his proſecution: for the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> who ſtill retain'd the Tyranny of <hi>Piſaſtratus</hi> (which had raged but a few years before) freſh in their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, were extreme apprehenſive of the growing power of any Fellow-Citizen. And they imagin'd, that <hi>Miltiades,</hi> who
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99884:35"/>
had born ſo great Offices and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, would not afterwards be eaſily content to move in a narrower and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Sphere; and that ſince he had been us'd to Rule, the force of meer Cuſtom w<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uld incline him to aſpire after it ſtill. For all the while he dwelt in the <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneſe</hi> he had the Government wholly in his own hands, and was ſtiled a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but Govern'd according to Law: for he ow'd not his power to the hands of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, but to the good Will of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which he maintain'd by his own gentleneſs and moderation. Now they who had the ſupreme Government in any Commonwealth during Life, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly enjoy'd the liberty of Electing, were call'd Tyrants. But <hi>Miltiades</hi> was a perſon of great Humanity, and ſo exceedingly affable and obliging, that the meaneſt of his Subjects had free and eaſie Acceſs to him. A mighty deference was paid him every where. His Name grew great and venerable; and he had the character of an incomparable Soldier. And upon theſe motives the People thought it more ſecure to take him out of the way (tho he deſerv'd it not) then to live under the continual apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of danger from ſo great a Man.</p>

He was often made an Arbitrator to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile private Differences, and was very frequent at the publick Aſſemblies. There was no buſineſs of more then ordinary concern but it paſs'd thro his hands; for he quickly apprehended what was moſt neceſſary to be done, and expreſs'd the ſame in an eaſie and familiar ſtile. Neither was he leſs ready in the managing of any affair then in the contriving of it; becauſe (as <hi>Thucydides</hi> ſays) he had a true judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of things preſent, and would give a ſhrew'd gueſs at what was to come. So that upon the account of theſe his extraordinary parts he in a ſhort time became of great repute among the <hi>Athenians.</hi>

The firſt Honour which was conferr'd upon him, was the Government of the Commonwealth in the <hi>Corcyraean</hi> War; for the carrying on of which he being choſen General, made the <hi>Athenians,</hi> not only in that, but alſo in all after-Expeditions, more warlike then they had formerly been. For whereas the public Money, which their Silver-Mines brought them in, was every year laviſhly ſpent by the prodigality of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, he prevail'd ſo far with the people, as to perſwade them with that Money to build a Fleet of an hundred Ships. Which being in a ſhort time effected, he firſt ſubdued his Enemies the <hi>Corcyraeans,</hi> and then ſcowr'd the Sea of all the Pyrats, with which it was much infeſted. By this Action he mightily enrich'd the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and made them moſt expert Sea-Soldiers. And how much this conduc'd to the ſafety of all <hi>Greece,</hi> may be eaſily gather'd from the <hi>Perſian</hi> War: For when <hi>Xerxes</hi> invaded all <hi>Europe</hi> both by Sea and Land, with ſuch puiſſant Armies as no Prince, either before or ſince his time, has as yet had; with a Fleet of twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men of War, attended by two thouſand Victualling Ships; and Land-Forces, to the number of ſeven hundred
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99884:37"/>
thouſand Foot, and four hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe. The news of whoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach being brought to <hi>Greece,</hi> with a report that his deſigns were chiefly againſt the <hi>Athenians,</hi> to revenge his defeat at <hi>Marathon,</hi> they immediately ſent to <hi>Delphos</hi> to conſult the Oracle, what would be beſt for them then to do as to their preſent affairs. <hi>Pythia</hi> adviſes them to fortifie themſelves with a <hi>Wooden Wall.</hi> The meaning of which Anſwer, when no body underſtood, <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> thus expounded it, telling them, That it was the advice of <hi>Apollo,</hi> that they ſhould take their Families and their Goods with them into their Ships, for thoſe the Oracle meant by the <hi>Wooden Wall.</hi> Which Counſel they approv'd of, and they built as many Galleys as they had Ships before, and ſo carried all their Moveables, ſome to <hi>Salamis</hi> and ſome to <hi>Troezene.</hi> Their Tower and their Images they deliver'd up to the care of their Prieſts and a few old men, and ſo they left the Town.</p>
               <p>This Counſel was very ungrateful to moſt of the Cities, becauſe they had much rather have been engag'd in a Land War. Therefore a ſelect Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany are ſent under the Command of <hi>Leonidas</hi> King of the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99884:37"/>
poſſeſs themſelves of <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> and to ſtop the farther progreſs of the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi> But they were over-power'd by the Forces of ſo great an Enemy, and were all cut off in that very place. The firſt Engagement of the two Fleets (that of the <hi>Greoians</hi> conſiſting of three hundred Sail, whereof two belong'd to the <hi>Athenians)</hi> was at <hi>Artemiſium,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Eubaea</hi> and the Continent. The reaſon why <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> made choice of thoſe Streights was, leſt ſo great a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude might have ſurrounded him. Here, tho both Navies retreated upon equal terms, yet the <hi>Athenians</hi> durſt not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their ſtation; becauſe they fear'd, that if part of the Enemy's Fleet ſhould get beyond <hi>Eubaea,</hi> they would engage them on both ſides. Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they were forc'd to leave <hi>Artemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium,</hi> and ſail to <hi>Salamis,</hi> which is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againſt <hi>Athens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Xerxes</hi> having gain'd <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> immediately marched to <hi>Athens,</hi> where meeting with no oppoſition, he kill'd the Prieſts which he found in the Tower, and fir'd the City. At the news of which the Sea-men were much terrified; and when they durſt not ſtand to their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and 'twas the advice of moſt of them, that every one ſhould go home
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99884:38"/>
to their own Houſes, and defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as well as they could within their Walls, <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> alone ſtood undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, telling them, <hi>That ſo long as they held together in one Body they might equal the Enemy;</hi> but proteſting, <hi>if once diſpers'd they muſt neceſſarily pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi> And that that would be their fate he affirm'd to <hi>Eurybiades,</hi> a King of the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> who then was Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral. Whom when he found not to be concern'd ſo much as he could have wiſh'd, he ſent one of his Servants (in whom he could moſt confide) to <hi>Xerxes</hi> by night, to tell him, <hi>That his Enemies were upon their flight; and that if they ſhould now eſcape, he muſt expect a long and difficult War; for then he would be forc'd to purſue them ſingly; but if he would now Engage them, he might in a ſhort time deſtroy them all.</hi> This ſtratagem ſo far prevail'd, that his own Soldiers were compell'd to fight, tho againſt their wills. Whereupon, <hi>Xerxes</hi> not in the leaſt ſuſpecting the trick which was put upon him, fell upon them the next day in ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a Sea that his whole Fleet could not engage; a place very diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to himſelf, but on the contrary mighty advantageous to his Enemy: So
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99884:38"/>
that he was Conquer'd rather by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of <hi>Themiſtooles</hi> then by the Arms of <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Altho <hi>Xerxes</hi> manag'd this Action ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ill, yet after all he had ſo great Reſerves, that even with them he might have beaten the <hi>Athenians;</hi> but for the preſent he was forc'd to retreat. For <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> fearing leaſt he ſhould go on with the War, ſent him word, that the breaking down of the Bridge which he had built over the <hi>Helleſpont</hi> was then in agitation, to exclude his paſſage into <hi>Aſia;</hi> and made him believe it. For that Journey which coſt him ſix months travel when he came for <hi>Greece,</hi> he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the very ſame way in leſs then thirty days at his return; looking upon himſelf not as conquer'd by <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> but preſerv'd. Thus by the Policy of one man, <hi>Greece</hi> was reſtor'd to its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and <hi>Aſia</hi> made ſubject to <hi>Europe.</hi> This other Victory was not at all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to that at <hi>Marathon:</hi> For here alſo at <hi>Salamis,</hi> after the ſame manner a few Ships defeated the greateſt Fleet that has been in the memory of man.</p>
               <p>Great was <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> in this War, and as great in Peace. For when the <hi>Athenians</hi> had only the <hi>Phaleric,</hi> a ſmall and inconvenient Port, by his advice
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99884:39"/>
they built a triple Haven at <hi>Pyraea,</hi> and encompaſs'd it with ſuch Walls that it equall'd the City in glory, and excell'd it in uſefulneſs. He alſo rebuilt the <hi>Athenian</hi> Walls at his own hazard. For the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> having got a plauſible reaſon, <hi>viz. the Incurſions of the Barbarians,</hi> deny'd that any City ought to be built but at <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> leſt there ſhould be any Fortifications which might harbour their Enemies; and therefore they endeavour'd to put a ſtop to their Buildings. But their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns were quite contrary to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences: For thoſe two Victories, that at <hi>Marathon</hi> and the other at <hi>Salamis,</hi> made the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſo conſiderable all the World over, that the <hi>Lacedaemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were afraid they would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with them for the Soveraignty; wherefore they uſed all means to keep them as low as poſſibly they could. For after they heard that the Walls were begun, they ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Athens</hi> to forbid their proceedings. Whilſt they were there they deſiſted, and told them that they would ſend Ambaſſadors to treat with them about that affair. This Embaſſy <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> undertook, and went firſt himſelf, ordering the reſt of the Ambaſſadors not to follow till they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99884:39"/>
thought the Walls were high enough. In the mean time all the City, of what condition ſoever, whether Bond or Free, aſſiſted in the work; neither did they ſpare any place, whether ſacred or prophane, public or private; but took from all parts what materials would moſt conduce to the Fortifications. So that their Walls were built with the Ruins of their Temples and Monuments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> when he came to <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemon,</hi> did not immediately deſire Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Magiſtrates, but ſpun out the time as long as he could, making this his excuſe, that he expected his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues. But whilſt the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> complain that the Works nevertheleſs went on, and that <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to deceive them, in the interim the reſt of the Ambaſſadors arrive; by whom when he was given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the Fortifications were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt finiſh'd, he addreſs'd himſelf to the <hi>Ephori,</hi> the chief Magiſtrates among the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> and told them, <hi>That what they heard concerning their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications was falſe, wherefore he thought it but reaſonable that they ſhould ſend ſome perſons of Truſt and Quality, to whom credit might be given, to enquire into that affair; and in the mean time
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99884:40"/>
they might keep him as their Pledge.</hi> They granted his requeſt, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly three Ambaſſadors are ſent, Men of great Honour and Repute; on whom <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> order'd his Collegues to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; forewarning them, not to ſuffer the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Ambaſſadors to return till he himſelf was ſent back. When he thought they were arriv'd at <hi>Athens,</hi> he waited upon the Senate and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, and told them very frankly, <hi>That by his Advice the</hi> Athenians <hi>had Wall'd in their Publick, their Tutelar, and Houſhold Gods, that they might with the more eaſe defend them from their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (which thing was juſtifiable by the Common Law of Nations); neither did they do this with a deſign to incommode</hi> Greece, <hi>for their City was as 'twere a Bulwark againſt the</hi> Barbarians, <hi>having twice routed the</hi> Perſian <hi>Armada.</hi> He told them, <hi>That they did not act like juſt and honeſt men, who rather regarded what conduc'd moſt to their own Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then what might be profitable to all</hi> Greece; <hi>wherefore if they thought ever to have thoſe Ambaſſadors return whom they had ſent to</hi> Athens, <hi>they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe him, otherwiſe they muſt never expect to receive them again into their own Country.</hi>

                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:99884:40"/>
Yet after all this he could not evade the envy of his Fellow-Citizens. For even the ſame jealouſie which condemn'd <note place="margin">The <hi>Oſtraciſm?</hi>

                  <hi>Miltiades</hi> baniſh'd <hi>Themiſtocles.</hi> After which he went to <hi>Argos;</hi> where living in much ſplendor, upon the account of his great Endowments, the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Athens,</hi> with this Accuſation againſt him, <hi>That he had made a League with the King of Perſia to deſtroy Greece.</hi> For which Crime, tho abſent, he was condemn'd of <hi>Treaſon.</hi> Which thing ſo ſoon as he heard of, not thinking himſelf ſafe at <hi>Argos,</hi> he went to <hi>Corcyra;</hi> where un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that the Governors of the City were very fearful leſt the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> ſhould declare War againſt them upon his account, he fled to <hi>Admetus</hi> the King of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians,</hi> who had formerly entertain'd him. But at his firſt arrival, not finding the King, that he might be receiv'd by him with the greater fidelity, he took his little Daughter and carried her with him into the Sanctuary, a Cuſtom which is very religiouſly obſerv'd among the <hi>Moloſſians;</hi> and from thence he would not ſtir, till the King had given him his Hand, and receiv'd him into his Patronage; which he afterwards faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99884:41"/>
perform'd. For when he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> he would not deliver him up, but advis'd him to conſult his own ſafety; for 'twas not likely that he ſhould be ſecure in a place ſo nigh his Enemies. Therefore he commanded him to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Pydna,</hi> and ſent a ſufficient Guard with him. Whereupon he went a Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board <hi>incognito,</hi> but a great Storm, which then happen'd, drove the Veſſel upon the Iſland <hi>Naxus,</hi> where at that time the <hi>Athenian</hi> Army lay. <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> thought that if they ſhould put in there, he muſt neceſſarily periſh; ſo that by this ill fortune he was forc'd to diſcover himſelf to the Maſter of the Ship, promiſing great Rewards if he would preſerve him. The Maſter commiſerating the condition of ſo great a man, kept his Ship at Anchor for a day and a night, at a good diſtance from the Iſland, and would not ſuffer any man to go out of it. From whence he ſail'd to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and there he landed <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> who afterwards ſufficiently rewarded him for his great ſervice.</p>
               <p>I know that many Authors have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> went into <hi>Aſia</hi> whilſt <hi>Xerxes</hi> was King, but I think
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99884:41"/>
                  <hi>Thucydides</hi> is rather to be credited, who living about that Age, wrote an Hiſtory of thoſe times, and was alſo of the ſame City; and he ſays, that he came to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes,</hi> and wrote him a Letter after this manner: <hi>I</hi> Themiſtocles <hi>am come unto you; I, who brought ſo many Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by the</hi> Grecians <hi>upon your Family, when I was forc'd to make War with your Father to defend my own Country. But I did him greater Services afterwards, when I was ſafe and he in danger; for when he would not go back into</hi> Aſia, <hi>after the Battel at</hi> Salamis, <hi>I ſent him word, that it was then in agitation, that the Bridge which he had made over the</hi> Helleſpont <hi>ſhould be broken down, and that he ſhould be ſurrounded by his Enemies; by which meſſage he eſcap'd the danger. But now here I my ſelf am come, baniſh'd from all</hi> Greece, <hi>humbly to entreat your Alliance, which if I may but obtain, you ſhall find me as great a Friend to you, as I have been a dangerous Enemy to your Father. But I would deſire a Year's time to conſider of thoſe Affairs, concerning which I intend to treat with you, and when that is expir'd, to permit me to come unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King admiring the greatneſs of his Spirit, and being deſirous to make

ſuch a man his Friend, granted his Requeſt.

ſuch, that (for ought we yet know) He was the only Perſon whom the World has hitherto thought fit to Entitle <hi>The Juſt;</hi> yet He was ſo run down by <hi>Themistocles,</hi> as to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, by the <hi>Oſtraciſm,</hi> to Ten years Baniſhment.

and his Goodneſs, are not eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; particularly, 'twas by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, that, when He and <hi>Pauſanias</hi> (who was Commander at the Overthrow of <hi>Mardonius)</hi> were in the ſame <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Fleet, the Dominion of the Seas was transferr'd from the <hi>Lacedaemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to the <hi>Athenians;</hi> the former, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, having been <hi>Lords</hi> both by Sea and Land.

               <p>After this, <hi>Pauſanias</hi> was again intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Common Fleet of the Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates for <hi>Cyprus</hi> and the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> to diſmantle the Garriſons of the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> in thoſe parts. In which Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture meeting with the like ſucceſs, he began again to behave himſelf more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolently, and aim'd at greater things then ever. For in the Sack of <hi>Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium</hi> taking many of the <hi>Perſian</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and among them ſome of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99884:46"/>
Blood Royal, he remitted them privately to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and ſent with them <hi>Gongylus</hi> an <hi>Eraetrian,</hi> with Letters to the King (as <hi>Thucydides</hi> delivers) in theſe words; Pauſanias <hi>the</hi> Spartan <hi>General, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſome taken at</hi> Byzantium <hi>were nearly related to you, has made you a Preſent of them, and withall deſires to Contract an Alliance with you. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if you approve of the Propoſals, he ſues for your Daughter in Marriage, on Condition that by his means both</hi> Sparta <hi>and the reſt of</hi> Greece <hi>be put into your Hands. If you think theſe things worth your Conſideration, ſend an approv'd Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, to whom things may be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated more particularly.</hi> The King ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well ſatisfied at the ſafety of ſo many Perſonages ſo near to himſelf, immediately diſpatch'd away <hi>Artabazus</hi> to <hi>Pauſanias</hi> with this Anſwer, <hi>That he applauded the Deſign, and deſir'd nothing ſhould be omitted which might be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it; promiſing, in caſe it took effect, he ſhoul'd never meet a Repulſe in any thing he would ſue for. Pauſanias</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inform'd of the King's pleaſure, grew ſo forward in the Buſineſs, that he incurr'd the Suſpition of the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> who remanded him home; where he was queſtion'd for his Life, but the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99884:46"/>
Allegations charg'd upon him amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to no more then <hi>High Miſdemeanours,</hi> he was only Fin'd, and diſcharg'd from returning to the Navy.</p>
               <p>Yet, not long after, of his own head he went back to the Army, where he follow'd ſuch indiſcreet and raſh Practices as confirm'd what hitherto had only been ſuſpected of him. He laid aſide not only the ſeverer Moralities of his own Country, but their Faſhions and Dreſs. He appeared in Pomp and Splendour like a Foreign King; and came into publick in the <hi>Median</hi> Habit. His Perſon was guarded by a Retinue of <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Egyptians;</hi> his Entertainments were after the <hi>Perſian</hi> manner, with greater Luxury then his Friends thought allowable; he was hard of Acceſs; he anſwer'd proudly, and commanded cruelly. In fine, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to return to <hi>Sparta,</hi> but withdrew to <hi>Getonae,</hi> a place in the Country of <hi>Troas,</hi> where he engag'd in Meaſures deſtructive to his Country and Himſelf. The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> being certified of this, ſent Deputies to him with the <note n="*" place="margin">A ſort of Tally, by which the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was inform'd of their Will.

                  <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tala,</hi> in which after their manner it was ſpecified, That unleſs he immediately return'd home they would paſs a <hi>Bill of Attainder</hi> againſt him. Upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of this news he went home, hoping
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99884:47"/>
to diſperſe the Clouds which hung over him, by the power of his Money and Intereſt there. But the <hi>Ephori</hi> ſecur'd him immediately, in the Name and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Community. For by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of that Government this Power over the Prince is repos'd in the hands of any one of the <hi>Ephori.</hi> However, in ſome time he got rid of that Grievance, but could not ſo eaſily remove the Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition he lay under; for it was ſtill miſtruſted he dealt underhand with the King. There are a ſort of People among the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> they call <hi>Helotes,</hi> who are imploy'd in manuring the Lands, and performing all other offices of Slaves; Theſe alſo it was thought he had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to debauch to his Deſigns with hopes of <hi>Liberty.</hi> But the Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him being meerly Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, they deferr'd proceeding againſt a Perſon of his Name and Quality upon Surmiſes and Preſumptions, till time ſhould make a fuller Diſcovery.</p>
               <p>While theſe things were in agitation, <hi>Argilius</hi> (a young man whom <hi>Pauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> had formerly defil'd to ſatisfie his unnatural Love) being ſent by him with a Pacquet to <hi>Artabazus,</hi> a ſuſpition ran in his head, that there was ſomewhat in it nearly concern'd himſelf; becauſe he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99884:47"/>
had obſerv'd, that none who went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the like Errand had ever return'd back. Upon this, breaking up the Seals, he found that on the delivery of the Letters he was to have been made away; beſides many things relating to the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions then on foot between the King and <hi>Pauſanias;</hi> all which, with the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters themſelves, he immediately commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the <hi>Ephori.</hi> But here the warineſs and moderation of the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> is not to be paſs'd by, who ſuffer'd not themſelves to be wrought upon, even by ſuch proof, to take <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanias</hi> into Cuſtody; but forbore to uſe any rigor towards him, till ſuch time as his own Verbal Evidence ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd againſt himſelf; and accordingly they gave Inſtructions to the Diſcoverer how to manage this affair. Now there was a Temple of <hi>Neptune</hi> at <hi>Taenaris,</hi> which the <hi>Greeks</hi> held inviolable; hither the Diſcoverer was to fly for Sanctuary, and kneel down before the Altar; near this they had contriv'd a place under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground, from whence any one might hear what was diſcours'd to <hi>Argilius;</hi> where ſeveral of the <hi>Ephori</hi> had privately poſted themſelves. <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> as ſoon as he heard that <hi>Argilius</hi> was fled to the Temple, haſtning after him in great
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99884:48"/>
diſturbance, found him on his Knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Altar; and enquiring into the occaſion of that ſudden motion, he open'd to him the Contents of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. At this <hi>Pauſanias</hi>'s diſturbance increas'd ſo far, that he entreated him not to diſcover or betray one who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly deſerv'd ſo well of him; promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for the future, if he would grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him ſo far, and be aſſiſting to him under the preſent Diſtreſs, he ſhould find it of very great Advantage to him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ephori,</hi> after this Diſcovery, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding it ſafer to apprehend him in the City, return'd thither. And <hi>Pauſanias</hi> having, as he thought, made up the buſineſs with <hi>Argilius,</hi> was arriv'd on the place where it was order'd he ſhould be ſiez'd; when he perceiv'd a Deſign out againſt him, from the looks of one of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> who had a deſire to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe him of it.

               <p>
                  <hi>CIMON,</hi> the Son of <hi>Miltiades,</hi> an <hi>Athenian,</hi> was very unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in his Youth; for his Father not being able to pay his Fine to the People, and dying a Priſoner of the State, <hi>Cimon</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the ſame Confinement; Nor by the Laws of <hi>Athens</hi> could he be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas'd till he had paid the Mulct impos'd on his Father. But he had Eſpous'd his own Siſter <hi>Eſpinice,</hi> not ſo much to gratifie his Affection as to follow the Mode of his Country; for 'twas com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99884:49"/>
with the <hi>Athenians</hi> to marry their own Siſters. One <hi>Callias</hi> (a man of a fair Eſtate, but of mean Extraction and Parentage; for out of the Silver-Mines he rais'd his Fortune and Wealth) being his Rival, made this propoſal to <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> that if he would yeild to a Divorce and Reſignation of her to him, he then would pay his Debts. But when <hi>Cimon</hi> generouſly ſcorn'd to part with his Wife and Siſter on ſuch baſe and mercenary Conditions, She (out of Affection and Charity to him) declar'd, That ſhe could not ſuffer the Son of the Great <hi>Miltiades</hi> to be perpetually Damn'd to a Priſon, when it lay in her power to procure his Enlargement. Therefore ſhe reſolved to marry <hi>Callias,</hi> provided he perform'd his part of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cimon</hi> having thus obtain'd his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſoon became a Chief Miniſter of State. For he was a great Maſter of Rhetoric, a very Generous Perſon, an admirable Civilian, and an expert Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; for his Father gave him his Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Education in a Campaign. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he kept the Citizens in awe and ſubjection; and in the Army he was almoſt Abſolute. When he was firſt a Commander, at the River <hi>Strymon,</hi> he routed a vaſt Body of the <hi>Thraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:99884:50"/>
He built the Town of <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> and planted there a Colony of ten thouſand Natives of <hi>Athens.</hi> At <hi>Mycale</hi> he alſo Triumph'd over the Captive <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Phoenician</hi> Navy, conſiſting of two hundred Sail. Neither were his Enterprizes by Land that day leſs ſignal then his Victory by Sea; for having made himſelf Maſter of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary's Fleet, he Landed his Soldiers, and at one onſet gave a total Overthrow to the <hi>Barbarian</hi> Army. Having enrich'd himſelf with the Booty of this Conqueſt, he return'd homewards. For now ſome Iſlands had Rebell'd, under the pretence of Tyranny and Arbitrary Government. Thoſe whom he found Loyal, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in their Principles; thoſe who had traiterouſly Revolted, he compell'd to their Duty and Allegiance. He Baniſh'd the <hi>Delopes</hi> from the City and Iſland of <hi>Scyrus</hi> (the preſent Inhabitants thereof) becauſe their Behaviour was ſtubborn and obſtinate; and divided their Eſtates among the new adopted Deniſons. At his arrival, he defeated the <hi>Thaſii,</hi> who truſted in the Fortreſs and Sanctuary of their Riches. With the Spoils and Ornaments taken in theſe Wars the South-ſide of the Caſtle at <hi>Athens</hi> was beautified.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:99884:50"/>
When this his proſperous Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Aſſairs ſhould have Entirl'd him to the greateſt Name and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the City, he had the Fate to be Envied, as his Father was, and other <hi>Athenian</hi> Worthies; for by the majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Votes inſcrib'd in Shells (which they call'd <hi>Oſtraciſm)</hi> he was condemn'd to a Ten Year's Exile. For which unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural uſage the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſooner expreſs'd repentance then <hi>Cimon</hi> his ſorrow. For when with a generous and undaunted For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude he bore the Envy of the ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Citizens; and the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> had proclaim'd War againſt the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> They immediately perceiv'd the want of ſo much Experienc'd Valour and Conduct. Therefore after five Years Baniſhment he was Reſtored. He (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had been courteouſly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd <note place="margin">The <hi>Nemeguen</hi> Edition of <hi>Corn. Nepos,</hi> is in this place follow'd, all the other Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, having o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a material ſentence.</note> by the <hi>Lacedemonians)</hi> eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it the Intereſt of both Cities, that the Difference ſhould be Compos'd, without the Deciſion of the Sword; voluntarily went Ambaſſador to <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemon,</hi> and by his ſucceſsful Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reinſtated the two great Rival Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Peace and Amity. Not long after he was Commiſſion'd to go into <hi>Cyprus</hi> with 200 Ships; and when he had ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the greater part of the Iſland, he fell
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99884:51"/>
mortally Sick, and Died in the Town <hi>Citium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For many years afterwards the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> (both in times of War and Peace) found the want of their Patriot. For he was ſo free and generous a Gentleman, that tho he had ſeveral Farms and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens in his poſſeſſion, yet he never ſubſtituted Bailiffs with a deſign that they ſhould preſerve the Fruits for him, leſt any man, that deſir'd them, might be deprived of his Satisfaction and Enjoyment. His Footmen were always furniſh'd with ready Money, that he might be provided on all occaſions to relieve the Neceſſities of the Indigent, leſt the Delay of his Charity might be miſconſtrued a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial. If he ſaw any man that had the misfortune to be in a beggerly Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, he frequently beſtow'd on him his own Coat. He kept ſo conſtant a Table, and ſuch plenty of Proviſion, that he daily invited all thoſe to Dinner (who were not preengag'd) that he met in the public places of Aſſembly. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver refus'd to be any one's Surety; nor deny'd them his Aſſiſtance, or the uſe of his Goods. Several grew Rich on his Bounty and Benevolence. Many poor Wretches, who left not enough behind

them to pay for their Burial, he Interr'd at his own charges. Therefore 'tis no wonder, if by this his Carriage and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, his Life was free from Danger and Detraction, and his Death untimely and lamented.</p>

                  <hi>LYSANDER</hi> of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> has left a great Name behind him; which he rather acquir'd by the Kindneſs of Fortune then by any Valiant Enterprize. It is clear indeed, that he gave the <hi>Athenians</hi> a ſignal Defeat, in the twenty-ſixth year of their War with the <hi>Peloponeſian</hi> State; <note n="*" place="margin">The vulgar Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions read, <hi>idque ratione conſecutus ſit, latet,</hi> but others are of opinion, that the original Copy had, <hi>nonlatet,</hi> which laſt we follow, as moſt agreeable to the Authors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</note> 
                  <hi>but then we are not ignorant how He gain'd that Victory;</hi> for it was never procur'd by the proweſs of his own-Army, but by the unruly behaviour of his Enemies; who, thro their diſobedience to their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99884:52"/>
Commanders Orders, and by leaving their Ships unmann'd, and being diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly ſcatter'd up and down the Fields, came at length into the power of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi>'s Forces. Thus the <hi>Athenians</hi> yeilded themſelves Vaſſals to the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi> Yoke. <hi>Lyſander,</hi> tho always Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious before, and a ſtout Stickler in Factions, yet being pufft up with this late Succeſs, he now took ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; that by his means the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doemonians</hi> were render'd extremely odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to <hi>Greece.</hi> For, whereas they had given it out, that the only motive of their War, was to take down the too powerful Dominion of <hi>Athens; Lyſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> after having made himſelf Maſter of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Fleet, which rode on the River <hi>Egos,</hi> made it his whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to keep every City under his own Juriſdiction; all the while pretending he did it purely by the incitement of the <hi>Lacedaemonians.</hi> For they who had favour'd the <hi>Athenian</hi> proceedings being turn'd out of Office every where, he ſelected Ten out of every City, who were to be entruſted with the Soveraign ſway and power of all things; none being received into the number of theſe, but who would either enter himſelf a Member of his Family, or elſe would
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99884:53"/>
take this Teſt, <hi>That he would be wholly</hi> Lyſander<hi>'s Creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Decemvirate being eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd in every City, all things were carried on as he pleas'd. For an example of whoſe Cruelty and Treachery, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to produce a ſingle inſtance, that we may not tire the Reader's patience, by reckoning up more of his baſe Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. When he return'd Conqueror out of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and had viſited <hi>Thaſus</hi> by the way, he greatly deſir'd to demoliſh that City, only for its ſurpaſſing fidelity to the <hi>Athenians;</hi> as if the <hi>Thaſians</hi> would now prove their firmeſt Friends and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, who heretofore had been their never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing Enemies. But he foreſaw, if he had diſcover'd his intention herein, that the Revolt of the <hi>Thaſians</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily have enſu'd, and that they would have ſtood upon their own guard, in defence of their Lives and Fortunes.</p>
               <p>Therefore that Decemviral Power, <note n="*" place="margin">Sibi ab illo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutam ſuſtulerunt.</note> 
                  <hi>which he himſelf had erected only for his own ends,</hi> the contrary party pull'd down; whereat being grievouſly vex'd and enrag'd, he contriv'd and plotted how to depoſe the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Kings. But he found he could never compaſs this deſign without the Aſſiſtance of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99884:53"/>
Gods; for the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accuſtom'd themſelves, to bring every thing to their Oracles determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His firſt Attempt was to ſeduce that of <hi>Delphi;</hi> but failing there, he ventur'd next upon the Oracle of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dona;</hi> and meeting with a repulſe here, then he nois'd it abroad, that he was under an Obligation of paying ſome Vows to <hi>Jupiter Ammon;</hi> thinking to tamper with the <hi>Africans</hi> at an eaſier rate. After his arrival into <hi>Africa,</hi> being buoyed up with theſe alluring hopes, he found his Expectations mightily fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Prieſts. For to wheedle 'em into the acceptance of a Bribe, was not only a thing unfeaſible, but it alſo made 'em diſpatch away their Deputies to <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> to accuſe <hi>Lyſander</hi> of Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Being impeach'd of this Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour, he was acquitted by his Judges; and afterward being ſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Orchomenians,</hi> he was ſlain at <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liartus,</hi> by the hands of the <hi>Thebans.</hi> How true a Judgment had been paſt upon him, that Speech diſcovers to us, which was found in his Houſe after his death; in which he endeavours to perſwade the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> that after they had null'd the Power of their Kings, they would ſingle him out for their General to carry
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99884:54"/>
on the War. Now this was penn'd with ſo much Art, that its whole frame and compoſure ſeem'd to ſute and humor the Oracular way of expreſsion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery; the procurement of which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver queſtion'd, relying upon the ſtrength of his Purſe. <hi>Cleon</hi> of <hi>Hallicarnaſſus</hi> is the reputed Author of this Copy.</p>
               <p>And here we muſt not paſs by the cunning contrivance of <hi>Pharnabazus,</hi> a <hi>Perſian</hi> Lieutenant, of a Royal Extraction. For when <hi>Lyſander,</hi> Admiral of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, had been guilty of many cruel and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous miſcarrages in the War, and was ſuſpitious, that his Fellow-Citizens had notice of 'em already; he made his requeſt to <hi>Pharnabazus,</hi> that he would bear him witneſs before the <hi>Ephori,</hi> with what Sincerity he had manag'd the War, and treated the Allies; and becauſe his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Patronage would be very ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him herein, he farther requeſted an accurate deſcription of his Integrity in writing. <hi>Pharnabazus,</hi> after his large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, fill'd a great Book with many high expreſſions in his Commendation; which after <hi>Lyſander</hi> had perus'd and approv'd, in the very nick of its Sealing, <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabazus</hi> ſlily puts down another ready Seal'd in its place, of a ſize ſo uniform and ſo equal to the other, that no eye
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99884:54"/>
could perceive the difference; in which was drawn up a very full Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s Avarice and Perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs. After his return home, and after his Harangue before the Chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, as much as he thought fit, upon his own Exploits; at laſt he produc'd <hi>Pharnabazus</hi>'s Book and Gift, as an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Evidence of his unblemiſh'd Carriage and Deportment. <hi>Lyſander</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing order'd to withdraw, the <hi>Ephori</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd the interval of his abſence in the peruſal of this Manuſcript, and after full cognizance of its deſign and purport, they redelivered it him to read. So this inconſiderate man at the ſame time read his own Indictment and prov'd it.</p>

                  <hi>ALCIBIADES</hi> was the Son of <hi>Clinias,</hi> an <hi>Athenian.</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeems, in the production of this Man, to have exerted the utmoſt Abilities of her Skill and Power; all Authors, who have written concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, agreeing in this, That ſuch a mixture of the moſt eminent Virtues and Vices was never found in any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as in <hi>Alcibiades.</hi> The Greatneſs and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99884:55"/>
Splendour both of his City and Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, Ennobl'd his Birth: And as for the Gifts of Nature and Perſonal Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, he not only excell'd all his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries in Beauty and Comlineſs of Body, but had likewiſe a Mind ſo richly and variouſly endow'd, that he apply'd himſelf to all matters (whether of Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Pleaſure) with unparallel'd dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity. Accordingly we find, that he acquitted himſelf as an excellent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander both by Sea and Land; and was likewiſe ſo thorowly accompliſh'd in the whole Art of Oratory, that he gain'd the precedence of all others, as well for a powerful Eloquence as a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Elocution. Altho he was exceeding wealthy, yet could he, when the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of affairs requir'd, endure the ſevereſt toil and hardſhip; no man living at other times with greater ſtate and affluence, either in what related to his Table, or in his uſual Attendance and Equipage. He was moreover extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courteous and affable in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; and obſerv'd to be Maſter of an exquiſite Art of Diſſimulation and Compliance with all Perſons and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Laſtly, as often as he had a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe from public Buſineſs, and ſome reſpite allow'd from labour and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99884:56"/>
of Mind, he gave himſelf entirely over to Luſt and Luxury, being Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and Intemperate to ſuch a degree, that thoſe who reflected upon the other Scenes of his Life, were ſtruck with Admiration at the wonderful diſſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and inconſiſtencies of Nature in the ſame Perſon; no man being found to differ more from <hi>Alcibiades</hi> then <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>He had his Education in the Houſe of <hi>Pericles,</hi> his Stepfather (for ſo he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to have been); but for his Learning he was oblig'd to the Care and Inſtructions of <hi>Socrates.</hi> So that marrying moreover the Daughter of <hi>Hipponicus</hi> (the <note n="*" place="margin">Divers Copies have it <hi>Omnium Grace Linguae Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentiâ diſertiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimum:</hi> but this ſeems not very conſiſtent with the high Commendation given already to <hi>Alcibiades</hi> upon the ſcore of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <hi>[omnium Gracorum ditiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum]</hi> may be thought more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine; eſpecially ſince it is collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſupported by the authority of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who only mentions the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Riches and high Quality of <hi>Hipponicus.</hi>

By which Arts he was become ſo popular, that the eyes of the Multitude were (with a diſregard to the reſt of the Nobility) continually fixt upon him whenever he appear'd in publick; ſo that for this reaſon he came at length to be look'd upon as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal object of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Hopes and Fears; all men eſteeming him equally capable of promoting the Welfare and Ruin of his Country. Beſides this, he lay under the ſcandal of holding Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Conventicles in his Houſe; which

                  </note> therefore brought againſt him in open Court; but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that the time of his departure upon the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Expedition drew near, and reflecting upon the uſual proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Country-men againſt abſent Criminals, made it his requeſt, to be preſently brought to a Trial, and not to be expos'd at a diſtance to the craft and malice of his Enemies.

Whereupon he readily obeying the publick Summons, and (altho he had the faireſt hopes of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Adminiſtration of his Province Crown'd with Honour and Succeſs) going on board the Gally which was

               <p>Yet did not theſe their Succeſſes ſo much encreaſe their Love, as awaken their Fears, and alienate their Affections from him; for conſidering him to be a perſon of the acuteſt parts, and moſt experienc'd prudence in all manner of affairs, and fearing withall, leſt prevail'd upon by the dictates of an inbred tenderneſs for his Native Soil, he ſhould one time or other deſert their Service, and purchaſe a Reconciliation with his offended Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; they judg'd it expedient, e're this

               <p>But by no kind of Fortune could <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades</hi>'s Soul be diveſted of a tender Affection for his Native Country; and this he ſufficiently manifeſted about this time, by the Advice given to <hi>Philocles,</hi> Commander in Chief over the <hi>Athenian</hi> Fleet in the River <hi>Aegos; Lyſander,</hi> the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99884:62"/>
                  <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Admiral lying at no great diſtance from him, and deſiring by all means to prolong the War, becauſe he knew that the <hi>Athenians</hi> had nothing left beſides their Weapons and Gallies (their public Exchequer being quite exhauſted), and that the Forces of his own Country at the ſame time were ſupported and maintain'd by a conſtant ſupply of Money from the <hi>Perſian</hi> King. Neither were theſe things conceal'd from <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> who therefore coming to the <hi>Athenian</hi> Army, ſpoke publicly in the hearing of the common Soldiers to this effect, <hi>That if they pleas'd to accept of his Service, he made no doubt of forcing</hi> Lyſander, <hi>with his whole Fleet, to come to the deciſion of a Battel, or elſe to make ſubmiſſive Overtures of Peace. That the</hi> Lacedaemonians <hi>were indeed unwilling to run the hazard of a Sea-fight, becauſe their main ſtrength and confidence lay in their Land-Forces; but that he could eaſily prevail with</hi> Seuthes, <hi>the</hi> Thracian <hi>King, to drive them from Land, and that then they would be neceſſitated, either to come to fair terms of Accommodation with the</hi> Athenians, <hi>or venture all upon the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful iſſue of an Engagement at Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Advice, as it was not really dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik'd, ſo neither was it embrac'd by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locles;</hi>

who well knew, that if <hi>Alcibia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> were admitted to a conjunction with him, he himſelf ſhould be but an empty Cipher in the whole Action; and let the Event prove proſperous or otherwiſe, that on the one hand, he ſhould have no ſhare in the Glory; and on the other, no Partner in the Diſcredit and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny of ſuch an Undertaking. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> therefore, finding that his Counſel was not accepted, told <hi>Philocles</hi> at his departure, that he would only leave this ſhort caution with him, To ly as near the Enemy as might conveniently be with his Naval Camp; and to take care, leſt by the licentiouſneſs and looſe Diſcipline of his Soldiers, the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> ſhould have an opportunity put into their hands of ſurprizing his Fleet, and ruining the whole Army.

After this fatal blow receiv'd by the <hi>Athenians, Alcibiades</hi> judging it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe for him to make any longer ſtay in thoſe parts, withdrew into the more inward Regions of <hi>Thrace,</hi> lying above the <hi>Propontis;</hi> not doubting but in ſuch a place his Fortune and Quality might eaſily be kept undiſcover'd. But it was not long e're he found that he was miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; for a Body of <hi>Thracians,</hi> who had information of his great Wealth, placing themſelves in Ambuſcade, ſurpriz'd and plunder'd all his Carriages; wherefore, having himſelf narrowly eſcap'd out of their hands, and conſidering that (by reaſon of the great Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Lacedaemonians)</hi> no part of <hi>Greece</hi> could afford him a ſafe Retreat, he fled into <hi>Aſia</hi> to <hi>Pharnabazus,</hi> who was preſently ſo taken with his courteous Deportment and obliging Addreſs, that the firſt place in this great Man's Favour ſeem'd to be given to <hi>Alcibiades;</hi> who ſhortly after receiv'd from him, as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial teſtimony of Affection, the Fortreſs of <hi>Grunium</hi> in <hi>Phrygia;</hi> the Caſtellany whereof yeilded him no leſs then fifty Talents yearly Income.</p>
               <p>But this plentiful Fortune brought no real contentment to <hi>Alcibiades;</hi> of which his mind was abſolutely uncapable, ſo

long as the <hi>Athenian</hi> continued in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> State. The whole bent of his Soul was therefore to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the delivering of his Country from that Inglorious Yoke and Bondage. But this he foreſaw could not be effected without the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Perſian</hi> King, whoſe Amity was therefore to be procur'd in the firſt place; and of that he aſſur'd himſelf, if he might but obtain free acceſs to his Perſon. For having ſecret notice of the <note n="*" place="margin">Our Author does not term it a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion or Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, becauſe <hi>Cyrus</hi> was no Liege ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to <hi>Attaxerxes,</hi> their Father <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> (as we are told by <hi>Justin)</hi> having by Will given the former the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Soveraignty of thoſe Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries over which he had before preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> War in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended againſt the King by his Brother <hi>Cyrus,</hi> with the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonians;</hi> he queſtion'd not, but by diſcovering this Confederacy, he ſhould purchaſe to himſelf the higheſt degree of Favour and Affection.</p>

And altho many boaſted themſelves born of more Ancient Families, yet none outſtripp'd
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99884:66"/>
him in any other Accompliſhment of a Great Man. Whoever Reſcues his Native Country from the Oppreſſion of one <hi>Tyrant,</hi> does ſo Brave an Action, that many Men have Attempted, but few have had the Honour of Atchieving; yet was it this Man's good Fortune, to Free His, groaning under the intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Burthen of Thirty at once. His Valour was firſt fledg'd in the <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſian</hi> War; where being in a Joint-Commiſſion, he did many great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits without <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> tho <hi>Alcibiades</hi> did nothing without Him; all his Actions expreſſing an ardent deſire to promote the Good of the Commonwealth. But in pitch'd Battels the Strength and Number of Forces is as much to be rely'd on as the moſt excellent Conduct; and the private Soldier juſtly claims a ſhare in the Glory of the Action with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. Beſides, Fortune ſometimes lets them know, that Succeſs depends neither upon one nor the other; but is ſolely at her diſpoſal. Wherefore, the moſt Glorious of all Actions <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> may juſtly claim to be properly his own; For when <hi>Athens</hi> was miſerably haraſs'd and torn by the <hi>Arbitrary Proceedings</hi> of thoſe Thirty Burgomaſters, ſet up (as it were
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99884:67"/>
a <hi>Council of State)</hi> by the <hi>Lacedaemonians;</hi> during whoſe uncontrolable ſway, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Eminent Citizens were kill'd, ſome (preſerv'd by Fate from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the War) were baniſh'd, and many others had their Eſtates confiſcated and divided amongſt the Uſurpers: He only (not as a General, but) ſingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd open War againſt them; and when he fled to <hi>Phyle</hi> (the ſtrongeſt and beſt fortified Caſtle in <hi>Attica)</hi> he had ſcarce Thirty Confederates. So weak were the Foundations of the Deſign by which the Liberty of that Illuſtrious City was aſſerted. He was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable for his Perſon or Parts; but was contemn'd for his inconſiderable Party; which at laſt prov'd of great conſequence to him; as the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Deſign for the Relief of his Country, and the utter and final Ruin of it's Enemies. For they, lull'd in their own ſecurity, neglected a ſpeedy and vigorous proſecution; and conſequently gave him a longer time to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more conſiderable both for Men and Money. Whence is evinc'd the truth of that common Axiom, <hi>In War no Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is to be ſlipt;</hi> and it is not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſaid, <hi>The Mother of a Coward need ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99884:67"/>
Fear.</hi> Yet all this while <hi>Thraſybulus</hi>'s Supplies and Aſſiſtances bore no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to his Expectations. For even in thoſe days men were more laviſh of their Words then Actions; and more hotly diſputed their Liberty with their Tongues then their Swords. From <hi>Phyle</hi> he march'd to <hi>Pyraeum,</hi> and fortifies <hi>Munichia;</hi> which place his Enemies twice attempting to take by Storm, in two general Aſſaults, were as often beat back with conſiderable Damage, and at laſt forc'd to retire into <hi>Athens</hi> with the loſs of all their Arms and Baggage. <hi>Thraſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus</hi> in the mean time manages his Affair with as great Wiſdom as Courage, and commands that Quarter ſhould be given to all thoſe who would accept it; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it was but reaſonable, <hi>that Fellow-Citizens ſhould ſpare one another.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed was there any perſon hurt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, but thoſe who continued in a poſture of Hoſtility. He ſuffer'd none to be ſtript of their Clothes; nor touch'd any part of the Plunder, only Arms (for which he had urgent occaſion) and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals. In this ſecond Conflict fell <hi>Critias,</hi> the primier Burgomaſter, after he had fought valiantly. <hi>Critias</hi> being ſlain, <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanias,</hi> King of the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> comes
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99884:68"/>
to the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Athenians;</hi> and at length concludes a Peace between both Parties on theſe Terms: Firſt, That no Citizen (except the Thirty Tyrants, and the Ten Pretors, who exactly Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied thoſe Originals of Cruelty in their Actions) ſhould ſuffer Baniſhment.

And Thirdly, That De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy ſhould be Reeſtabliſh'd, and the Soveraign Power remain in the hands of the People. One more remarkably great Action of his we muſt by no means forget; When Peace was ſettled, and he bore a great ſway in the City, he Enacted a Law, <hi>That no man ſhould be accus'd, or any way puniſh'd, for any thing that was paſt.</hi> This was afterwards call'd <hi>An Act of Oblivion.</hi> But not ſatisfied with the bare Enacting of ſuch a Law, he took a mighty care in the juſt and ſtrict Execution of it; and check'd ſome of the Partakers of his miſery in Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who would have made havock of thoſe men they had ſo lately receiv'd into Favour. For theſe great and illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Actions, <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> was Honour'd by the People with a Coronet made of Olive-branches; a mean Reward indeed, but attended with theſe Advantages, that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99884:68"/>
it was in no manner extorted, but a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and hearty Teſtimony of the People's Affection; and was therefore an Honour, free from the Detractions of Envy or Emulation. For as <hi>Pittacus</hi> (a man juſtly regiſter'd in the Catalogue of the Seven Wiſe-men of <hi>Greece)</hi> well obſerv'd to the <hi>Mitylenaeans,</hi> when they would have given him many thouſand Acres of Land for a Reward; <hi>Don't ye,</hi> ſays he, <hi>give me ſo Noble a Preſent, that many will Envy, and more will Covet; I will only accept of an hundred Acres, which is ſufficient to ſhew your Good Will, and my own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty. Great Favours are often ſnatcht away, whilſt little ones, below Envy, are longer enjoy'd. Thraſybulus</hi> therefore, highly pleas'd with this petty Crown, ſought no other Satisfaction; but look'd upon himſelf to be as much Honour'd as any of his Cotemporaries. In proceſs of time, going Admiral to <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and his Soldiers being very remiſs when they were upon their Guard, he was in a Sally ſurpriz'd in his Tent, and ſlain by the <hi>Barbarians.</hi>

                  <hi>CONON,</hi> an <hi>Athenian,</hi> became Great in the Eſteem of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth at the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War; where his Conduct was ſignally Heroick. For he was Captain-General of the Land-Forces and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral at Sea; and perform'd noble Atchive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; which made him the Darling of the People, who Conſtituted him Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of all their Iſlands; in which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion he took <hi>Pharae,</hi> a Colony of the <hi>Lacedaemonians.</hi> He was alſo Captain-General
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99884:69"/>
in the laſt <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War, when the Flower of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Army was deſtroy'd by <hi>Lyſander</hi> at the River <hi>Aegos.</hi> But <hi>Conon</hi> was not in Perſon at that Battel; from whence may be concluded the Misfortune of that fatal Day. For he weigh'd every Military Action; and was even jealous in acquitting himſelf like a General. Which makes it highly probable, that his Perſonal Valour and Conduct might have diverted that Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre of the <hi>Athenians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet in this ſad deſtraction, when he heard the groans of his Country, he conſulted not his own Safety and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, but the Relief of his diſconſolate Country-men. He haſtned therefore to <hi>Pharnabazus,</hi> Lieutenant of <hi>Ionia</hi> and <hi>Lydia,</hi> who was Son in Law to the King; into whoſe Favour he inſinuated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, tho not without great intrigue and hazard. For when the <hi>Lacedaemonians (Athens</hi> lying gaſping) had broke their League, which they had made with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes,</hi> and had ſent <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> with an Army into <hi>Aſia</hi> (where he was often Careſs'd by <hi>Tiſſaphernes,</hi> who was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the Familiar of the King, but had revolted from all the Endearments of his Prince, and combin'd with the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99884:70"/>
                  <hi>Lacedaemonians); Pharnabazus</hi> march'd againſt him as General,; tho in reality <hi>Conon</hi> was Chief, and his Warlike Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Controll'd the whole Council. He ſtopt the carier of <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> that ſo much renown'd Captain, and confounded all his Stratagems; and 'twas the wiſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Conon</hi> which prevented <hi>Ageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> from renting that part of <hi>Aſia</hi> on this ſide <hi>Taurus</hi> from the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> being remanded home by the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> who were embroil'd in a War with the <hi>Boeotians</hi> and <hi>Athenians; Conon</hi> took that opportunity to ingratiate himſelf with the <hi>Perſian</hi> Nobility; and ſoon became their only Oracle.</p>
               <p>At this time the Malecontent <hi>Tiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phernes</hi> had quitted the Court, of which the King was only incredulous; ſo great a ſhare had <hi>Tiſſaphernes</hi> in the Royal Favour, tho in this very time of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal Villany. Neither is it ſtrange, that the King was unwilling to miſtruſt this his Creature, when he call'd to mind, that by his Proweſs he quell'd his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Therefore <hi>Conon</hi> was ſent by <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> to Accuſe <hi>Tiſſaphernes</hi> before the King; who being arriv'd, according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> he came to <hi>Tithrauſtes,</hi> a Tribune and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99884:70"/>
principal Officer of State, requeſting that he might be introduc'd; without which ceremony none are admitted. To whom <hi>Tithrauſtes</hi> ſaid, there ſhould be no delay; but (ſaid he) you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult whether it were better to have an Audience, or to ſignifie your Buſineſs by Letter; for if you come into the Royal Preſence, you muſt fall down before the King; which they call <note n="*" place="margin">Graeci vocant <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Homage:</hi> But if you cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with this, truſt me to interceed for you, and you ſhall certainly attain your deſire. Then <hi>Conon</hi> reply'd; I could very chearfully pay any Honour to the King, but I fear leſt it ſhould be a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable blemiſh to my Country, if I ſhould proſtitute my ſelf to the Slavery of a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> who came from that People who by Nature are accuſtom'd to Govern. He therefore deliver'd his Buſineſs in a Letter; which being made known to the King, he was ſo taken with his Commanding Deportment, that he proclaim'd <hi>Tiſſaphernes</hi> a Traitor, commiſſion'd <hi>Conon</hi> to Fight the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonians,</hi> and to elect whom he pleas'd to raiſe Money for the War. Which choice <hi>Conon</hi> modeſtly deny'd to be in his Province, but in the King's, who
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99884:71"/>
beſt underſtood the Condition of his People; yet that it was his humble Advice, that he would confer that Office on <hi>Pharnabazus.</hi> After this, being ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd with great Preſents, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd to Sea, that he might convey the Galleys to the <hi>Cyprians, Phoenicians,</hi> with the other Port-Towns; and that he ſhould Rig a Navy, to ſecure the Seas the following Summer; in which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> was his Collegue, as he had petition'd. So ſoon as the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> heard this, they acted with great judiciouſneſs, becauſe they foreſaw a more dangerous War, then if they had been engag'd only againſt the petulant <hi>Perſian.</hi> For they were now to grapple with a bold and wary Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, intruſted with the whole <hi>Perſian</hi> Power; againſt whom their Stratagems of War were as ridiculouſly vain as their Strength. With this reſolution they contract a formidable Navy, and ſet Sail under <hi>Piſander;</hi> whom <hi>Conon</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted at the River <hi>Cnidus,</hi> and after a deſperate Fight routed; many Ships he took, and many he ſunk; by which Victory not only <hi>Athens</hi> but all <hi>Greece</hi> was freed from the Yoke of the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonians. Conon</hi> with part of the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99884:71"/>
Navy return'd to his own Country, was very ſolicitous in rebuilding the Walls of <hi>Athens,</hi> with the Haven <hi>Pyraeeum,</hi> which were demoliſh'd by <hi>Lyſander;</hi> and gave his Fellow-Citizens Fifty Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, which he had receiv'd of <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabazus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet it happen'd to this Great Man as to the Ignoble Peſantry, who was more improvident in the ſmoother then in the rugged part of his Life; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving vanquiſh'd the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, and ſatisfied the revengeful thirſt of his Country, he aim'd at higher things then his Policy could poſsibly reach; all which Attempts were Pious and Honourable, in as much as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd the welfare of <hi>Athens</hi> before the King's. For when he had acquir'd a ſplendid Eminency by the Sea-Fight at <hi>Cnidus,</hi> he began ſlily to whiſper among the <hi>Perſians</hi> and all the Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> that <hi>Ionia</hi> and <hi>Aeolis</hi> ſhould be ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to the <hi>Athenians.</hi> But this deſign taking vent, <hi>Teribazus</hi> Lieutenant of <hi>Sardis,</hi> inveighled <hi>Conon</hi> to come to him, pretending to ſend him to the King upon an Embaſſy of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Conon</hi> obey'd the Meſſage; and as ſoon as he arriv'd, was ſecur'd in Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

which he bore for ſome time. Others write, that he was brought to the King, and dy'd there.

                  </note> Gifts of the Tyrant. He had a great intimacy with <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Father, to which his Perſonal Merits were as inſtrumental as his Affinity; for tho he lik'd not <hi>Dionyſius</hi>'s Cruelty, yet he endeavour'd his Safety, upon account of their Alliance, but chiefly with reſpect to his own Relations. He was conſulted with in matters of the greateſt concern; and the Tyrant was very much ſway'd by his Advice, unleſs in thoſe things where the prevalence of his own Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons over-rul'd. All Embaſſies of note were perform'd by him; in which his Civility, together with his faithful and diligent Adminiſtration of Affairs, took off from that Imputation of Cruelty, which <hi>Dionyſius</hi> generally lay under. The <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi> to whom he was ſent by the Tyrant, honour'd him highly, inſomuch that they never had any <hi>Grecian</hi> in more Admiration. Neither was <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99884:73"/>
of theſe things, nor unſenſible how great an ornament he was to him; from whence it came to paſs, that <hi>Dion</hi> was moſt in his Favour, and lov'd by him as a Son: So that when 'twas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in <hi>Sicily,</hi> that <hi>Plato</hi> was come to <hi>Tarentum</hi> he did not only give the young Man (who had a great deſire to be one of his Hearers) leave to invite him thither; but after the grant, brought him in great ſtate to <hi>Syracuſe.</hi> For him <hi>Dion</hi> had ſo great a love and veneration, that he wholly yeilded himſelf to his diſpoſal; which was anſwer'd by <hi>Plato,</hi> who took no leſs delight in him. For altho he was cruelly misus'd by the Tyrant, who gave order he ſhould be ſold for a Slave; yet at <hi>Dion</hi>'s requeſt he had leave to return. In the mean time <hi>Dionyſius</hi> fell ſick; and his Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <note place="margin">He ſurfeited at a Feaſt which He made for joy he was declared Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in Poetry. <hi>Diod.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99884:74"/>
concern'd, that to prevent any confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>Dion</hi> and his Father, he forc'd the Phyſitians to give the later a ſleeping Potion; which the old man took, and ſlept his laſt.</p>
               <p>Such was the beginning of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel between <hi>Dionyſius</hi> and <hi>Dion;</hi> which many things afterwards fomented. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, for ſome time there remain'd an appearance of Friendſhip; ſo that <hi>Dion</hi> being urgent with him, to ſend for <hi>Plato</hi> from <hi>Athens,</hi> and make uſe of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, he comply'd with his deſire, that in ſomething he might be like his Father, and at the ſame time brought <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Philiſtus</hi> the Hiſtorian back to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> a man who was equally a Friend to the Tyrant and his Tyranny. But of this I have ſaid more in my Book of the <hi>Greek</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. As for <hi>Plato,</hi> his Eloquence and Authority ſo much influenc'd <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> that by his perſwaſion he was reſolv'd to reſtore the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and put an end to the Tyranny; but being deterr'd by <hi>Philiſtus</hi> from exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his intention, he became more Cruel then before. Finding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that <hi>Dion</hi> had the advantage of him in Parts, in Authority, and the Love of the People, he fear'd their
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99884:74"/>
ſtaying together might be an occaſion of his own Ruin; upon which he gave him a Gally to tranſport him to <hi>Corinth;</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him withall, that what he did was for both their ſakes; leſt out of the mutual fear which was between them, one might be apt to ſupplant the other. This action was highly reſented by many, and drew great'envy upon the Tyrant; who to make the World believe, that he did it not out of hatred to the man, but meerly for his own ſecurity, Shipp'd off all his Moveables and ſent them to him. But <note n="*" place="margin">

From whence it is evident, <hi>That no Empire is Safe which is not Guarded by Love.</hi> At that time <hi>Dionyſius</hi> was in <hi>Italy,</hi> expecting the Fleet; and did not imagine, that any of his Enemies durſt venture upon him without conſiderable Forces. In which he was miſtaken; for <hi>Dion,</hi> with thoſe very men which were under his Adverſary's dominion, abated
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99884:75"/>
the Tyrant's Arrogance; and made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of all that part of <hi>Sicily</hi> which was in ſubjection to <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> as he did of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> likewiſe, except the Citadel, and the Iſland adjoining to the Town. Whereupon the matter was brought to that paſs, that the Tyrant was contented to make Peace on the following Articles: <hi>That</hi> Dion <hi>ſhould have</hi> Sicily, Dionyſius <hi>poſſeſs</hi> Italy, <hi>and</hi> Syracuſe <hi>be in the hands of</hi> Apollocrates, <hi>a man in whom</hi> Dionyſius <hi>repos'd the greatest truſt.</hi> But this unexpected proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity was attended with a ſudden change; Fortune by her fickleneſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to ruine him, whom juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe had exalted. The firſt token of her malice, ſhe ſhew'd in his Son, whom I mention'd before; for having brought back his Wife, who was given to another, and being deſirous to reſcue his Son from the Debauchery in which he had been bred, and reduce him to his former Sobriety, he receiv'd a grievous blow by the Death of his Child. The next misfortune, was the Diſſention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and <hi>Heraclides;</hi> who made a Faction, rather then he would yeild the priority to <hi>Dion,</hi> and had as much intereſt among the Nobility as he; for
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99884:76"/>
by their conſent he commanded the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Forces, at the ſame time when the other did thoſe at Land. This <hi>Dion</hi> could not brook; and repeated thoſe Verſes in the ſecond Iliad of <hi>Homer,</hi> to this purpoſe, <hi>That a State cannot be well order'd, where the Government is in the hands of many.</hi> The Saying rais'd him much envy, for by it he ſeem'd to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover an intention of getting all into his own power; which opinion he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd not to leſſen by complaiſance, but ſuppreſs by rigor; and caus'd <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclides,</hi> when he came to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> to be kill'd. An action which ſtruck every body with fear; no man thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſafe, now <hi>Heraclides</hi> was thus taken out of the way. But <hi>Dion,</hi> being rid of his Adverſary, with more licence diſtributed the Eſtates of the contrary Party among his Soldiers. After which diviſion, by reaſon of the greatneſs of his daily expences, he quickly began to want Money; which he knew no way to be ſupply'd with, but by ſieze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Friends poſſeſſions; upon which it happen'd, that the gaining the Soldier prov'd the loſs of the Nobility. Theſe things he took very much to heart; and being unaccuſtom'd to be ill ſpoken of,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99884:76"/>
could not endure to be in diſrepute with thoſe who a little before had prais'd him to the Skies. For the Rabble perceiving the Soldiers were offended with him, ſpoke more openly, and often reproacht him with intolerable Tyranny.

And that he might not be deſtitute of means to eſcape, if Fortune ſhould prove croſs to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, he furniſh'd a Galley with Men and Arms; and order'd his Brother <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locrates,</hi> who commanded it, to keep it moving in the Port, as if he only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the exerciſe of the Rowers.

Their familiarity in the Family immediately gain'd them admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into his Chamber; where, as ſoon as they were enter'd, they faſten'd the Doors, fell upon him in his Bed, and bound him; which was not done ſo ſilently, but the noiſe was heard with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Hence it is evident, as I have often ſaid before, how odious a thing the Government of a ſingle Perſon is; and how miſerable a Life they lead, who had rather be the object of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject's Fear than Love. For his very Guards, had they bore him any kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, might have broke open the Doors, and ſav'd his Life; the Conſpirators be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forc'd for want of Arms to keep him alive 'till they could procure a Weapon of thoſe who were out of the Chamber.

nois'd that <hi>Dion</hi> was ſlain, many who diſlik'd the action ran thither, and upon a falſe ſurmiſe kill'd the Innocent inſtead of the Guilty.

Wherefore by public Order he was buried in the moſt Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable place of the City, and by the ſame had a Tomb erected.

                  <hi>IPHICRATES,</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> became famous to Poſterity, rather by his accurate Skill in the Art of War, than the Gallantry of any Noble Atchievements. For he was ſo perfectly furniſh'd with all the neceſſary Accompliſhments requiſite to complete a General, that he not only attain'd the Excellencies of his moſt eminent Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries, but might juſtly diſpure
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:99884:79"/>
Preeminence with the Chief of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Ages. He was ſo very well expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd in Martial Affairs, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often entruſted with the Command of entire Armies, he never was defeated by any failure or default of his own; and what Victory ſoever he obtain'd, it appear'd principally to be owing to his Prudence and Conduct. So great was his Judgment in all things relating to War, that he both advanc'd the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Diſcipline by additional Rules to a far greater perfection than it ever had before his time, and improv'd thoſe few ſcatter'd ones he met with to the beſt advantage. He alſo made moſt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and beneficial alterations in the Arms of the Infantry; for whereas before his time broad unweildy Shields, ſhort Spears, and little Swords were only in uſe, he chang'd the firſt of them into a lighter Target, made ſomewhat in ſhape of an Half-Moon, call'd <hi>Pelta,</hi> from whence the Foot afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the name of <hi>Peltaſtae;</hi> and by this more portable Buckler, he did not only expedite their Marches, but made them capable of receiving their Enemy's onſets with greater readineſs and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. As for the Sword, he augmented
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99884:79"/>
its length, but doubled that of the Spear; changing moreover their Breaſt-Armour from Iron and Braſs to thoſe made of Linnen; which render'd his Soldiers fitter for Action; and by thus leſſening their weight, he at once provided for their eaſe and ſecurity too. He was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in a War with the <hi>Thratians,</hi> and reſtor'd <hi>Seuthes,</hi> an Ally of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> to his Kingdom. At <hi>Corinth</hi> he kept the Army to ſo ſtrict Diſcipline, that there were in no part of <hi>Greece</hi> to be found better Train'd Forces; or any who with ſo great readineſs receiv'd and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the Commands of a General, even in the moſt minute particulars; for by his pains and induſtry they grew ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in all Military Orders and Poſtures, that as ſoon as ever he had but once given the Word of Command, they would immediately form themſelves into as regular a Figure, as if the moſt skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Commander had rank'd each pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Soldier in his particular place. With this Army he intercepted a ſelect Party of the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Horſe; which Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was very much extoll'd throughout all <hi>Greece.</hi> In the ſame War he gave their whole Strength a ſecond total De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat; which alſo procur'd him a large
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99884:80"/>
ſtock of Honour. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> purpoſing to fight the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> made it his requeſt to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that they would grant him <hi>Iphicrates,</hi> whom he deſign'd as Commander in Chief over his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Forces, the ſame amounting to the number of twelve thouſand men; and having obtain'd his deſire, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them ſo fully and exactly in the whole Art of War, that as formerly the beſt <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers were diſtinguiſh'd from the meaner ſort by bearing the name of their Leader <hi>Fabius;</hi> ſo the <hi>Grecians</hi> had thoſe under the Command of <hi>Iphicrates</hi> in the higheſt eſteem. When he went to aſſiſt the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> he ſoon put a ſtop to the Attempts of <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas;</hi> for had he not haſten'd his March, the <hi>Thebans</hi> would not have rais'd the Siege of <hi>Sparta,</hi> till they had laid it waſte in Aſhes, and utter ruin. The greatneſs of his Spirit bore an equal proportion with that of his Body; his Preſence being very Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic and Commanding, did ſo clearly beſpeak him what really he was, that his bare look of it ſelf was ſufficient to ſtrike all Beholders with an Admiration of his Perſon. <hi>Theopompus</hi> has recorded, that he was remiſs in matters which requir'd
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:99884:80"/>
continu'd Labour, and that he could not well brook the hardſhips of War; yet he had ſtill the character of a good Citizen given him, and was always reputed a Man of a ſteddy and untain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Fidelity; of which, as on ſeveral other occaſions he gave moſt undeniable proofs, ſo he did in a more peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſignalize it by protecting the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs'd Orphans of <hi>Amyntas</hi> the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian.</hi> For <hi>Euridice</hi> the Mother of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diccas</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> upon her Husband's death, preſently fled with her two Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Children to <hi>Iphicrates</hi> for ſuccour and patronage; who being rich, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly aſſerted their juſt Rights againſt all kinds of wrong and oppreſſion. He died old, in the Love and Favour of his Fellow-Citizens; tho their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had been for ſome time alienated from him; for he, and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> were forc'd to make their public Defences in the Aſſociated War; and he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted by thoſe who were conſtituted his Judges. He left behind him a Son call'd <hi>Meneſtheus,</hi> whom he had by a <hi>Thracian</hi> Woman, Daughter to King <hi>Cotus;</hi> who being ask'd, <hi>which he lov'd best, his Father or Mother?</hi> reply'd, <hi>his Mother.</hi> And when all the Company

               <p>
                  <hi>CHABRIAS</hi> was an <hi>Athenian;</hi> one that bore a Name in the Catalogue of their greateſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders; and perform'd ſeveral Exploits that very well deſerve the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording. Among which, there ought more eſpecially to be remarqu'd, that Stratagem which he made uſe of at <hi>Thebes,</hi> when he came to aſſiſt the <hi>Boeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians:</hi> For in that Engagement <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> General, being very confident of obtaining the Victory, and having made ſo great a ſtep toward it,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99884:82"/>
as the putting to flight all the Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Forces of the Adverſe Party; <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brias</hi> procur'd the other Troops to keep their ſtation, while by his own example of kneeling down upon his Buckler, and holding out his Spear or Pike aſlaunt, he taught them in that manner to expect the onſet of the Enemy. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> being ſurpriz'd at ſo unwonted a ſight, durſt make no farther attempt upon them, but immediately ſounded a Retreat, and thereby ſummon'd his Soldiers to fall back, when they were juſt ready to have made the aſſault. This contrivance was ſo much applauded throughout all <hi>Greece,</hi> that <hi>Chabrias</hi> order'd himſelf to be drawn in that defenſive poſture in the Statue which was erected for him in the <hi>Forum</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> at the public charge of that City. And from hence it commenc'd a cuſtom, that ever after all Gladiators, and other Fencers, were wont to have their Statues carv'd to the ſame poſture wherein they had got their reſpective Victories. But to return, <hi>Chabrias</hi> wag'd ſeveral Wars in <hi>Europe,</hi> while he was commiſſion'd a General of the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> and behav'd himſelf bravely in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when he ſerv'd as a private Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntier. Going to the help of <hi>Nectanebus,</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:99884:82"/>
he got him ſetled in his Kingdom. He came off with as good ſucceſs at <hi>Cyprus;</hi> tho there indeed he was publicly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the <hi>Athenians</hi> as a Collegue with <hi>Evagoras;</hi> nor did he diſpatch from hence till he had ſubdued the whole Iſland; and from the happy manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Enterprize, the <hi>Athenians</hi> purchas'd themſelves a vaſt credit. In the mean while aroſe a War between the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Egyptians;</hi> the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> enter'd into League with <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> ſided with the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> of whom <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> King of <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> made a very conſiderable advantage. <hi>Chabrias</hi> taking notice of this, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf no way inferior to <hi>Ageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> frankly offer'd his Service to the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> and was made Admiral of their Fleet, <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> being Commander of their Infantry. Upon this, the Captains who were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd by the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> diſpatcht Meſſengers to <hi>Athens,</hi> to complain that <hi>Chabrias</hi> took part with the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in a War againſt their Maſter. The <hi>Athenians</hi> hereupon fix'd a day, by which time if <hi>Chabrias</hi> return'd not, they threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned he ſhould forfeit his Life, for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99884:83"/>
the Summons. <hi>Chabrias</hi> at this news comes back to <hi>Athens;</hi> yet ſtay'd there no longer than was juſt neceſſary to avoid the penalty which was otherwiſe denounc'd againſt him. For he was not fond of reſiding among his own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; having liv'd ſo ſplendidly, and far'd ſo high, that he could not but raiſe the Envy of the Rabble. For this indeed is a common fault in Great and Free Cities, That Envy is always faſten'd upon Glory; and moſt Perſons are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme forward in detracting from thoſe, who are promoted to be their Superiors. And, what is ordinary to obſerve, the Poor cannot without regret at their own harder Fate, caſt an eye upon the more ample Fortunes of the Rich. <hi>Chabrias</hi> upon theſe conſiderations was as much abroad as his Affairs could diſpenſe with. And herein he was not ſingular, in his caution of ſtaying little at home in <hi>Athens;</hi> for almoſt all their eminent men took the ſame courſe; thinking themſelves ſo far remov'd from Envy as they were diſtant from their own Native Country. <hi>Conon</hi> for this reaſon liv'd the moſt part in <hi>Cyprus, Iphicrates</hi> in <hi>Thrace, Timotheus</hi> in <hi>Lesbus,</hi> and <hi>Chares</hi> in <hi>Sigaeum.</hi> This <hi>Chares,</hi> it is

true, was different from the reſt both in Temper and Action; yet he was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of great Honour and Wealth at <hi>Athens.</hi> But finally, <hi>Chabrias</hi> came thus to his end, in the Social War; The <hi>Athenians</hi> laid Siege to <hi>Chium, Chabrias</hi> was in the Navy only as a Reformade, yet he had greater Authority than any who were in places of Command; the Common Soldiers paying more reſpect to him than to any of their Officers, which prov'd the occaſion of haſting his Death: For whilſt he was ambitious of making the firſt Entrance into the Harbour, and accordingly had directed the Pilot to ſteer in, this Adventure coſt him his Life; for when he was got in, none of the other Veſſels would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; whereupon, being ſurrounded with the Attacks of the Enemy, he fought couragiouſly, till the Ship ſprung a Leak, by ſome damage toward the Head, and began to ſink under him. Hereupon, being unable to make any eſcape; for if he had thrown himſelf overboard, the <hi>Athenians</hi> would have took him up as he ſwum; he therefore choſe rather to dye in his ſtation, than to lay down his Arms and quit the Ship. None of the other Sea-men would run the ſame ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99884:84"/>
but leap'd out, and eſcap'd ſafe to ſhore; while <hi>Chabrias,</hi> preferring an honourable Death before an ignoble and ſlaviſh Life, fighting hand to hand upon the Deck, was at laſt kill'd on the place.</p>

                  <hi>Timotheus</hi> being made Admiral of the Navy, ſailing along by <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> he waſted the Country of <hi>Laconia,</hi> and beat their Fleet.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99884:85"/>
Joy was there at <hi>Athens</hi> upon the news of this Victory, that then it was that public Altars were firſt Erected to the Goddeſs of Peace, and a Pallet appointed Her. The Memory of which noble Act, that they might perpetuate, they erected a Statue for him in the <hi>Forum;</hi> which Honour was never pay'd to any man before him, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſame People who had ſet up a Statue for the Father ſhould give the Son one to; the laſt ſerving to revive the Memory of the former.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Timotheus</hi> was very ancient, and had quite left off all public buſineſs, War began to threaten the <hi>Athenians</hi> on every ſide. <hi>Samus</hi> and <hi>Helleſpont</hi> revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> being very powerful, made great Preparations for a War. Againſt whom, when they had ſent <hi>Chares,</hi> they thought him not ſtrong enough to oppoſe him; and thereupon make <hi>Menestheus</hi> (the Son of <hi>Iphicrates,</hi> and Son-in-Law to <hi>Timotheus)</hi> their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; and order him to go to the War.

Perſons of ſuch Authority, that there was great hopes by their means they might recover all they had loſt.

This Attempt having ſucceeded ill, and loſing a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of his Ships, he retires back again from whence he came, and diſpatches an Expreſs to <hi>Athens,</hi> to let them know, that he could eaſily have taken <hi>Samos,</hi> had he not been deſerted by <hi>Timotheus</hi> and <hi>Iphicrates.</hi> Upon this Accuſation of his, they were Impeach'd. The Commons, who were fierce, jealous, factious, changeable, and Enemies alſo to all in Power, call them home; and accuſe them of betraying their Country.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99884:86"/>
In this Trial <hi>Timotheus</hi> is caſt, and Fin'd an hundred Talents; and ſo being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd, through the ill will of an ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful City, he retires to <hi>Calcis.</hi> After his Death, the People repenting of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence they had paſs'd upon him, remitted all but a tenth part of his Fine, and oblige his Son <hi>Conon</hi> to repair part of a Wall. In which Action may be ſeen the various turns of Fortune; for thoſe very Walls which the Grandfather <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> had Rebuilt with the Spoils of the Enemy, is the Nephew forc'd to Repair, out of his own Eſtate, to the great Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of his Family. We might produce many inſtances of the Wiſdom and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of <hi>Timotheus;</hi> but one ſhall ſuffice; from whence we may eaſily conjecture, how dear he was to his Friends. When he was but a young Man, he was forc'd at <hi>Athens</hi> to plead for himſelf; and not only his Friends and private Acquaintance came to his Aſſiſtance, but alſo <hi>Jaſon</hi> the Tyrant, who at that time was a Man of very conſiderable Power. This Man, tho in his own Kingdom, never thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſafe without his Guards about him, yet came alone to <hi>Athens,</hi> valuing his Friend at ſo dear a rate, that he rather
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:99884:87"/>
choſe to endanger his own Life, than not aſsiſt <hi>Timotheus</hi> in vindicating his Honour. But notwithſtanding all this, <hi>Timotheus</hi> ſoon after, by the Command of the People, fought againſt him; account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the obligations to his Country greater than thoſe of Friendſhip. This was the laſt Age of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Commanders; for after <hi>Iphicrates, Chabrias,</hi> and <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus,</hi> there was no Commander of any note in that City.</p>

                  <hi>DATAMES</hi> a <hi>Carian,</hi> the Son of <hi>Camiſſares</hi> by'a <hi>Scythian</hi> Lady, was the moſt conſiderable, for Valour and prudent Conduct, of any of thoſe of the <hi>Barbarous</hi> Nations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the two famous <hi>Carthaginians, Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> and <hi>Hannibal.</hi> What he did was great, and out of the uſual road; yet ſo little known, that we are oblig'd to be the larger in our Account of him: For he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:99884:88"/>
never ow'd his Succeſs to the greatneſs of his Army, or to any of the common cauſes of it; but always to that which ſeem'd his peculiar Talent, a moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Policy. His firſt Employment was in the Guards at <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his Court; but his Father, as the Reward of his eminent Courage and Conſtant Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to the King, had the Government of that part of <hi>Cilicia</hi> which lyes upon <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia,</hi> and is inhabited by the <hi>Leucoſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. Datames</hi> having a Command in the Army, firſt ſignaliz'd himſelf in the War againſt the <hi>Caduſians;</hi> in which there were many thouſands kill'd, and chiefly by his means; for which Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>Camiſſares</hi> likewiſe falling in the Battel, he ſucceeded him in the Province.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Autophradates</hi> being ſent by the King to reduce ſome to their obedience who had revolted, he behav'd himſelf with equal Gallantry; for by his manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a ſmall Party ſurpriz'd the Enemy in their Camp, and deſtroy'd them; the greateſt part of the Army doing no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice at all in the Action. After this, he was remov'd to higher Employments; for <hi>Thyus,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> (deſcended from that <hi>Pyloemenes</hi> which <hi>Homer</hi> ſays was ſlain by <hi>Patroclus</hi> in the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99884:88"/>
                  <hi>Trojan</hi> War) not ſufficiently complying with the King, <hi>Datames</hi> (who was his Couſin-German) was ſent with an Army to force his ſubmiſſion to the King's Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But he intending to uſe his utmoſt endeavours, to make his Relation ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his Duty upon eaſie terms, and not ſuſpecting any Treachery from a Friend, went to him without any Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants; Altho his Confidence put him in extream danger; for <hi>Thyus</hi> had reſolv'd upon a private Aſſaſination, <hi>Datames</hi> having intelligence of the deſign from his Mother, who was <hi>Thyus's</hi> Aunt, and underſtood his intentions, made his eſcape, and immediately proclaim'd the War; which he vigorouſly continued, tho he was deſerted by <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Lydia, Ionia,</hi> and all <hi>Phrygia;</hi> and made not only <hi>Thyus,</hi> but his Wife and Children too, his Captives.</p>
               <p>He made all the haſte imaginable, that the news of this Exploit might not get to the King before him, and got privately to Court, without any one's knowledg. The next day he ſhew'd his Captive, who was a vaſt black hairy Man, with a frightful and ghaſtly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, dreſs'd very richly in the Habit of a <hi>Perſian</hi> Nobleman; with a Golden
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:99884:89"/>
Collar, and all other Princely Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He himſelf appear'd meanly, like a Peaſant, in a Hunter's Head-piece, made of the Skins of ſeveral Beaſts; with a Club in one hand, and Toyls in the other; and brought him out in ſuch a manner as if he had been ſome cruel Monſter, juſt ſubdued. So unuſual a ſight drew a great many Spectators; one being accidentally there that knew <hi>Thyus,</hi> inform'd the King of it. But he at firſt ſuſpecting ſo ſtrange a ſtory, commanded <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> to go and bring him a certain relation of the thing; from whom, when he had receiv'd full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, he commanded him to be brought into his Preſence, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely pleas'd with the humour; but eſpecially, that ſo great a Prince ſhould ſo unexpectedly come into his hands. After he had for this nobly rewarded <hi>Datames,</hi> he ſent him to the Army which was then rais'd againſt <hi>Egypt,</hi> under <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd <hi>Tithrauſtes,</hi> and gave him a Command equal to theirs; and after <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> was recall'd, He was made Generaliſſimo. But whilſt he was haſtning the general Rendeſvouz of the Army, and preparing for his March to <hi>Egypt,</hi> he receiv'd an Expreſs from
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:99884:89"/>
the King, that he ſhould go againſt <hi>Aſpis,</hi> the Governor of <hi>Cataonia;</hi> a Country which lies above <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and borders upon <hi>Cappadocia.</hi> For <hi>Aſpis</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon his Woods and ſtrong Frontier-Towns, not only diſobey'd ſome of the Kings Commands, but rob'd his Carriages, and made incurſions on all about him. Tho <hi>Datames</hi> was at a great diſtance from <hi>Cataonia,</hi> and then in the management of greater Affairs, yet he yeilded to the King's pleaſure; and in order to the execution of it, ſet Sail only with a few, but very ſtout Men; ſuppoſing, (as indeed it afterwards hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd) that he could have more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over him with a ſmall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany upon ſurprize, then with a great Army after open defiance. Being arriv'd at <hi>Cilitia,</hi> he continu'd his Marches 'till he had paſs'd over Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> and was come to the end of his Journey. Enquiring for <hi>Aſpis,</hi> he underſtood that he was hunting near that place. The occaſion of <hi>Datames</hi>'s coming was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſuſpected; and therefore <hi>Aſpis</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately put the <hi>Piſidae,</hi> and others he had with him, in a poſture of defence. Upon notice of which, <hi>Datames</hi> muſter'd up his Men, and commanded them to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:99884:90"/>
follow him; and being mounted on an excellent Horſe, rid briskly up to the Enemy. But <hi>Aſpis</hi> perceiving the vigour of the firſt onſet, the leaſt endeavours of reſiſtance were diſcourag'd; he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſurrender'd himſelf; and was ſent in Chains to the King, by <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> whilſt theſe things were in agitation, recollecting, that he had call'd one of his beſt Commanders from a conſiderable Poſt, and ſent him upon a trivial employment; but thinking that perhaps he was not yet gone, diſpatch'd a Meſſenger to <hi>Ace,</hi> with orders that he ſhould by no means leave the Army. But the Command was ſuperſeded; for thoſe that guarded <hi>Aſpis</hi> were met upon the way. <hi>Datames</hi> having accompliſh'd his buſineſs with ſuch unexpected Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, was greater in the King's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour then ever; and became ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, that he was the Envy of the whole Court. For they perceiv'd, that his ſingle intereſt was greater then theirs in conjunction; and therefore all jointly conſpir'd his ruin. <hi>Pandates</hi> the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, who was his Confident, made him acquainted with all their deſigns, and told him by Letter what danger he
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99884:90"/>
was in, if any miſcarriage ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen during his Conduct in <hi>Egypt;</hi> That Kings took the Honour of great Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to themſelves, but always imputed ill ſucceſs to their Miniſters; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were eaſily inclin'd to diſgrace thoſe whom they thought the occaſion of it; That His condition was worſe then any others, becauſe it was the temper of the King, to hate thoſe moſt who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been his chief Favourites. Having receiv'd this news upon his coming back to the Army at <hi>Ace,</hi> and knowing the advice was not to be contemn'd, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to leave the King's Service, but did nothing that was inconſiſtent with his Truſt; for he left the Army under <hi>Mandrocles</hi> a <hi>Magneſian,</hi> went with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of his own Men into <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and ſiez'd <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> which lay next to it, without diſcovering his diſaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the King. After which he held a ſecret correſpondence with <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> got ſome men together, and plac'd them in the fortified Towns for the defence of the Garriſons. But it being Winter, the ſeaſon of the year hinder'd ſome of his deſigns.</p>
               <p>Hearing the <hi>Piſidae</hi> were preparing ſome Forces againſt him, he ſent his Son
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99884:91"/>
                  <hi>Ariſideus</hi> thither with an Army. The young General was kill'd in the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But his Father, concealing the loſs he had receiv'd, went with ſome more men into the Field, being willing to get to the Enemy before his Soldiers had the report of the Defeat; for he thought the news of his Son's Death would very much diſcourage them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arriv'd at the place he deſign'd, he ſo Encamp'd that he could neither be oppreſs'd with the numerous Forces of the Enemy, nor yet hinder'd from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any advantageous Aſſault. His Father-in-Law <hi>Mithrobarzanes,</hi> Captain of the Horſe, was then with him; but thinking their condition very deſperate, went over to the Enemy. Of which <hi>Datames</hi> having notice, he preſently conſider'd, that the noiſe of his being deſerted by ſo conſiderable a man might make the reſt revolt; and therefore gave out, that <hi>Mithrobarzanes</hi> was by his orders gone away like a Renegade, that he might be admitted by the Enemy, and ſo deſtroy them with leſs difficulty. That therefore they ought not to deliver him into their hands, but immediately to follow him; which if they did with reſolution, the <hi>Piſidae</hi> could make no
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:99884:91"/>
reſiſtance, for they would be ſlain both in their Camp and in the Field. The Deſign being approv'd of, he led out his Army, and purſued <hi>Mithrobarzanes;</hi> upon whoſe approach to the Enemy, <hi>Datames</hi> commanded his Standard to be ſet up. The <hi>Piſidae</hi> being in great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion at the ſuddenneſs of the buſineſs, ſuſpected the Renegades, and imagin'd they came with a treacherous deſign of doing the greater miſchief. Therefore they firſt fell upon them; which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing Accident put them in ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, that they were forc'd to fight with thoſe to whom they had fled, and aſſiſt thoſe whom they had deſerted; but being ſpar'd by neither, were all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently cut off. <hi>Datames</hi> afterwards falling upon the <hi>Piſidae,</hi> forc'd them to fly, kill'd many in the purſuit, and took poſſeſſion of their Camp. By this Stratagem he at once puniſh'd the Deſerters, and gain'd a Victory over his Enemies; and made that which was intended for his Ruin, the means of his Succeſs. And perhaps it was a Deſign ſo cunningly laid, and in ſo little time effected, that Hiſtory can ſhew nothing parallel to it.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding theſe great Exploits, <hi>Sciſmas</hi> his eldeſt Son left him, and gave
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99884:92"/>
the King an account of his defection. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> being troubled at the news, (for he knew he was to deal with a man of undaunted Courage, one who never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd any thing but what he dar'd ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to effect, and never attempted any thing but what he had ſufficiently conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd) ſent <hi>Autophradates</hi> into <hi>Cappadocia. Datames</hi> endeavour'd to poſſeſs himſelf of the Foreſt, which is the paſſage. to <hi>Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia;</hi> but not being able ſo ſuddenly to get his men together, he was oblig'd to take other meaſures; yet he choſe ſo commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious a place for his Camp, that the Enemy could neither encloſe him, nor paſs by him without being attacqu'd in ſeveral places; and was poſted ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly, that in any Encounter their Multitudes could do very little damage to his ſmall Company.</p>
               <p>Altho <hi>Autophradates</hi> was ſenſible of all this, yet he was reſolv'd rather to engage him, then either to continue long in that place, or go back with a great Army; for he had in the Field twenty thouſand Horſe, an hundred thouſand Foot, and three thouſand Slingers; which were the <hi>Cardaces,</hi> a people of the Leſſer <hi>Aſia;</hi> beſides theſe, eight thouſand out of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> ten out of <hi>Armenia,</hi> five from
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99884:92"/>
                  <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> ten from <hi>Phrygia,</hi> five from <hi>Lydia,</hi> about three thouſand of the <hi>Aſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dii</hi> and <hi>Piſidae,</hi> two from <hi>Cilicia,</hi> as many of the <hi>Caſpians,</hi> and three thouſand Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries, which he had out of <hi>Greece;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a conſiderable number of Light-Horſe. All <hi>Datames</hi>'s hopes of doing any thing againſt ſuch mighty Forces, were in himſelf, and the convenience of the place wherein he was Encamp'd; for he had not the twentieth part of the men which were brought by <hi>Autophradates.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs with theſe he ventur'd to give him Battel; and in it, with but the loſs of about a thouſand men, cut off ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral thouſands of His. In memory of which he erected a Trophy, the next day, in the place where they fought. After he had remov'd his Camp from thence, tho his Army was ever the leaſt, yet he was ſtill greateſt when the Fight was done; for he underſtood the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and always contriv'd, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhould be confin'd to ſuch narrow places, where he had no room to manage any conſiderable number of men. <hi>Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phradates</hi> finding the War prov'd more unſucceſsful to his Maſter then to <hi>Data<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi> ſolicited him to a Peace, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to reſtore him to the King's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:99884:93"/>
He accepted the Conditions, tho he did not think them real; and ſaid he intended to ſend his Ambaſſadors to <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> in order to an Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. And the War being thus ended, <hi>Autophradates</hi> went into <hi>Phrygia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the King hated <hi>Datames</hi> ſo impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably, that when he ſaw his deſtruction could not be accompliſh'd by any open Force, he endeavour'd by ſome ſecret Methods to take him off. But he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated ſeveral of their deſigns; of which the moſt remarkable was this: He had intelligence, that ſome about him, and ſuch as were reputed his Friends, had contriv'd his Death; this he thought, becauſe it came from his Enemies, was neither to be over-much credited, nor perfectly ſlighted; but being willing to ſee the reality of the thing, he went to the very place where he was told they intended the Aſſaſination; To one that exactly reſembl'd him for ſhape and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he likewiſe gave his Habit, and commanded him during the Journey to repreſent him, by riding in his place. He himſelf was Accouter'd like a Common Soldier, and Rid amongſt His Guards. And charg'd all the Company to obſerve his motions, and ſecond them. When
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:99884:93"/>
the Conſpirators ſaw the Company; they were deceiv'd by the place and dreſs, and aſſaulted the Counterfit; which when <hi>Datames</hi> perceiv'd, he preſently threw out his Darts, and the reſt (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Sign) doing ſo too, they were all kill'd upon the ſpot.</p>
               <p>Yet at laſt this ſagacious Man was over-reach'd by a project of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ariobarzanes;</hi> who aſſur'd the King of his Death, upon condition he might act as he pleas'd with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The liberty being granted, and the Promiſe (according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Perſians)</hi> confirm'd by the Hand, he pretended an open Defiance of the King, rais'd Forces, beſieg'd his Towns, and vext his Provinces; by Agents de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd a correſpondence with <hi>Datames,</hi> and after a Diſtribution amongſt his Soldiers, complemented him with a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of rich Spoils. By theſe Actions he perſwaded <hi>Datames,</hi> that he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd himſelf in an everlaſting Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with the King; but however, to prevent the leaſt ſuſpition of his deſigns, he neither deſir'd a Conference with him or an Enterview; but manag'd his falſe Friendſhip ſo well at diſtance, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould ſeem to be the foundation
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99884:94"/>
of it, but their common Hatred of the King.</p>
               <p>When he thought he had ſufficiently ſetled him in this opinion, he ſent him word, that it was neceſſary they ſhould prepare greater Forces, and engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in an Actual War with the King himſelf; and if he approv'd the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, that he would meet him at any place he ſhould chuſe, to conſult farther about it. The time and place being appointed; <hi>Mithridates,</hi> going thither ſome days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with one that was his Confident, hid ſeveral Swords, and nicely obſerv'd how they lay. When the day came which they had fix'd upon, they both ſent ſome Servants to view the place, and then met according to the agreement. After they had ſpent ſome time in the debate, and were parted, <hi>Mithridates</hi> (that he might not be at all ſuſpected) before he was got to his Company, return'd to the ſame place, and ſat down where he had buried one of the Daggers, as if he had deſign'd only to reſt himſelf. But having taken up the Weapon, and conceal'd it under his Clothes, he ſent for <hi>Datames,</hi> under pretence that he had forgotten ſome important matter; and told him, that as he paſs'd along he had
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:99884:94"/>
'ſpy'd a very convenient place for their Camp. <hi>Datames</hi> turning, and looking with ſome earneſtneſs upon the place which he ſhew'd him, was immediately ſtabb'd in the Back, and dy'd before any one could come up to his aſſiſtance. Thus he that had over-reach'd many by generous Stratagems, but none by any baſe Treachery, was at laſt deceiv'd and ruin'd by the plauſible pretences of Friendſhip.</p>

                  <hi>EPAMINONDAS</hi> the Son of <hi>Polymnius,</hi> was a <hi>Theban.</hi> But before we begin our account of him, it ſeems neceſſary to deſire the Readers, that they would not make an Eſtimate of other People's Manners by their own; nor ſuppoſe, that things of ſmall value with them, bear the ſame rate amongſt all the reſt of Mankind. Muſick (we know) according to our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents is below the Dignity of a Prince; to Dance, the mean Employ of Slaves;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:99884:95"/>
yet amongſt the <hi>Grecians</hi> theſe are Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Accompliſhments, of great repute. <hi>Epaminondas</hi>'s Character deſerves to have nothing omitted, that may conduce to the knowledg of ſo great a Man; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall in the firſt place diſcourſe of his <hi>Parentage,</hi> in the next of his <hi>Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> then of his <hi>Manners</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſition,</hi> (and if there be any thing elſe on thoſe heads worth relating); and in the laſt place, concerning his <hi>Actions;</hi> Theſe are the great concern of life, and are by moſt preferr'd before all the ſolitary Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of a lazy Virtue. His Father's name you have heard before. His Family was Gentile, yet ſuch as might receive, not give a luſtre.

His Tutor in Philoſophy was <hi>Lyſis</hi> the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentinian,</hi> of the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Sect; He was ſo great an Admirer of this old Man, that his reſerv'd ſevere Converſation pleas'd him better then the gay Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of his Equals; Neither would he
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:99884:96"/>
leave him, till he had ſo far outgone his Fellow-Pupils, that it was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent his Excellence in other Arts would be proportionate to his happy ſucceſs in theſe. If you give a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to our Cuſtoms, theſe things may ſeem mean and contemptible, and not proper Theams of Praiſe; yet were they anciently in <hi>Greece</hi> of as great concern as good Breeding could make them. After he was fifteen years old, he betook himſelf to the Academy, for the Exerciſes of the Body; where he did not ſo much aim at greatneſs of ſtrength, as nimbleneſs in motion; The firſt he knew might gain applauſe in a Ring, the other was of the greateſt uſe in War. Therefore he deſign'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſuch a perfection in Running and Wraſtling, as he might be able while he was ſtanding on his Feet to grapple and cloſe with his Enemy; <hi>but neglected the other tricks of theſe Exerciſes, which were perform'd by the Parties tugging and tumbling one another on the Ground.</hi> Theſe were his Recreations; Arms were his ſerious bus'neſs. This Strength of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy thus gain'd, was attended with a more numerous train of the Goods of the Mind. He was modeſt, prudent, grave in his
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:99884:96"/>
Behaviour, of great Addreſs, and none more wiſe in managing each juncto of time to the greateſt advantage. He was well Skill'd in the Art of War, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant in the Duties of it, and of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Courage; So ſevere a Lover of Truth, that he would not Lye in Jeſt; Chaſt, compaſſionate, and patient in an eminent degree; eaſily forgiving, not only the Injuries of the Multitude, but of his Friends; Above all things, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to conceal Secrets committed to him; <hi>which ſort of Silence is ſometimes of as great advantage as the clearest Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</hi> He thought the readieſt way to Learn was to Hear; therefore when he came to any place in which Debates were held, either in Politicks or Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, he never departed until the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was at an end. Poverty was ſo eaſie a thing to him, that Glory was the only advantage he made of the Commonwealth. In his Neceſſities he was perfidiouſly deſerted by his Friends; yet was his Kindneſs ſo conſtant to others in their Wants, that one would gueſs his Principle was, <hi>That Friends have all things in Common.</hi> Thus, when any of his Country-men were taken Captive, or any of his Acquaintance had a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:99884:97"/>
Marriagable, who could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd for want of Fortune, he call'd a Conſult of Friends, allotted to every one (according to the proportion of his Eſtate) what he ſhould give, and when the deſign'd ſum was made up, he would not himſelf receive it; but introduc'd the perſon who was to receive the benefit, to collect it, that he might know how much he ow'd to every one's kindneſs. He gave a brave experiment of his Integrity in the repulſe of <hi>Diomedon</hi> the <hi>Cyricenian,</hi> who at the requeſt of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had undertaken to corrupt <hi>Epaminondas;</hi> in purſuit of this deſign, he comes to <hi>Thebes</hi> with vaſt Sums of Gold, and with a Preſent of five Talents brings over to his Party <hi>Micythus,</hi> a young Man whom <hi>Epaminondas</hi> dearly lov'd. <hi>Micythus</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes himſelf to <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints him with the Gift he had receiv'd, and the reaſon of <hi>Diomedon</hi>'s coming; whereupon he ſent for <hi>Diomedon,</hi> and thus ſpeaks to him; <hi>There is no want of Money; for if the King deſires ſuch things as are for the Intereſt of</hi> Thebes, <hi>I am ready to comply with him without the Bribe of a Reward: But if they are of another nature, he has not Silver and Gold enough. For the Love of my Country weighs more with me, then all
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:99884:97"/>
the Riches of the Univerſe. That you, who did not know me, and thought me like your ſelf, made this Attempt upon my Virtue, is no wonder; and I forgive you: But haſte you hence. Such Temptations may prevail on others, tho they can't on me. And you,</hi> Micythus, <hi>reſtore him his Money; which if you do not preſently do, I will deliver you up into hands of Juſtice. Diomedon,</hi> dejected at the reſolute Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty of the Man, now only deſires, <hi>to return ſafely Home, and carry his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures along with him. You ſhall</hi> (replies <hi>Epaminondas), not for your ſake, but my own; leſt if your Money ſhould be taken from you, any one ſhould ſuſpect, That I accepted that as a Spoil, which I had before refus'd as a Gift; and did not ſo much contemn the Bribe, as hate the Obligations of it.</hi> Then he ask'd him, whither he would be convey'd; and <hi>Diomedon</hi> anſwering to <hi>Athens,</hi> he gave him a Guard to conduct him thither; and not content with this, he took care, by his Friend <hi>Chabrias</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> (whom we have mention'd before), that he ſhould ſecurely take Shipping there, I ſuppoſe this is a ſufficient teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his unſhaken Honeſty. We might produce a great many more of the like

nature, but we muſt deny our ſelves that liberty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe we deſign in this one Volume to comprehend the Lives of many Illuſtrious Perſons; upon each of whom other Writers before us have beſtow'd large Commentaries. He was the moſt eloquent of the <hi>Thebans;</hi> nor leſs acute in extemporary Repartee, than perſwaſive in continued Diſcourſes. One <hi>Meneclides</hi> was his profeſs'd Enemy, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways oppoſing him in the Government of the Commonwealth; He was a Man ready and bold in Diſcourſe; that is, he was a <hi>Theban;</hi> to which Nation Nature ſeems to have allotted more of Strength then Wit. When this Man found, that <hi>Epaminondas</hi>'s Conduct in Military Affairs gain'd him <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he began to adviſe the <hi>Thebans, To lay aſide the thoughts of War, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy themſelves in Peace.</hi> This he did, not out of any Love to his Country, but to ſtifle the occaſions of <hi>Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>'s Glory. To this <hi>Epaminondas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, <hi>War indeed is a diſmal Word; and 'tis the Sound alone that you make uſe of, to affright our Citizens from their interest. 'Tis Eaſe that you pretend, but Slavery is meant; for the Foundations of Peace are beſt lay'd by the Sword; and they that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99884:98"/>
propoſe to themſelves an undiſturb'd and flouriſhing Tranquility, muſt be well Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciplin'd in War. Therefore</hi> (O Thebans) <hi>would you raiſe your State above the reſt of</hi> Greece? <hi>This Glory is to be gain'd in Camps, not Schools of Exerciſe.</hi> At ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, when this ſame <hi>Meneclides</hi> objected to him, <hi>that he was never mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd, and had no Children;</hi> and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally inſiſted on this, as a great height of inſolence, <hi>that he durſt compare his own Actions with thoſe of Agamemnon's.</hi> He anſwer'd, <hi>Meneclides, do not object the want of a Wife; for I ſhould in that affair ſooner take any Man's advice than yours,</hi> (for <hi>Meneclides</hi> lay under the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of a very incontinent Fellow): <hi>But you are mistaken, if you think it my Ambition to reach</hi> Agamemnon's <hi>Glory; for he, with the Aſſistance of all</hi> Greece, <hi>ſcarcely at laſt, in ten years time, took one City; whereas I, on the other ſide, with the ſingle Forces of one City, and in one day, routed the</hi> Lacedaemonians, <hi>and deliver'd all</hi> Greece <hi>from Slavery.</hi> When he went to the Convention of the States of <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> to engage them in a League with the <hi>Thebans</hi> and <hi>Argives,</hi> he found there <hi>Calliſtratus</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> Ambaſſador, to oppoſe his deſigns, who was eſteem'd the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99884:99"/>
beſt Orator of his time; he very bitterly inveigh'd againſt the <hi>Thebans</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives,</hi> who were then Confederates; and amongſt the reſt of the Invectives, were theſe, <hi>That the</hi> Arcadians <hi>ſhould conſider what kind of Men both Cities had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, and from thence give a judgment of the reſt;</hi> Oreſtes <hi>and</hi> Alcmeon <hi>were</hi> Argives, <hi>and theſe wickedly murder'd their Mother;</hi> O'dippus <hi>was born at</hi> Thebes, <hi>who when he had Kill'd his Father, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd his Mother, and had Children by her.</hi> When <hi>Epaminondas</hi> had anſwer'd the reſt of his Speech, he came at laſt to his Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſaid, <hi>He wonder'd at the Folly of the</hi> Athenian <hi>Orator, who did not conſider, That theſe Men were born Innocent, but when they had contracted Wickedneſs enough to be Expell'd their own Country, were yet thought good enough to be Receiv'd and Careſs'd at Athens.</hi> But then did his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence moſt eminently appear, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Battel of <hi>Leuctra,</hi> all the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the Confederates were met at <hi>Sparta:</hi> Here, in this great Aſſembly, he ſo clearly ſet forth the Tyranny of the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> that his Diſcourſe did as much ſhake the Greatneſs of that State as the Battel at <hi>Leuctra;</hi> for then it was (which appear'd afterwards) that they
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99884:99"/>
were depriv'd of the Aſſiſtance of their Allies. That he was a very forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Man, and thought it unlawful to be angry at, or revenge, the Injuries of his Country, take the following in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: When Envy had ſo far work'd him out of the Affections of his Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, that they would not chuſe him General, but ſupply'd that Truſt with a very unskilful Commander, whoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence led their Forces into ſuch Streights that they were enclos'd by their Enemies, and now near Ruin; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reflect upon, and wiſh for, the good Conduct of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> who was at this time a Common Soldier in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; To him they apply themſelves for Aſſiſtance; who taking no notice of their Ingratitude, rais'd the Enemy's Leaguer, and ſecur'd a ſafe Retreat to the Army. Such Actions as theſe he often perform'd; but that which bears a greater luſtre then any of the reſt, is his brave deportment when he led the Army into <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> againſt the <hi>Lacedaemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> in which Expedition he had two Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues, one of which was <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> a very valiant Man; who falling under the Envy of ſome Crimes that were faſten'd upon him by his adverſaries, all their Commands
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99884:100"/>
were taken from them, and new Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors appointed to ſucceed. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> refus'd to obey this Act of State, and perſwaded his Collegues to do the like; and ſo they proceeded in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that War. The reaſon upon which <hi>Epominandas</hi> acted was this, <hi>He foreſaw (if he comply'd) the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Folly of the deſign'd Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders would ruin the Army:</hi> The Law was, <hi>That it ſhould be Death for any man to retain his Command longer than was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by his Commiſſion.</hi> This <hi>Epaminondas</hi> well underſtood, and the danger of it; but did not think fit, <hi>That the Law which was made for the Preſervation of the Commonwealth ſhould be turn'd to its Ruine;</hi> therefore he durſt continue his Command four months longer then the the People had Enacted. After their return home, his Collegues being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach'd upon this Crime, he permitted them to caſt the whole guilt upon him, and to plead, <hi>that it was wholly thro his means they had not obey'd the Orders of the State.</hi> Which Plea brought them clearly off; but none could believe <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas</hi> would make any Reply, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Crime being plain, they could not fancy what Defence could be made
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99884:100"/>
in the Caſe. He makes his Appearance, pleads Guilty to his Inditement, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes all that his Colleagues had laid to his Charge; and tells them, that he was very ready to undergo the puniſhment the Law appointed; but now, being a Dying Man, deſir'd this one favour of them, that this Inſcription might be wrote on his Tomb, <hi>Epaminondas was put to Death by the</hi> Thebans, <hi>becauſe at</hi> Leuctra <hi>he forc'd them to overcome the</hi> Lacedaemonians; <hi>whom, before he was General, not a Man of the whole Country of</hi> Boeotia <hi>had the Courage to look upon in the Field; and that in one Battel he not only rais'd</hi> Thebes <hi>from out of its Ruins, but restor'd all</hi> Greece <hi>its Liberty; and ſo far chang'd the Scene of Affairs, that the</hi> Thebans <hi>beſieg'd</hi> Sparta, <hi>and the</hi> Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonian <hi>Pride was brought ſo low as to be contented</hi> not to be Slaves; <hi>Neither, tho commanded, would he lay down his Arms 'till he had Fortify'd</hi> Meſſena, <hi>and by that means lay'd a perpetual Bridle upon the proud City of Sparta.</hi> This Speech rais'd Admiration, Laughter, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe in the whole Aſſembly; ſo that not one of the Judges durſt give their Verdict. And thus he came off this Trial for his Life with great Reputation.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:99884:101"/>
The laſt time he was General, was at <hi>Mantinea;</hi> where, preſſing too boldly amongſt the Enemies, they ſoon appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the advantage, and (knowing his Death would be the ſafety of their Country) turn'd their whole Force upon him, encompaſs'd him, and would not leave the purſuit, 'till after a great Slaughter on both ſides, and a brave reſiſtance made by <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> they ſaw him (wounded with a Dart) fall to the ground. This ſad accident did at firſt ſomewhat diſcourage the <hi>Boeoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> but recollecting themſelves, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge ſucceeded Grief, and they gave not over till they had utterly routed the Enemy. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf mortally wounded, and knowing, that ſhould the Shaft be pull'd out of his Head he muſt immediately dye, kept it in ſo long 'till 'twas told him his Army had got the Victory; <hi>Then</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I have liv'd long enough, for I ſhall dye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquer'd.</hi> So the Iron being drawn out, he immediately expir'd. He was never Marry'd; for which <hi>Pelopidas</hi> (who had a very Debauch'd Son) thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving him, <hi>that he took but little Care of the Commonwealth, who would not leave Children behind him to ſupport it after his
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:99884:101"/>
Death.</hi> He replies, <hi>Conſider whether you do not perform worſe Offices to it, in leaving ſo leud an Heir, who may help to deſtroy, but cannot maintain a Commonwealth: But as for me, I cannot want Iſſue; the</hi> Leuctrian <hi>Victory is my Offspring, which will not only ſurvive me, but will immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talize my Name.</hi> At the time that the Exiles, under the Conduct of <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> ſurpriz'd <hi>Thebes,</hi> and drove the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi> Garriſon out of the Caſtle, <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas</hi> (ſo long as his own Citizens were engag'd in the Fight) kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at home, and forbore all Action. The reaſon of which proceeding was, that he could not in Honour join with theſe Betrayers of their Country, nor would he appear in Arms againſt them, becauſe he would not ſtain himſelf with the Blood of his Country-men; for he well knew, <hi>That Victory in a Civil War was at best but an unfortunate Prize.</hi> But this ſame Man, as ſoon as the Battel was drawn off as far as the <hi>Cadmea,</hi> and the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> only concern'd, thruſt himſelf into the formoſt Rank. I think I ſhall have ſaid enough of the Virtues and Actions of this great Man, if I add but this one thing, which none can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, That before <hi>Epaminondas's</hi> Birth,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:99884:102"/>
and after his Death, <hi>Thebes</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſubject to a Foreign Power; but on the contrary, while he Preſided in that Commonwealth, it became the Leading State of <hi>Greece.</hi> Whence we may draw this concluſion, <hi>That the Bravery of one Great Man does more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a State than the whole Maſs of People.</hi>

                  <hi>PELOPID AS,</hi> the <hi>Theban,</hi> is more famous in Hiſtory then common Talk; of whoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues I cannot tell in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I ſhall treat; for ſhould I give a full deſcriptionof of his Actions, 'tis juſtly to be fear'd, that I ſhould rather ſeem to write a Hiſtory than his Life; and if I ſhould only touch upon the heads, that then I ſhould cloud his Reputation; and thoſe who are unacquainted with the <hi>Greek</hi> Hiſtories, would not perceive
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:99884:103"/>
how great a Man he was: Therefore, to the beſt of my power to prevent both, I ſhall provide againſt the ſatiety as well as ignorance of my Readers. <hi>Phaebidas</hi> the <hi>Spartan,</hi> as he led his Army thro <hi>Thebes</hi> towards <hi>Olynthus,</hi> at the inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome few <hi>Thebans</hi> (who, that they might the more eaſily check the contrary Faction, ſided with the <hi>Spartan</hi> intereſt) ſurpriz'd the Citadel <hi>Cadmea;</hi> and this he did, not by any order from the State, but upon his own head; for which the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> took away his Commiſſion, and ſet a Fine upon him; but refus'd to ſurrender the Caſtle to the <hi>Thebans;</hi> concluding it more politick, now diſtaſte was once given, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue a Guard upon them, then permit them to be free. For after the <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſian</hi> War, and the <hi>Athenians</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, they ſaw the <hi>Thebans</hi> only ſtand in competition, and dare to oppoſe their Empire. Upon this account they put their Friends in power; and as for the Heads of the contrary Faction, ſome they Butcher'd, and ſome they Baniſh'd; amongſt which, this <hi>Pelopidas</hi> (whom I mention'd in the beginning) was an Exile. Almoſt all theſe fled to <hi>Athens,</hi> not to live lazily, and at eaſe; but as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:99884:103"/>
the neareſt and moſt convenient ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whence on the firſt opportunity they might endeavour the freedom of their Country: And therefore as ſoon as time appear'd, upon agreement with their friends at <hi>Thebes,</hi> they made choice of that day in which the Governors us'd to meet at a publick Banquet, to deſtroy their Enemies, and free the City: Great Actions are often perform'd with no great force; but certainly never before from ſo mean a beginning as this, was ſo great an Empire overthrown: For not above twelve of the baniſh'd Youth undertook the Entepriſe, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an hundred would joyn with them in ſo dangerous an Attempt; and yet by this deſpicable number was the Power of the <hi>Spartans</hi> Ruin'd: for theſe did not ſo much Attempt the contrary Faction in <hi>Thebes,</hi> as the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> the then Lords of <hi>Greece;</hi> and whoſe Empire, firſt wounded by this Action, was a little while after in the Battel of <hi>Leuctra,</hi> brought to the laſt gaſp: Now theſe twelve, <hi>Pelopidas</hi> their Leader, leaving <hi>Athens</hi> in the day-time, that about the dusk of the Evening they might reach <hi>Thebes,</hi> to prevent ſuſpition they put themſelves in a Country dreſs, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:99884:104"/>
like Hunters, with Hounds, Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-poles and Nets; and entring the City at the very nick of time, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſht themſelves at <hi>Charon's</hi> Houſe, by whoſe appointment the day for the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was ſet. And here I crave leave to break my ſtory with a ſhort Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, To what great Calamities doth ſupine ſecurity expoſe! For the <hi>Theban</hi> Magiſtrates were quickly inform'd, that the Exiles were in Town; but being eager on their Entertainment, they ſlighted the diſcovery ſo much, that they would not trouble themſelves to examine a matter of ſo great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Beſides, which is a clearer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of their madneſs, a Letter was brought from <hi>Archias</hi> the chief Prieſt of <hi>Athens,</hi> to <hi>Archias</hi> the cheif Magiſtrate of <hi>Thebes,</hi> which made a full diſcovery of the Plot: This being delivered him while he was at Table, without opening it, he clapt it under his Cuſhion, with theſe words, <hi>I adjourn Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs till to morrow.</hi> In the dead of the night, when they were well drunk, the Exiles, under the Conduct of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopidas,</hi> diſpatcht them all: And that work once over, and the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple call'd in to Liberty and Arms, many
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99884:104"/>
from the Country as well as Town came in to their Aſſiſtance. They beat the <hi>Spartan</hi> Garriſon out of the Caſtle, freed their Country, and as for thoſe who entic'd <hi>Phaebidas</hi> to Surprize the <hi>Cadmea,</hi> ſome they Executed, and ſome they Baniſh'd. All this unquiet time, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> (as I hinted in his Life) whilſt the Citizens only quarrel'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, never ſtir'd; and therefore the freeing of <hi>Thebes</hi> is the peculiar Glory of <hi>Pelopidas.</hi> In almoſt all other Exploits <hi>Epaminondas</hi> had a ſhare; for in the Battel at <hi>Leuctra, Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas</hi> was General, and <hi>Pelopidas</hi> Captain of a Select Band, which firſt broke the Main Body of the <hi>Spartans;</hi> and in all Enterpriſes he made one. Thus when <hi>Sparta</hi> was ſtorm'd, he Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one Wing; and that the old <hi>Meſse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> might quickly recover their own Country, He himſelf went an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador to the <hi>Perſian.</hi> In ſhort, he was the other Man at <hi>Thebes;</hi> tho but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, yet ſo as to be next <hi>Epaminondas.</hi> He had alſo croſs fortune to Encounter, for firſt (as I have already mention'd) he liv'd in Baniſhment; and when he deſign'd to bring <hi>Theſsaly</hi> under the <hi>Theban</hi> Power, and thought the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99884:105"/>
of an Ambaſſador, which all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hold Sacred, was a ſufficient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; He and <hi>Iſmenias</hi> were ſeiz'd by <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Pherean</hi> Tyrant, and clapt in Chains. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> Warr'd on <hi>Alexander,</hi> and releiv'd him; but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after that could he be Friends with him that had offer'd the affront; and therefore he perſwaded the <hi>Thebans,</hi> to undertake the Protection of <hi>Theſsaly,</hi> and expel the Tyrants: He being cheif Commander in that Expedition, and having led his Forces into <hi>Theſsaly,</hi> as ſoon as ever he came in ſight of the Enemy, haſted to a Battel; In which Fight when he ſaw <hi>Alexander,</hi> fir'd with rage, he ſpur'd his Horſe towards him, and advancing a great way before His Soldiers, was ſhot throw: This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in his ſecond Victory, for the Tyrants Forces were already routed: For this Action, all the Cities of <hi>Theſsaly</hi> Honoured dead <hi>Pelopidas</hi> with Golden Crowns, and Brazen Statues; and gave his Children a conſiderable peice of Land.</p>

                  <hi>AGESILAUS</hi> of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> is a perſon highly applauded by the greater part of Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, particularly by <hi>Xenophon,</hi> Scholar of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who treats him with a ſingular reſpect. At firſt he ſtood in Competition for the Crown with <hi>Leoty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chides,</hi> his Brother <hi>Agis</hi>'s Son. It was a receiv'd Cuſtom amongſt the <hi>Spartans,</hi> to Dignifie two Perſons at a

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:99884:106"/>
own Territories; holding it a Maxim of good Policy, rather to remove a War into an Enemy's Country than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain it at home: beſides, the noiſe of <note n="*" place="margin">At that time King of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>'s Arms had already reach'd <hi>Greece;</hi> to invade which, he had E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quip'd a well furniſht Fleet, and ſet a Potent Land Army on foot; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent him, <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> as ſoon as he had got his Forces in a readineſs, enters <hi>Aſia</hi> with ſuch an incredible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, that his unexpected preſence anticipated the Fame of his coming; and that King's Lieutenants found him ſet down in the midſt of their Country before they had any notice of his deſign, to their great aſtoniſhment and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they not being in a poſture to make any defence. The news of ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a Gueſt could not long be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd from the ears of <hi>Tiſſaphernes, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi>'s Viceroy there, who upon the firſt Advertiſement of it, politickly deſires a Truce with the <hi>Spartans,</hi> under pretence of his friendly Interpoſition, to accommodate matters amicably and fairly betwixt both parties; but really for nothing elſe, but to gain time to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Forces. However it was, a Truce was agreed upon for three months; the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99884:107"/>
two Generals binding themſelves with a ſolemn Oath to obſerve it. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly none was ever more punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obſerv'd by <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> and leſs by <hi>Tiſſaphernes,</hi> who improv'd the time in making preparation for War. This the generous <hi>Spartan</hi> knew very well; but yet could not be induc'd to violate his Oath and make a breach, ſaying, <q>That he ſhould be the greateſt Gainer at length, for <hi>Tiſſaphernes</hi> by his Perjury muſt nceeſſarily expoſe himſelf and his undertakings to the juſt indignation of the Gods and Men: But that he by his Religious obſervance ſhould gain both Reputation and ſtrength to his Party; ſince the Gods are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways more propitious to, and all wiſe Men will the rather favour and wiſh well to thoſe, who put a value upon what they ſay, and are true to the Truſt which is repos'd in them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Truce expir'd, <hi>Tiſſaphernes</hi> draws down his Forces into <hi>Caria,</hi> partly to ſecure his own Poſſeſſions there, and becauſe that Country being of all the Richeſt, would in all probability be the object of the Enemies firſt Attempt. But he was miſtaken in his conjecture, for <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſuddenly wheels about into

                  <hi>Phrygia,</hi> which he overran with ſuch celerity, that he had depopulated the whole Country before <hi>Tiſſaphernes</hi> had advanc'd one foot forward to its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
               <p>Having here gratified his Soldiers with the Spoils of the place, he brought them back to their Winter Quarters at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where he ſet the <hi>Artiſans</hi> on work to prepare and furniſh him with all ſorts of Arms; and thoſe of his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers who were induſtrious to fit and Accoutre themſelves therewith, he (for the encouragement of others) oblig'd with ſome ſpecial Reward or Mark of his Favour; as likewiſe every one who in their daily Military Exerciſes particularly Signaliz'd himſelf above the reſt; by which means he effected, that in a few days he had the beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and the beſt Diſciplin'd Army in the World.

The <hi>Aſians</hi> were much ſtronger in Horſe, and therefore the wary <hi>Spartans</hi> declin'd all opportunities of engageing in open Campaign, and made choice of places the difficulty of which render'd the Enemy's Horſe of little or no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to them; by which policy he always remained abſolute Conqueror in <hi>Aſia,</hi> tho much inferior in Power; bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancing the inequality of Number with the excellency of his Conduct.</p>
               <p>But whilſt he was conſulting to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his Victories into the very bowels of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and to make the <hi>Sultan</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſenſible of the heavy ſtroke of his Arms, he receives an Expreſs from the

                  <hi>Ephori</hi> of <hi>Sparta,</hi> commanding his ſpeedy return thither; the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Baeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> having denounced open War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that State. And here we have a fair opportunity of diſcovering the excellent Piety as well as Fortitude of <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> who when he was at the Head of a Victorious Army, and might in deſpite of the World have put himſelf in poſſeſſion of the whole Empire of <hi>Perſia,</hi> did yet notwithſtanding ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous a proſpect, ſubmit to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the abſent Magiſtrates with ſo much readineſs and condeſcention, as if he had wore the character of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Commoner in <hi>Sparta</hi> rather than of ſo great a Prince. A rare example, worthy of the beſt of Emperors! <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilaus,</hi> the Incomparable <hi>Ageſilaus!</hi> to the ſcorn and Contempt of the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious World, chooſes rather to be Maſter of a good Reputation then of the moſt flouriſhing Empire; rather to Command the Affections of his Country then to be Lord of <hi>Aſia.</hi> Accordingly he is reſolv'd, and in purſuance of this ſo generous a reſolution, uſes ſuch Expedition, that he paſſes the <hi>Helleſpont</hi> with his whole Army in thirty days, which <hi>Xerxes</hi> could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh under a whole year.

                  <hi>Minerva's</hi> Temple, and he was ask'd, what he would be pleas'd to determine concerning them, he ſtrictly forbid any violence to be offer'd to them; tho he might juſtly have Sacrific'd them as proper Victims to his deep Reſentments, and to that Noble Blood which he Himſelf had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in the Quarrel, having receiv'd ſome conſiderable wounds in the Fight. But his Religious reſpect towards the Sacred Temples did not only evidence it ſelf in <hi>Greece,</hi> but in <hi>Aſia</hi> too, where he expreſs'd the like concern to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Sacred Altar and the Images of the Gods from violence and Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and he was often obſerv'd to ſay; <q>That in his opinion he was equally
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:99884:109"/>
Sacrilegious who offer'd violence to the Altar or the Votary at the Altar, and that in effect he was the ſame Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal who was an Enemy to the Sacred place, or the Religion of the place.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Corinth</hi> was the chief Seat of Action, from whence this took the Denomination of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> War. Here albeit in one Engagement he had left 10000 of his Enemies breathleſs upon the ground, and had ſo far weak|'ned the Enemies Forces that in all Mens opinion they were perfectly broken, and incapacitated ever to Rally again; yet the Generous <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> no leſs a Maſter of himſelf then the Enemy, was ſo far from entertaining himſelf with any Inſolent Conceits of his own Atcheiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that with a noble Compaſsion he deplored the unhappy State of <hi>Greece,</hi> which through its own diviſions ſhould loſe the Lives of ſo many brave Men; whoſe Valour, if it had been plac'd on a right level, and directed accordingly, would inevitably have prov'd the Ruin of <hi>Perſia.</hi> After this, having pent up the Enemy within the Walls of <hi>Corinth,</hi> he was advis'd to lay cloſe Siege to that place; but Generouſly reply'd, <q>That it was beneath the Prudence of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:99884:110"/>
ſo to do, for altho he knew very well how to reduce a Criminal to a ſenſe of his Duty, yet he did not think the Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> proper objects of his Valour, for whilſt <hi>Greece</hi> fought againſt <hi>Greece,</hi> and deſtroy'd its own Members, whoſe concern againſt the Common Enemy the <hi>Barbarian</hi> was one and the ſame, every Member, which by this means was Rent and Torn off, was loſt to the whole Body, whoſe Strength was thereby impair'd, and it Incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citated to Reſiſt the Attempts of the Enemy, who would improve the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their Diviſions to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time happen'd that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Battel at <hi>Leuctra,</hi> fatal to the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> whither <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> as if he had been Conſcious of the Event, could not by any Art be perſwaded to go; but afterwards, when <hi>Epaminondas</hi> had Inveſted the City <hi>Sparta</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Thucydides</hi> in his Proem ſays, that the Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> had no Walls, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Spartan</hi> Tyrants, diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtrength of their Arms, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs'd <hi>Sparta</hi> with a ſtrong Wall. <hi>Juſtin lib.</hi> 14.</note>, it being at that time naked, and not defended with any Wall; <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> behav'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſo much Gallantry and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in all Mens opinion, if <hi>Sparta</hi> had wanted her <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> ſhe had not long been <hi>Sparta.</hi> One remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance there was, wherein his expedite
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:99884:110"/>
and ſeaſonable Counſel diſcover'd it ſelf to the advantage of all. For when ſome raſh young Men, terrified with the report of the <hi>Thebans</hi> approach, had taken up a Reſolution to paſs over to them, and in order thereto had poſſeſs'd themſelves of a Poſt without the City, <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> foreſeeing the ill conſequence and example of it, if any of his Men ſhould be known to go over to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, <q>He cunningly joyns himſelf with them, commends their choice of that place where they were Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and tells them, that he himſelf had deſign'd the ſame before, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he would be their Leader, and the Companion of their Fortunes.</q> They, caught with this Stratagem, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently return'd to their Allegiance, and having ſome of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> his Followers joyn'd with them, lay aſide all thoughts of Surrendring the place; for their numbers being augmented with Men of good Experience and Conduct, they durſt not embrace any Treacherous deſign, and deſiſted the more willingly becauſe they thought that their Treaſon was not yet diſcover'd.</p>
               <p>After the Battel of <hi>Leuctra, Sparta</hi> could never recover it ſelf, or regain
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:99884:111"/>
its priſtine Majeſty and Power, yet <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> bravely bore up under all For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and never wanted a helping hand to Sublevate the ſinking State. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, when the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> were one time in great want for Money, he by Protecting thoſe who had been defective in their Duty, and had incurr'd the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Laws, obtein'd great ſums of Money from them, all which he frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſtow'd upon the Public. And this was more ſignally remarkable in him, that of all the Rich Preſents which were given him by Kings, Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or Cities which he had oblig'd, he never converted any to his own private uſe; neither did he ever deviate from the laudable Frugality and Thrift of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> his Diet was homely, his Apparel plain, his Lodging not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with the novel Bravery of the Times, but the ſame with that of <hi>Euryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenes</hi> the Founder of his Family; into which, if you ſhould enter, you would find no proviſion for Luſt, none for Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury; but Patience was the Ornament of it, Abſtinence its beſt Furniture, with theſe it abounded, but in other things it was not diſtinguiſhed from the Houſe of a poor Man or private Perſon.</p>

But Nature was not more indulgent to this Great Perſon in beſtowing upon him ſo many Excellent Qualities of Mind, then She was niggardly in diſpenſing the Graces of his Body; for he was low of Stature, and lame of one Foot; which latter defect made him appear ſomething deform'd; and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that beheld his face and the outward frame of his Body, ſlighted and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him; but thoſe that were acquainted with the inward Accompliſhments of his Mind, could never admire him enough.

                  <hi>EUMENES</hi> was a Native of <hi>Cardia;</hi> and ſo eminent for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Courage, that had his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or Succeſs been in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree equal to it, he had not, 'tis true, been really Greater then he was (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we meaſure the Greatneſs of an Hero by his inward Virtue, and not by any outward circumſtances of Fortune) but ſtill he had been more Honourable and Illuſtrious, and Fame had render'd him more conſiderable in the Eye of of the World. It was his unhappineſs
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:99884:113"/>
to be born in an Age wherein the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians</hi> flouriſh'd, and were at that heighth of Renown, as to eclipſe his Merit; neither was it any ſmall matter of Reproach and Detraction to him (who liv'd conſtantly amongſt them) to be ignominiouſly upbraided with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of a Forreigner, and a Man deſcended of a mean Stock; and yet he Himſelf was the Chief of the Family he ſprung from. So that, upon theſe reaſons, they envy'd him the Glory of Precedence; and yet were forc'd to be content and ſubmit to it: For he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd them all, in the Qualifications of a Statesman, in Care, Induſtry, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; in Subtilty of Contrivance, and Quickneſs of Invention. Theſe Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments recommended him early to the Acquaintance of King <hi>Philip;</hi> which in a very ſhort time he improv'd into a moſt intimate Familiarity and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; for as young as he was, there appear'd ſuch a Genius, and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Spirit, as promis'd much future Greatneſs. So that the King Conſtituted him his Secretary; which is an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of greater Reputation and Honour amongſt the <hi>Grecians</hi> than it is with the <hi>Romans;</hi> for we juſtly eſteem Perſons of that Character, as they really are,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:99884:113"/>
to be only Mercenary Scribes, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd for Gain. But, on the contrary, no Man was ever in <hi>Greece</hi> advanc'd to the Dignity of that Station, but ſuch as were born of honeſt Parents, were of approv'd Integrity, and had Abilities fit for the Service; and the reaſon is, becauſe their Office gives them Acceſs to Princes, makes them neceſſarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with great Intrigues, and the ſecret Meaſures and Reſolutions of all their Councils. He enjoy'd this Honour, and place in his Affection, during the laſt ſeven years of King <hi>Philip</hi>'s Reign, and (after his Death) was continued in the ſame Character under <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great for thirteen more; and at laſt was preferr'd to Command that Wing of the Horſe which was call'd the <hi>SOCIAL WING,</hi> from the Confederacy of the Allies that Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted it. In ſhort, he was Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor to both theſe Princes, and entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſole management of their Buſineſs, and all matters of Importance.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> was dead at <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> his Provinces came to be diſtributed equally to the ſeveral Officers who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd his Favour; it was <hi>Perdiccas</hi>'s Fortune (ſince <hi>Craterus</hi> and <hi>Antipater,</hi> tho more in eſteem with <hi>Alexander,</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:99884:114"/>
were abſent at this Delegation; and <hi>Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phestion,</hi> whom <hi>Alexander</hi> lov'd as paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately as himſelf, was dead alſo) to have the Command or Superintendency of the Whole lodg'd in his hands; and this was conjectur'd by the Ring that <hi>Alexander</hi> (when he lay ſpeechleſs) took from his Finger and gave, as a peculiar inſtance of his kindneſs; inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating by this Pledg, that he nominated him Protector of the Empire, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted the Government of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to his Conduct, whilſt his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were in their Minority, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd under his Guardianſhip. In this Diſtribution of Provinces, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> fell to <hi>Eumenes</hi>'s ſhare, or rather was Aſſign'd to him; and the Title only of Lieutenant conferr'd upon him, the Country at that time being actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in poſſeſſion of the Enemy. It was the policy of <hi>Perdiccas</hi> to make this Man his Friend, and gain him to his intereſt, which he endeavour'd to accompliſh by all the endearments imaginable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew him induſtrious in the Employment of War, and unalterably true to the Principle of his firſt Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; preſuming with much reaſon and confidence, that if he could move him
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:99884:114"/>
to eſpouſe his cauſe, his ſervice would be more than ordinarily inſtrumental to bring about thoſe great Affairs which he had then in hand; for he intended (that which almoſt all Men in Empire propoſe to themſelves) an Univerſal Monarchy, and to graſp all Power in his hands. Neither was he ſingle and alone in this deſign upon the Soveraignty of the World; for the ſame luſt of Power equally ſpread it ſelf, and run throw all the Governors of <hi>Alexander's</hi> Provinces; and accordingly we find <hi>Leonatus</hi> affecting the Command of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi> and Attempting to inveſt himſelf in the Government of that Province; and in order thereunto, plying <hi>Eumenes</hi> with the bait of Preferment, and propoſals of Honor to deſert <hi>Perdiccas</hi> and make a ſtrict League and Allyance with him; and when his arguments and promiſes were ineffectual to corrupt his Honeſty, or ſeduce him from the Friendſhip he bore <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> he treacherouſly ſought his Death, and had certainly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd it, but that <hi>Eumenes</hi> privately made his eſcape by night, and ſo avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the danger.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, whilſt theſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Deſigns were forming, there
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:99884:115"/>
ſeem'd to be lay'd the Foundation of thoſe enſuing Wars, which (after <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> Death) rag'd even to the Exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſeveral Parties in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt; and all of them (as one Man) join'd themſelves in a Confederacy, to ſuppreſs <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> and prevent his growing Greatneſs. Now, tho <hi>Eumenes</hi> was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the danger of his Friend, and knew that he was unable to ſtem the Tyde, or with his ſingle Forces over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power that formidable and united Body of Men, that were rais'd againſt him, yet he would not deſert him in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, but was more mindful of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, than the conſideration of his own ſafety; <hi>Perdiccas</hi> had put him in a place of Truſt, and Conſtituted him Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of that part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which lyes betwixt Mount <hi>Taurus</hi> and the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> and fixt him commodiouſly at that Poſt, for the conveniency of ſtopping the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropaeans,</hi> and keeping them from falling in upon the Rear, whilſt he in the mean time undertook an Expedition into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and deſign'd to encounter <hi>Ptolemy.</hi> And yet <hi>Eumenes</hi> was left in no good condition to Fight, for the Troops he had with him were not conſiderable ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Number or Courage, being for
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:99884:115"/>
the moſt part raw, and unexperienc'd, ignorant of all Diſcipline, and rais'd ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily from the Refuſe of the People; So that when <hi>Craterus</hi> and <hi>Antipater</hi> (Men of Renown and Terror in the Art of War) were ſaid to have paſs'd the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſpont,</hi> and advancing towards him with an Army of old <hi>Macedonian</hi> Soldiers (where by the way I muſt tell you, that theſe <hi>Macedonian</hi> Soldiers were thought as terrible in the Trade of War, as the <hi>Romans</hi> are now with us; for thoſe are ever counted the beſt Soldiers, that are levy'd from that Country which is the Seat of the Empire) <hi>Eumenes</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that if his Men ſhould know the Power and Strength of the Enemy, and againſt whom they were drawn out to Fight, they would be ſo far from going chearfully upon the Expedition, that they would drop down dead with the news; It was his care therefore to preſerve them in ignorance of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and to lead them through unknown and by-roads, where no certain or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Intelligence could poſſibly come to diſabuſe them; and to bear them in hand, that their Arms were to be employ'd againſt the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> to revenge the inſolence of a ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:99884:116"/>
that had offer'd Affronts and acts of Hoſtility to their Country: Acting therefore by theſe meaſures of ſecreſy, he had Marſhall'd and diſpos'd his Army in the beſt Array in the World for the Engagement, and had quite ended the Battle, before ever the Soldiers knew their Adverſaries, or againſt whom they drew their Swords; and yet it is to be confeſs'd, that this overthrow is to be aſcribed to another reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous choice he made of the ground, wherein his Horſe alone (which was the ſtrength of his Army) might bear the On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet and Attaque of the Enemy, and He not obliged to expoſe his Infantry to the Shock, which was very inconſiderable:</p>
               <p>In this ſmart Conflict, which laſted almoſt till night, <hi>Craterus</hi> the General, and <hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> who had the ſecond place of Command in the Field, were both ſlain: <hi>Eumenes</hi> engaged Perſonally in the Fight with <hi>Neoptolemus;</hi> and ſo violent was their hatred and animoſity to each other, that when their Grapling had diſlodg'd the Riders from their Horſes, and thrown them both to the Ground, they could not be diſengag'd from their hold, or parted by any thing but the death of one of the Combatants;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:99884:116"/>
ſo that they ſeem to have bore an internal malice, and to have wag'd War principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their Minds, and made their Bodies only ſeconds and Inſtruments in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. In this Conflict <hi>Eumenes</hi> receiv'd ſome ſmall Wounds, but they were not ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous as to induce him, for his Cure, to ſound a Retreat and leave the Field, but rather animated him to a freſh Purſuit, and a more vigorous Slaughter of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. So that when he had entirely rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Horſe, ſlain <hi>Craterus,</hi> and taken a vaſt number of Priſoners (of the beſt Rank and Quality in the Army), the Foot ſeeing themſelves deſtitute of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and lodg'd in ſuch narrow places, where 'twas impoſſible for them to make their eſcape with ſafety, ſurrender'd themſelves upon Diſcretion, and pray'd for Quarter. They no ſooner obtain'd this Grant of their Lives from <hi>Eumenes,</hi> but treacherouſly, upon the firſt opportunity broke their Faith, and (contrary to the Engagement of Captives) revolted with as much ſpeed as they were able to the Enemies Camp, and took part with <hi>Antipater.</hi> However <hi>Eumenes</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly labour'd to recover <hi>Craterus</hi> from his Wounds, who was brought from the Field with ſome faint Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99884:117"/>
and ſigns of Life, to his Tent; and when he ſaw that 'twas impoſſible for Art to cure him, out of deference to the Character he bore, and to the Friendſhip that was once betwixt them (for they were intimate Companions in <hi>Alexander's</hi> Life-time), he Celebrated his Obſequies with great Pomp, and ſent his Aſhes to his Wife and Children into <hi>Macedon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe great Actions were At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiev'd about the <hi>Helleſpont, Perdiccas</hi> was treacherouſly kill'd, in an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the River <hi>Nile,</hi> by <hi>Seleucus</hi> and <hi>Antigonus;</hi> ſo that the whole Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Affairs devolv'd upon <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater.</hi> Here thoſe who had deſerted the Army, by a Council of War, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd Traitors, and (tho abſent) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to loſe their Heads. Amongſt the number of thoſe who lay under this hard Sentence, <hi>Eumenes</hi> was Chief; who was really diſturb'd at the Injuſtice of his Fate, but not to that degree as to make him deſpond, or deſiſt from the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the War. And yet this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, tho it might ſeem inſignificant to affect a Man that was really in Arms, yet it had this effect, as to rebate the Greatneſs of that Courage which it was
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:99884:117"/>
unable utterly to overthrow. <hi>Antigonus,</hi> (who was provided with good ſtore both of Ammunition and Men) in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance to this Decree, follow'd <hi>Eumenes</hi> in the Rear, and gave ſome diſturbances to his Troops by ſmall Skirmiſhes on the Road; but was never able to force him to a pitcht Battel, only in ſuch narrow places, where a ſmall Party was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to engage the Front of his whole Army. And yet at laſt, when he was not to be undermin'd by Policy or Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he was ſupplanted and almoſt ruin'd by the Treachery of a Multitude; but yet, even here, he extricated himſelf out of this difficulty; and, with the loſs of ſome of his Men, retir'd ſafe to a Citadel in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> call'd <hi>Nora;</hi> wherein he was ſo cloſe beſieg'd by <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and abridg'd of room to Air his Horſes in, that he fear'd their diſſuetude from Exerciſe would ſpeedily breed a Murrain, and cauſe a deſtruction amongſt them; ſo that to prevent this inconvenience, he made uſe of an expedient, whereby they might in the ſame Stall procure a better Appetite to their Fodder, and yet not want the benefit of Riding. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd this way; and ty'd their Heads ſo high to the Rack with Halters, that they
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:99884:118"/>
could by no means touch the Earth with their fore-feet; and then his Grooms, with the Diſcipline of the Whip, laying on behind, oblig'd them to leap and kick backwards, to revenge the ſtroke. This motion, or agitation of Body, caus'd as much Sweating as if they had been actually Breath'd in a Courſe. So that (what was the moſt wonderful thing of all) by this Management the Horſes were brought from the Caſtle, after many Months Siege, as clean and in as good liking as if they had been air'd every day in the Fields. When he was thus block'd up, as oft as he thought convenient, he made Incurſions into the Enemy's Camp, and either burnt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh'd the Fortifications and Entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Antigonus;</hi> but ſtill he kept himſelf cloſe in his Garriſon during the Winter ſeaſon, becauſe he could not in the Field have the advantage of a Caſtle for his defence and ſhelter; but as ſoon as the Spring approacht, under the pretence of yeilding the place, and making Conditions of Peace, he impos'd upon <hi>Antigonus</hi>'s Officers (who had the management of the Treaty) and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd himſelf and his Soldiers both from the ſtraitneſs and danger of the Siege.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:99884:118"/>
To him <hi>Olympias,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Alexander,</hi> made her application, and addreſst from <hi>Epirus</hi> (where ſhe then dwelt) Letters to him into <hi>Aſia,</hi> to importune his Aid, and deſire his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to recover <hi>Macedon,</hi> and inveſt her in the poſſeſſion of that Empire. <hi>Eumenes,</hi> in his Anſwer, advis'd her to deſiſt from her Pretenſions, or at leaſt to wait the time, when the Son of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> ſhould aſſume the Government; but if her Ambition ſhould hurry her, againſt this Advice, to invade <hi>Macedon,</hi> by all means ſhe ought to forget old In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and not exerciſe any Acts of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty againſt her Subjects. She follow'd none of his Counſel; for She did go into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and Reign'd there with all the Tyranny and Barbarity imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. So that her Government becoming generally odious, ſhe was forc't to write again to <hi>Eumenes,</hi> and beſeech him not to ſuffer the inveterate Enemies of her Houſe to extirpate the very Race and Memory of <hi>Philip,</hi> but to bring ſpeedy Relief to the poor Remains and Poſterity of <hi>Alexander;</hi> which Requeſt of her's, if it were ſo reaſonable as to be clos'd with, ſhe further entreated him, to raiſe what Forces he could and bring to her
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99884:119"/>
Aſſiſtance; and that he might the more readily comply with this motion, for his encouragement, ſhe had already oblig'd all her Officers (who had not yet ſhoke off their Allegiance) to obey him, and ſubmit themſelves to be regulated by his Orders. <hi>Eumenes</hi> was ſo exalted with the Honour of his Employment, and the Greatneſs of the Character he was put into, that he choſe rather to embrace Death (if the Gods would have it ſo) in a generous Return of Service to his great Benefactor, than to live ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly, and with ſecurity, under the brand and appellation of Ingratitude.</p>
               <p>Accordingly he makes a new levy of Men, and prepares himſelf for a War againſt <hi>Antigonus;</hi> Now there were at that time ſeveral of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility with him, and amongſt them <hi>Peu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtes,</hi> who was of the Bed-Chamber to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and had the Government of <hi>Perſia</hi> conferr'd upon him, and <hi>Antige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Macedonian Phalanx; Eumenes</hi> thought it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to decline envy, or prevent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, if He, who was a Stranger, ſhould arrogate the Command, and prefer himſelf to be General in the Army, when there was ſo vaſt a concourſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99884:119"/>
of <hi>Macedonian</hi> Noblemen with him; and yet being unwilling to be laid aſide from the Employment, he takes a middle way to avoid the danger; he erects a Pavilion in the Camp, and calls it by the name of <hi>Alexander's</hi> Tent; and there orders all the Royal Furniture of a Golden Throne, a Scepter, and a Diadem, to be plac't where the Officers met conſtantly to treat of public Affairs, and the negotiation of War; being of opinion, that by this means he ſhould not be oppreſs't with envy, if under the pretence and umbrage of <hi>Alexander's</hi> name, he carry'd on the War; which point he accompliſhed according to his deſign; for when the principal Officers met and concerted their meaſures ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly at the Royal Pavilion, and not at <hi>Eumenes</hi> his Tent, his Superiority in a manner was conceal'd, and yet in effect he manag'd the whole Buſineſs of the Conſult.</p>
               <p>When the point of Precedency was in this manner accommodated, <hi>Eumenes</hi> met <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and had an encounter with him in <hi>Paraetacis;</hi> not in a formal pitcht Battle, where the whole Army was engaged, but in ſmall skirmiſhes by Parties, where <hi>Antigonus</hi> was conſtantly
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:99884:120"/>
worſted, and obliged to retire to his Winter Quarters in <hi>Media;</hi> He in the mean time lodg'd his Forces in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Perſia,</hi> not as if he had choſe the place for any advantage to himſelf, but the obſtinacy of his Soldiers obliged him to it; for that Wing of his Army (with which <hi>Alexander</hi> overrun <hi>Aſia,</hi> and Conquered <hi>Perſia)</hi> were ſo inſolent with the ſenſe of their former Victories, and the Glory they Atchiev'd there, that they thought it their Buſineſs to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and not Follow their Leaders. Which really is the true character of our <hi>Veteranes;</hi> and there is this danger in employing either of them, for fear their unrulineſs and untractable Spirit ſhould have this effect of deſtroying all before 'em, and their pride turn as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to their own Party, as their Valour is fatal to the Enemy; and if any one will take the pains to examine and compare the Actions of both, he muſt neceſſarily find a great parity and reſemblance betwixt them, and no other difference but in point of time. But to return from this digreſsion; <hi>Eumenes</hi> Quarter'd his Men in Poſts, not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for the Buſineſs of War, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate to the Luxury of his Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:99884:120"/>
and for this end they lay ſcatter'd in the Country, in no order at all, but at a great diſtance from each other. <hi>Antigonus</hi> was ſenſible of the diſorder they were in, and withall conſcious of his inability to attack them with ſucceſs, if they were form'd into a Body, or put in a poſture to receive him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chang'd his meaſures of aſſaulting them openly, and upon warning, and took new reſolutions; of doing it by ſurpriſe. There were two ways lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his Winter Quarters in <hi>Media,</hi> to his Enemies Camp on the other ſide, the one of 'em was ſhort, exactly in a line, and lay croſs the Country, where there was nothing but Deſart and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitable places, by reaſon of draught and the penury of water, and was only ten eaſy daies journy at the moſt; The other, which was the more beaten Tract, went round about in a circumference, and was much the longer paſſage, but ſtill had all the conveniences and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations of Travel. He foreſaw, that if he undertook to paſs in the more publick Road, the Enemy muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be upon their Guard, and have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of his March, before he had accompliſh'd the third part of his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99884:121"/>
but if he moved with his Army, in a ſtraight line, thro the Deſart part of the Country, he might have hopes to oppreſs 'em unawares, and unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for his coming; upon this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ordered ſeveral Pitchers and Veſſels of water to be prepared, and a great deal of Provinder to be in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, to ſupply the defect of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and then took care for his Soldiers, that there ſhould be Bread and Victuals enough bak'd, to ſerve for ten daies; and this he did, becauſe he would not be put to the neceſsity of making fires upon every occaſion of Eating, for fear the Enemy ſhould diſcover his approach at a diſtance, and he ſhould have the ſecret of his journey betray'd.</p>
               <p>In this Equipage, he ſets forward and begins the Compaign, who notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this care, had not travell'd above half the way, but from the ſmoak in his Tents, and the duſt which his Army rais'd, <hi>Eumenes</hi> had great reaſon to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the Enemy was nigh. A Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of War is therefore preſently call'd, to conſult what was fitting to be done in this Exigence: It was the Judgement of moſt that were preſent, that their Troops could not be imbodied or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99884:121"/>
ſo ſoon as <hi>Antigonus,</hi> with the ſwiftneſs of his March would be upon them; at this debate (when almoſt the whole Council were at a loſs, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd of any Expedient of ſafety) <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> aſſured the Board, <hi>That if they would uſe Diligence and obey Orders, which hitherto they abſolutely refus'd, he would even yet bring things to a happy Iſsue; for whereas the Enemy might eaſily approach them in five daies time, he would order matters ſo, that he ſhould be retarded full as long, and be put back ten; wherefore,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>let every Officer go his Round, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Soldiers that belong to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and that lye ſcatter'd and diſpers'd at large in the Country:</hi> Now this was the project that he us'd, to put a ſtop to <hi>Antigonus</hi> his motion and divert his courſe; He Commanded a Party of Men to lodge themſelves at the foot of the Mountains, where the Enemy was to paſs, and at the beginning of the Night, to make large fires, and extend them very wide in the Front, but to diminiſh the number and make them leſs in the ſecond Row, and ſo propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to render them more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably ſmall in the third and hindmoſt
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:99884:122"/>
Flank, that ſo, by this reſemblance and ſhew of a Camp, the Enemy might be induc'd to think, his deſign was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, that they were alarm'd at his approach, and moved their Tents, in order to meet him in the Road and give him Battle in the Deſart; This task the Officers were to renew every night; who according to their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions perform'd their charge; <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> by this peice of ſubtility was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded; who, as ſoon as it was dark, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the fires, and fell into a Beleif, that theſe were really the Tents of his Enemies, and that the whole whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was Rendezvous'd and Encamp'd there to Fight them; ſo that he chang'd his reſolution, and ſince he ſaw himſelf defeated of his deſign, and could not poſsibly ſurpriſe them in diſorder, he turn'd his Courſe, and took the longer paſſage, which lay round about the Hills in a fruitful Soil, and tarry'd a day or two in the Country, to eaſe and refreſh his Soldiers (that were tyr'd with the Fatigue) and to give reſt to his Horſes; that after ſuch a Reſpit and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit, both Man and Beaſt might be in a better condition to oppoſe the Enemy, and more vigorouſly maintain the Fight.</p>

By this ſtratagem <hi>Eumenes</hi> overreach't the policy of the General, and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſuddainneſs of his Attaque; and yet it was without any real advantage to himſelf in the end; for ſuch was the envy of his Officers that maligned his Glory, and ſo great was the perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Veterane</hi> Soldiers, that 'tho in a brave Engagement (when they had put things to a puſh) they returned Conqueror from the Feild, and gain'd ſignal Trophies of Victory, yet they deliver'd their General Priſoner, and in Chains, to <hi>Antigonus;</hi> and this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery they acted, after they had thrice Religiouſly ſworn to defend him with their Lives and Fortunes, and never to deſert his cauſe; but ſo predominant was their envy above the conſideration of their Oaths, or the obligation of their Fidelity, that they choſe rather to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their Faith, than not turn Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Ruin and betray him. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> had certainly ſpar'd his Life (tho he was his moſt mortal and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Enemy in the World) if his Council could have bin induc'd to have given way to it, becauſe he knew, that no Man Living could be more ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him in the management of the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:99884:123"/>
Buſineſs of War, which he had then in hand, and ſaw a neceſſity of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing it; for both <hi>Seleucus, Lyſimachus,</hi> and <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> (who were all Men of Power and Strength) were ready to oppreſs his Grandeur, and contend with him for Soveraignty and the prize of Empire; But thoſe who were of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> his Council, would not ſuffer ſuch a failure in Politicks, as to be willing to have his Life preſerv'd, whoſe promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a little time would certainly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant their Eſteem, and render them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable in the Army; and beſides, <hi>Antigonus</hi> himſelf was ſo enrag'd againſt him, for the Outrages he done, and the havock that was made in the Army, that there was no hopes of his reconciliation, or pacifying his Anger, unleſs he had an aſſurance of a full compenſation by future Services in War.</p>
               <p>When he was therefore committed to Cuſtody, and the Governor of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ask'd <hi>Antigonus,</hi> in what manner he would have him kept, <hi>With the ſame care,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>as you would keep a wild Lyon, or the feirceſt Elephant,</hi> under the ſtricteſt Guard: For he had not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd with himſelf, whether he would preſerve his Life or no; Now there came

all ſorts of People to viſit <hi>Eumenes</hi> in his misfortune; ſome, out of hatred, to glut their eyes with the ſight and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over him in Affliction; Others, upon the account of Friendſhip, that formerly had bin betwixt them, went to comfort him in his Adverſity, and pay their Complement of Condolence to him; but the greateſt number came out of Curioſity to contemplate his form, and to know the ſhape and figure of the Man, to be able to remember and talk to their Acquaintance that they had ſeen the perſon, whom ſo long and ſo juſtly they had ſtood in dread of, and in whoſe deſtruction all their hopes of Victory and Peace were plac't; <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> (whoſe Spirit was troubled more at the impertinence of the Viſits, than at the greif of his Confinement) told <hi>Onomarchus,</hi> one day in Company, when he had bin long in Priſon, <hi>That he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, he had bin kept three days without Death or Releaſement; that it was not ſutable to the methods of Prudence to uſe a Captive ſo, but that</hi> Autigonus <hi>ought either to Execute him preſently, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs him ſafe, loaded with apprehenſions of Gratitude to his Friends.

Oh! would to God, ſaies</hi> Eumenes, <hi>this had bin in my Power or choice; but this could not poſſibly be my Fate, for I never in all my Life time had the Glory to Encounter a Braver Man than my ſelf, and never conteſted the point of Valour with any Hero yet, but forc't him to yeild and own me the Conqueror; and now tho I am baſely in your Power, yet my ignominy is to be aſcribed to the Treachery of my Friends, and not to the Proweſs of my Adverſary.</hi> Neither was any thing of this Diſcourſe, tho it ſeem'd a Rant, falſe; for he had both a Majeſty in his preſence, that ſtruck an awe and terror into the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, and ſuch a Gigantick firmneſs in his make and Limbs, as ſeem'd to be compos'd only for Work and Labour, and yet there was ſuch a Symmetry and proportion of parts, as render'd him both Auguſt and Comely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antigonus</hi> durſt not haſtily and alone determine of this Man's Fate, but left his caſe to the Conſideration and Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his Council: <hi>Here many of the

Board ſtood aſtoniſh'd at the neglect of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and wondered that Execution was not preſently done upon an Enemy, who for many years had laid waſt and ravaged their Country, ſlain the cheif of their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and put ſuch a Terror and Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation amongst the Reſt, that they had bin brought even to extremity and deſpair; and if the ſenſe of theſe injuries is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to juſtify or provoke his Ruin, yet let the danger of his Perſon weigh ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards his Death: As long as he is in Being, there can be no ſecurity for our Preſervation, but we ſhall be conſtantly afraid, leſt he ſhould be violently releas'd from his Priſon to head a Mutiny or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the Camp; but at his Death theſe dangers ceaſe, and there can be no apprehenſion of Diſturbance to be rais'd from his Aſhes; but however,</hi> purſued they, <hi>if</hi> Antigonus <hi>was inclined to give him Life, they humbly entreated to know, how he would new model his Council, or where he would find Officers to have place there; for with</hi> Eumenes <hi>none of the old Commanders would either Correſpond, or joyn Intereſts, or be at the ſame Board to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi> Tho the Sentiments of the Council were in this manner made known, yet <hi>Antigonus</hi> takes ſeven days
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:99884:125"/>
time to deliberate and pronounce his Doom; and thèn fearing an Inſurrection might be caus'd by the delay of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he orders his Warders to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, his daily ſuſtenance to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, and forbids all Mankind his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence (for ſtill he would not offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the Man who once had bin his Friend) that ſo he might periſh with Famine, without involving others in the guilt of his Blood; and yet <hi>Eumenes</hi> after three daies languiſhment with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, when his Spirits were impair'd and ſunk, unknown and without order from <hi>Antigonus,</hi> was kill'd by his Keepers, to prevent the care of tending him, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Camp.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Eumenes</hi> (who, as we told you before, at twenty years of Age, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd at Court withall poſſible demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of kindneſs, who for the ſpace of ſeven years was a conſtant Favourite and Attendant to King <hi>Philip,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards was admitted to the ſame place in <hi>Alexanders</hi> eſteem, and enjoy'd it thirteen years more, to that degree, that in his time, he was conſtituted Maſter of the Horſe in the <hi>SOCIAL AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MY,</hi> who alſo, after his Death, was Commander in Cheif of the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,

                  <hi>TIMOLEON,</hi> a <hi>Corinthian</hi> born, was without doubt, in the general eſteem of the World, a very Eminent Man; for he had the happineſs to which few or none could arrive, of freeing his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country from the oppreſſion of a Tyrant, of redeeming the City of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſe,</hi> to whoſe aſsiſtance he was ſent, from a long continued Bondage, and of reſtoring all <hi>Sicily</hi> to its former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which had been long harraſs'd by War, and the inhumane uſage of the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:99884:130"/>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Barbarians.</hi> But in the managing of all thoſe Affairs, he met with many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Adventures; and what is thought to be the hardeſt encounter of the two, he behav'd himſelf rather the more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly in his Proſperity, then in his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. For when his Brother <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi> who was made General by the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> by the help of his Mercenary Soldiers had invaded the Soveraignty, and <hi>Timoleon</hi> might have had a ſhare in the Royalty with him, He was ſo far from a betting any ſuch peice of Villany, that he put a much greater value upon his Fellow Citizens Liberty, then he did upon his Brothers Life, and look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf infinitely more oblig'd to live in obedience to the Laws of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try then to rule over it. Being a Man of theſe principles, he contriv'd to have his Brother the Tyrant Murther'd by a certain Soothſayer, and another who was related to 'em both, as having mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried their own Siſter both by Father and Mother. In which Murther he was ſo far from having any hand, that he would not ſo much as look upon his Brothers bloodſhed. For while the thing was putting in Execution by them, he took a Poſt at a diſtance, that none of his
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:99884:130"/>
Live-guard might come to his Reſcue. This notable Action of his, was not look'd upon by all with the ſame eyes, for ſome took it to be a breach of Piety, and by a Siniſter interpretation repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the whole matter as unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Nay, his Mother, after this would never let him come within her Doors, nor as much as admit him into her preſence; but out of a deteſtation of the Fact, would brand him with the name of unnatural Aſſaſsine of his Prince, and Brother. At the hearing of which words, he was ſo mightily concern'd, that he had ſometimes thoughts of being his own Executioner, and by imbracing Death to abandon the ſight of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful World.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, after <hi>Dion</hi> was ſlain at <hi>Syracuſe, Dionyſius</hi> made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf again Maſter of the Town; But they of the contrary Party, Petition'd the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for ſuccour, and deſir'd a General over their Forces. In which Expedition, <hi>Timoleon</hi> was ſent, and with wonderful ſucceſs, beat <hi>Dionyſius</hi> quite out of <hi>Sicily,</hi> yet ſpar'd his Life, when it was in his Power to have taken it away; and took particular care to ſee him ſafely convey'd to the City of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:99884:131"/>
which had been frequently ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the aid and aſſiſtance it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from both the <hi>Dionyſii.</hi> Of which Favour <hi>Timoleon</hi> was willing to leave a Memorial; eſteeming that Conqueſt much more Honourable, which had in it more of Mercy than Cruelty. In a word, he ſent him thither alive, that the World might not receive it by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition only, but be eye-witneſſes, what a Perſonage he had reduc'd, from ſo great an Empire to ſo mean a condition. After <hi>Dionyſius's</hi> departure, <hi>Timoleon</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a freſh War with <hi>Icetas,</hi> who had acted contrary to <hi>Dionyſius's</hi> inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, not ſo much out of diſlike or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of his Tyranny, as out of private intereſt, as was plain from his unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to quit his Command, when <hi>Dionyſius</hi> was depos'd. <hi>Icetas</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, <hi>Timoleon</hi> routed a very formidable Army of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> at the River <hi>Crimeſsus,</hi> and oblig'd them to reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, if they might be permitted to live quietly in <hi>Africk,</hi> who for many years paſt had been in poſſeſſion of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily.</hi> Beſides all this, he took <hi>Mamercus</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Commander Priſoner, a very Warlike Man, and one of great inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, who had come over into <hi>Sicily</hi> to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:99884:131"/>
the Aſſiſtance of the Tyrants.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being happily Atchiev'd, and finding by a long continuance of War, that not only Countries, but Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties alſo were depopulated, he drew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all poſsible Recruits, firſt of the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> then of new Planters which he brought over from <hi>Corinth,</hi> becauſe the City <hi>Syracuſe</hi> was by them Originally Founded. To the old Inhabitants he reſtor'd their own; he divided among thoſe of the new Plantation, the Eſtates of ſuch whoſe owners had been loſt in the Wars, he repair'd the ruinated Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and demoliſh'd Temples, he Erected anew the ſeveral States upon their old Laws and Liberties, and after a moſt dreadful War, ſettled ſo great a Peace and Quiet through the whole Iſland, that he might rather be taken for the Founder of thoſe Cities, then they who had at firſt Planted 'em. The Citadel of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> which <hi>Dionyſius</hi> had Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd, on purpoſe to block up the Town, he eras'd from the very Foundation, ſleighted all other Bulworks of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Government, and did what in him lay, that as few marks of Bondage as could might remain. Having ſo great Power, as that he could have extorted
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:99884:132"/>
obedience from them, and again being ſuch a Favourite of all the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> that he might have come to the Crown, by a unamimous conſent, he choſe rather to be Belov'd then Fear'd. Therefore as ſoon as conveniently he could, he laid down his Command, and paſs'd the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of his Life there, as a private Perſon. And this was not done unadviſedly; for he maintain'd that Grandeur and Authority through a mutual good will, which other Princes could never compaſs by force. Every Man paid him conſtantly a very great reſpect, and no publick Buſineſs was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after Tranſacted at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> of which any Decree was made, before <hi>Timoleon's</hi> ſenſe of the matter was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. No Mans Counſel was ever preferr'd before his, nor as much as ſtood in competition with it. And ſo to do was not more their Affection, then Wiſedom.</p>
               <p>When he was grown old, he loſt his Eye-ſight; which Affliction he bore with ſo much Patience, that he was never heard to complain of it, nor was yet leſs uſeful in private concerns or publick Affairs. For he came to the <hi>Theatre,</hi> when the People met there in Counſel,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:99884:132"/>
drawn by a pair of Mules, by reaſon of his infirmities <note n="*" place="margin">He was Aged, Blind, and had the Gout.</note>, and ſo from the Coach deliver'd his opinion concerning the matter in debate, which no Body look'd upon as a piece of pride in him, for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did any thing like Inſolence or vain Glory come out of his mouth. If at any time he had heard himſelf mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd, he would only reply, that he did ſignally bleſs the Gods, and was bound upon that particular account to be always thankful, for that, when the Gods were graciouſly pleas'd to raiſe <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> they made choice of him as their unworthy Inſtrument. For he thought, that no humane actions were brought to perfection without an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Providence. And therefore he Erected a private Chappel in his houſe to Fortune, where he with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and zeal paid his Devotions.</p>
               <p>Beſides this moſt excellent temper of his, ſeveral remarkable Accidents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd to render him famous. For all his moſt memorable Battels happen'd to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fought upon the day on which he was born; ſo that it fell out, that all <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi> made their Anniverſary Feaſts on his Birth-day. When one <hi>Laphyſtius,</hi> an inconſiderable, ſawcy, and ungrateful
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:99884:133"/>
Fellow, requir'd ſtipulation of him for an appearance, under colour of an Action that he had againſt him; and the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude flocking together, endeavour'd forcibly to curb the pretenders inſolence; <hi>Timoleon</hi> beſeech'd 'em to deſiſt; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, that he had gone through great hardſhips, and extream dangers, chiefly upon the account, that <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſtius</hi> and others might enjoy their Liberty. For the true nature of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is, that any one may try out whatever Cauſe he has by due Courſe of Law. When another Fellow, much like <hi>Laphyſtius, Demaenetus</hi> by name, in a Harangue before all the People Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in Counſel, had detracted from the Glory of <hi>Timoleon's</hi> Actions, and had ſharply inveigh'd againſt him, he made no other anſwer, but that he now found that his Prayers were heard; For he had ever made it his humble Requeſt to the Gods, that the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> might enjoy ſuch a Liberty, whereby every one might be free, to ſpeak his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of whom he pleas'd. When he dy'd he was interr'd at the publick charge of the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> (in an Academy, which had its denomination from him) all finely attending his Funerals.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>HAMILCAR,</hi> a <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> Sirnam'd <hi>Barcas,</hi> the Son of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> at the later end of the firſt <hi>Punic</hi> War, tho then very young, was Conſtituted Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſimo of the Forces in <hi>Sicily.</hi> In which Employment he behav'd himſelf ſo well, that (tho before his time the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Army was always worſted, both by Sea and Land) he ſtill kept his Ground, and was ſo vigilant, that his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could never find him unprovided;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:99884:134"/>
but on the contrary, when opportunity ſerv'd, would fall upon them, and always made himſelf Maſter of the Field. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, when the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> by their ill ſucceſs had very near loſt all footing in <hi>Sicily,</hi> he ſo prudently defended the City <hi>Eryx,</hi> as not to leave the leaſt ſign of a War behind him. But in the interim, <hi>C. Lutatius,</hi> the then <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beaten the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Fleet at the Iſlands <hi>Aegates,</hi> the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to Conclude the War, and to that end made <hi>Hamilcar</hi> their Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary. Who, tho naturally more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to War than Peace, yet in that Juncture of Affairs, He prefer'd Peace; becauſe his Country being then poor, could no longer endure the hardſhips and expences of War; yet he reſerv'd this to himſelf, that as ſoon as the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> were a little refreſhed, again to renew the War, and by Arms oppoſe the <hi>Romans,</hi> until Fortune had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd the Conqueſt. With this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution he concluded the Peace; in the ſetling whereof, He was ſo ſtout, that when <hi>Catulus</hi> refus'd to ſign the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, unleſs He, with the whole Garriſon of the City <hi>Eryx,</hi> would depart <hi>Sicily</hi> without their Arms; He bravely and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:99884:134"/>
ſharply replyed, that tho his Country being poor, could yeild him no aſsiſtance, yet he would rather dye, than return to his home with ſuch Ignominy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. For it would not conſiſt with his Valour, tamely to deliver up to his Enemies thoſe Weapons which were committed to his Truſt for the defence of his Country. Upon this his reſolution <hi>Catulus</hi> comply'd.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> ſo ſoon as he arriv'd at <hi>Carthage,</hi> found the Commonwealth in a condition worſe than he expected. For by the long continuance of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign War, Inteſtine diſcords were ſo much heightn'd, that <hi>Carthage</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the like dangerous condition, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when it was quite raz'd and demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd. For the Mercenary Soldiers who were twenty thouſand ſtrong, and (who had formerly fought againſt the <hi>Romans)</hi> Revolting, drew all <hi>Africa</hi> to their Party, and likewiſe beſieged <hi>Carthage.</hi> By which great misfortune the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were ſo Terrify'd, that they ſought for Aid and Protection from their greateſt Enemies, the <hi>Romans,</hi> and obtain'd their Requeſt. But in fine, when they were almoſt reduc'd to the utmoſt extremities of miſery and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:99884:135"/>
they voted <hi>Hamilcar</hi> their General. Who not only made thoſe Rebels, who were above twenty thouſand, to raiſe their ſiege from before <hi>Carthage,</hi> but alſo forc'd them to that extremity, that ſhutting them up in places where they were void of all relief, more periſh'd by Famine than were kill'd by the Sword. He brought back again the revolted Towns to their former Duty and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and amongſt the reſt, <hi>Utica</hi> and <hi>Hippo,</hi> the two wealthieſt Cities of all <hi>Africa.</hi> Neither was He ſatisfied with this; but he alſo enlarg'd the Empire, and all <hi>Africk</hi> was ſo ſettled, that none could imagine that there had been any War there for many years before.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being finiſh'd by him ſo ſucceſsfully, out of a couragious and an exaſperated mind againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that He might more handſomely pick a Quarrel with them, he contriv'd, that he himſelf ſhould go Commander with an Army into <hi>Spain,</hi> taking along with him his young Son <hi>Hannibal,</hi> then but nine years old. With him marcht <hi>Haſdrubal,</hi> that Beautiful and brave Youth; whom ſome think to have been belov'd too much by <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> in
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:99884:135"/>
a manner not allowed to his Sex: For great Men ſeldom eſcape ill Men's mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Tongues. And upon this account, the Youth <hi>Hasdrubal</hi> was forbid by the Cenſor to attend the General. But <hi>Hamilcar</hi> giving his Daughter in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to <hi>Hasdrubal,</hi> found out that way, as the beſt expedient, of enjoying the Youth's company; for their Laws did not forbid the Son-in-law to converſe with his Father. I thought this paſſage worthy of my notice, becauſe when <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar</hi> was kill'd, he Commanded the Army, and was Succeſsful in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Exploits; and during his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, by large Gifts he ſo corrupted the ancient manners of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that after his Death <hi>Hannibal</hi> receiv'd his Power from the Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> after he had croſs'd the Sea, and enter'd <hi>Spain,</hi> with great ſucceſs undertook vaſt Deſigns; he ſubdu'd the moſt Warlike, and the wealthieſt Countries: and furniſhed all <hi>Africa</hi> with Men and Horſes, Arms and Mony. But as He was deſigning a War on <hi>Italy,</hi> in the ninth year after his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into <hi>Spain,</hi> Fighting againſt the <hi>Vettones,</hi> He was unfortunately ſlain. His implacable hatred againſt his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:99884:136"/>
the <hi>Romans,</hi> was the cheif cauſe of the ſecond <hi>Punick</hi> War; for his Son <hi>Hannibal</hi> was ſo exaſperated by the daily and repeated Conjurations of his Father, that he often declar'd, He had rather periſh, than not try the Courage of the <hi>Romans.</hi>

               <p>AS 'tis a Truth of undoubted Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, That the <hi>Romans</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all other People in Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo likewiſe muſt it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, That <hi>Hannibal</hi> was as far above all other Commanders for his Wiſedom and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:99884:137"/>
Conduct, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Valour was more eminent than that of all different Nations. For during the whole time that <hi>Italy</hi> was the Seat of his Action, Succeſs continually waited on his Arms; inſomuch, that had not the Envy of his Enemies at home unfortunately, hindred his Progreſs abroad, He ſeems to have been ſufficiently able to have made an abſolute Conqueſt over the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. But too numerous were his detract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Foes, to be Encounter'd by the Gallantry of a ſingle Perſon. He ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd the Hatred that his Father bore the <hi>Roman</hi> Nation, and which was in a manner Hereditary to Him, that He would ſooner have parted with his Life, then in the leaſt have abated of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to that People. For tho he lay under the unhappy circumſtances of a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Man, and conſequently was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to Forreign Princes for their aſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, yet He never ceas'd (at leaſt in his intention) to wage War with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> Not to inſtance in King <hi>Philip</hi> (whom he render'd an Enemy to that Nation, tho he had not the advantage of Conſulting with him in Perſon) He poſſeſs'd King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> a Prince of the greateſt Strength and Power of thoſe
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:99884:137"/>
times, with ſo eager a deſire of making War upon them, that he raiſed the whole Force of his Empire, as far as the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> with a deſign to Invade <hi>Italy.</hi> To this <hi>Antiochus</hi> it was, that Embaſſadors were ſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> to the intent they might inform themſelves of his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and uſe all poſſible endeavors, by underhand Polices, to bring <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> into ſuſpicion with the King, by aſſuring Him, that (as if they had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn him from his Fidelity) He now eſpous'd a quite different Intereſt than He had formerly ſerved. They effected this with no ſmall ſucceſs, as <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſoon perceiv'd, when he found that He was turn'd out of the Privy Councel; ſo that at a convenient time, He firſt waits on the King, and having put him in mind of his great Loyalty to him, and his Hatred to the <hi>Roman</hi> People, he added over and above, <hi>When I was a Boy of about nine years of Age, my Father</hi> Hamilcar <hi>being upon his departure from</hi> Carthage, <hi>as General into</hi> Spain, <hi>offer'd up Sacrifice to the Great</hi> Jupiter; <hi>during which Solemnity, he asked me, whither I would bare him company to the Camp; which when I readily accepted of, and began to importune him, that he would not
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:99884:138"/>
ſcruple to take me along with Him; I will</hi> (ſays he) <hi>grant your Requeſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you will take an Oath, which I ſhall propoſe to you; Upon which he led me to the Altar where he deſign'd to Sacrifice. And when (according to Cuſtom) I had laid my Hands upon it; the reſt of the company being at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, he commanded me to ſwear, That I would never be in Friendſhip with the</hi> Roman <hi>People. This Oath, which my Father then gave me, I have preſerv'd ſo inviolably to this very day, as not to give any Man the leaſt ground of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting, but that I ſhall be ever of the ſame Diſpoſition. So that now if you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain any thoughts of contracting any kind of Friendſhip with the</hi> Romans, <hi>'twill be your wiſeſt courſe to conceal it from my knowledg; but on the other hand, whenever you deſign a War with them, you will very much miſtake your meaſures, if you do not principally commit the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of it to my hands.</hi>

Thus <hi>Hannibal,</hi> not yet twenty five-years of Age, was actually General of all the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Forces, and within the ſpace of three years after, ſubdued all the Countries of <hi>Spain;</hi> He took <hi>Saguntum</hi> (a City in Alliance with the <hi>Romans)</hi> by Storm. He rais'd three vaſt Armies; one of which he ſent into <hi>Afric,</hi> another he left with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Hasdrubal</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the third he Commanded in Perſon into <hi>Italy.</hi> He paſs'd the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains, and all along as he march'd, having frequent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters with the Inhabitants, He Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd all He Fought. Coming at laſt to thoſe <hi>Alps</hi> which divide <hi>Italy</hi> from <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> the Inhabitants oppos'd his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, which He ſoon laid open by cutting them in pieces. He was the firſt Man that ever led an Army over theſe Mountains, except <hi>Hercules</hi> the <hi>Grecian,</hi> from whoſe paſſage they took their Name. Here <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> open'd the Way, and fortified the Paſs, making ſo great an alteration, that the Elephants, together with their Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, could march conveniently in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:99884:139"/>
place, where before a ſingle Man, tho unarm'd, could ſcarce creep along. From hence leading his Forces into <hi>Italy,</hi> he had an Encounter on the River <hi>Rhone</hi> with <hi>P. C. Scipio</hi> the Conſul, and put him to flight. He fought him likewiſe near the River <hi>Po,</hi> for the Town <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtidium,</hi> where <hi>Scipio</hi> himſelf was wounded, and his Army utterly routed. He had a third Battel with him and his Collegue <hi>Tiberius Longus,</hi> who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd towards Him near the River <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> where he engaged them and defeated them both. Marching at length through <hi>Liguria,</hi> he croſs'd the <hi>Appenine</hi> Hills, intending for <hi>Hetruria.</hi> In this march he was extreamly afflicted with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper in his Eyes, to that degree, that he could never recover the perfect uſe of his right one again; But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his indiſpoſition was ſuch that he was forc'd to be carried in a Litter, he obtain'd a very ſignal Victory over <hi>C. Flaminius</hi> the Conſul, at the Lake <note n="*" place="margin">Now call'd <hi>Lago di Perugia.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Thraſimenus,</hi> where having circumvent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him by ambuſh, he cut him off with his whole Army. In a ſhort time after, he ſerv'd <hi>C. Centenius</hi> in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who with a choſen party of Men, had poſſeſs'd himſelf of the Tops of the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:99884:139"/>
Mountains. He came from hence into <hi>Apulia,</hi> where the two Conſuls <hi>C. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius Varro,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Paulus Aemilius</hi> advanc'd towards Him, and in one Battel he routed both their Armies; In which En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement <hi>Lucius Paulus</hi> the Conſul was kill'd, with many more who had ſuſtain'd that Dignity, amongſt whom was <hi>Cn. Serilius Geminus,</hi> who had enjoyed it the foregoing year. After this Action, He march'd to <hi>Rome</hi> without any Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. He halted for ſome time on the neighbouring Mountains, and in a few days after decamp'd from thence. In his return to <hi>Capua; Q. Fabius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Dictator, oppos'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him in the <hi>Falernian</hi> Field. Tho the Streights were ſo very narrow, that <hi>Hannibal's</hi> Army was perfectly ſhut up, yet by the advantage of the Night he got away without any damage. Here it was, that he outwitted that ſubtle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander <hi>Fabius:</hi> For in the dead of the Night he commands his Soldiers to ſet fire to the Bowes of Trees, which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore order'd to be faſten'd to the Horns of a conſiderable number of Oxen, which he drove in a hurry upon them. This unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſight was no ſooner beheld, but it put the <hi>Roman</hi> Army into ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:99884:140"/>
that not a man offer'd to ſtir out of his Trenches. A fews days after, he defeated <hi>Marcus Minutius Rufus,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Cavalry (whoſe Command at that time, by the Votes of the People, was made equal to that of Dictator) whom he had cunningly decoy'd into a Battel. And tho he was not preſent at the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as being then in <hi>Lucania),</hi> yet at a diſtance he laid an Ambuſh for <hi>Titus Sempronius Gracchus,</hi> the ſecond time Conſul, and ſlew him; as he did <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Claudius Marcellus,</hi> who had five times bore that Office. 'Twould be a tedious work to give a diſtinct Relation of each particular Action, ſo that this ſhort Account ſhall ſuffice, to ſhew the World how extraordinary a Perſon he was. That ſo long as he was in <hi>Italy</hi> no man was able to reſiſt him in Battel; neither durſt any one after the Defeat at <hi>Cannae</hi> make Head againſt him in the Field. Being thus far a Conqueror, He was at laſt call'd home to the Relief of his own Country. He was employed in the management of the War againſt the Son of that <hi>Scipio</hi> whom he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beaten on the Rivers of <hi>Rhone</hi> and <hi>Po,</hi> having likewiſe defeated him near the River <hi>Trebia.</hi> But the Affairs of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:99884:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Country being in a deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he was very willing (in a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with <hi>Scipio)</hi> to put an end to the War at preſent, that he might be in a better condition to renew it. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they had an Interview; but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions propoſed were ſuch as could not be agreed upon. So that in a few days afterwards he fought him at <hi>Zama;</hi> in which Battel, <hi>Hannibal</hi> being utterly routed, with incredible ſpeed, in the ſpace of two days and two nights, arriv'd at <hi>Adrumetum,</hi> which is three hundred miles diſtant from <hi>Zama.</hi> In this flight the <hi>Numidians</hi> (who quitted the Battel at the ſame time with <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal)</hi> conſpir'd againſt him; but he had not only the good Fortune to avoid their Treachery, but to ſuppreſs them. Here he rallied together all thoſe who had ſaved themſelves by flight; and new Muſters being made, in a few days he liſted a conſiderable number. While he was thus earneſtly employed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king preparations for a War, the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> conclude a Peace with the <hi>Romans. Hannibal</hi> notwithſtanding had the Command of an Army, and (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his Brother <hi>Mago)</hi> was in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in <hi>Afric</hi> till the time that <hi>P. Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picius</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:99884:141"/>
and <hi>Caius Aurelius</hi> were Conſuls; for 'twas during their Magiſtracy, that the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Embaſſadors were ſent from <hi>Carthage</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> to return thanks to the Senate and People for the Peace they had granted; and in conſideration of the Favour, to preſent them with a Golden Crown; intreating them withal, that their Hoſtages might be remov'd to <hi>Fregellae,</hi> and their Priſoners Reſtor'd. To whom the Senate gave this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that as their Preſent was very grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and acceptable to them, ſo likewiſe they conſented, that their Hoſtages might be lodg'd where they had deſir'd; but that their Captives ſhould by no means be releas'd, becauſe they ſtill em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd <hi>Hannibal</hi> (the Author and Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the War, and the irreconcileable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Name) with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mago,</hi> in the chief Command of their Armies. They no ſooner receiv'd this anſwer, but <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Mago</hi> were recall'd home again. <hi>Hannibal</hi> at his return, was choſen Praetor, after he had been King twenty-two years. For as it was cuſtomary at <hi>Rome,</hi> yearly to elect two Conſuls; at <hi>Carthage</hi> two Kings were annually choſen. He acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf in this Employment, with
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:99884:141"/>
the ſame Prudence as he did in War; For he took care, that the new Impoſts ſhould not only furniſh Mony for the Tribute paid to the <hi>Romans,</hi> but that ſome over and above ſhould be left to lay up in the Exchequer. The year after his Praetorſhip, Embaſſadors arriving at <hi>Carthage, Hannibal</hi> ſuſpecting they came to demand him, privately takes Ship before they could have Audience of the Senate, and flies to King <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> in <hi>Syria;</hi> which when the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> knew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they immediately ſent out two Ships with orders to apprehend him if they could overtake him, which not being able to effect, they confiſcated his Goods, raz'd his Houſe to the very ground, and proclaim'd him a Baniſht Man. In the Conſulſhip of <hi>Lucius Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> and <hi>Quintus Minutius</hi> (which was three years after his departure from his own Country) He Cruis'd for ſometime about the Coaſt of <hi>Cyrenaica</hi> with five Ships, endeavouring to perſwade the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to renew the War, upon the confidence of <hi>Antiochus</hi> his ſtrength, whom he had already perſwaded to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>Italy;</hi> then He engage'd his Brother <hi>Mago</hi> in the deſign of which, the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> being inform'd, they us'd
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:99884:142"/>
him with the ſame ſeverity they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on his Brother. Thus their Affairs being in an ill condition, they ſet ſail for <hi>Aſia</hi> to King <hi>Antiochus.</hi> There are two different accounts given of the Death of <hi>Mago,</hi> ſome Authors affirming that he periſhed by Shipwrack, others, that he was murdered by his own Servants. Had <hi>Antiochus</hi> hearken'd to <hi>Hannibals</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, as well in the management of the War, as he had done in the undertaking it, the deciſion of the Empire of the World might have been nearer the River <hi>Tibur</hi> then the Streights of <hi>Thermopylae.</hi> But notwithſtanding, this Great Commander well underſtood the Imprudence of his Conduct, yet he would never forſake him in any Enterprize. He was made Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of a ſmall Fleet, with orders to convey them from <hi>Syria</hi> into <hi>Aſia,</hi> with this he ingaged the <hi>Rhodian</hi> Navy in the <hi>Pamphylian</hi> Sea, who being very much Superior to him in number, his party was beaten, tho that Squadron which he himſelf fought in, had the advantage of the Enemy. After the Defeat of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioohus, Hannibal</hi> fearing leaſt he would deliver him up to the <hi>Romans</hi> (as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he would have done, had not He prevented him) went into <hi>Crete</hi> to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:99884:142"/>
the <hi>Gortynians,</hi> that he might have time there to conſider, how to diſpoſe of Himſelf hereafter. And here, out of his extraordinary ſubtility, He foreſaw he ſhould be in great danger, by reaſon of the Covetous humor of the <hi>Cretans.</hi> For he brought a conſiderable ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with Him, the rumour of which he knew was already ſpread abroad. This therefore was his device; Having fill'd a great number of Veſſels with Lead, and covering the top of them with Gold and Silver, He places them in the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> in the preſence of the <hi>Gortynians;</hi> pretending that He committed his whole Fortune to their Truſt. After he had put this cheat upon them, He fills up ſeveral Braſs hollow Statues (which he had brought along with Him) with his money, and throws them negligently in the outward Court. In the mean time, they guard the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the greateſt ſtrictneſs; not ſo much ſuſpecting other people, as fearing leaſt <hi>Hannibal,</hi> without their knowledge might remove the prize He had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them. Thus our <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> having ſav'd his Treaſure intire, and finely deluded the people of <hi>Crete,</hi> He came at length to <hi>Pruſias</hi> the King of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:99884:143"/>
                  <hi>Bythinia</hi> in <hi>Pontey;</hi> where He ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd his old inclination towards <hi>Italy,</hi> and made it his endeavor to engage the King againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> People. But when He perceiv'd He was not ſtrong enough of Himſelf to oppoſe them, He Aſſociated other Kings, and Warlike Nations in a Confederacy. <hi>Eumenes,</hi> as being a great Friend to the <hi>Roman</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, refus'd to joyn in the Alliance; ſo that they maintain'd a War with each other, both by Sea and Land. But being back'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> He was infinitely too hard for them. Now <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> perceiving, how neceſſary it was for the better ſucceſs in His Affairs, that <hi>Eumenes</hi> ſhould be cut off, he reſolves upon this way to rid himſelf of Him. They were in a ſhort time to engage at Sea; but <hi>Hannibal</hi> being overpower'd in number, Stratagem was to ſupply the place of Strength; Accordingly he charges his Men to get as many poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Serpents as they could, and put them into Earthen Veſſels; of which they procur'd (as commanded) a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number. On the day that they were to fight, having call'd his Seamen together, he gave them order, that they ſhould all ruſh together upon the Ship
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:99884:143"/>
in which <hi>Eumenes</hi> was, and that in the mean time, they need not doubt, but that they were able enough to defend themſelves from the reſt, ſince they were provided of ſo great a number of Serpents. It ſhould be his buſineſs to ſhew them which was the Ship he would have aſſaulted, and likewiſe to reward the perſon, who ſhould either kill the King, or take Him Priſoner. After he had given theſe directions, the two Fleets being ſet in order, and about to engage; That his Soldiers might plainly ſee, where this <hi>Eumenes</hi> was before the ſign was given, He ſends out a Meſſenger in a ſmall Boat, having a white Wand in his Hand (as a token of Peace) when he was come near to the Enemies Fleet, he ſhews them a Letter, asks for the King, upon which he was immediately Conducted to Him, every one taking it for granted, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had ſent him to treat of Peace; the Meſſenger having thus diſcover'd to his own Party which was the Kings Ship, returns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. When <hi>Eumenes</hi> had broke open the Letter, He found nothing contain'd therein, but what tended to Laughter and Contempt of his Perſon; He very much wonder'd what the meaning of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:99884:144"/>
this ſhould be, which tho he could not underſtand, without any more ado, He engages the Enemy; At the very firſt Onſet, the <hi>Bythinians,</hi> according to their orders, ruſhing on altogether, beſet <hi>Eumenes</hi> his Ship, who being not able to withſtand their ſhock, ſaved his Life by flight, which he could never have effected, had he not betook himſelf to his Guards in the neighbouring Shore. When the reſt of the Navy of <hi>Eumenes</hi> began more fiercely to Attack the <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinians,</hi> they pour'd in their Veſſels up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, which at firſt the Enemy only Laught at, who could not deviſe what their intent could be. But when they perceiv'd that their Ships were full of Serpents, being affrightned with the ſtrangeneſs of the thing, and knowing not what danger chiefly to avoid, at laſt they tack'd about, and made to their Port; So that the Cunning of <hi>Hannibal</hi> was too Powerful for the Force of the <hi>Pergamenan</hi> Navy; Who by the ſame kind of Stratagem had frequently obtain'd great Victories at Land. While theſe things were Tranſacting in <hi>Aſia,</hi> King <hi>Pruſias's</hi> Embaſſadors (then at <hi>Rome)</hi> being accidentally at Supper with <hi>Caius Quintus Flaminius</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul;
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:99884:144"/>
ſomebody accidentally happening to mention <hi>Hannibals</hi> Name, one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſaid, that He was in their Kingdom. The next day <hi>Flaminius</hi> acquaints the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, with what had been affirm'd by this perſon, who imagining that they ſhould be never free from Treacheries, ſo long as <hi>Hannibal</hi> was alive; deſpatched Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors into <hi>Bythinia,</hi> (one of which was <hi>Flaminius)</hi> who were to demand of the King, that He ſhould not protect their moſt inveterate Enemy, but forthwith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver Him up into their Hands. <hi>Pruſias</hi> could not deny, but that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was in his Dominions, tho He refus'd Himſelf to betray Him to the Embaſſadors; deſiring, that they would not Requeſt any thing which was ſo much againſt the Laws of Hoſpitality; But let them take Him if they could, who without any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties might find Him out. <hi>Hannibal</hi> conſtantly confin'd Himſelf to one place, being a Caſtle, with which the King had Preſented Him as a Reward for his Services, which He ſo contriv'd, that he had Sallies on all ſides, through which he might eſcape, if he ſhould have occaſion; for he always ſuſpected that that would befall Him, which at laſt did really happen. The <hi>Roman</hi>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:99884:145"/>
Embaſſadors accompanied with a great number of Men, having at length ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded this Caſtle on all parts; his Servant perceiving them from the Gate, runs to his Maſter and acquaints Him; that there appear'd a more then uſual company of Armed Men; upon which He commands him to go round all the doors of the Houſe, and ſpeedily bring Him word whither there was any way to eſcape. When the Boy had immediately acquainted him how the caſe ſtood, and had farther aſſur'd Him, that all the paſſages were ſtopt, he was ſoon ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that this could not happen by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, but that they came to ſeize his perſon, and that conſequently he could not long enjoy his Life, which He was reſolv'd ſhould not be in another Mans diſpoſal; upon which he immediately ſwallowed a doſe of poyſon, which he was always accuſtom'd to carry with Him. Thus, this our moſt Valiant <hi>Hero,</hi> harraſs'd with nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and various Labours, repos'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Death the ſeventieth year of his Age. Authors do not agree in whoſe Conſulſhip He dyed. For <hi>Atticus</hi> in his Annals affirms, that <hi>Claudius M. Marcellus,</hi> and <hi>Q. Fabius Labeo,</hi> did then bare that Office; <hi>Polybius</hi> on the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:99884:145"/>
other hand aſſerts, that it was in the time of <hi>Lucius Aemilius Paulus,</hi> and <hi>Cn. Baelius Tamphilus.</hi> But <hi>Sulpicius</hi> different from both, ſays, that <hi>P. Corn. Cethegus,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Baebius Tamphilus</hi> were at that time Conſuls. Tho this our Great Man was always imploy'd in the buſineſs of War, yet He beſtowed ſome time in Learning. For he wrote ſeveral Books in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, amongſt which, one is an account of the Actions of <hi>Cn. Manlius Volſus</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> which he dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the People of <hi>Rhodes.</hi> Many there are who have given an account of the Wars of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> among which were <hi>Philenius</hi> and <hi>Soſilus</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> who were his Fellow-Soldiers, and liv'd with Him as long as Fortune permitted. He made uſe of <hi>Soſilus</hi> as his Maſter, to Inſtruct Him in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue.</p>
               <p>But now it is time for me to make an end of this Hiſtory, and proceed to the giving an account of the <hi>Roman</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, that comparing each others Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, we may be able to make an Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, which were the Braver Men.</p>

He was a Man of great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Application in Buſineſs; He was a skilful Husbandman, a good Stateſman, a good Lawyer, a great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, a perſwaſive Orator, and none more addicted to Learning. He did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed apply himſelf to Letters ſomething late, yet was there ſcarcely any thing in the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Literature, that he did not perfectly underſtand. From his Youth he exercis'd himſelf in the compoſing of Orations. When he was old, he entertain'd himſelf with writing Hiſtory, of which he left ſeven Books: The firſt contains the Actions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Kings: The ſecond, gives an account of the Founding and Beginning of each City in <hi>Italy,</hi> upon which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon poſſibly he entitles his Books <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines.</hi> In the fourth, he gives a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt <hi>Punick</hi> War, and in the fifth of the ſecond; and of all theſe things he has only given us the Heads or matter of Fact, without engageing in the particular circumſtances of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs:
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:99884:148"/>
After the ſame manner he wrote the reſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Wars, even to the Praetorſhip of <hi>Ser. Galba,</hi> (who has the infamy of pillaging of <hi>Luſitani</hi> fix'd upon his name). In theſe his Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Wars, he did not mention any Commanders, but without any names at all, gave us the naked Event of things. We have given a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account of his Life and manners, in that Hiſtory, which at the Requeſt of <hi>Titus Pomponius Atticus,</hi> we wrote on purpoſe concerning him, to which we remit the Lovers of <hi>Cato.</hi>

                  <hi>POMPONIUS Atticus</hi> was Deſcended of one of the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Houſes in <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Dignity of a Knight was deriv'd down to him from his Anceſtors, being an Honor Inherent in his Family. His Father was an induſtrious Man, and very indulgent towards him; was of a Genius Accomodated to the times, and very ſtudious; As He was a Lover of Learning himſelf, ſo he infus'd thoſe inclinations into his Son; for he train'd
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:99884:149"/>
up his Youth in all thoſe Sciences which his tender Age was capable of: But the Lad, beſides a great docility of Wit, had an extraordinary ſweetneſs of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and Elocution; ſo that he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quickly apprehended what was taught him, but pronounc'd it too with a very agreeable cadence. Theſe Attainments ſo early diſcloſing themſelves, got him an high Reputation, and dazl'd his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries; for he gave brighter hopes of himſelf, then thoſe other Young Gentlemen who were his School-Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows could look ſtedily upon; ſo that his forwardneſs of Example piqu'd them all with generous incitements. Amongſt whom were <hi>L. Torquatus, G. Marius, Caius</hi> his Son, and <hi>M. Cicero,</hi> whom he ſo gain'd to him by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging air of his Converſation, that no Perſon was always ſo dear to them as He himſelf. His Father died in a little time, and he being very young, run a great hazard, by reaſon of his being related to <hi>P. Sulpitius,</hi> who was kill'd when he was Tribune of the People; For <hi>Anicia</hi> who was Coſin German to <hi>Pomponius,</hi> Married <hi>Servius</hi> who was Brother to <hi>Sulpitius;</hi> therefore, after <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitius</hi> was ſlain, and he ſaw the City
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:99884:149"/>
Embaraſs'd with the Commotions of <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> ſo that he could not live with that Port which became his Quality, for the Intereſts of the Citizens were divided, ſome addicting themſelves to the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Cinna,</hi> and others to that of <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> thinking it a fair opportunity to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Studies. He went to <hi>Athens;</hi> But this did not hinder, but that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd Money upon young <hi>Marius,</hi> who was declar'd an Enemy to his Country, and ſupply'd him when he was a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive; and that his withdrawing from <hi>Rome</hi> might not prejudice his Domeſtick Affairs, He convey'd the greateſt part of his Fortune along with him thither. Here he liv'd after that manner, that he was peculiarly belov'd by all the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi> For, beſides the Credit He had acquir'd, which was very great for a Young-Man, He releiv'd them in their Publick Exigents; for when they were to take up Money of the Bankers upon any great Payments, and could not obtain equitable Conditions, He always ſo ſeaſonably interpos'd, that, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded no intereſt for the ſums he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burs'd, ſo he would not let them owe longer then the time they promis'd to refund them; and this procur'd them a
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:99884:150"/>
double advantage, for he would neither ſuffer the Debt to grow upon them by his forbearance, nor the Uſury of it to be multiplied. He made an acceſſion to this Courteſy by another peice of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, for he diſtributed Corn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them all, and gave to each of them ſix buſhels of Wheat, which ſort of meaſure is call'd <hi>Medimnus</hi> by the <hi>Athenians;</hi> Here his carriage was ſo adjuſted, that as He was familiar to thoſe below him, ſo He was equal to thoſe of the firſt Quality. This had that grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influence upon them, that they would have Confer'd all the Honors upon him they poſſibly could, and made him a Citizen; but this offer he refus'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe according to ſome Men's opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; He that is made a Denizon of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther City, forfeits the Freedom of his own. Whilſt he liv'd amongſt them, he always oppos'd their deſign of Erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Statue to him, but he could not hinder it when he was gone; ſo that in his abſence, they Celebrated the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories of him and <hi>Pilia</hi> his Wife, by this laſting ſort of remembrance, even in the moſt Conſecrated places of the City; for in every Concern of the Commonwealth, they always followed
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:99884:150"/>
his Conduct and Advice; therefore it was a partiality of Fortune to him, to be a Native of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was the Seat of the Empire of the World, and that which was his Country was his Miſtreſs too, to whom he was Conſtant in his Obſervances; and it was a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inſtance of his Wiſedom, that when He went to <hi>Athens,</hi> which claims the Preeminence above all other Cities for Antiquity, Humanity, and Learning, they ſhould make choice of him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all Mankind to be their Darl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. When <hi>Sylla</hi> came here out of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as long as he tarried, He had always Young <hi>Atticus</hi> in his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for he was extremely charm'd with his good Parts, and the ſweetneſs of his humor; for He ſpoke <hi>Greek</hi> ſo perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that He ſeem'd to be born in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and had that delicious fluency in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, that it was very apparent, that the ſmoothneſs of it was Natural to him and not Acquir'd; He would repeat Poems in both theſe Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, ſo that nothing could exceed him; this ſo endear'd him to <hi>Sylla,</hi> that he would ſcarce let him be out of his ſight, and he had a great deſire to have brought him away along with him,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:99884:151"/>
but when he endeavor'd to perſwade him to it, <hi>Pomponius</hi> return'd him this anſwer; <hi>Do not, Sir, carry me to Fight againſt thoſe, upon whoſe account I left</hi> Italy, <hi>that I might not bear Arms againſt thy ſelf;</hi> But <hi>Sylla</hi> praiſing the Young Man for the good Offices He had done him, order'd when He went away, that the Preſents which were given him whilſt he was at <hi>Athens</hi> ſhould be carried to his Houſe, as the tokens of his thankfulneſs. Here He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd many years, and tho He beſtow'd as much inſpection upon the Affairs of his Houſe, as became the diligence of one that was Maſter of a Family, and ſpent the reſt of his time either in Study or managing the buſineſs of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> yet He continu'd his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his Fellow-Citizens; For He Canvaſs'd at all their Public Elections, and when any thing of importance was Tranſacted, He was never wanting in his ſolicitations. To <hi>Cicero</hi> He ſhew'd himſelf ſingularly faithful in his laſt extremities, for when He was forc'd to abandon his Country, He gave him <note n="*" place="margin">Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand eighty three Pounds ſix ſhillings and eight pence, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ste<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:99884:151"/>
return'd home, and as I think when <hi>L. Cotta</hi> and <hi>L. Torquatus</hi> were Conſuls. The day of his departure, the whole City of <hi>Athens</hi> ſo deplor'd, that by the tears of their ſorrow they expreſs'd the greatneſs of the love they had for him; He had an Uncle whoſe name was <hi>Q. Caecilius,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, an intimate friend of <hi>L. Lucullus's,</hi> and very Rich, but he was otherwiſe of a moroſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and difficult to be pleas'd; but <hi>Atticus</hi> ſo ſoftued his temper, which was intolerable to every one elſe, that He gain'd his good will, and retain'd it even to a decrepit Age; and then He reap'd the fruits of that Piety, with which He cultivated his ſower humor, for He adopted him and made him Heir to all that he had; which Inheritance amounted to ten <note n="*" place="margin">Eighty three thouſand three hundred thirty three Pounds ſix ſhillings, eight pence, <hi>Sterl.</hi>
                  </note> millions of <hi>Seſterces.</hi> The Siſter of <hi>Atticus</hi> was Married to <hi>Q. Tullius Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Marcus</hi> his Brother was a great promoter of the match; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom and <hi>Atticus</hi> there was a familiarity, even from their being School-Fellows together, and a cloſer friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip maintain'd then with <hi>Quintius;</hi> that from hence we may form a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that in the Unions of that Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the reſemblance of a like diſpoſition
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:99884:152"/>
prevails more then Affinity; <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> too was his boſome-friend, who at that time had the cheif vogue for Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ſo that it was a matter utterly undecided, which lov'd him beſt, either him or <hi>Cicero;</hi> by this means he ſolv'd an inconſiſtence in theſe two Orators, which was a thing not eaſy to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, for tho there was a ſtrong Contraſt betwixt them for Applauſe, yet they never broke out into any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings of one another, but both agreed in eſteeming him. He ſo Comported himſelf in the Commonwealth, that as He was always of the beſt ſide, ſo He had the luck to be thought ſo. But He never was a party in the Civil Wars, for it was his opinion, that thoſe who embarque in quarrels of that nature, have no more Aſcendant over themſelves when the Waves of Sedition work high, then thoſe who commit their Fortunes to a Tempeſt. He never was ambitious of any Honor, tho the acceſs was eaſy to his pretenſions, not only by reaſon of his Credit but his Quality; He ſaw that Men were not ſo fair Candidates for it as their Fore-Fathers, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo profuſe in their Bribes to gain Votes, that the Offices of the Common-wealth
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:99884:152"/>
could not be undertaken, and the Laws kept inviolate, nor could they be diſcharg'd without danger, there being ſuch a general corruption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which Epidemically run through all the City. He never was a purchaſer of any goods that were ſold by outcry, and as He never farmed any of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Revenues, ſo He never was a Surety for them who did. He never manag'd a Criminal Proceſs againſt any one, nor ſubſcrib'd to anothers Accuſation; for He never went to Law, nor had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any difinitive Sentence; When ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Conſuls and Pretors offer'd him Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, He would not follow any of them into their Provinces, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting himſelf with the Honor of the Propoſal, He rejected the profits of it; He denied to go with <hi>Q. Cicero</hi> into <hi>Aſia,</hi> tho he might have been his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General; for He did not think it decent to be in ſubordinate Authority to a Pretor, who had refus'd the firſt Dignity it ſelf; and by this means, He not only Conſulted his Honor, but his eaſe likewiſe, and avoided the leaſt um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brages of a Crime, that He might live unſuſpected; the reſult of this Caution was, that the aſſiſtances he paid his
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:99884:153"/>
freinds were the more acceptable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſincere, when they were the effects only of a readineſs to oblige, and could not be imputed to ſuch ſervile motives as Hope and Fear. When He was about ſixty years old, the Civil War of <hi>Caeſar</hi> burſt out into a flame; but He enjoy'd the priviledge his Age indulg'd him, and never ſtir'd out of the City; But thoſe of his freinds who went over to <hi>Pompey's</hi> ſide, He furniſh'd their Expeditions out of his own Store; but <hi>Pompey</hi> could not think He was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded, if he did not actually joyn him Himſelf, for he had not receiv'd any advantages from him, which might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him to it, as others had done, who by his countenancing them were become Powerful and Rich; ſome of whom followed his Camp, but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret and very unwillingly, and others ungratefully tarried at home, which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry highly offended him. But the Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality of <hi>Atticus</hi> was ſo grateful to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> that when he was Conqueror, and diſpatch'd Imperious Mandates to private Perſons to Command their Mony from them, He not only not moleſted him, but pardon'd his Siſter's Son which ſhe had by <hi>Quintius,</hi> tho he was of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey's</hi>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:99884:153"/>
party; thus by keeping firm to thoſe firſt maximes of Conduct He laid down for the regulation of his Life, He preſerv'd himſelf ſafe from all new and emergent dangers; conſequent to this, when <hi>Caeſar</hi> was ſlain, and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſeem'd to be devolv'd into the hands of <hi>Caſſius</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> the Fortune of <hi>Rome</hi> like a Machine turning about toward him; yet He ſo Careſs'd <hi>Brutus,</hi> that the Young-Man never delighted in any ones Company, tho He was of the ſame Age with himſelf, with that pleaſure as He did in that of the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Atticus;</hi> for He not only admitted him into his moſt intimate Councels, but enjoy'd his Converſation at all his Repaſtes. There was a project ſet on foot, that a fund of Treaſure ſhould be Conſtituted by the <hi>Roman</hi> Kinghts for the Murderers of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> they thought the deſign very feeſible, if the Cheif of that Order, would Contribute their ſhares towards it; whereupon <hi>C, Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> who was a great friend to <hi>Brutus,</hi> apply'd himſelf to <hi>Atticus,</hi> that He would be a principal mover in this Buſineſs; but He, who did courteſies to thoſe He reſpected, without engageing in their Factions, and had always a Temper un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:99884:154"/>
from deſignes of that Nature, made this anſwer, that if <hi>Brutus</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any ſupplies, He would Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date him out of his own Mony to what value he pleas'd, but that he would never diſcourſe with any Man about the Buſineſs, nor accord with him in it; ſo that the united ſentiments of a whole party were ruin'd by his ſingle diſſent. A little while after <hi>Anthony</hi> began to have the upper-hand, and <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> (the Affairs of thoſe Provinces which were given them by the Conſuls, only for form-ſake, becoming deſperate) were forc'd to fly for it. But <hi>Atticus</hi> who never employ'd his Mony to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the other party, when they were moſt flouriſhing, ſent an <note n="*" place="margin">Eight hundred thirty three Pound ſix ſhillings eight pence, <hi>Sterl.</hi>
                  </note> hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Seſterces</hi> to <hi>Brutus</hi> when he left <hi>Italy,</hi> and was broken in his Fortunes; and when He was at <hi>Epire,</hi> He order'd <note n="*" place="margin">Two thouſand five hundred Pounds <hi>Sterl.</hi>
                  </note> 300 thouſand more to be given him, himſelf being Abſent; and as He never the more flatter'd the Power of <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> ſo He never forſook thoſe who were brought to a Precipice. After this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the War of <hi>Modena,</hi> in which if I ſhould only call him Prudent, I ſhould detract from his Character, and ſpeak leſs then I ought to do. He was rather
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:99884:154"/>
Divine, if a Conſtant Natural Goodneſs deſerves that Appellation, which is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhaken nor leſſen'd by outward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents; <hi>Anthony</hi> being declar'd a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Enemy, was forc'd to leave <hi>Italy,</hi> and there was no hopes of being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd; for not only his Adverſaries which were very many, and in a great Power Combin'd againſt him, but his Freinds joyn'd themſelves to that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and Revolted from him; they pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all their hopes of Advancement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Depreſſion; they perſecuted his moſt intimate Freinds, they endeavor'd to ſpoil his Wife <hi>Fulvia</hi> of all her goods, and extirpate his Children. <hi>Atticus</hi> as He was familiar with <hi>Cicero,</hi> ſo He was a great freind to <hi>Brutus;</hi> by this means He not only reſtrain'd them from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any outrage upon <hi>Anthony</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but He Protected as many of his Confederates which fled out of the City, as much as He poſſibly could, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd them with all things they ſtood in need of. He was ſo kind to <hi>P. Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnius,</hi> that greater tenderneſs could not be expected from a Father; and He was ſo diligent in his ſervices to <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> when ſhe was harraſs'd with Law-Suits, and vex'd with melancholy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:99884:155"/>
that ſhe never enter'd into ony Obligation without <hi>Atticus,</hi> for He was her Stipulator in every thing; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly when in her proſperous Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe had bought a parcel of Land, which was to be ſatisfied for to a day, and now ſince this Calamity beſell her, could not take up Caſh enough upon her own credit to diſcharge the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe; <hi>Atticus</hi> came in opportunely to redreſs the greivance, for He lent her Mony without intereſt, or ſo much as prefixing a day when it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payed; for He reckon'd himſelf the greateſt gainer by the Reputation of a grateful and an obliging Man; and thereby make it appear, that He did not Contract an acquaintance with Mens Fortunes but their Perſons. And tho theſe were his Actions, yet no one could imagine He did them out of any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poriſing principle; for it could not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally enter into any one's opinion, that <hi>Anthony</hi> would ever recover that game of Empire He ſeem'd ſo utterly to have loſt; but every now and then He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd ſecret checks from ſome of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, objecting to him, that his hatred was not intenſe enough againſt ſuch profligate Citizens. But He confiding in his own
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:99884:155"/>
Judgment, had a regard rather to what ought to be done, then what other Men would commend, whether it was right or no. For the ſcene of Fortune ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chang'd, and when <hi>Anthony</hi> return'd into <hi>Italy,</hi> every one was in pain for <hi>Atticus;</hi> for they thought He muſt be involv'd in great riſques, by reaſon of the ſtrict Communication that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Cicero;</hi> therefore when the Triumvirate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd the City, He went out of it, for He fear'd Proſcription, and abſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Houſe of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Volumnius,</hi> to whom He was ſo Eminently Serviceable, as we have ſhew'd before. So Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious was the turn of Affairs in thoſe times, that ſometimes one party and ſometimes another, would either be in the height of Proſperity, or the Abyſs of Misfortune. He was not alone in this Retirement, but <hi>Q. Gellius Canius</hi> who was of the ſame Age, and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Him in the Cuſtomes of his Life, was the Companion of his Obſcurity; and this is another inſtance of the good nature of <hi>Atticus,</hi> that He liv'd ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly with him whom He knew from his Childhood, and was his Play-fellow, for their friendſhip grew up with their
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:99884:156"/>
years, and laſted even to an extreme old Age. <hi>Anthony,</hi> tho He was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterately angry with <hi>Cicero,</hi> that He not only declar'd open enmity againſt Him, but threatn'd all his Abettors, and was reſolv'd to Proſcribe them; yet when many made Remonſtrances to Him in the behalf of <hi>Atticus,</hi> and He himſelf call'd to mind the Engagements He had formerly laid upon him, He as ſuddenly Relented; ſo that He Writ to him with his own hand to know where he was, bid him not be afraid, but that he ſhould immediately come to Him, for that He had ſtruck him and <hi>Gellius Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> out of the number of the Proſcrib'd; Beſides He ſent him a Guard to aſſure him in the darkneſs, and free him from the dangers of the Night; by this means his ſears were diſpers'd, and He not only ſecur'd himſelf, but was an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſafety to the Man who was next dear to Him. For He never ſolicited to be out of trouble alone, but in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with his freind, that by this it might appear, that Men who love one another are not to be divided in their Fortunes. If that Pilot therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves applauſe who ſteers his Ship in a Winter Sea, when the Seaſon is as
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:99884:156"/>
rough as the Ocean, why ſhould not his Prudence merit a particular Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium, who arriv'd at ſafety through ſo many Civil broils and ſuch Storms in the State? When He had work'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of theſe diſtreſſes, He was intent upon nothing elſe then how He might Aſſiſt as many as he could, and in what things He was able. When the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umverate ſet a price upon the heads of the Proſcrib'd, that the proſpect of a reward might encourage the Rabble to a ſearch, there was not any one who fled into <hi>Epire</hi> who wanted for any thing; and He gave them liberty to make it their perpetual Reſidence; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, after the Battel at <hi>Philippae,</hi> and the Slaughter of <hi>C.

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:99884:157"/>
any Siniſter deſign, nor was it to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor the preſent current of Affairs; this may be concluded from the things themſelves, and the Complexion of thoſe times; for He never ſided with the Proſperous, but always ſuccour'd thoſe who were in affliction; for He was as Aſſiduous in his reſpects to <hi>Servilia</hi> the Mother of <hi>Bratus</hi> after the Death of her Son, as when he was living and moſt happy. Being ſo Generous He could not well provoke any one to be his Enemy, for He never offer'd an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and if another was the Agreſſor upon Him, He choſe rather to forget then Revenge the Affront; If He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a Civility the impreſſion of it was Immortal, never to be effac'd; but if He confer'd one, it eaſily fell out of his mind, till He that was oblig'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd the memory of it by his acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments; doing after this manner, He confirm'd the truth of that ſaying, <hi>That every one owes his lucky hits to the Conduct of himſelf;</hi> but the making his Fortune, was the laſt thing in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, He firſt form'd his Manners as a previous Qualification, and with ſuch an exquiſite niceneſs, that He might not juſtly be charg'd with any thing
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:99884:157"/>
that was culpable. By this means it came to paſs, that when <hi>M. Vipſanius Agrippa,</hi> who was the Favourite of young <hi>Octavius,</hi> might have had his choice out of the Ladies of the beſt Condition in <hi>Rome,</hi> by reaſon of his own Credit and the Power of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> yet He was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of being related to Him, and deſir'd rather to marry the Daughter of a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, as the nobler Alliance; The cheif Menager of this Match (for it is not to be conceal'd) was <hi>Anthony,</hi> who was one of the Triumvirate for ſetling the Commonwealth. Being ſhin'd upon by his favor, He might have made large Additions to his Eſtate, but He was ſo little infected with the love of Mony, that He never us'd it but in thoſe occaſions where his freind was to be freed from danger, and eas'd of any thing that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoded him. An illuſtrious inſtance of this was in the time of the Proſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for when the Triumvirate had ſold the Goods of <hi>L. Saufeius</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, according to the cuſtom which then obtain'd, who was of the ſame Age with himſelf, had Reſided many years at <hi>Athens</hi> to Study Philoſophy, and had noble Lordſhips in <hi>Italy; Atticus</hi> carried Himſelf in this buſineſs, with ſo much
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:99884:158"/>
Induſtry and Addreſs, that the ſame Meſſenger who brought him word that He had loſt his Patrimony contradicted his own news, by telling him, that He had recover'd it again. He likewiſe clear'd off <hi>L. Julius Calidius,</hi> who I am bold to affirm, after the death of <hi>Lucretius</hi> and <hi>Catullus,</hi> was the moſt Elegant Poet of his time; He was no leſs famous for the integrity of his Morals, and his being Educated in all the beſt Arts; This Man after the Knights were Proſcrib'd, tho He was abſent, yet He was brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the number by <hi>P. Volumnius,</hi> who was Overſeer of the Workmen of <hi>Anthony;</hi> and his great Poſſeſſions in <hi>Africk</hi> made him obnoxious to this puniſhment; So that it made it a puzling queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was more difficulty in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, or Glory in the performance. But it was a Character of <hi>Atticus</hi> general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, that it was his care as much to releive his abſent Freinds as thoſe that were preſent; and He was as good a Father of a Family as He was a Citizen; for tho He was a great Monied-Man, yet no one was ſo moderate a Purchaſer, nor Built leſs then He did; not but that he liv'd very Commodiouſly, and what things He ſerv'd himſelf of, they were the beſt
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:99884:158"/>
of their kind. His Houſe was Situate in the <hi>Quirinal</hi> Hill, which was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance left him by his Uncle, whoſe pleaſantneſs did not conſiſt in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of the Structure, but in the Wood that encompaſs'd it; for being a Pile rais'd after the antient manner, it had more of conveniency in it then beauty; and He never made any Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, but where the decays by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of time requir'd to be repair'd; His Family, if we judge of them by their uſefulneſs, was extraordinary; but if we regard only the outward appearance, it was ſcarce tolerable; for it was made up of Lads who were very good Scholars, could read excellently well, and writ delicate hands for Tranſcribing, and there was ſcarce any Foot-boy but could do either of them to admiration. All the Artificers too, whoſe Art was neceſſary for the Adorning his Apartments, were the choiſeſt of their Profeſsion. And there was not one of them but was born and run through the Novitiate of their ſeveral Trades in his Houſe; which was a ſign not only of his moderation but great induſtry; for not to be intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in our deſires after thoſe things which others ſo eagerly covet, is a great
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:99884:159"/>
continency of temper; and to acquire that by diligence which others are at an expence for, argues a more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Application. <hi>Atticus</hi> was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Polite then Magnificent; He did all things for his Honor, but without any exceſs of coſt; He was always clean and neat, but did not affect an Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate niceneſs. As for his Moveables and Furniture they were Competently Rich, and did not abound; ſo that He avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the two extremes of being ſtingy and profuſe. I will not omit one thing, tho to ſome it may ſeem a matter of light importance, that tho He was one of the moſt Splendid of the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights, and receiv'd Men of all conditions at his Houſe with a Liberal Hoſpitality, yet He ſpent no more then juſt <note n="*" place="margin">Equivalent to ten pounds <hi>Sterl.</hi>
                  </note> three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Aſſes a month, as appears by the regiſter of his Disburſements; and this I do not ſpeak by hearſay, but as a thing I am certain of; for by reaſon of the familiarity betwixt us, I was Converſant in the Family, and was at the caſting up of the Accounts. He had no other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort at all his Feaſts but only a ſingle Reader, which in my opinion was the moſt raviſhing Muſick; nor did he ever Sup without one of theſe Lectures; that
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:99884:159"/>
whilſt their Appetites were Regaled the minds of the Gueſts might be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd with ſomething more diverting; for He never invited any one to his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but in whom he diſcern'd a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition conformable to his own. Tho Riches flow'd in upon him, yet He never heightned his daily Proviſions, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated from the former meaſures of his Life; for He was ſo moderate that when He was worth but <note n="*" place="margin">Sixteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred ſixty ſix pounds thirteen ſhillings and four pence <hi>Sterling.</hi>
                  </note> twenty hundred thouſand <hi>Seſterces,</hi> He did not Live in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloriouſly, which was the Eſtate left him by his Father, ſo when it amounted to <note n="*" place="margin">The ſum total is one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds <hi>Sterl</hi> For theſe reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Roman</hi> Coin to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Standard, I am oblig'd to the Learned Mr. <hi>Wat.</hi>
                  </note> ten millions, He did not raiſe his Port to any greater Affluence then what He firſt deſign'd; for He kept inaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to the ſame pitch, in either fortune. As for his other Recreations, He had no Gardens with Parterres, nor no delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful place to take the air in the Suburbs; He had no Sumptuous <hi>Villa</hi> near the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore, nor indeed in all <hi>Italy,</hi> except it were at <hi>Ardea</hi> and <hi>Nomentum,</hi> which were only two Country-farms; And all the Revenues He had conſiſted in the Lands He had at <hi>Epire,</hi> and ſome Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsions in the City; from whence it may be known, that He did not make his eſtimate of Morry by the immenſe
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:99884:160"/>
quantity, but the rational uſe of it. As He was always a Man of ſtrict veracity himſelf, ſo He abhor'd lying in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; therefore his courteſy was mix'd with ſomewhat that was Auſtere, and He was Affable but Grave; ſo that it was hard to ſay, whether His Freinds Lov'd or Reverenc'd him moſt; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was entreated of him He would promiſe ſolemnly to do it, for it was his opinion that he was not a generous but an inconſtant Man, who would engage for that which He was not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. He was ſo induſtrious in bringing an affair to a reſult which he had once eſpous'd, that He ſeem'd to Tranſact his own concern and not anothers, which was deputed to his Management; and when he had once undertaken a buſineſs, He was unwearied in his purſuits, for he thought his Reputation was Intereſs'd in it, of which he was jealous even to a delicacy; By this means He ſolicited the buſineſs of <hi>Marcus</hi> and <hi>Quintius Cicero,</hi> of <hi>Marius, Cato, Hortenſius, Aulus Torquatus,</hi> and many other <hi>Roman</hi> Knights; from whence we may infer, that it was an effect of his judgement, and did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from any unactive temper, that he declin'd the publick Functions of the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:99884:160"/>
Commonwealth. A greater inſtance of the Complaiſance of his humor cannot be given then this, that when he was a Young-Man He was very agreeable to <hi>Sylla</hi> who was in the decline of his Age, and when himſelf was old <hi>M. Brutus</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely delighted in Him who was in the bloom of his years; He liv'd ſo amicably with his Cotemporaries <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> that it is hard to ſay to which Age his Genius was moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted; but <hi>Cicero</hi> Lov'd him the moſt fervently of the two, for it was to the laſt degree of affection; ſo that his Brother <hi>Quintius</hi> was not dearer or more familiar to Him; the real evidences of it, beſides thoſe Books in which he makes mention of him, which are already pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd, are thoſe ſixteen Volumes of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles which He ſent to <hi>Atticus</hi> from the beginning of his Conſulſhip even to his latter days, which whoſoever reads he will not deſire a more Connected Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of thoſe times; for in them the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and deſigns of Princes, the faults of Generals in their Conduct, and the Revolutions of the Commonwealth, are ſo perſpicuouſly trac'd out, that all the intrigues of State are unravell'd, and the ſprings of Policy ſeem to ly open;
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:99884:161"/>
ſo that from hence we may conclude, that Prudence is a ſort of Divination; For <hi>Cicero</hi> not only pointed out all the accidents of his own time, but with a brisker heat of Propheſy foretold all the events which have happen'd ſince, and we ſenſibly experience. What need I Commemorate any thing more of the Piety of <hi>Atticus?</hi> When I heard Him Glorying thus juſtly of Himſelf, in the Funeral Oration He made upon his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom He buried at ninety years of Age, Himſelf being ſixty-ſeven, that He never had any occaſion to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd to Her, and no difference ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd betwixt Him and his Siſter, who was almoſt of the ſame Age with Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; which are manifeſt indications, either that no cauſes of Diſſatisfaction ever aroſe between them, and ſo there was no need of Cement where nothing was broken; or that He was ſo kind to his Relations, that He thought it even a peice of Irreligion to be angry with thoſe whom He had all the obligations upon Him to Love. And this He did not ſo much by the tender inſtinct of Nature, whoſe ſuggeſtions we are all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequious to, but it was the effect of his Learning, and He acquir'd it by Study;
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:99884:161"/>
for the Precepts of the cheif Philoſophers were cloſely impreſs'd upon him, and they did not ſerve for Parade and oſtentation, but He made them uſeful to him in the whole courſe of his Life. He ſet the Manners of the antient <hi>Romans</hi> before him as the patterns of his imitation, and fairly copied out the great Originals; He was likewiſe a Studious Lover of Antiquity; this knowledge he intimately convers'd with, and gave large demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of it in the Volume He Wrote of Magiſtracy, which was a Province He ingeniouſly adorn'd; for there was not a Law made, no Peace concluded, nor no War undertaken, not an Action of Conſequence done by the <hi>Roman</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but He hath related it with a ſtrict Chronology, and adjuſted every occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to its proper time; and which ſeems an attempt of great intricacy, He hath interwoven in it the Pedigrees of ſome Families, with ſo fine a texture, that by them we may know the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of thoſe Men who have made any conſiderable Figure in <hi>Rome.</hi> He did the ſame thing ſeparately in other Books; as at the entreaty of <hi>M. Brutus,</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd the <hi>Junian</hi> Family from its firſt Source, and ſhew'd all the Channels in
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:99884:162"/>
which it hath flow'd down even to our times; diſtinctly numbring each one's Predeceſtor in a true ſeries of Succeſſion, and relating what Honors they attain'd to, and in what times they enjoy'd them; He did the like courteſy for <hi>Marcellus Claudius</hi> concerning the <hi>Marcelli;</hi> and at the inſtances of <hi>Scipio Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> He gave an account of the <hi>Cornelian,</hi> the <hi>Fabian,</hi> and the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi> Families; and nothing carries with it ſo endearing a reliſh as theſe Books to thoſe who have the leaſt tincture of curioſity to be acquainted with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents of Illuſtrious Men; He had a ſmattering too in Poetry, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive was, that He might not be ignorant what ſweetneſs there was in it; for if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had arriv'd to a higher pitch of Dignity beyond the ordinary <hi>Romans,</hi> or had ſignaliz'd themſelves by any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table performances, He employ'd his Poetical Talent to Record their Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; for He deſcrib'd their Exploits, and what Charges they had in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under each of their Pictures, and this in no more then four or five Verſes, which ſeems a thing almoſt incredible, that He could compriſe tranſactions of ſuch high moment in ſo narrow a
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:99884:162"/>
compaſs. He Writ a Book alſo in <hi>Greek</hi> concerning the Conſulſhip of <hi>Cicero.</hi> Theſe things we have related of him were whilſt <hi>Atticus</hi> was alive; but now ſince the malignity of fate will have us to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live Him, we will run through the reſt of his Actions and diſpatch what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of this Great Man; that by real and bright examples, we may inſtruct the Reader, and ſo confirm that axiome we have before laid down, <hi>That every one allures Fortune to his ſide according as He manageth himſelf;</hi> for <hi>Atticus</hi> contenting himſelf with the Paternal Dignity of a Knight which deſcended to him, He at laſt came to be related to the Son of <hi>Julius,</hi> and the friendſhip between them was heightned into Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for He had before gain'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> by the elegancy of his Living; and this was the inducement by which He attracted others of the cheifeſt rank in the City to his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, who were of as Noble an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction as the Emperor, but their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was unequal, becauſe not ſo proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous; for Fortune ſeem'd to fawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and ſo conſtant a ſucceſs ſtill followed him, that all the Honors ſhe ever decreed to any of her Favourites, ſhe
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:99884:163"/>
confer'd upon Him, and with her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious gales convey'd Him to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Honor which the ambition of a Citizen could aſpire to. <hi>Agrippa</hi> made <hi>Atticus</hi> a Grandfather, who married his Daughter when ſhe was a tender Virgin; this Female-Infant, tho ſhe was ſcarce a year old, <hi>Caeſar</hi> betroth'd to <hi>Tiberius Claudius Nero,</hi> which his Wife <hi>Druſilla</hi> had by a former Husband, and was his Son-in-Law; this Alliance confirm'd their former Amity, and tied it on with an inviolable Sanction. Tho before theſe Eſpouſals, not only when He was abſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> when he writ to any of his Freinds, He ſent to <hi>Atticus</hi> even the minutes of his Life, as what he was then doing, eſpecially what Author he was reading, in what place He reſided, and how long he deſign'd to tarry there; but likewiſe when He was in the City, and was diſtracted by multiplicity of buſineſs, which gave him ſo great Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, that He could not enjoy him ſo often as he would, yet the commerce of the Pen was not interrupted, for no day paſs'd in which He did not by Letter ask his opinion in ſome matters relating to Antiquity, or propoſe ſome Poetical queſtion; ſometimes He would be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetious
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:99884:163"/>
only and rally him, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers in which He Reparteed might be the more prolix which had this good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that when the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Feretrius,</hi> which <hi>Romulus</hi> built in the Capitol, through Age and Peoples being incurious of its repairs, began to threaten a total ruin, <hi>Caeſar</hi> by the perſwaſion of <hi>Atticus</hi> took care to ſupport it. <hi>M. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> had him in no leſs paſſionate eſteem, and maintain'd an intercourſe with him of this nature; for when he was baniſh'd even to the extreme limits of the Empire, yet He certified his <hi>Atticus</hi> to a nice punctilio of what he was then upon, and what deſign He had in farther Projecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; He only is qualified to judge of the greatneſs of this Correſpondence, who can make a true eſtimate what a peice of Conſummate Wiſdom it is to retain the favor, and reconcile the jealouſies of two great Perſonages, who were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors in the ſame Ambition, betwixt whom there was not only a bare Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but a perſect Antipathy, which kindled into the mutual upbraiding one another; it was an Averſion as ſtrong as could poſsibly be between an <hi>Anthony</hi> and a <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who would not divide the Globe, but each one contended not only
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:99884:164"/>
to be Maſter of <hi>Rome,</hi> but Emperor of the World. Through all theſe Traverſes of Life, He at laſt arriv'd to the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſeventh year, and his Credit and Riches multiplied upon him even to an extreme old Age; (for many left him all that they had, purely upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his wonderful Goodneſs.) But now after He had been of ſo ſtrong a Complexion that he had no need of a Phyſitian for thirty years together, his health was ſo entire, He at laſt contracted a Diſeaſe which Himſelf and his Doctors at firſt deſpis'd as a very ſlight indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, for they thought it to be a <note n="*" place="margin">This is a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs endeavor of nature to eaſe her ſelf, occaſion'd by a defluxion of ſharp humots, the which irrirate the Sphinctor of the Anus.</note> 
                  <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſmus,</hi> therefore they adminiſtred quick and eaſy applications, to diſperſe it in its firſt acceſſes. After He had lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd three months, without any more ſenſible uneaſineſs then what He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from the methods of his cure, the whole weight of his diſtemper ſunk at laſt into one of his guts, which broke out afterwards into a very putrid Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula; But before this Criſis hapned to Him, when he found his pains to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and his blood grow warm, He order'd his Son-in-Law <hi>Agrippa</hi> to be ſent for, with <hi>L. Cornelius Balbus</hi> and <hi>Sextus Peducaeus;</hi> when He ſaw that
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:99884:164"/>
they were come, leaning upon his Couch he ſpoke to them after this manner; <hi>What care I have taken for the preſervation of my health, ſince you all can abundantly atteſt, a diſcourſe of that nature will be altogether ſuperfluous; Hoping therefore that I have given you ſatisfaction, and being Conſcious to my ſelf, that I have omitted nothing which carried the leaſt tendency in it towards a cure; it only remains now that I more nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult my ſelf, and this is the thing I would acquaint you with, that I am reſolv'd no longer to nouriſh my diſeaſe but ſtarve it; for the ſuſtenance I have taken theſe laſt days hath protracted my Life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but it hath prolong'd my afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with at, without any hopes of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. I therefore beg it of you, that you would firſt approve of my expedient, and then uſe no arguments to diſſwade me from it, for it will be all in vain.</hi> He ſpoke this with ſuch a ſtrong voice, and ſuch an aſſur'd Countenance, as if He was not leaving the World, but paſsing from one Houſe into another. But <hi>Agrippa</hi> with tears in his eyes kiſsing him, did not only entreat but earneſtly Conjur'd him not to Accelerate his fate himſelf, but let nature bring it leiſurely upon him;
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:99884:165"/>
and ſince there were remains of health which would in Life keep ſome time longer, that He would ſuffer himſelf to ſurvive both for his own ſake and that of his Freinds; but He rejected his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitles with an obſtinate ſilence. Thus after two days rigid abſtinence his Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor went of without any Paroxyſmes, and all the Symptomes were manifeſtly abated: but He thinking it not worth the while to live, would not recede from his firſt purpoſe, therefore the fifth day after he had taken up this fatal reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion He departed this Life, which was the day before the Kalends of <hi>April, L. Domitius</hi> and <hi>C. Soſius</hi> being Conſuls. His body was brought forth in a Litter, as He himſelf had order'd, without any Funeral Pomp; but all the beſt Men of the City accompanied the Corps with a numerous Concourſe of the Common People; He was buried five miles from <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Appian</hi> way, in the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Q. Caecilius</hi> his Uncle.</p>
