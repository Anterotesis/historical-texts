         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN EXHORTATION OF THE Friends and Brethren of London TO ALL YOUTHS and YOUNG MEN; VVho are Children of Friends, and Apprentices, or have been Apprentices to Friends, who are Convinc'd in their Judgments of the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> and inhabiting in and about this City.</head>

            <p>WE whom the Lord hath made ſenſible of his Everlaſting Day, and given a ſight of the Glory thereof unto, cannot but be ſenſible of a Great Care upon our ſpirits for the Preſerving the Honour and Glory of that Bleſſed Day of God, from being again any wayes Vailed or Darkned by any thing on our parts, that is contrary thereunto: And this Care and Tenderneſs doth not only extend to keep us Watchful and Diligent in our own Particulars, but to have a Watchful Eye over Others, who do profeſs the ſame Name and Truth with us; deſiring from our very Hearts, That as it hath pleaſed God to Viſit us with his Everlaſting Love, and to make his Power ſhine forth in this our Generation, ſo the Generations to come may know the ſpreading and Encreaſe of the ſame, as we have done; which cannot be, but by a True, Diligent, Watchful Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Light of the Lord Jeſus, which was unto us, and will be unto God's People in all Ages, the Morning-Star, which leads unto the Day of Salvation: And while our Minds are exerciſed concerning theſe things, To our great Grief we ſee many Youths and Young Men (who are Children of Friends, &amp; Apprentices, or have been Apprentices to Friends) who are Convinced in their Judgments of the Way of Truth, and are called to be the Plants of the next-coming Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to witneſs forth the Brightneſs of the Day of the Lord, and to Honour him in a Holy Converſation: Who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great Love of God ſhewed to them, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king known his Love and Way of Truth to them, in their Tender Years, yet do not Anſwer the Love of God to them, as they ought to do, nor Walk Cloſely with the Lord in his Way of Holineſs, nor have had regard unto the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Covenants unto which they in their Indentures have Conſented, which Truth would have taught to have performed with a diligent Reſpect and Care unto the Equity thereof: But on the contrary, many hold a Profeſſion of the Bleſſed Truth in a Traditional Belief and Notion of the Good Teſtimonies which the Lord's People have born, and do not ſink down into Lowlineſs of mind, as becomes the Goſpel; but grow Heady and Stubborn, and are puffed up in Knowledge, and are Exalted above the Croſs, and ſo let that Nature at Liberty unto which the Croſs was and is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; and then that Nature leads into Looſneſs and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, and into Pride and Headineſs, and Covenant-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king both with God and Man, as well under a Profeſſion of Truth, as under any other Profeſſion, from which they ſeem to ſtand ſeparated; and this hath brought Diſhonour to the Name of our God; and by thus Walking, many good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have been Diſhonoured, and Maſters Wronged, and Truth Reproached, and the Holy Spirit of God in his People Grieved many a time.</p>
            <p>Therefore we do in the Name and Power of God, in which we ſtand Witneſſes for God, exhort and admoniſh all Young Men, who do profeſs the precious Truth of God, that they be Careful and Diligent in their Places, as becomes the Truth; and that they be Obedient unto their Parents and Maſters, as God hath commanded; and that they take heed of breaking thoſe Good and Wholſom Rules and Orders, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which themſelves have Subſcribed; for, Covenant-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers the Lord will Judge. And we do exhort all Young Men, That they Honour the Truth in their Places, as becomes their Profeſſions, that ſo they may Anſwer the Power of God, &amp; live in it, by which they may come to be ſenſible of the Life and Unity that is in the Church of Chriſt. And we do truly deſire, That the Power may be brought over the Rebellious Stubborn Nature, and a Stop thereby may be put to the Extravagant Courſes taken by ſome profeſſing the Truth: And therefore, if any Young Men, who do hear this our Exhortation, doth not ſubmit thereunto, but do hereafter walk Looſly and Diſorderly, either in Diſobeying their Parents who walk in the Truth, or in Wronging, or being Unfaithful to their Maſters, or in Spending their Time in Idleneſs or in Evil Company, and bringing Diſhonour upon the Truth of God, and will not hear the Wholſom Counſel of their Parents and Maſters, &amp; reform their Evil Courſes; then we deſire that ſuch Fathers and Maſters may acquaint a few Staid Sound Friends with the Matter in time, who may deal with ſuch Young Men in the Counſel and Wiſdom of God; and if they will not hear their Admonition, that then they may acquaint the Monethly Meeting therewith, that ſo ſuch may be procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt; and if they will not yet Hear and Reform, that Truth may be cleared of ſuch Diſorderly Walkers, and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony may be given out againſt them, that their Profeſſing the pure Truth may be no Cloak to their Unrighteous Actions, nor no Stumbling-Block may be laid by them in the way of them who believe not: But that the Teſtimony of God may be kept Pure, as we received it in the Beginning, and may be committed Pure unto the Generations to come.</p>
