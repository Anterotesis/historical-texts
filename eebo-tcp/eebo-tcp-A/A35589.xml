            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>CASE,</hi> as Sir <hi>William Aſhton</hi> puts it, is, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William Aſhton</hi> hath a Letter from his Majeſty to the Lords Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<note place="margin">Letter dated 3. Novemb. 1660.</note> of <hi>Ireland</hi> to paſs Letters Patents under the great Seal, to make him ſecond Juſtice of the Kings Bench there. Dated the <hi>3 Novem. 1660.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Jerom Alexander</hi> hath a like Letter to make him ſecond Juſtice of the Court of Common Pleas in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Dated <hi>30 Novemb. 1660.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Several Letters Pattents paſs to each accordingly, both Dated, the 19 of<note place="margin">Letter dated 30. Novemb. 1660.</note> 
               <hi>January 1660.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both Letters Pattents are preſented to the Lord Chancellor, at the ſame time,<note place="margin">Both Letters Patents dated <hi>30. Jan. 1660.</hi>
               </note> both being in place.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Jerom Alexander</hi> demands Precedency, and to be firſt ſworn, as Antient to Sir <hi>William Aſhton</hi> in the Inns of Court in <hi>England,</hi> and an utter Barreſter before him.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William Aſhton</hi> demands Precedency, and to be firſt ſworn, as he was made ſecond Juſtice of the Court of Kings Bench: as having a Precedency before the Court of Common Pleas, and as his Letter from the King, was of a prior date.</p>
            <p>The Lord Chancellor inquires of the Officers of the Courts then attending his Lordſhip what the practiſe therein had formerly been, and being informed by them<note place="margin">Mr.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Patrick Tallant.</note> (one of whom was the moſt eminent Attorney in the Court of Common Pleas) that the Precedency had alwaies been given formerly to the ſecond Juſtice of the Kings Bench. Thereupon ordered Sir <hi>William Aſhton</hi> to be firſt ſworn with a <hi>ſalvo Jure</hi> to Sir <hi>Jerom Alexander</hi> if any he had.</p>
            <p>The firſt queſtion is to whom the right of Precedency belonged at firſt: To Sir <hi>Jerom Alexander,</hi> as antient to Sir <hi>William Aſhton</hi> in the Inns of Court; or to Sir <hi>William Aſhton,</hi> either in reſpect of being ſecond Juſtice of the Kings Bench; or as having his Majeſties Letter of a Prior date.</p>
            <p>The ſecond queſtion is: whether Sir <hi>William Aſhton</hi> being <hi>(de facto)</hi> firſt ſworn ought not to have the Precedency as Senior Judge, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>(Salvo Jure)</hi> to Sir <hi>Jerom Alexander.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhall agree it to be the Caſe in all things, but in this one thing only, which is matter of Fact and reſteth in Proof.</p>
            <p>And I do affirm, that it was not all the Officers of the Courts there preſent
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97435:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that did affirm, that the Precedency had alwaies béen formerly given, to the ſecond<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants</hi> teſtimony un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand, of the 20 of <hi>Decem. 1661.</hi> in haec <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba.</hi> When the Right Honorable the Lord Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor demanded of me who ſhould be firſt ſworn, Sir <hi>Jer. Alexander,</hi> or Sir <hi>William Aſhton,</hi> I repaired down the ſtairs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of thoſe whom I conceived better to give an account of that matter then my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf. And meeting below the ſtairs with Coll. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Knight;</hi> I put the queſtion unto him. Who anſwered me, that the ſecond Judge of the Kings Bench was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſworn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſecond Judge of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pleas. And thereupon I came up again, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the ſame. <hi>Pa. Tallant.</hi>
               </note> Juſtice of the Kings Bench (nor is it ſo, but the contrary.) But my Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor directed Mr. <hi>Tallant</hi> (who is that Eminent officer of the Court of Common Pleas, mentioned by Sir <hi>William Aſhton</hi> in the draught of his Caſe) to inquire how the practiſe had formerly béen: And he méeting with one Collonel <hi>Knight;</hi> inquired of him, who told him ſo; and upon that ſingle diſcourſe with Collonel <hi>Knight,</hi> without any conference had with any other of the Officers there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and without any knowledge that he had thereof himſelf: Mr. <hi>Tallant</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns my Lord Chancellor that anſwer. And thereupon my Lord ſwears Sir <hi>William Aſhton</hi> firſt, with a <hi>Salvo Jure</hi> to me.</p>
            <p>Now albeit this makes nothing for Sir <hi>William Aſhton</hi> in the Caſe. When I ſhall make the contrary to appear. Yet I cannot admit of it: becauſe it is not the truth.</p>
            <p>And therefore if my Lord Chancellor ſhall not; upon hearing what we can ſay for ourſelves, be pleaſed to determine the difference, but ſhall think fit to tranſmit it for <hi>England,</hi> I ſhall humbly deſire thoſe words may be left out, and the Eaſe made no otherwiſe, then as it was: and that Mr. <hi>Tallant</hi> may be called to declare his teſtimony to this relation in the Caſe.</p>
            <p>But if in the Courſe of my Argument, I make the contrary to appear; all that allegation of Sir <hi>William Aſhtons,</hi> will be out of doors: and fall of itſelf without any more ado.</p>
            <p>So I ſhall proceed to argue the points of his Caſe. And ſhall begin to argue his ſecond point firſt, as moſt material.</p>
            <p>For if the <hi>Salvo Jure</hi> to me, ſhall operate nothing, we are at an end. The firſt point will never come in queſtion.</p>
            <p>For if Sir <hi>William Aſhton</hi> being <hi>(de facto)</hi> firſt ſworn, therefore ought to have the Precedency as Senior Judge: Notwithſtanding the <hi>Salvo Jure</hi> to me. Then the controverſie is at an end.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſhall indeavour in the firſt place to probe that this <hi>(Salvo Jure)</hi> doth ſéeme to me my right of Precedency: Notwithſtanding that <hi>(de facto)</hi> Sir <hi>William Aſhton</hi> was firſt ſworn. As this Caſe is.</p>
            <p>And howſoever Sir <hi>William Aſhton</hi> have made this a queſtion in the Caſe. Yet I preſume he is ſo much a Gentleman, and ſo conſcientions of his waies, that if he ſhall be ſatisfied; that the right of Precedency did belong to me to be firſt ſworn, as we ſtood unſworn; that he will not take advantage of his own wrong, and kéep that right from me, which he ſhould ſo gain by a falſe ſuggeſtion.</p>
            <p>But I doubt not but to make it clearly to appear.</p>
            <p>1 Firſt that the <hi>Salvo Jure</hi> in the Caſe, have ſecured unto me, what right of Precedency I had to be firſt ſworn; (as we ſtood unſworn.)</p>
            <p>2 Secondly That the right of Precedency to be firſt ſworn did properly belong to me; as we ſtood unſworn. Notwithſtanding his being made ſecond Judge of the Kings Bench: And notwithſtanding the Prior date of his letter.<note place="margin">My Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor the proper Judge of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt I conceive that Sir <hi>William Aſhton</hi> will not deny, but that my Lord Chancellor is the proper. Judge of this controverſie, and ſo have power of doing right unto us both. This is ſo undeniable a truth, as it néeds no other proof, but aconſtant uſage and cuſtom as through all England, ſo throughout all <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> which is the Common Law. For thoſe cuſtoms and uſages, which are uſed and accoſtomed: <hi>Per totam Angliam, &amp; per totam Hiberniam,</hi> are the Common Laws of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the uſual practiſe, and courſe in theſe Caſes have béen; That the Lords<note place="margin">The Judges Oath ſettled by the Stat. of <hi>18. E. 3.</hi>
               </note> Chancellors of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> have conſtantly, and continually uſed to ſwear the Judges to exerciſe their Offices; according to that Oath preſcribed by the Statute of <hi>18. E. 3.</hi> Before they enter upon the execution of their places,</p>
            <p>So that, Albeit it be the Letters Pattents which makes him a Judge; yet without this ceremony of firſt ſwearing him to be faithful to his truſt, &amp;c. He cannot take upon him the execution of that Office.</p>
            <p>The King is <hi>Fons Juſtitiae;</hi> and as <hi>Kitchin</hi> ſayes, at firſt did juſtice to his people in his own perſon. As <hi>Moſes</hi> did; in the time of the old Law, until <hi>Jethro</hi>
               <note place="margin">The King is <hi>Fons Juſtitiae. Kitchin.</hi>
               </note> adviſed him, to depute Judges under him for leſſer matters, to eaſe him ofſo great a burthen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:97435:2"/>Thus our Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> of their Prerogative Royal, have the<note place="margin">The King have the ſole nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of his Judges</note> ſole denomination, and appointment of their Judges. Whoſe Offices being granted to them by Letters Pattents under the Great Seal: Yet the Lord Chancellor delivers them to them, and not before they have taken the Oaths of Judges as a Feoffment in Fee without livery and Seizin, takes no effect. So this Oath is as a Livery and Seizin, to give them poſſeſſion of their places. <note place="margin">A feoffment in fee without livery &amp; ſeizin, takes no effect.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord Chancellor may perform this office as he pleaſes; yet moſt regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 'tis done in that Court, where the party is made a Judge: The Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor ſitting there in perſon, and calling the party before him, &amp; advertiſing him of the Kings favour and pleaſure; cauſes the Letters Pattents to be read, then <note place="margin">The manner how Judges ars uſſually ſworn.</note> gives him the Oath, then admoniſheth him concerning his truſt; how he ought to be faithful in that, and how to carry himſelf; then ſets him in his ſeate, and there leaves him.</p>
            <p>My Lord Chancellor of <hi>England</hi> too, is the prime Agent in making of Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants<note place="margin">The Lord Chancellor of <hi>England</hi> a prime agent in making of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants at Law.</note> at Law; out of which the Judges there are ſtill choſen by the King, and there he cannot be a Judge, that is not firſt a Serjeant. <hi>Forteſcue. 120.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Forteſcue</hi> ſome times Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> deſcribes the manner of calling of Serjants in thoſe daies.</p>
            <p>The Lord chief Juſtice of the common Bench, by the councel and aſſent of all the reſt of the Judges, have uſed to choſe ſeven or eight of the diſcréeteſt perſons, that <note place="margin">Forteſcue <hi>de laudibus le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum Angliae 117.</hi>
               </note> have moſt profited in the ſtudy of the Laws, to be called Serjeants, preſenting their names unto the Lord Chancellor in writing; who by vertue of the Kings writ, which he iſſueth, he chargeth every of the perſons elect, to be before the King, at a day by him aſſigned, to take upon him the ſtate and degrée of a Serjeant, <note place="margin">The manner of calling of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants at Law.</note> under a penalty in the Writ mentioned; at which day the Lord Chancellor ſwears them, &amp;c and ſo inveſts them in their degrees of Serjeants.

               </note> Then in <hi>England,</hi> we know there are four Inns of Court, and eight Inns of Chancery; two Inns of Chancery appropriate to every Inns of Court. Where that all thoſe that profeſs the Law (under the degrees of Serjeants; for they <note place="margin">Four Inns of Court, eight Inns of Chancery in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

            <p>And antiently, every one that intended the practiſe of the Law, was firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of one of the Inns of Chancery; and began his ſtudies there, where by converſe with Officers, Attourneys, and Clerks belonging to the Courts of Law, they gained much knowledge and experience, in the practique part of the Law, which made their ſtudies much more eaſie, and made them much the better to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Theory of it, in their books, and fitted them much the better for the practiſe of it afterwards.</p>
            <p>Nor was it time loſt to ſtudy there; not only for the reaſons aforeſaid. but of great benefit and advantage alſo, For that every Inns of Court, having two of the Inns of Chancery appropriate to it, they uſually ſent them Readers from amongſt

And then every Inns of Court alſo ſent two ſtudents, of the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, under the barr; for to argue likewiſe the readers caſe, there in the ſaid Inns of chancery. And in this way, antiently were all our famous Judges of <hi>England</hi> bred; and whoſe judgments we now reverence. as Preſidents for imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And then, when after they came from thence to the Inns of court; they had ſome of that time allowed them which they had ſpent in the Inns of chancery, in their ſtudies for promotion unto the Barr.</p>
            <p>Then every Judge in <hi>England,</hi> was firſt a ſtudent in ſome one of the four Inns of Court, and after ſeven years ſtudy, was by the Benchers, who are the Gove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours<note place="margin">Carys Caſe in Noys Rep. 107.</note> of thoſe houſes; called to the Barr, and admitted to practiſe as a counce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor at Law; then was a Bencher, then a Reader, then a Serjeant, then a Judge.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>England,</hi> no man can be admitted for to practiſe as a Lawyer, before he hath been called to the Barr. For in <hi>Noy's</hi> Reports, in <hi>Carys</hi> caſe? it is there delivered for Law, that by the courſe of the common Law, a man may not give<note place="margin">The Inns of Court no bodyes politique.</note> councel or advice, until he hath béen called to the barr; no, though he hath Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters pattents, enabling him to do ſo, as fully as if he had béen called to the Barr.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ſtudy of the Law a noble ſtudy.</note> And though the Inns of court be no Bodyes Politique, incorporate by letters pattents to plead, and be impleaded by any name; yet by the common law of <hi>England,</hi> which are the common cuſtoms of the land; they have gained ſuch a <note place="margin">The ſtudy of the Law qualifies men for other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments both at home and abroad though they make, it not their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> power to themſelves, that within their ſeveral ſocieties, they have the power of an order and Government, to promote the noble ſtudy of the law, in the beſt way they ſhall think fit.</p>
            <p>And therefore the more noble; becauſe almoſt all the Nobility and Gentry of the land, for the moſt part have their education there; as it were an Vniverſity or ſchool of all commendable qualities, requiſite for Noblemen and Gentlmen; where thoſe that will not make it their profeſſion, yet do exerciſe themſelves, in <note place="margin">They have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees given in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>And as in the Vniverſities, he that is firſt matriculated, and ſo received into the fellowſhip of the Vniverſity, hath the Precedency of all that come after him. So it is in the Inns of court. All ſtudents take their places according to their admittances into thoſe ſocieties, whereof they are made members: Which is done by the ſeveral Benchers of thoſe houſes, to whom they are preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>And as this admittance, and the receiving thereof, gives us Precedency in the houſe, at all méetings and exerciſes within the houſe, ſo it doth abroad. As at all readings in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Inns of chancery, whether two from every of the four hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are ſent to argue the Readers caſe: There every man takes his ſeniority, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he hath béen admitted, in any of the Inns of court without diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">The degree of the bar gives ſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority to all that ſlip their time.</note>

            <p>Where eleven Serjeants were called by Writ, in the life time of Quéen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> and before the return of the Writ, the Quéen dyes, and King <hi>James</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeds; and afterwards new Writs do iſſue, to call them in the reign of King <hi>James,</hi> returnable at a day certain; and afterwards other Writs iſſue of a later<note place="margin">The Letters gives nothing of Precedency, in reſpect of the date one before another for the teſte of a Serjeants Writ one before another gives no right of Precedency in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the degree.</note> 
               <hi>teſte.</hi> To call three more, <hi>viz. Snigg, Shurley,</hi> and <hi>Hutton,</hi> returnable at the ſame time with the other eleven; all come to the Bar together to take their Oaths, according to their Seniorities; notwithſtanding the ſeveral teſtes of their Writs one before another.</p>
            <p>And Sir <hi>John Crook,</hi> whom I knew afterwards a Judge in the Kings Bench, being one of that call, who having formerly been Speaker in the houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Parliament: And therefore had Precedency before all Councellors at the Bar; and would therefore have béen ſenior, of all that call of Serjeants, which was much laboured for him at Court; yet being puiſne to five of them, was ſworn after them, according to his ſeniority.</p>
            <p>Whereby it appears, that it was not the prior Teſte of the Writs, nor his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of having been Speaker of the houſe of Commons, that gained any thing of priority one before another. But their ſeniorities one before another, as they ſtood unſworn; which ſettled them in their Precedency one before another; as they ſtood in their degrees one before another. And this is a ſtronger caſe then Sir <hi>William Aſhtons:</hi> In as much as a Writ which is an eſſential part of the call, is more towards the degree, then his Majeſties pleaſure barely ſignified by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.<note place="margin">Objection, that albeit it may be ſo in <hi>England,</hi> yet not in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>But then it may be objected; that albeit this may be granted to be the order and rule in <hi>England;</hi> yet it is not ſo in <hi>Ireland.</hi> For here are no Inns of Court, here are no degrees taken of Barreſters, Benchers and ſerjeants at Law; Nor are the Judges here made from amongſt that order of ſerjeants at Law; but of ſuch whom the King pleaſeth to nominate, and appoint for that ſervice. And then Sir <hi>William Aſhton</hi> being appointed firſt to be a Judge of the Kings Bench, ought to take place of me; as declared after him to be a Judge in the Common Bench.<note place="margin">The ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law that governs <hi>England</hi> alſo <hi>Ireland</hi> is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by it.

And in the twenty ſixt year of his reign, he ſent King <hi>John</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> with a great train of young gallants.

            </p>
            <p>Then afterwards, in the twelfth year of his reign, he came again into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and brought along with him many learned men in the Law, and other Officers and Miniſters of all ſorts; and eſtabliſhed the form of Civil Government, to be according to the Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that he not only introduced the Law; but we may conceive, ſettled Judges (which in the Hiſtory goes by the names of learned men.)

            <p>This being thus; it follows; that the ſame Rules and Orders of procéeding, in making Judges and other Officers; and procéedings in the Courts of Law ſhould be the ſame, as well in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as in <hi>England.</hi>

               </gap>ant in one of the Inns of court, within the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> ſtudying, practiſing, and indeavouring themſelves the beſt they can, to come to the true knowledge and jvdgment of the ſaid laws; upon pain of one hundred ſhillings to every perſon, or perſons offending contrary to the Proviſo laſt before ſpecified, or any thing therein contained.</p>
            <p>Now upon this ſtatute I do obſerve.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That it was made in a time of Popery. When all Lawyers then were Papiſts; and had liberty to plead in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> And yet it was not thought fit, that any man ſhould practiſe the law, that had not ſtudied to make himſelf able for the exerciſe of the ſame profeſſion. And therefore the ſtatute calls them, that ſhould be thus admitted to plead, men learned in the laws; and men cannot be learned in the laws, without ſtudying the laws.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe they had no Inns of court in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Though by the introduction of the common law into <hi>England,</hi> it is conceived they had the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97435:5"/>
of erecting Inns of court, and Inns of chancery as in <hi>England;</hi> yet wanting the means to do it; for to avoid barbariſme and neſcience, or ignorance in the practiſe of the Law: They make this ſtatute to compel thoſe that ſhould profeſs the Law in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to run the courſe of their ſtudies in the Inns of Court, firſt in <hi>England;</hi> and therefore are in <hi>England</hi> to be called to the barr before they plead. And this ſhews likewiſe that they are two diſtinct Kingdomes, though governed by the like Laws. And that it was ſomething doubtful before this Law was made; whether a Barreſter of <hi>England</hi> might practiſe here in <hi>Ireland,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leave and licence of the State.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That howſoever this blank—for the years of their ſtudies how many they ſhall be; happens to be in this ſtatute; yet certainly it cannot be intended a leſſer number of years then ſeven years; which are the number of years that men uſually ſtudy the Laws in <hi>England,</hi> before they be called to the Barr; and then all Lawyers were Papiſts, and yet could not practiſe the Law as a Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, without firſt being called to the Barr. And then again, the word (compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) immediatly following the blank, doth inſinuate the ſame thing: According to the rules and orders of thoſe Inns of Court, where they were to compleat their ſtudies.</p>
            <p>And it is but reaſonable and juſt, that a man ſhould ſpend ſo many years for to acquire the underſtanding, and knowledge of ſo honorable a Science and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; when as an Apprentice to every trade, and Mechanical occupation, is by the Law tyed to ſerve ſeven years, before he can be made free to exerciſe his trade or occupation.</p>
            <p>And Laws are called, <hi>Libertates, quia liberos facit,</hi> becauſe they make a man<note place="margin">

            <p>In reſpect of the dangers, which they themſelves run alſo, and may incur otherwiſe. For be that will take upon him to uſe a trade in which he hath no<note place="margin">Fitz. Na. br. 9. imperitia eſt maxima mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum poena &amp; quoſlibet quaerit inqualibet arte pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritos. Coke 11.

For men ought to be skilful, before they undertake ſuch faculties.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Scientia, we ſay non habet inimicum praeter ignorantem:</hi> Ignorance, is the greateſt enemie to ſcience. For theſe, are like blind men ſhooting at a Crow, if they kill her, it is by chance: They are like <hi>ignes fatui,</hi> commonly leading men out of the way; whiles they ſhine bright in their eyes. The proverb is true in this alſo. Money makes this man. But as 'tis ſaid of the Nightingale; he is <hi>Vox &amp; praeterea nihil;</hi> a ſound and nothing elſe.</p>
            <p>And 'tis againſt the rule of the common Law, for one tradeſman to take up anothers trade, in which he never ſerved.</p>
            <p>And 'tis obſervable alſo, that Barreſters are called Apprentices to the Law;<note place="margin">Barreſters at Law called Apprentices</note> becauſe they ſerve as Apprentices ſeven years, before they attain the Barr.</p>
            <p>And much rather it ought to be ſo, as the ſtudy of the Law is far more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, then it can be for a man to learn a mechanical trade and occupation. And how can a blind man judge of colours? It were a fooliſh preſumption, if a lapida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhould undertake to ſtate the value and luſtre of a Jewel that is lockt up, before he opens the Cabinet.</p>
            <p>It is alſo neceſſary, that thoſe that ſtudy the law, ſhould be firſt called to the barr, before they be admitted to plead, and make the law their profeſſion; as wel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And there is another ſtatute in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which if I underſtand it aright, takes away that objection, or ſcruple of conſcience rather; why they are ſo nice to take the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, as they are penned in the ſtatut which commands the taking of them: and which all Proteſtant Lawyers, I ſay do take before they be admitted to the Barr.</p>

The Caſe of Tenures upon the commiſſion of defective titles. Some of the Judges now, being Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges then; and can witneſs it <hi>viva voce,</hi> if néed be.</p>
            <p>The Caſe was this.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> by Commiſſion under the great Seal, dated the ſecond day of <hi>March</hi> in the fourth year of his reign, did authoriſe certain Commiſſioners to grant the Mannour of <hi>Dale</hi> by Letters Pattents, under the great Seal of <hi>Ireland</hi> to A. and his heirs; and there is no direction given in the ſaid Commiſſion, touching the Tenure to be reſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">To prove this by teſtimony.</note>There are Letters Pattents by colour of the ſaid Commiſſion, paſſed unto A. and his heirs to hold by Knights ſervice, as of his Majeſties caſtle of <hi>Dublin.</hi>

               </note> The queſtion was, whether the ſaid Letters Pattents be void in the whole, or only as to the tenure.</p>
            <p>Which Caſe was argued by the councel of the Lord <hi>Dillon,</hi> in the firſt place, which was Mr. <hi>Nicholas Plunket,</hi> then by Serjeant <hi>Catlyn,</hi> for the King. And after by <hi>John Pollexfen,</hi> for the Lord <hi>Dillon;</hi> and then by <hi>Osbaldeſton</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourney General for the King.</p>

               <note place="margin">At the requeſt of Sir <hi>Jerom Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> Knight. ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Juſtice of his Majeſties Court of common Pleas. I do certifie, That concerning the Precedency of the Judges here in <hi>Ireland.</hi> I know that when <hi>Hugh Creſſey</hi> Eſq. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, was ſecond Juſtice of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Court of Kings Bench in <hi>Ireland;</hi> That Sir <hi>Samuel May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art</hi> Knight, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, being then ſecond Juſtice of his Majeſties Court of Common Pleas, took Precedency of him, as being the antienter Judge. And I have often heard, and ſometimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: that the ſecond and third Judges of the Courts of Juſtice here in <hi>Ireland,</hi> took their Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in order, as they were firſt ſworn Judges. And I do know that Sir <hi>James Barry</hi> Knight, then ſecond Baron of his Majeſties Court of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer; and now Lord Baron of <hi>Santrey,</hi> and Lord Chief Juſtice of his Majeſtices Court of chief place, took Precedency before Sir <hi>William Ryves</hi> Knight, one of the Juſtices of the Kings Bench: Being ſworn ſecond Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of the Exchequer, before he was made one of the Juſtices of the Kings Bench. And afterwards when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Ryves</hi> dyed, and I became of courſe ſecond Juſtice of the Kings Bench; Baron <hi>William Hilton</hi> then puiſne Baron of his Majeſties Court of Exchequer, claymed Precedency before me, as ſenior Judge; and at that time ſome of the Judges, inclined to his Precedency, as he was a Senior Judge. All which I ſhall be ready to teſtifie upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> And becauſe it was a Caſe of great weight and importance, it was delivered unto the Judges, and they were required by the Lord Deputy and Councel, to conferre and conſider of it, and to return unto them their reſolution concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it; but they (upon private conference among themſelves) did not agree in opinion; and therefore it was thought neceſſary for publique ſatisfaction, that it ſhould be argued ſolemnly by them all: And thereupon in <hi>Trinity Tearm 1637.</hi> the Caſe was argued accordingly. And in that Book is ſet down all the Judges names that argued it, and the order of their Precedency one before another: and as in all Caſes of Arguments by the Judges, the puiſne Judge begins firſt; and ſo it procéeds to the Lord Chief Juſtice of the Kings Bench laſt, and ſo it was done in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William Ryves,</hi> that was then puiſne Judge of the Kings Bench. He began and argued firſt. Then Sir <hi>James Barry</hi> now Lord of <hi>Santrey,</hi> and Lord chief Juſtice of his Majeſties Court of Kings Bench; but then ſecond Baron of his Majeſties Court of Exchequer; and ſecond Judge to Sir <hi>William Ryves;</hi> he argued next. Then <hi>Hugh Creſſey</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of the Judges of the Court of chief place, in that place which Sir <hi>William Aſhton</hi> now enjoyeth: He argued next; and after him; upon another day appointed for the Caſe: Sir <hi>Samuel Mayart</hi> one of the Judges of the common Pleas, and then ſitting in that place, which I now enjoy, Argued next, then Sir <hi>Richard Bolton</hi> chief Baron argued next, then Sir <hi>Gerard Lowther,</hi> chief Juſtice of the common Pleas; and then Sir <hi>George Shurley,</hi> chief Juſtice of the Court of chief place.</p>
            <p>By which the order of Precedency of the Judges in this Kingdome, one before another; doth appear to be the very ſame as in <hi>England,</hi> according as they are firſt ſworn Judges; and my Predeceſſor being Senior Judge to Sir <hi>Williams Aſhtons</hi> Predeceſſor had the place of him.</p>
            <p>Vpon all which matter I conclude.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the right of Precedency belonged unto me at firſt, as we ſtood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn; as antient unto Sir <hi>William Aſhton</hi> in the Inns of Court in <hi>England;</hi> and that the ſame order is to be obſerved here in <hi>Ireland;</hi> in aſmuch as by the Stat. of 33. of <hi>H. 8. 3.</hi> here in <hi>Ireland:</hi> No man can give advice as a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor at Law, that hath not been firſt admitted of an Inns of Court in <hi>England.</hi> And the common Law of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which eſtabliſheth the Inns of Court in <hi>England,</hi> being the ſame.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the Courts of law in <hi>England,</hi> nor in <hi>Ireland,</hi> give no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency to the Judges at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:97435:7"/>Thirdly, That Sir <hi>William Aſhtons</hi> Letter of a prior date to mine, gives him no advantage or benefit at all, in the Caſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, That the ſaving to me of my right of Precedency, upon the ſwearing of Sir <hi>William Aſhton,</hi> in the firſt place bath ſaved to me my right of Precedency. And therefore I ought to be eſtabliſhed in it accordingly.</p>
