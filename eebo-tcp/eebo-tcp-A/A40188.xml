         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FOr your Whoredoms in the City of <hi>London,</hi> is the hand of the Lord ſtretched forth againſt thee, and the Sword of the Lord God drawn to hew thee down. Ye airy ſpirits, ye high mindes, ye treacherous hearts, ye Whores and Whoremongers, the God of glory is riſen, the Sword is drawn. Ye chaffiſh mindes, the plagues of God is to confound you all. Ye proud, ye are for the fire which cannot be quenched. Ye proud and lofty, and high-minded, are an abomination: it goes before the fall. Ye luſtful ones, the plague and dread of the Lord is to come upon you, who are up in the air, clouds without water, trees without fruit, in your luſts burning, filled with unrighteouſneſs. One tempts another with your beauty, which is vain; with your apparel, the faſhions of it, which your luſts doth increaſe, which under judgement muſt be brought, with the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible God, which is a conſuming fire to the proud. And the day of the Lord ſhall burn the wicked; plagues and vengeance of God be poured forth upon the Whores, and upon the Whoremongers, and upon the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who burns your ſelves in your luſts, and brings the plagues of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. Oh you ſtink before the Lord, Oh you are noyſome; the noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſmell of your fleſh ſtinks, which burns. Ye corrupted ones, plagues, wo and miſery is to come upon you all, in whom that nature lives contrary to the light: the works of darkneſs are ſeen; you cannot hide your ſelves from the ſecrets of the Lord, but he ſees your works, your actions, your deeds. And the light in all your conſciences, ſhall anſwer Gods judgments, and make you to confeſs his judgements juſt, his wrath juſt, his vengeance juſt, his plagues juſt, his deſtruction juſt. And this is the word of the Lord to you, and anſwered ſhall be in every one of your conſciences, in the day of the Lords ſlaughter. A Witneſs againſt all Ungodlineſs.</p>
            <p>The Lord God of heaven and earth is not worſhipped. To idolatries are you given, and to pleaſures and wantonneſs, and to pride; ſo on going without the fear of God, making Images, and ſo delighting in the works of your own hands, making likeneſſes of things that be in heaven, of Angels; and making likeneſſes of things that be in the ſea, and making the likeneſs of things that be on the earth, of men and women, and creatures, and of the ſtars, ſun and moon; ſo follows your own inventions, taking pleaſure in the works of your own hands, given up to idolatry, in the day-time, found in pleaſures, ſporting, and in wantonneſs, which the Lord ſent his Apoſtles to cry againſt, who was in the ſame ſpirit that gave forth the Scriptures: Therefore we having the ſame ſpirit, do cry out againſt ſuch things now, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, who received the Law from God. So that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord is grieved now, to ſee the images of men and women made of ſtone and wood, ſet up and down; and the likeneſſes of other creatures, of horſes, bulls, birds, fowls in the air, and fiſhes in the ſea and rivers, and creeping things of the earth. And this is found in the inventing minde, in <hi>Cain</hi>'s nature, where the pride, ſtrife and envie is. <hi>I am the light of the world, and doth lighten every one that comes into the world,</hi> faith Chriſt the Son of God, the Covenant of life and peace. If you take heed to this Light that comes from the Lord Jeſus, and in it walk, you will come to ſee the Lord Jeſus, the Saviour of your ſouls, from whence this light comes, who is the way to the Father. But if you hate the light which comes from the Lord Jeſus, and will not bring your deeds to the light, with the light to be proved, this is the condemnation, the light, faith Christ: which light if ye did love it, would bring you to worſhip God, and to turn from your inventions, which all is to be condemned with the light, which feedeth the light, wanton, fleſhly minde.</p>
