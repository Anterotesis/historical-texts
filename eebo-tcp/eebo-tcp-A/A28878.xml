            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42607:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Doctor <hi>Liſter</hi>'s Caſe, as a Preſident for the ſame thing: On theſe Conſiderations I ſubmitted to and gratified their Requeſt.</p>
            <p>Four years now elapſed, and by their advice, having regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly compleated my Degree of Doctor in Phyſick <hi>(July</hi> 6. 1687.) performing all Exerciſes required by the Statutes of the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> (and as 14, 15 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things for his Form, without any grace) as my Diplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma to them ſhewn, and the Regiſter in that Univerſity will ſufficiently teſtifie; I applied my ſelf to the then Preſident of the Colledge in the year 1687, for my Admiſſion (as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directed and promiſed, by the Preſident and Cenſors, in the behalf of the whole Colledge in the year 1683.) from whom I had a courteous reception, and acknowledgement that it was all the Reaſon and Juſtice in the World that I ſhould have my Admiſſion, beſides, ſaith he, we cannot deny it you; and then adviſed me to wait till next Colledge day, and there give my attendance; which I accordingly did, and was then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to another opportunity, by reaſon the Colledge was then ingaged in private buſineſs <hi>(viz.</hi> Making New Statutes of Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) and no publick buſineſs would at that time be entred on; I attended again and again, and was ſtill deferred: During theſe delays the private buſineſs is effected, and the New Statutes of Excluſion are made, and promulgated in the Theatre, <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 28. 1687.</p>
            <p>After theſe New Statutes were made, I was adviſed to wait on the Preſident and Cenſors on a private Colledge day, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand my Admiſſion, and did accordingly; and had for Anſwer from them their New Statutes, which Mr. Regiſter would needs read: To which I anſwered, Theſe Statutes cannot relate to my Caſe, being made above four years ſince the deſires, requeſts, and directions of this Board, in behalf of the whole Colledge, were made to me to ſuſpend my Admiſſion till I had compleated my Degree of Doctor; beſides, I have lately attended ſeveral times on the Colledge for my Admiſſion in <hi>July, Auguſt, Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 1687. ſince I was Doctor in Phyſick, and before theſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes were made or promulgated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42607:2"/>
However, ſo it was, that unleſs I would abjure the Company of Apothecaries (as well as I had, by their advice and directions, quitted my imployment in Pharmacy in the year 1684.) and bring it atteſted under the hand, or by the perſon of a Publick Notary, that I had relinquiſh'd and abjured that Society, I ſhould not be admitted.</p>
            <p>And now, I will give you ſome Statutes of the Colledge, as alſo an Advertiſement publiſh'd in the Gazette; with what they have annexed to his moſt Sacred Majeſties Letters, and publiſh'd by the conſent of the whole Colledge, to ſhew to the World their fair dealing with all men, and care for the Publick Good.</p>

                  <q>Now, of all theſe ſeveral Ranks and Degrees of Practiſers in Phyſick, none of them is confined to any certain number, but the Fellows and Candidates; ſo that the reſt being wholly unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, no perſon can be excluded out of the Colledge, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from Practice, but ſuch as are ſo wholly illiterate and unskilful, that they dare not adventure to ſubmit themſelves to the Examination and Judgement of the Preſident and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Colledge, either as to the goodneſs of their Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, or their own skill in all or any part of Phyſick, though the Preſident and Cenſors be men ſtrictly ſworn to do Juſtice to all perſons who ſhall preſent themſelves or their Medicines to their Scrutiny and Examination.</q>
