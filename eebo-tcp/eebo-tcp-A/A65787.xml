            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He many attempts
you have this long
time made upon
me, to declare a
point of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
wherein partly I was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and partly loth to meddle
(being mindefull of the Poets
admonition, <hi>Incedis per ignes
suppositos cineri doloso</hi>) have at
the last beaten out of my resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
this little sparke of fire,
<pb facs="tcp:58869:3"/>
or rather light; borne by the
Authors intention, to shine, not
to burne. For, having by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of many our debates
upon single points, found that
such skirmishes were not like
to gaine the victory of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
upon your so solid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
I saw my selfe
forced to lay before your eyes,
in one Platforme or designe,
the most intimate and bottome
principles of Obedience and
Governement. The which, I
have strived to doe in the most
short and summary manner I
was able: not willing to bee
over-curious in so awfull a
subject. I play therefore the
pure Philosopher. I deliver
<pb facs="tcp:58869:3"/>
the abstract notions onely:
leaving to the prudence of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
to draw such conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
as every ones circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
shall make necessary
and evident unto him by the
short hints I give. And as for
your selfe, I doubt not but my
time is well employed. As
for others, I feare the fortune
of my other Writings, may
prove constant also to this;
that it will finde, those who
reade it not, or who cannot
judge of it, severe Censurers:
and those who like it, fearfull
to oppose so loud and clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a multitude; or at least,
stonned with the adverse noise.
But for this, let the eternall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb facs="tcp:58869:4"/>
care. To me such cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
will bee no novelties:
But the content of having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you satisfaction, an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
reward of the endeavours

               <p>
                  <hi>XEnophon,</hi> in his excellent
Booke of the instruction
of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> moves this
Question, Why, of all
other living Creatures, which are
of different Natures from Man, wee
easily attaine to the mastery and
rule; but few men are so intelligent
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58869:7"/>
as to be fit to governe Men; and
those few are the highest and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest
part of Mankind? But, to
me, the very Question seems to
beare the solution in its owne bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells.
For, when one asks, why
Man is hard to be govern'd since
he governes other Creatures; hee
asks, why one, who hath the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to rule others, is himselfe so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to be master'd: and the
answer is, because the powers, by
which he reduceth others to his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
makes him apter to resist
them who seeke the conquest of
himself; and so renders it a higher
taske to weild and manage him,
then those Creatures which he hath
power over.</p>
               <p>For, we need not looke into
Philosophy, nor study learned
Bookes, to know that the nature of
Man is inclin'd to have its owne
will, and casteth all things which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58869:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are under his consideration to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
and effect it: as also, that
every ordinary mans knowledge
and consideration is farre beyond
any we find in other living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
and, by consequence, is farre
lesse easily masterable then any of
them.</p>
               <p>Whence we may plainly collect,
that were it possible for a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to make every single person in
his Dominion particularly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that what was ordered by
the Governement was his owne
truest interest; such an one would
be the most absolute and perfect
Governour; and infallibly would
find the charge of governing most
easie and sweet, as well to himselfe
as to his Subjects.</p>
               <p>This Case is cleare both in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and in Experience. Reason shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us, that to draw any thing to
Action, according to its owne fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58869:8"/>
and inclination, is both easier
to the attempter, and makes the
action it selfe more efficaciously and
throughly performed. He that will
drive a wedge into a hard piece of
wood, strives, as far as the scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
gives him leave, to make his
hammer fall downewards, because a
weight hath, of it selfe, an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that way, and so both the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
is stronger and the arme
lesse strain'd, knocking and the
very fall of a weight encreasing by
motion downewards: Therefore
Black-smithes, whose continuall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
is to use the hammer, lay their
iron upon their anvile, that is, in
such a scituation below their heads,
as is most fitting to gaine the best
advantage of the descent of their
hammers, which they first raise to
give them scope of a descent.</p>
               <p>Upon this principle it is, That
they who tutour Dogges, Horses,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58869:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Elephants and Hawks, knowing
the ordinary attractive of Beasts to
be meat and some kind of Flattery,
make them understand, to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of their capacity, that to do
the action they breed them for,
gaines them food; to which they
joine also certaine motions of stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and gentle words, that make an
impression in the Beast of its owne
excellency, and that it pleaseth its
master. In like manner, to deterre
them from certain actions, cudgels,
whips, and harsh words are used;
which have a notabler efficacy then
one would easily imagine, if he saw
it not by experience.</p>
               <p>This, now, being apply'd to
Mankind, drives the effect home.
For Man, being a rationall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
(whose inclination it is to
worke according to knowledge)
desires to know that the worke
prescribed him is good, that is, good
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58869:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for him, or his good. And because
if two actions be proposed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the one is better for him then the
other, the lesse good action deprives
him of some good which the more
good had brought him; his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
leads him to do the
better, and by consequence to
know and dispute which is the
better; which is as much as
to chuse betwixt them; and
this we call being <hi>free,</hi> or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
naturall Liberty to do one and
not the other. So that, the Nature
of Man is to be <hi>free;</hi> and to act
what ever he does, because it seems
to him the best.</p>
               <p>Whence it is evidently conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that the perfectest way and most
connaturall for governing men is,
by making them determine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to their actions, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
freely, and act, as it were, by
their owne inclinations. This if the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58869:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Governour can effect, hee shall finde
both his intent generally perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
because the Subject proceedeth
with much affection and courage; and
seldome or never will his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
be resisted, or their obedience
repented: For, men are not wont to
repine often at what themselves chuse
and judge best for themselves; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if, even after the action per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
and peradventure the attempt
failed, yet the Subject remaines sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
that it was best for him, in
those circumstances, to do what he
did: Now, if the reasons were solid
when the Governour proposed them,
such must of necessity be, for the
most part, the sequell.</p>
               <p>Experience maketh this same as
manifest as Reason concludeth it.
What Mother or Nurse doth not
seeke to perswade and win the yet
sucking childe with gay things, with
Flattery and such demonstrations of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58869:10"/>
Love (that is, of the childs good)
as the child is capable of? What Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
or Father draweth not his Boyes
to schoole and sitting exercises, by
promises and proposalls of good, as
play, goodcheere, fine cloathes, and
any other toyes suitable to their
tempers? The stronger ages have
stronger Motives; as, of Honour,
Lands, Offices, and the like: by
which we see the most part of men
led, not onely to Labour, but even
to hazard their lives and those very
goods which are proposed them for
motives of their actions.</p>
               <p>On the contrary side, how ill do
those enterprises thrive, where the
Actors conceive themselvs either not
concern'd or wrong'd? How dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
are excuses sought out and
easily found, and every cause of
delay judged sufficient? How rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
(if the Actours be in great
multitudes (as Soldiers or Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58869:10"/>
do seditions and mutinies
spring up, and all disorders grow
bold and spread themselves, the
Commander of the action hated
and esteemed an oppressour and a
Tyrant, his Officers scorned and
disobeyed?</p>
               <p>This then is, of all hands, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that the proper and naturall
way of Governement is, by making
the obeyer understand that it is his
owne profit which the action aimes
at; so to make him work out of
the inclination of his owne will,
and the dictamen of his owne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58869:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Nature is not able to make it perfect
in most both persons and actions.
Children are not come to the ability
of judgeing; some others are so
grosse of capacity, they cannot bee
brought to understand their owne

which Nature hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
them; Most spend so much
of their day in some one Businesse,
which they have chosen either for
their Livelyhood or pastime, that
they have not sufficient Leasure to
attaine the Knowledge necessary for
other occurrences of their life: Even
the greatest Wits are not capable

               <p>Neverthelesse, Nature doth not
recede wholly from her Principle,
in thus subjecting one mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to anothers, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
most times to the lesser. For it
doth not this, otherwise then by
making the party subjected see, it is
his owne good to trust another's
skill. Wherefore, it is true, that
he followes his owne inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

and so governes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
onely, hee is a degree higher,
not busying his thoughts about the

chusing the master of the worke, or
about his own submission, that is,
his owne action, as he is a man, and
his action as that of a man, and not
of a Physician or Pilot, or such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
particular discipline or Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
It remaines therefore still that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58869:12"/>

of it.</p>

               <head>The Third GROUND.</head>
               <head type="sub">That a Rationall beliefe is necessary
to Humane Action.</head>
               <p>OF those things to whose
knowledge wee cannot our
selves arrive, but must rely on the
credit of others, there are two kinds;
some purely to be believed, others
to be also acted. As, when we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
our selves of what passed in
some forreigne Country, or of the
nature of Trees or Beasts wee never
have use of; wee are barely to
assent to what is delivered: But,
when a Physician telleth us wee
must take a Purge or keepe such a
Dyet; wee doe not onely believe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58869:12"/>
him but act according to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.
Now, though in truth this
second sort belongeth properly to
our discourse apart, because the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of pure beliefe is intrinsecally
included in it, as a part in the
whole; yet wee must first note the
Errours to bee avoided in a meere
speculative assent: And these are
two; one of <hi>defect,</hi> and one of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The vice by <hi>defect,</hi> warnes you
to believe no thing but what your
selfe understand, that is, indeed to
<hi>believe</hi> nothing at all. But, were
these men bound to their own Law,
that they should take no Physick
till they knew it would doe them
good, at least as well as the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
doth; nor trust their cause to
a Lawyer till they understood the
subtleties as perfectly as hee; and
so in other vocations; I doubt they
would have neither health nor
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58869:13"/>
wealth for Physician or Lawyer
to worke upon.</p>
               <p>But, because those who advance
this proposition are persons of wit,
I must not think they stumble at so
notorious a block: Therefore, their
meaning is onely, that wee ought
not to beleeve, but what we are able
to understand if wee had will and
leisure to study. But, even so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated,
it is a most wilfull propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
reason being quite on the
opposite side: For, let the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which denounceth me a Truth,
be sufficient to make it credible, and
overvalue the mysteriousnesse of the
object; and the higher it is above
my knowledge, the more necessity
there is of believing it. What is
but a little above me, I may easily
come to know; and so need not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
but take paines and see it: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
is ordained for Truths whose
direct and immediate evidence wee
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58869:13"/>
cannot compasse; and therefore is
more proper, more due, more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
for such as are above our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>But, peradventure these smart
persons do suppose that all things
which have a possibility to be
knowne, are the subject of mans
wit; and so take these two to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the same sence, that the object is
such as we are able to understand,
and that it is understandable, or
doth not couch a contradiction in
its termes: and peradventure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themselves able to shew con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
in whatever they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to believe. If this be their
meaning, the maxime they goe upon
is safe; but they must be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
not to subsume or apply it to
particular instances without much
consideration: For, ordinarily, the
authority is very great which by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
men, is alledged for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58869:14"/>
and high truths; and so is
dangerously neglected, without an
exact perusal and anatomy of the
truths maintained by it.</p>
               <p>There are others soe prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
of our naturall endowments,
that they will teach us a kinde of
contempt of reason and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
In a word, their position is,
That, though you be certaine the
proposition made (for ought you
know) is false, neverthelesse, you
may and ought to think it true:
which how to excuse, from being an
irrationall act and a pure folly, is
beyond my skill; at the same time
to be assured it is uncertaine, and to
hold it for certaine is, to mee, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility.
Doe I not hold that
which I am certaine of? that is,
that this truth is uncertaine? How
then can I hold it is certaine? Put
this in the mouth of a witnesse in
any Court of Justice, and teach him
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58869:14"/>
that, though hee know certainly hee
doth not perfectly remember whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee saw the man killed, yet hee
may sweare hee saw it; what Justice
will remain uncorrupted?</p>
               <p>Passion and Precipitation may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with us, to judge that cleare and
evident which is not so, and carry us
to believe and affirm it; but that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
should make us believe what it
telleth us it seeth no ground for, or
not sufficient, is to me, an assertion
the most unworthy, the most contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to reason, and the most biassed by
interest that can be imagined. If our
nature be rationall, if all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
should be conformable to our
nature, and governed by reason;
there cannot bee a more pernicious
proposition, then to tell us we must
assent, when there is no proportioned
motive think wee ought to assent.</p>
               <p>Thus much I thought fit to say
concerning the errours of belief in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58869:15"/>
speculation; because beliefe in
practicall things, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
our actions, depends of it,
and includes it, and is, in part, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by the same rules. The belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of practical things begins to
trench upon the subject of our main
discourse: for it is the first and most
simple or uncomposed degree of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and obedience, and so the
very roots of both are dependent
from and to be discovered out of it.</p>
               <p>For, wee experience by our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
apprehensions, that wee esteeme
a Physician, a Lawyer, a Schoole-master
ought to bee obeyed, though
wee doe not acknowledge in them
the power of a Lord or Magistrate.
And so wee say, the Scholler will
never profit, because he will not doe
what his Master would have him:
The client loseth his cause, because
he would not obey his Counsell: The
Patient recovers not, because he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58869:15"/>
not the advice of his Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian.
And though we doe not say
the Doctour or Counsellour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
his Patient or Client, yet, if
we look into it, he both rewardeth
and punisheth, which are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants
of commanding. For
who obeyeth is rewarded with
learning, health, and prosperity,
and who disobeyeth is punished
with Ignorance, sicknesse, and
losses.</p>

               <head>The Fourth GROUND.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the vertue of obedience, and
wherein it consists.</head>
               <p>OUt of this we may easily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what nature intends
by the vertue of obedience, and
what are the limits and Lawes of
it. For it is plaine, the immediate
end is that our workes and all that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58869:16"/>
concernes us may be well done, even
as to those things wherein our selves
have no skill, or not enough, and
the more remote end to bee atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by this is, that our life may bee
good and happy, and the end of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
arrived to by us. The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
likewise are cleere: First,
that the matter of our action bee
such as our selves are not sufficiently
skilfull in; the second, that our
Commander bee a master in that art;
the third, that hee bee a good and
honourable person, in whom wee
may rest confidently he will deale
with us conformably to his skill,
and not wilfully or for his own
pleasure, or interest, doe any thing
against our good and profit.</p>
               <p>If the first bee wanting, wee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
our selves are wanting to our
selves; for Nature hath endowed us
with reason to provide for our owne
good by this power: againe, it is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58869:16"/>
non-sence and folly to expect ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man should be more carefull of
our good, then our selves: And sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it were so, it were either our
fault or his, and for ought to bee
mended on one side; our fault if
wee bee not so sollicitous as wee
ought to bee, that is, as much as
the weight of the affaire requires;
His if he be more sollicitous of our
good then the same demandeth, and
soe hee who professeth such a care
may bee feared to bee a busie fellow,
and one who aimes at his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
under colour of love, unlesse it bee
in an evident neglect of ours, which
cannot well be imagined of one who
is ready to obey another.</p>
               <p>If the second condition bee
wanting, there can be no vertue in
obedience, since it will nothing
mend but rather impaire our life, and
to the import of that action, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
our pretence to happinesse, to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58869:17"/>
submit our selves to one who hath
no more skill then wee, nor can bee
rationally supposed to bear us more
love and care, or that hee will or
ought to imploy himselfe in our
particular businesse more attentively
then we our selves.</p>
               <p>As for the last condition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it obedience is a plaine precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of our selves into misgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
and absolute ruine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a pernicious &amp; wicked practice.</p>
               <p>By this discourse wee may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
it is a fallacious principle,
though maintained by many, that
obedience is one of the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
vertues, and that it is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
sacrifice we can offer to God, to
renounce our owne wills, because
our will is the chiefest good wee
have. For, not denying that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
is a great vertue; it being,
truly in it selfe, the affection to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
the pride of our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58869:17"/>
which is subject to make us
think too well of our owne opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
without having evidence of the
truth of them, and so hinder us
from candidly seeing and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
the truth (an inclination of
all others most deeply rooted in our
nature, and both most hard to bee
conquered, and most pernicious to
be followed) and therefore, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
which tempers and moderates
this passion must needs be very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent:
yet I cannot give it so high
a rank, as to preferre it before all.</p>
               <p>For, I see it is only a vertue in
case of imperfection, as Penance
and some others are; it being
grounded on this, that a man is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
in those matters wherein hee
ought to bee obedient. But, the
reason displeases mee more then the
conclusion: For what signifieth this,
that it is the greatest good we have
and can renounce for Gods sake? If
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58869:18"/>
it bee a great good, it is no vice, no
excesse, but a naturall power or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of a power given us by Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God; and then would I know,
why to renounce such a thing is
pleasing to him. Can we think it
were pleasing to God for any one to
binde up his armes or legges, or cut
off his hands, pretending to doe it
for his sake? Hee that made them
gave them us to use; and there by
commanded us to use them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the manner intended by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and, if wee doe not so, wee
offend him.</p>
               <p>There is a story of <hi>Origen,</hi> that
he exsected his virility, thinking to
Please God; but the same story saith,
hee was reproved by the whole
Church, and excommunicated for
the fact: <hi>Simeon Styletes</hi> is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have chained himself upon a
hill, that he might not goe thence;
but he was taught that such impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58869:18"/>
was fit for beasts, not men. So
that, to renounce any natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or the legitimate and fitting use of
it, under pretence of pleasing God,
is a folly, not a vertue.</p>
               <p>But, let us see what power it is
that wee must renounce; <hi>our Will:</hi>
and this word doth not, in this place,
signifie any interessed affection or
malicious resolution; but that will
which followeth and is guided by
our understanding, and that truth
which God hath made us capable of:
Therefore the renouncing of this
will, is, withall, the renouncing of
our understanding; that is, of our
wits and manhood; so that it is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
to renounce our rationality, and
that by which we are the image of
God. If any man should take a fancy
to goe upon all foure like a beast, or
subject himself to bee led in a string
like a Beare about the Countrey;
would not all wise men cry out on
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58869:19"/>
him for bestiality, and thinke him
unworthy the conversation of men?
How much greater is the indignity
of him who permitteth himselfe to
bee carried in his whole course of
life, and those actions that most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
him without using that wit or
understanding which hee hath, and
by the sole direction of another?</p>
               <p>Hee can bee accounted so farre no
better then a clock or watch, which
tells the houre by the wit and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of the maker, not by any sence
or worth of its owne. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to renounce our wills for Gods
sake bee to bee accounted a sacrifice;
as farre as my understanding reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
it is no other then that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
expresseth upon another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to wit, one by which the sons
are sacrificed to the father, the image
of God defaced to the glory of him
whose image he is.</p>

               <p>BUt leaving this mistake of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
devotion; of which wee
needed not have spoken so much,
had there not depended on it some
matter of greater consequence (as
the following discourse will manifest
in its due place:) wee are to take
notice of an equivocation which
may draw on some errour if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.
Wee use to say serving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and waiting-maids ought to
bee obedient to their Masters and
Mistresses, whereas indeed, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
by which they serve is not that
of obedience, but of fidelity and
truth, which is manifest to him that
looks into the nature of hirelings.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58869:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For, none thinke a husbandman,
who is hired to till or fence a piece
of ground, obeyeth the hirer more
then hee that selleth a piece of cloth
or other merchandize obeyeth the
buyer, because he taketh his moneys;
but they are said to contract and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
their part of the bargaine
faithfully and truly. So servants pay
their duties, performe their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains:
and Fidelity is their proper
vertue; to doe it carefully, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly;
not Obedience.</p>
               <p>For, Obedience is in such actions
as are the proper actions of the
obeyer, which concerne his life, and
by which hee may derive good if
well done, and harme if amisse.
Now in servants the good successe
pertaineth to the Master, the servant
hath his livelyhood and wages,
whether the event goe right or
wrong, so hee doe what his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
commandeth. And hence it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58869:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
followeth, that neither ought hee bee
ignorant in the action hee doeth,
nor sollicitous whether his Master
bee either skilfull or honest: For,
since what is done concerneth not
him but his Master, his duty is to
seek to doe what hee is commanded
in the best way he can, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressing
himself about the successe.
This I say, as farre as he is a serving-man;
but as hee is also an honest
man, it may belong to him to suggest
to his Master what hee thinks best;
and, sometimes, when it lieth happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in his way, to help such errours
of his Master as he can: without
trenching on his Masters credit;
still providing for his own indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
that hee bee not involved in his
Masters either imprudence or ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
for by his bargaine with his
Master, he did not renounce the care
of his own preservation.</p>
               <p>The reason of this equivocation
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58869:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is because wee ordinarily call <hi>obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
the doeing another mans will:
and distinguish not how, sometimes,
this is done with renouncing our
own wills, which is in those actions
whereof wee are Masters, that is,
our owne actions; and, sometimes,
without such renunciation, as in the
actions which belong to others, in
which wee have no will to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce.
Now Obedience as it is a
vertue especially attending on the
renouncing of our wills, is properly
confined to the former sence, not to
the other; with which it onely
hath an alliance in the name, and
which truly is Fidelity, as we have
already declared.</p>
               <p>But, although Fidelity bee a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
vertue from Obedience, yet is
it not such a stranger as not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a place in this Treatise: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
because the kinde of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
wee desire to look into, which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58869:21"/>
is that by which Common-wealths
and Communities subsist, is founded
generally on Fidelity or the matter
thereof which wee call promise, and
in that vertue it bindes to obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.
After which discourse wee
shall bee prepared to venture on the
matter it self of Governement, and
to our power, declare the force of it
amongst men.</p>
               <p>Man therefore being by his nature
and definition a reasonable, that is,
an understanding Creature, or one
whose primary and principall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
is to truth or true knowledge;
and the outward carriage and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of man being naturally propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to his inward substance; it
is cleere his chief property, by which
he behaves himself outwardly like a
man, is to speak truth, and to doe as
hee sayeth, when his words have
action following them. Hence it
is, that though <hi>honesty</hi> (which in a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58869:22"/>
Courtlyer terme is called <hi>Honour,</hi>
when applyed to a rationall carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and in a more spirituall lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<hi>Conscience</hi>) bee extended to
many other qualities, yet it is most
frequently and principally expected
in his keeping his word; in so much
that though hee have other faults,
either spirituall or carnall, yet if he
be <hi>true of his word,</hi> he, often and in
ordinary conversation, passeth for <hi>an
honest man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, this vertue of <hi>Truth</hi> is the
principall and first engine of humane
conversation, and he that hath it not
is unfit to be admitted to treate
amongst men, but is to be rejected
and banished from all Negotiation.
Thus you see what engagement
every one hath, both by nature and
necessity of conversation, to stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his word or fidelity: For so we call
the vertue by which we speake our
mind in reference to action, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58869:22"/>
are constant to performe what wee
say.</p>
               <p>Yet, since malice is growne to
such a height, all nations, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the fear of any Deity, have
used to make men confirme their
faith and promise by the invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Deity they worship;
hoping Religion may worke in them
what Nature is not strong enough
to effect. This confirmation is
performed in two sorts: One, when
we onely call God to witnesse; as
when we say, God, who sees my
heart, knowes this to be truth, or
that I meane as I speake: The other,
when we pledge our trust in God
for a security; as when wee wish
God may punish us, or never doe
us good, if we break our promise.
And this is properly an execration,
as the other an oath; yet both cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
oaths, and agree in this, that
we pledge our beliefe and feare of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58869:23"/>
God, to another, for his security.</p>
               <p>By which it is evident, that men
generally esteem Religion the thing
which should pierce deepest into
a mans heart and affection; and the
strongest Bond and tye of Faith and
honesty; and that he, who setteth
little by his Religion, hath neither
honour nor honesty in him; or at
least wanteth the greatest and
strongest part of them, and that
which ought to rivet in and fixe
the naturall inclination which we
have to truth and fidelity.</p>

               <head>The Sixth GROUND.</head>
               <head type="sub">In what consists Right or Due.</head>
               <p>THE next consideration may
appear too Metaphysicall a
subtlety for a Morall treatise: yet
such it is, that the ignorance of it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58869:23"/>
is mother of many mistakes and
quarrells. We ought therefore,
to know that a man, considered in
pure Nature, lookes on all other
things, Men and Beasts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible
creatures, as his subjects
to worke on; his onely rule being
Reason, which takes nothing to
bee good but what is good to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and makes the rule of his
actions, to do what is fitting for him
or conformable to his, that is, to a
rationall nature. By this rule he
treats another Man, otherwise then
a horse or a dog, and them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then a tree or stone: For Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is a faculty to use every thing
suitably to their natures; as, to take
a knife to cut, a horse to ride on,
a man to read or write or be his
Counsellour. And this runs through
all his actions.</p>
               <p>But as, though a Taylor or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner
governe himselfe by this rule,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58869:24"/>
even when he playeth the Taylor or
Pilot, yet none can doubt but the
rules of Taylorship or Steerage are
different from this seeking his owne
good and applying all things to
that end: So, neither can any just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doubt but the art of a Lawyer or
Counsellour is different from this
principle which belongeth to all
men.</p>
               <p>And to find out the difference,
wee are to reflect, that he who
maketh a promise to another, so it
be a perfect one (which we adde to
decline the question of what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
oblige, what not) puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
and his Promissary into a rank
of agency and patiency, on a new
score, to wit, that of fidelity and
negotiating: So that now, not the
nature of the two men, but their
words, and what followeth out of
them, ground their being active and
passive. This power of activity is,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58869:24"/>
in Latine, called <hi>Jus</hi> or <hi>Justum,</hi>
in English, Right or Due.</p>
               <p>The difference of these two Arts
is, One considers onely what is
noble, and manly, and Conscience;
the other, what is according to
promise and consent of parties.
Whence we finde, by the vertue of a
promise, a new order growne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men following out of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise:
Wherein three things are to
be considered; The engagement of
nature and honesty; The confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
by oath; and lastly, This
right and duty which ariseth from
the promise: For, whoever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth,
submits himselfe to his
promissary, and becomes his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
as far as the contract reaches.</p>
               <p>The first mistake that springs
from the ignorance of this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is, the great noise we heare of
the Law of Nature and the Law of
Nations. For, we are made ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58869:25"/>
that Nature hath bound us
to certaine Lawes, and not left us to
the Liberty of Reason, where no
pacts or agreements intervene:
As, that men ought to give free
Trade to leave the Seas open, to
give immunities to Ambassadours,
and the like: For these either depend
on Custome and Consent, or are free
for every man to dispose of, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his owne profit, necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or convenience of his affaires.</p>
               <p>It is true, there is an inclination
in man, from reason, to do another
any good I can without my owne
prejudice, and to have a desire to
keepe peace with all men: But if
I do not, it followes not that I
wrong him, even though I do him
harme or seeke his ruine; But I
wrong my selfe, nature binding me
to make my carriage to every one
rationall and becoming a man:
For he is no otherwise to me then
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58869:25"/>
a piece of cloath or wood, which
I cut and shape after my
owne will, fittingly for my use.
And, on the contrary side, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
prejudiced or refused a Courtesy,
gets no right over me to revenge
himselfe: But Nature and Reason
teaches him, peradventure, that it is
good and prudent for him to hurt
me, to prevent a greater mischiefe
to himselfe; and he doth right to
himselfe in harming me, because
he doth an action rationall and
suitable to manhood.</p>
               <p>The different consequents of the
two positions, will appeare in this:
That, if there be, in nature, radica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
such an order of right and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
just or due (as many hold) it is
a thing that reason can never infringe
nor can any thing justifie what God
hath shewed us by example, and
we see wise Politicians practise
sometimes, when, without crime
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58869:26"/>
or offence offered, they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Masters of convenient pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
But, if there bee no such right
by Nature, then Reason is left Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
to judge whether it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the nobility of man to
do such an action or no.</p>

               <head type="sub">Why men desire to live in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
and of the necessity of
Governement.</head>
               <p>NOt to make the foundations or
under-ground workes bigger
then our building; It is time to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon our pretended subject of
<hi>Governement</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> and
examine what it is maketh Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
necessary to Mankind. And,
because the Governement we looke
upon is that of a multitude; first
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58869:26"/>
it is fit to understand why men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to live in flocks or multitudes.
Neither can any who hath never so
little skill in nature doubt, but, as
pleasure masters and heads all our
actions, so likewise doth it this of
living in society.</p>
               <p>The first community is of Man and
Wife. Who seeth not the power of
pleasure in their mutuall society?
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> out of experience, teacheth
us that we take pleasure in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
with handsome persons. And if
wee consider pleasure to be nothing
but the knowledge or sence of our
being well or receiving some good;
and, that the immediate cause of
pleasure is the impression which
some naturall or apprehended good
maketh of its owne presence; and
that good signifieth connaturall or
fitting for us; wee shall perceive
that Handsomenesse in our owne
kinde must of necessity cause plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58869:27"/>
in us; the impression it makes
by our eyes being of the features and
colour due to the perfection of our
Nature; a gracefulnesse, not onely
of gesture and voice, but even of
wit and discourse being regularly the
ground of the outward beauty. So
that (if Nature hath not miscarried)
all the parts and actions of a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
body are gracefull to nature,
and breed pleasure in others who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
them by conversation and, as it
were, communication.</p>
               <p>This then is the first origine of
meeting and living together; as,
whosoever lookes into experience
will easily discover: For, he will
finde most men burthensome to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
when they are alone, and to
seeke company to divert themselves,
so to elude the length of time.
I remember to have heard a
Country fellow complaine of the
losse of a Dog which was stollen
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58869:27"/>
from him; and gave for his reason,
that he was to travell a whole night
alone, and the Dog would have beene
an excellent companion to him.
Bees also, wee know, love company.
Horses not onely labour, but even
eate better amongst their fellowes:
and we often heare sickly stomachs
thank those that visit them for the
good meale they have made, as if the
company helped downe their meat.
Pleasure therefore and Love is the
first combiner of men into Society.</p>
               <p>The next is, that God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
have so managed mankind, that
no one hath of himself, as much as
he desireth; but regularly aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in one kinde of goods and
wants some other which his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
hath: Hence, they mutually
affect Society; to bee accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with such necessaries, as they
cannot have but by communication
one with another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:58869:28"/>
In the third place comes Feare:
for hee that findeth himselfe stored
with those things which hee and
others love, is subject to feare those
whom hee suspecteth able to bereave
him of them; and so seeketh compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of friends for protection. Nor
doth any one feare to lose but what
he affecteth to have; so that first love
marcheth in the van, and feare fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
in the reare. Besides, it is
against all generosity, and embases
Nature it selfe, to set the Throne of
Feare above that of Love; and
agreeth neither with Philosophy nor
Morality.</p>
               <p>To make a step farther: Granting
once men to be desirous to live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and taking notice of the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they are subject to, and how self-love
corrupteth the judgement of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all in their own case; it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
they can never live in quiet and
content, unlesse there bee some way
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58869:28"/>
contrived of agreement, when passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
stirreth contention. They must
therefore, necessarily, give consent,
to end their controversies by some
means. And since reason is our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and every ones reason freer to
see the truth in anothers case then in
his owne; and a wise and good
man fitter then a fool or knave,
the most naturall way for a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to live in peace is to have some
man or men, accounted wise and
good, chosen, to whose arbitrement
all the rest ought to stand; the
stronger part combining to force the
weaker, in case of resistance; that
is, the disinteressed part, which is
the multitude, to force the interessed,
which generally are but particulars
if compared to the body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Here you see the nature of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement
begin to appeare. But, to
make it perfect, wee must farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58869:29"/>
That many commodities are
necessary to a multitude, which are
to be furnished by common consent:
That likewise there are many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
enviers to a multitude which
liveth handsomely and happily: And
in conclusion, that to provide for
goods and prevent evils in common,
is a matter of so great weight and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
that it takethup the whole life
of one or more men; and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
these businesses cannot be
carried on by the whole body of the
community, whose worke and aime
is to enjoy themselves to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
in getting by their labour,
those accommodations of humane
life, which they esteem necessary or
conducing to their happinesse. It
solloweth therefore, they must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust
some more or fewer to take care
of the common concernements.</p>
               <p>Such Trustees are called Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and the commnnity is said to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58869:29"/>
obey them; and according to the
principles forelaid, you see the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are supposed ignorant of what
ought to bee done for the publike,
this being a businesse requiring a
mans whole time; which they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can spare, nor doe desire to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
in this: way: You see they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust
others in whose prudence and
goodnesse they confide; and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
execute what their Trustees
think fitting, either by practising
when they are commanded, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a sufficient force to their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
to master such restif par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as will not obey: In conclusion,
you see Governement is, naturally,
a power or right of directing the
common affaires of a multitude,
by a voluntary submission of the
communities wills to the will of the
Governours; whom they trust, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
opinion that they are understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and honest, and will administer
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58869:30"/>
the Commonalty by the rules of
wisedome and goodnesse, as is most
convenient and advantageous for the
people.</p>
               <p>It seems to mee no moderate and
discreet person can doubt but a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement
so ordered is both neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
and connaturall to a rationall
multitude, and, in a word, such as
humane nature requires; and is the
best, if not the onely, that sutes to
the disposition of free men and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>

               <p>BY this resignation of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

Magistracy receives such an activity
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58869:30"/>
and power as, wee have explicated
before, did arise out of a mans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to his neighbour: and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
that the people as farre as
they have renounced their owne
will, so farre they have no power
left in them to contradict or resist
the orders of the Magistracy.</p>
               <p>I say, as farre as the People have
submitted their wills: for since this
power is in the Magistrate in vertue
of their wills, it cannot extend far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then the peoples promise: So
that if the people binde their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
to certaine Lawes and Limits;
hee hath no right to transgresse such
Lawes, or extend himselfe beyond
the prefixed limits by his install<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the original power given
him: but above all, he cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of one chip or dispense in one the
least law; farther then he apprehends
it as fit and necessary to the good
of the Common-wealth: and, if hee
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58869:31"/>
doth, hee exceedeth his Patent and
power. True it is, there is a great
discretion to bee used in such limits,
and the prudent Governour will see
that the good of the Community re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
many of those dispensations,
which carelesse Governours use out
of an overweening of their owne
height and power.</p>
               <p>Having thus declared the nature
and conditions of naturall Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
it is not amisse to see whether
there bee any other Governement;
and wherein distinguished from this.
And casting our eyes round about us
wee quickly perceive certaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities
which pretend to a defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Governement: as Companies
of Merchants or Trades-men; Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
and Colledges of Schollers;
and Cloysters of men and women,
who pretend to employ themselves
wholly to perfect their soules to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
eternall beatitude. All these
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58869:31"/>
have a participation of Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but have not the universall
administration of humane goods
and evills: For, power of life and
death, generally, they have none;
and are subject, for the most part, to
appeals from their judgements, in
matters of great consequence: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have they any power of peace
and warre: And if sometimes any
of these royalties belong to them;
it is not as they are heads of such
Communities, but as they partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
of Soveraignty by priviledge, or
accident.</p>
               <p>These therefore are distinguished
from the Governement wee pretend
to declare; as being slight imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of it, and certaine likenesses,
not the power it self; or as some Art
or Trade is different from Morall
Philosophy, which is Mistresse of
the will, and all her actions; the
others being but Ushers to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58869:32"/>
as it were formes or rankes in
which petty things are taught. In
fine, these others are to our Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as particulars to the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall.
The Governement therefore
which wee explicate is that which
hath power, either of all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the people it governeth;
or at least, of all comprehensible by
Nature and falling under Sence and
Experience. The first of these wee
see in the <hi>Pope</hi> and such <hi>Bishops</hi> as
are withall <hi>Secular Princes;</hi> the
second, in other Christian Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
either of Princes or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths,
where the Spiritual

higher and greater, though not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of the Temporall.</p>
               <p>But wee seeke farther, whether
there bee any supreme Governement
different from this wee explicate,
or no: And the occasion is from
what wee see in certaine instances,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58869:32"/>
that there is a kinde of command or
rather subjection, which wee call
Slavery, exercised, not onely amongst
Heathens, but even Christians, who
have more conformity to nature.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Slavery and the lawfulnesse

               <p>ANd first, wee must looke into
the notion of Slavery; which
signifies a subjection to command in
all things; and that meerely for the
Masters profit. This <hi>all things</hi>
may either reach to the hindring
him from those actions which are
necessary to obtaine Beatitude; or
onely to corporall services, with
that moderation, that the Master
hinders him not from such exercises
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58869:33"/>
as concerne the procurement of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
happinesse.</p>
               <p>And clearly, it is against nature
for any to submit his will so farre as
to renounce eternall blisse. There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
then, bee any Obedience due to
such an extremity; and, by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
there cannot be any power
of commanding such enormities in
the compasse of nature. The like I
conceive of a subjection to be killed
or maimed causlessely and without
desert, or even tormented; nay, or
so penuriously abused as to have no
content in life; but perpetually
to suffer sicknesse, hunger, cold, or
any other notably afflictive condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so that his life is rather a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
then a content to him. For
since life is our beeing, and since bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is the thing most deeply recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to us by nature; it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
against the inclination of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to consent to the losse either of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58869:33"/>
life or of the profit of life, which
is, either to be well in this world or
in the next: therefore it cannot be
conformable to nature to renounce
either; especially, the Quiet in this
world being the meanes to gaine
blisse in the other.</p>
               <p>Neither doth it scare me to cast
my eyes upon so many holy men
and women, as have put themselves,
voluntarily, upon penurious and
painfull lives. For, I can easily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that they had not displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
lives; enjoying the fruit of
contemplation, and the sweetnesse
of Conscience in expecting a great
reward for what they did: So that,
they onely refused the pleasures of
this world, to gaine those of the next;
which is very rationall. But, for a
man to renounce the content of this
world, who either thinke not of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
or, at least, hopeth nothing
out of his renunciation: this must
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58869:34"/>
of necessity be extremely irrationall
and against Nature; whose univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
aimes are, to be well, either in
the next or this present life. But if
there be no su<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h subjection naturall,
there can as little be any power of
command gotten either by promise
and submission of the subject, or
violence of the Commander; who
may perforce do what he list, but
can never make it conformable to
nature, to use an other with such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
severity.</p>
               <p>There followes yet another kinde
of Slavery; which consisteth in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bound to do what his Master
commandeth, while his Master af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth
him a convenient lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;
and being subject to due pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
without farther appeal,
when he deserveth it. And this hath
no apparent opposition to Nature;
why, in circumstances, a man may
not binde himselfe to it, and be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58869:34"/>
to maintaine and make good
his word to his dying day. And, of
such a kind of Slavery, we may
question, Whether nature alloweth
a whole people to be involved in it,
or it be a thing that onely can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
accidentally in nature.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Aristotle</hi> is the first
man whom wee are engaged
to offend in this matter; who
sayes or seemes to say, That some
Nations are naturally Masters and
Commanders, others, Slaves and
Subjects: To which conceit <hi>Virgil</hi>
seemes also to incline;
<q>
                     <l>Tu regere imperio populos Romane
memento &amp;c.</l>
                     <l>Hae tibi erunt artes—</l>
                  </q>
As if it were proper to that Countrey
to command. Neither doe I thinke
<hi>Aristotle's</hi> meaning was any more,
then that there was a greater fitnesse
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58869:35"/>
in some Nations to command, then
in others: for, himselfe teacheth,
the Barbarous prisoners, whose edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
had been noble, should not
be put to servile offices. So that, it
was but a little selfe-pleasing in these
two great Authours, and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their Countries, which made
them fall into this extremity, of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it fit that other nations should
submit to theirs: Whereas, had they
lived in our dayes, long experience
would have taught them that, in
every nation, there are men fit to
Governe, if Education and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
be not wanting; And againe,
any nation may prove a Slave, even
through too much wit, if they have
not goodnesse to temper it. But we
must not be angry, even with great
ones, if they flatter a little their
Countrey: but take warning it be
not our owne case, either for our
Countrey, or, which is more absurd,
for our selves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:58869:35"/>
Leaving then this question, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any nation be, by nature, borne
and designed to slavery? let us see
whether, within the Latitude of
Nature, it consists that any nation
can enslave it selfe in the sence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.
I do not here intend to
engage in that question; Whether
one nation may oppresse another,
and, by force of Garrisons and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
keepe them quiet in a Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
course of Governement and
Subjection? a question much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from ours, which is onely,
Whether a whole Nation may vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
submit it selfe to a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by which it shall have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of its owne, nor be able to
deserve or get any thing; but bee
entirely at the disposition of the
Magistrate it chuseth, without
right or property?</p>
               <p>That we may not walk too much
in the dark, the holy Scripture
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58869:36"/>
holdeth us out a Lanthorne, in
the example of <hi>Joseph;</hi> who bought
up the whole nation of <hi>AEgypt</hi> for
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> their King, so that he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
him not onely the Governour
as before, but also absolute Lord
and Master, and them his slaves; and
this by their consent. Neverthelesse,
I am not able to understand reason
in it. To put therefore the case
clearly, the meaning is; Whether
a whole nation can ty it selfe so by
any promise to one Magistrate, as
afterward to be bound, they and
their Children, in force of their
words, not to have or dispose of
their Labours and goods of fortune
but at the pleasure of the Magistrate;
and that he hath power, arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and without any farther reason
then his owne will, to give what
one man possesseth to another, and
make any one worke and obey ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
meerly because such is his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:58869:36"/>
That which induceth me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
for the Negative is the Nature
of man; whose first and maine ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
is judgement and choice;
and the matter of this is his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
action: So that, who univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ally
renounceth his judgement in
externe action, truely renounceth
nature it selfe, in renouncing the
end and action for which it was
made. Now, that a single man
may be forced to this, I make no
difficulty: For, if force can take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
a single mans life, much more
may it take away his outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But, when I speake of a Nation,
me thinks I speake of Nature it selfe:
For, I understand a Nation to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
a thing in nothing different from
humane Nature, except in greatnesse;
as a bit of bread from a loafe or a
paile of water from the pond out
of which it was taken; and so,
Reason cannot teach us to do that to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58869:37"/>
a nation, which ought not bee done
to all humane kinde. Now, who
abhorres not to thinke that the use
of judgement and will should bee
banished out of Mankinde? Were
not that quite to unman us and be-beast
our whole nature? On the
other side, it being the property
of reason to use every thing it know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
according as it is fitting to
the respective nature of the thing;
and nothing being more fitting for
man in common and every one in
particular, then to judge and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
in his little spheare of activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
reason can never demand or
approve of the contrary to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
universally; as is implyed
in this Position, that it may be done
to a whole nation.</p>
               <p>I looke not into the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of such proceeding: How base
and unworthy it renders the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
how unfit for the service of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58869:37"/>
the Magistrate; how ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of any occasion to better them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and the like; which are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to dehort any wise Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
from attempting or desiring
it: Because my Theame is onely
upon the contracting an obligation
of obedience, out of the force of
their promise; and extends no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And, I suppose, the shewing
that such a promise invalidateth the
principle upon which a promise
grounds its constancy, is enough, to
shew that no promise so made can
be constant and firme; since a man
stands to his word, because he is
a man and hath a principle of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or choice upon judgement, by
which and according to which he is
and ought to be governed: Now
then, such a promise being a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
and bereaving him of this
his manlinesse; it cannot assuredly
bee maintained by manlinesse which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58869:38"/>
is the onely or chiefe strength of a
promise.</p>
               <p>But, what must we reply to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph?</hi>
what to many thousands of
eminent Christians, who seeme to
professe and observe, in vertue of a
vow, this very kinde of subjection?
As for <hi>Joseph,</hi> he justifies himselfe,
in renouncing the Vassalage of his
People for one fifth part of their
lands and fruits. 1. And, not to
make an estimate, how proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
the fifth of a Kingdome is
to the furnishing of necessaries for
governing; so much at least is plain
that, by his remission of foure parts
absolutely, that is, for ever, he did
not execute what he pretended by
the bargaine; but, by the formality
of acquiring all, he obtained what
he aimed at, That the People should
willingly contribute the fifth part
of their Labour and goods ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
and, in case of necessity,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58869:38"/>
willingly obey their Governour.</p>
               <p>As for the speciall obedience
vowed by some Christians of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
life, it is professedly only,
concerning spirituall instruction
or exercise, even then when it is
applyed to the Knights champions
of Christendome: And this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by the greatest Divine the
Schoole ever had, in his 22<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. <hi>Qu.</hi>
104. <hi>Art. 5. ad tertium.</hi> So that,
neither of these objections prejudice
the conclusion we have setled; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the outward undiscerned shew
may make an appearance to the
contrary.</p>
               <p>Out of this conclusion it is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seene, that the Turkish, Mosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viticall,
Tartarian and other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Governements, setled upon
this principle, that the Goods and
Lives of the Subjects are the
Princes, not to defend (as our Lawes
go) but to dispose of at will, without
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58869:39"/>
contradiction or limitation, more
then of his pleasure; neither do nor
can ever breed any obligation of
Obedience in the Subject, farther
then out of feare or present utility.</p>
               <p>It is not amisse to adde this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
that those Tyrannicall
Governours exact of their Subjects
no lesse then to forgoe all that is
deare in this world, at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
life and meanes, wife and
children, and whatsoever hath made
impression upon them: So that,
truely, there is no protection or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
from them; and if they rob
you not, it is because they have
no occasion, not because they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any unworthinesse in it.
Whence, no good nor profit doth,
regularly and according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the pact and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
result to the particular;
but all is the high Masters, and
the Subjects portion is onely to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58869:39"/>
share those scraps he shall cast
down to him, as to a Dog, to make
him fit to hunt for his master.</p>

               <head>The tenth GROUND.</head>
               <head type="sub">Why a man is to hazard himselfe
for the common good.</head>
               <p>IT is true, this debt in the subject,
of hazarding life and limbs and
all that is estimable in this world,
is exacted, as well in just and legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Governements as in those hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous
Tyrannies; But, there is a
recompence for it, and the good of
the whole reflecteth on the part;
and if one lose his life, his children
and relations at last feele the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of it; and this makes men
hazard with courage, and die
with comfort. And cleerly, were
there not this obligation, no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
could stand. What
City could be defended, if the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
would not venture their lives
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58869:40"/>
upon the walls? What Army could
bee managed, if the Souldier would
never be brought into the danger of
death, or would fly as soon as the
bullets began to play about his ears?
all wrongs must be suffered at their
hands who would expose their own
lives to hurt others; and no justice
maintained, or innocency defended.
Nature therefore makes it most cleer
that such an obligation is unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and the daily necessity of it
beateth it out so flat and plaine, that
wee can no way escape so manifest
an evidence.</p>
               <p>But if it bee by the direction of
nature, certainly it is also rationall,
and hath some principles of its truth
and reasonablenesse. Now, in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
the reason of all action is the
good obtaineable by it; which if
lesse or not greater then what wee
hazard and, peradventure, lose in
the attempt, it is no good nor can
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58869:40"/>
bee a rationall motive of such an
action. We ought therefore to seeke
out this great good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> proceeds as cunningly
in this businesse as became so wise a
Master; and, according to his fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
where his skill reached not to
explicate the particulars, remained in
common termes: telling us, that
<hi>Bonum commune divinius est quàm
particulare:</hi> But, in what this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
consists, hee no where expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
Truly, if there were a <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Idea</hi> of the particular's goods,
which might bee termed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good, I could understand that
there were a Divinity in it; but
himselfe hath extinguished that
flash of <hi>Plato's,</hi> beyond reviving.
I understand also, that the notion of
<hi>common,</hi> compared to the notion of
<hi>individuall,</hi> hath a kinde of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
by its universality, which
rendreth it very august and lustrous,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58869:41"/>
and of a higher degree then the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
I know again the perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a Common-wealth pretendeth to,
compared to the mortality of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
person, vesteth it selfe with a
kinde of infinity, which giveth it a
glorious appearance. Nay, when I
see the same man work for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
in a free way of doing
it good; and againe, for a private
friend: I see a vast distance between
his pretended ends; and an eminent
generosity in one over the other:
Whence, I believe, it cometh that
<hi>Heroës</hi> and heroicall vertues are
chiefly taken in respect of doing
good to whole Countreys or Cities.</p>
               <p>But when, on the other side, I see
the same great Master teach us, that
Good is the same with Desireable;
and every ones good, what is desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to him; I finde it is an intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
labyrinth of equivocation
wherein wee endlessely erre, while
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58869:41"/>
wee thtnk that Good taken in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
should bee accounted Good,
truly and properly. As, who would
bee so wilde as to bend any strong
labour here in <hi>England</hi> to profit the
King of <hi>Persia</hi> or <hi>Siam,</hi> if hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
no good to reflect on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
by it? Much lesse would any
account it good to bee robbed or
maimed, because it was good to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
who possessed his money or
was afraid of him: and yet if wee
stick upon the common Notion of
good, without determining to whom
it is good, <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oth these must bee esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not onely goods but great ones;
for, so they are to some body, though
nothing or harme to the esteemer.
Then, to cry, <hi>The Common good,</hi> is a
meere deceit and flattery of words;
unlesse wee can shew that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good is as great to us as wee
make it sound.</p>
               <p>Neither can the authority of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58869:42"/>
learned Nations and the many ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of worthy men perswade us
the contrary. For these Nations
generally were of Popular governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
where plainly the common
good was the good of them who
were to reward the causes of it: so
that, it was no wonder the Common
good should be so highly exalted
and cryed up; where it was the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
good, both to them to whom
it was commended, as also the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menders
themselves were to arrive to
their own private pretences through
that notion of the common good.
The like is of all Princes and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours;
who if they bee wise,
conceive the common good in most
circumstances, to bee compared to
them as their own proper good.</p>
               <p>It remaines therefore, to see what
may bee the ground on which an
understanding man ought to value so
highly the common good; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58869:42"/>
his life and all that is deare to
him, upon the score of the Publicke.
Cleare it is, that hee who ventures
his life, ventures all this world: For
if hee dies, what reward remaines
there in this world? <hi>Fame</hi> is a slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
recompence, when the fruit of it
(which chiefly consists in being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
in company, and having a
power amongst his associates) is
once passed. The good of his
wife and children; that may rejoyce
a dying man; but if there rest no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
after death, it is a comfort
which soon expires; being indeed
nothing but a flash. It is then past
dispute, that for him, who expects
nothing in the next world, there can
bee no rationall motive of volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
endangering his life for the
common cause; if himselfe bee not
particularly interessed in it.</p>
               <p>I know Philosophers reply, that
there is no harme in death, nor pain
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58869:43"/>
after it, and wee are but as if wee
never had been; so they dispute to
take away the feare of death. But
first, I would ask them, why, even
in such a case, the fear of death should
be taken away? What signifieth this
to a sound Philosopher, to take away
the love of his <hi>Summum Bonum?</hi>
of the end for which hee is to doe all
his actions? Againe if hee must
embrace death, upon what motive
must he make his onset? shall hee
propose to himselfe none? or a lesse
good then hee loses? or entertaine
frantick apprehensions of glory after
hee is nothing? These are not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
for Philosophers and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
persons; but for some hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brained
fool-hardy flashes or doat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Oratours, who, with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of fine words, can plausibly
dresse up contradictions and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
               <p>This therefore remaines certain,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58869:43"/>
that there is no good to bee expected
here equivalent to the hazard of
death; and consequently, none can
bee rationally valiant, who sets not
his hopes upon the next world: And
as, before, wee made it apparent,
that hee who was not constant to his
Religion, could have no rooted Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
or Honesty in him; so, now it
is likewise evident, hee cannot ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
bee either valiant himselfe or
trusted by others in danger, farther
then hee is a foole. Since then, on
the contrary side, the nature of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths
makes it beyond dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
that hazarding is necessary; it
is both evident there is another life
to bee expected, and that it imports
good Government to plant deeply
in the breast of the subjects a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
apprehension of it. The cause
therefore, and solid reason why men
ought to bee valiant, is the hope of
reward hereafter for doeing good to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58869:44"/>
our neighbour here: and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
beeing our neerest and
greatest Neighbour, as including our
Friends, Parents, Acquaintance,
and all of Mankinde that our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
reacheth to; to performe ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to It is, certainly, the greatest
act of charity towards our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
that is the highest externe
act which God hath granted to us,
and, consequently, to bee preferred
before all others; and, as such, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a profit and recompence in the
next life.</p>
               <p>I know, it may bee objected, that
in beasts also is to bee found a kinde
of valour, even to the hazard of
their lives for their Mates and little
ones, and yet no reward of the next
world can be pretended for them.
But, wee are to reflect, that beasts
are not governed by any reason gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them to governe themselves by;
but like Clocks and other Engines,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58869:44"/>
by the wit of their Makers: and
therefore it ought not to bee expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they should bee addressed to that
which is their individuall greatest
good, as Man is by his Reason; but
onely to what is fittest for their
Creators intention; which being
onely to continue them for the use of
Man; and this passion of audacity
which wee see in them, being fit for
that, wee are not to seeke a further
reason for them to hazard their
lives, nor to draw any conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
from them to Mankinde,
whose propriety is to governe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
by the knowledge of his owne
good, and not to bee forced out of
that for the good of any other, so
the notion of good bee rightly taken.</p>
               <p>By this wee, in part, understand
wherein consists the worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of a Magistrate and his Office:
to wit, that all others ends being pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

or family; the Magistrates aime
is at the universall good of the whole
eternall body of the Common-wealth,
the extent of the persons,
the long and farre-sighted care, and
the abstraction from his private

beyond comparison, above that of
private men and their intentions;

he can make himselfe and his Lawes
obeyed. But chiefely he hath his
owne Prudence and Goodnesse,
which is supposed to be the choicest
that could bee found in that people;
and the Credit of it to be his strength
and support.</p>
               <p>For, if we looke into it; As we
see that, in the naturall generation
of Governement, the people truely
intend to be governed by one
whom they esteeme the Wisest and
Best amongst them: so afterward,
when they apprehend their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
no <hi>Solomon,</hi> yet they still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
he is the best they can obtaine
or prudently aime at; That is, if
they should attempt to change, it
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58869:46"/>
would bring greater inconveniences
then their continuance under this
weaker Magistrate. So that,
as it were, the Essence and
Forme of his power to governe,
is Wisdome and Goodnesse; at
least, such a degree of both as is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
and apprehended the greatest
possible, according to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
wherein they are. His End
wee finde to bee The common
good: and to that is he wholly and
adequately bound, by his owne
Goodnesse, by the peoples Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by his owne Acceptance, by
the nature of the Charge it selfe,
and by the very forme of his life
and Profession: In so much that,
he faileth from his Duty, from
the expectation of his Subjects,
and his owne Goodnesse, if he doth
the least action for his private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
or otherwise then out of his
esteeme that it is for the greatest good
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58869:46"/>
of the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>And truely, if it bee duely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
we may plainely see that his
private interest is not distinguished
from the publick. For, how can it
be? First for Honour, 'tis plaine, the
welfare of his Subjects is his highest
honour; Their knowing they are well
by him, and so their love to him,
his strongest security; Their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
still on all occasions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with his actions, and esteeme
of his person, his greatest pleasure;
and in fine, the more wealth they
have, the greater Commander is he:
so that really, this private interest
(if he be indeed a good Governour)
is the true felicity of his People. I
doe not, by this, intend to cut off
from Supreame Magistrates that
promise and magnificence wee see
usually in persons of that quality:
But, whereas it may be practised
either for pride and vanity, that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58869:47"/>
is, to procure an esteem of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
merit of the Magistrate, or else,
to facilitate the governement by the
awe and reverence it printeth
in the Subject; I expect the supreame
Magistrate to be so discreet, as to
understand the former is meerly
a shadow or faint and fading co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
the other a reall profit and
necessary instrument, and so to be
embraced for the good of the
people.</p>
               <p>Neither must wee leave our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
here, but transplant our
discourse into a new consideration.
For, if he hath gotten a Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he hath not, by that, lost the
quality of a rationall, wise, and
good man; but joined to that a
new obligation of being new fixt
upon the Common good, as the effect
and scope of the actions of his whole
life: Insomuch that, to determine
the quality of his action, we must
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58869:47"/>
make one complexe of the whole
person; and aske, What a wise
and noble minde, haveing such li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations
upon him, by word or
oath engaged in his installment,
may or ought to do concerning the
limitations?</p>
               <p>And first, it is undoubted on both
sides, that neither may he, without
great cause, make a breach in those
hedges his way is fenced with; nor,
if he make some small and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
breaches, that hee violates
therefore his oath. For, the nature
of humane action is such, as not to
consist in an indivisible; but, of it
selfe, to have a morall Latitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
our understandings not being able
to reach to such small and petty dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
as nature maketh and our
operations containe, as far as they
depend from nature.</p>
               <p>But, the Question cometh, When
some great fault discovers it selfe in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58869:48"/>
the limitations, and the end of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement
is prejudiced by such a
defect; and neverthelesse it is no
doubt but 'tis the intention of the
people or the Trustees of the people
to binde their Magistrate to such
conditions; Whether, in such a
case, he be bound to his orders and
oath, or whether the duty of a wise
and good man doth enfranchise him
to doe what is truely best for the
people, though it be against their
wills?</p>
               <p>The question seemeth hard: and
therefore it is not amisse to note,
that <hi>truely best</hi> signifieth that it
be not onely best, if it had been
fore-ordered or if it were in practise;
but that it be best to be brought into
practise; and that, notwithstanding
all dammages and dangers which
are to be incurred in the setling of
it; Otherwise, it is clear, he ought
to stand to his oath. Another caution
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58869:48"/>
is, that the Magistrate doe not onely
<hi>think</hi> it so <hi>best,</hi> but know it by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
and science; otherwise, hee
proceedeth not wisely, to hazard a
disturbance of the Common-wealth
upon slight and weak appearances.</p>
               <p>These two suppositions premised,
wee are to consider what it is that
engageth the Magistrate on both
sides. And, for his promise, it is
above declared, that hee is engaged
to it by the connaturality and beauty
of Truth in Mans nature: Now not
Truth onely is conformable to mans
nature, but also that Noblenesse and
Goodnesse that bindeth man to man;
which in its highest pitch, that is,
as it looketh upon a Common-wealth
or a little Mankinde, is the
beauty and vertue of a Governour.</p>
               <p>Againe, I see a Governour hath
in himselfe, as it were, two Truths,
or degrees of truth belonging to his
person: One, which is the publicke
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58869:49"/>
Honesty, either considered betwixt
him and his subject or some aliens;
and this forfeited maketh his publick
credit weak and unfit for the use of
Governement: the other is but a
splendour reflecting on his own
person, by which hee appeareth in
the face of honour and a man of his
word. For this latter it is very
evident, the affection to the publicke
ought to oversway it; because being
but a private good it should doe
homage to those vertues which carry
a man to the common interest. For
the former, the dammage ensueing is
to bee esteemed and poised against
the profit or necessity of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth:
For, if it bee evident,
that the good of the change openly
and vastly exceeds the dammage
proceeding from the discredit;
cleerly hee is bound to admit of the
discredit, to purchase the advantage
accrewing by the change: But, where
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58869:49"/>
there is none or little difference,
there the ballance hangs upon quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
side, and change is not to bee
ventured on.</p>
               <p>This seemeth so plainly and
evidently concluded, that a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
man cannot resist it. But,
to those who are used to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
their credit by custome more
then by reason, it is a <hi>bolus</hi> of
hard digestion, to tell them they
must break their word for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good: and seemeth to bee of the
same nature, with that famous defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of an <hi>Ambassadour,</hi> witty in
<hi>England,</hi> harsh in other Nations, that
Hee is sent <hi>ad peregrè mentiendum
pro patriâ,</hi> which where the equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of <hi>lying abroad</hi> is not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
is, in verity, a scandall to
Statesmen, whose negotiation hangs
so tenderly on their credit, that, it
once being broken, they have lost a
principall instrument to penetrate
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58869:50"/>
the hearts on which they are to
work.</p>
               <p>Therefore, let us see whether the
high Magistrate (in proceeding as
wee have declared) does truly force
the rampart of veracity so necessary
for a Governement. Let us first
begin with his promise, and consider
what it is. Hee is entrusted to doe
for the common good: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why hee is entrusted is, because
the entrusters conceive themselves
either through their incapacity or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
to other imployments, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of what is truly the common
good. They entrust him, therefore,
with more then they understand;
and so his power is to proceed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his understanding, though
it crosse theirs: Hee then of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
must bee false to his Oath, if hee
doe not, according to his trust, act
for the common good what hee evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
sees in a high degree to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58869:50"/>
it. Further, because wee know,
in morall businesses, the end aimed
at, is more principall then the means
ordered to it, and hath such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
over them that they are to bee
or not to bee, according as is fitting
for the end: And in the Oath or
Promise of our high Magistrate, if
hee observe his limitations, he <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth</hi>
the end for which they
were put: Hee offends against both
his Oath and Fidelity to his people,
if hee maintain such limitations,
when hee is obliged, for the publick
good, that is, when hee ought to
break them.</p>
               <p>Yes but (replieth the man who
thinketh himselfe wedded to an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and seeming honesty in this
cause) howsoever, at least hee breaketh
that part of his Oath, in which hee
swore directly, to those limitations.
Let us therefore see even that point,
and ask, what was the peoples will in

exacting his Oath or Promise?
Doeth any one will what hee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth
and knoweth not? If one
should say to another, I give thee
what is in that trunk; in which
himselfe had put a suit of apparell,
and, without his knowledge, his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
had taken that out and put in
bags of gold to the same bulk; would
any Divine, or Chancery Judge, or
prudent person assert he were bound
to bestow on that promissary all
his gold, which was in the trunke?
I thinke not; and the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the will and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which hath the power to give
strength to a promise or contract;
and here the will is wanting; for
hee knew not what he said, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to give any thing but a suit of
clothes.</p>
               <p>How many promises doe Divines
and Lawyers pronounce null,
though they were good and valid
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58869:53"/>
when they were made, by reason
of the change of accidents follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which could not be foreseene?
If one promise his Daughter in
marriage to his neighbour, and shee
dyeth; is he bound to fulfill his
engagement, or seeke his neighbour
another wife? Nay, if the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
be discovered not to be the
man he was taken for; not to have
a competent estate and such like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions;
he may justifie the disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of his promise; nor shall
he forfeit his credit if he doeth not
keepe his word, but rather, if he
do, be accounted a weak man.</p>
               <p>Now, to come to our purpose,
let it bee supposed the people were
made understand, when they exact
the promise from their Magistrate,
that such limitations would destroy
their peace, and contentment: doth
any one think they would binde
their Governour to maintaine them?
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58869:54"/>
If they would not, tis evident,
howsoever their mouthes pronounced
the words, their hearts were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and inculpable of such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action;
for they knew not what
they did, they understood not nor
meant what they spake.</p>
               <p>But suppose that truely they
knew the incommodities that were
to follow, and yet they would have
them observed: For, this happeneth
often in this our subject, that some
(especially great men, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the populace) understand the
inconvenience of a Law, and yet
for private interest will have it
maintained: What then is the duty
of the supreame Magistrate, who is
sworne to maintaine the said Lawes?
The question is clearely answered
by the condemnation of <hi>Jephthe;</hi>
who, when he had rashly vowed to
sacrifice the first thing that met him
from home, did impiously murther
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58869:54"/>
his daughter. All understanding
men know, a wicked oath is not to
be observed. He that should give a
mad mana sword, because he had
vowed or sworne it, deserved to
be hanged for the murthers by him
committed: Now, an ignorant and
wilfull man, what is he but a mad
man? Or what is madnesse but a
wilfulnesse in doing evill? If the
action be naught and such as the
exactor cannot, with reason, desire,
he cannot by any oath bind a swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to it: Now to observe conditions
which shall ruine the Governement
and destroy the end for which they
were instituted, is an action con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all reason, and to which
the promissary cannot binde the
promiser, in any wisdome and
goodnesse: He is therefore bound,
rather to the destroying then ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
such conditions; neither is
he therefore perjured, but were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58869:55"/>
unjust and wicked, if he obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them. This so resolved, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
plainly, that no supreame
Magistrate can bee bound to any
Lawes contrary to good Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
farther then either the danger
of changing them, or the not cleerly
seeing them to be such, may hold
his hand.</p>

               <head>The Twelfth GROUND.</head>
               <head type="sub">Who is such a Governour, and the
Subjects duty towards him.</head>
               <p>WEE have long talked of
a Supreame Governour;
it is time we should point him out,
that he may bee knowne. And,
since all agree that there are three
sorts of Governement, Monarchy,
Aristocracy, and Democracy; when
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58869:55"/>
they are simple, there can bee no
doubt who is the supreame magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.
Now, mingled they may bee,
all together, or some two of them:
And againe, their mixing may bee
either continually, as when all parts
mixed are so often engaged that their
Authorities run jointly, or else some
are continuall, others but at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
termes.</p>
               <p>If Monarchy bee mixed, either
with Aristocracy or Democracy, so
that they be continually joint actors;
the Monarch is but a Servant, and
the other part the Master: as is to be
seen i<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>Italian Doges,</hi> and the
<hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Kings; for his force
is nothing, compared to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort.</p>
               <p>If Democracy and Aristocracy
be so mixed, the quarrell is more
ballanced; and because it is a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement
divided in it selfe, and
therefore dangerous; no doubt but,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58869:56"/>
if the Aristocracy get power enough,
she is in the posture of supreame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
The example of this wee
have in the <hi>Roman Common-wealth,</hi>
in the time, specially, of <hi>Sylla's</hi>
conquest; when, if he had setled
the State in the Senate, there had
been no feare of <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompeyes</hi>
mangling that <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> as
afterwards fell out.</p>
               <p>Monarchy and Democracy can
hardly be so mixed, that Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
be perpetuall, and Monarchy by
spurts: For that is not Monarchy;
the said Monarch being not long
enough in power to be accounted a
setled Magistrate; as wee see in the
<hi>Decemvirs, Tribunes</hi> and <hi>Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
amongst the Romans: So that,
the Monarch hath not the power in
his hand to change any thing, which
is the case we aime at. And the like
is of Aristocracy; when its em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
is the ordinary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58869:56"/>
and Monarchy onely by
turnes and seasons.</p>
               <p>There remaineth onely Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
in continuance, compared to
Aristocracy and Democracy at
certaine turnes. And in <hi>both,</hi> it is
cleare, the Monarch is the supreame
Governour in ordinary; and so the
Magistrate of whom we speake, who
may alter the inconveniences, if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
serve. As for the People,
they are but a weake part, if the
Governour be wise: So that he is,
by this posture, in the state of doing
that good to the Commonwealth
which his judgement and conscience
dictate to him to be necessary. The
comparison to Aristocracy is much
harder; every one of the Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy
being, generally and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
speaking, a petty Monarch;
and the whole of them easily assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled;
and, when so, having the
power in their hands: So that the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58869:57"/>
Monarch is not (by vertue of his
ordinary condition) in a posture
to bee able to rectifie what he seeth
necessary to be altered; therefore he
is not the man wee call the supreame
Magistrate, but the assembly of
the Nobility, whereof he is but an
eminent and considerable one.</p>
               <p>The Subject, being correlative to
the Magistrate, requireth upon that
title, to be reflected on; but much
more because the nature of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
cannot be well understood,
unlesse the duty of the Subject bee
joyntly declared. We must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
declare, or seeke out at least,
what Honour and Conscience ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
the Subject to: and, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
this, wee must reflect upon
his motive of Obedience; which,
as is before insinuated, was groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on the love and necessity of
living in Community, that, from
it, he may receive good, and, by
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58869:57"/>
its protection, secure himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
evill. To this end he entrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the charge of the common ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
to the Magistrate;
taking himselfe as one unskilfull or
unable for such employment. Wee
see therefore, the end of the Subject
in his obedience, immediately, is
the publick good or the good of the
Commonwealth: a farther though
more cordiall and deep in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
is the good he is to receive out
of the Commonwealth being well;
which is nothing else but that the
particulars of the Commonwealth
be so. Evident then it is, that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
motive which the Subject
is to propose before his eyes, in his
obedience, is the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth;
that is, the very same
motive the Magistrate ought to have
in administring, and which hee
had when first, in his owne person
or in his forefathers, he submitted
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58869:58"/>
himselfe to this rule.</p>
               <p>Wee know, by consequence,
how excellent a virtue this act of
Obedience is; having a motive of so
great a price and high elevation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
other ordinary employments,
which reach no farther then to his
private good. But, herein the same
vertue is lesse in the Subject then in
the Commander; that, because the
common good is the very private
good of the Commander, therefore
it is not related to any private good
of the same nature; and so not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
or limited by any other, as
in the subject it is by the end of
his idioticall good.</p>
               <p>The next thing that occurreth is
the Subjects fact by making this
trust; and that is, that he hath made
away all power of judgeing and
caring for the common good,
farther then by the eyes and hands
of the Magistrate, his Trustee, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58869:58"/>
they have not made him Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
Governour: So that, if he
thinketh or judgeth any thing to goe
amisse, or interpose his opinion, in
any reall and effective way, even
so farre as to disgust himselfe or any
other against the Governement;
he breaketh his promise and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to his Governour: Much lesse is
it in his power to recall the trust and
seeke any way to take it out of the
hands of his Soveraigne. As for his
oath of Allegiance, I believe every
man sees, it takes its strength from
these two; and, by consequence, is
to be understood to reach whither
they carry it, and strengthen the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
that they ground: but,
not to extend it selfe to what they
doe not; onely what they begin
and, as it were, make, the oath doth,
by Religion and reverence to God,
enholy and consecrate, and so
give it the greatest strength that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58869:59"/>
falleth upon humane Liberty.</p>
               <p>By this discourse, we learn, that
the Magistrates security, from hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
and conscience, is the greatest
that humane nature can frame; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grounded upon the noblest ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
fortified by the vertue of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity
so naturall and principall as
is above signified; the subject ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made as great an alienation of
his propriety to Governement as
will can ratifie; and lastly, eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it above his cwne soule by the
invocation of him who is master
both of soule and body, of time and
eternity. Whence, nothing but the
frailty of humane condition can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
a Governour once estated le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimately
in his seat of Justice;
nothing can make a Subject more
delinquent, then to work against
this duty of obedience; no wonder,
therefore, if Rebellion be connume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
with Soothsaying and Idolatry.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58869:59"/>
and Obedience preferred before sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
even in the sight of God.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Qualities of Lawes and
Commands, in respect to
Obedience.</head>
               <p>OUt of what hath been said
concerning the Subject's Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to Obedience, wee may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
a distinction made by
many, of the validity and lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of commands. For, the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
to a Soveraigne Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
is no other then that hee truly
thinketh it to bee for the good of
the common; that is, for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
good, all things considered:
which if hee doth, it is, by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
discourse, lawfull for him to
command, what he pleases, without
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58869:60"/>
reproach of conscience or honour to
him; and on the other side, if hee
swerve never so little, hee so farre
breaketh his trust: and the greater
the abuse is, the greater also his fault
and shame. But, the subject is to
remember that hee hath put his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in his Governour; as beeing
himselfe ignorant and not having
leasure to look into the depth of the
policy: and therefore hee is to think
and judge well of his Magistrates
counsells, and make account hee
doeth not understand the bottome of
them; and so bee prompt and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to obey.</p>
               <p>The validity of the command
consists in the obligation the subject
hath to performe it: And this may
faile in two degrees; One to the not
fulfilling the command, by avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it; the other, by resisting it. This
latter is no waies in the Subjects
hands, unless it be in such a case as
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58869:60"/>
his oath of Allegiance and Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the good of the Community,
cease or bind not: The former can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
happen as long as it can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to be the Commanders will
this Subject, in these circumstances,
should perform this command; For,
so long, his trust obligeth him not to
faile. But, because a Governour many
times is not rightly informed, nor
can a Law reach home to all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
accidents; it is very incident that;
in some speciall cases, the Subject
may presume it is not the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
will he should be bound to
this particular service. And this is so
ordinary that, among us, there is a
particular and highest Court, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
when wee are not bound to the
written lawes.</p>
               <p>Yet is it necessary to believe that
even that Court is able to satisfie all
cases, or that private men are bound
not to avoid a law without having
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58869:61"/>
recourse to that Court, or to obey all
decrees of that Court if they can
prudently avoid it: because no
Court (especially amongst refined
pleaders) can bee without many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities;
which are not the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Justice, and therefore
may prudently bee declined, neither
honour nor conscience obliging to
such proceedings. But they must
ever have for their rule, that the
Lawmaker intended not to include
them, in these circumstances, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the compasse of his Law.</p>
               <p>Some make us a threefold division
of Lawes; the first absolute or
commanding; the second permissive;
the third they call penall Lawes:
The first they averre to bee obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
because directly intended by
the Law-giver; and of this sort is
verified what wee have newly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed.</p>
               <p>The second (were it expressely
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58869:61"/>
the sense of the Law to permit a
thing) is also of the former kinde
and onely distinguished in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
For it would make the thing
permitted truly lawfull. But this is
not the Writers meaning: For they
doe not conceive it was the Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
intention to allow of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
but onely not to punish it,
or to ordaine somewhat in supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the case. As when usury is
limited to such a rate, that greater is
forbidden; but to such a rate is so
permitted, that he that hath borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is bound and compellable to pay
so many in the hundred; but no man
is bound to borrow; nor as they
say, <hi>allowed</hi> to take Interest, though
the Law constraine the borrower to
pay. But, how the Law can forc<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
the one to give, and yet not allow
the other to take, is to mee, a
hard proposition and like a rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle;
and therefore, I believe,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58869:62"/>
the law it selfe is to bee condemned
or the practice to bee justified; and
that truly there neither is nor can
bee such a kinde of Law, as shall
compell a thing to bee done and not
approve of the doeing.</p>
               <p>The third sort also seemeth to mee
no lesse contradictory: for though I
confesse there are penall Lawes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably,
that is, such as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
punishments for offences; yet
these Masters meane not such, but
under the cloake of the name, teach
disobedience to certaine Lawes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
us the Law-givers intention
is indefinite, that either a man
should doe such a thing, or suffer
such a punishment if hee bee disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to have committed the fault:
which is directly against all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
For first wee are to consider
whether the thing commanded bee
usefull to the Common-wealth; if
so, it cleerly argues it is the direct
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58869:62"/>
will of the Lawmaker. Againe,
it is to be looked into, if it be
universally neglected, what dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
accreweth to the Common;
and this also will assure us, by the
necessity of it, that it is intended for
the common good, and therefore to
be executed to the possibility of the
Subject. Againe, how unworthy a
thing is it of a Governour, who is
sapposed to be all equity and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
to ly at the catch with his
Subjects, to entrap them for a
thing he doth not aime to have done?
Besides, the name of punishment
supposeth a fault; so that, the law
must be supposed to speake im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly;
which, in its dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
way of proceeding, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd.</p>
               <p>Yet doe I not deny but Lawes
may bee made indefinitely; as, to
command every Townesman to
march or pay so much monies, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58869:63"/>
it to his Liberty to do which
hee listeth: But this is no penall
Law, nor hath it any likely hood of
one; but is meerly a disjunctive
Command. Neither likewise do
I entrench upon such orders in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities,
which being almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to bee rigorously observed,
have some other obligation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the failing; to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the conscience of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent,
whether discovered or no.
For, this clearely remaineth volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
and is ordered to make the
failing rare, and to acknowledge a
defect and fault in the not observing;
and so hath not that crossing of
the will, and that force which one
feeleth when he is discovered and,
by authority, chastised. So that,
in conclusion, there is but one sort
of Law in all these; and that binding
the Subject, in force of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
and oath, to the proportion of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58869:63"/>
his concurrence to the Common
good, by his act of Obedience.</p>

            <div n="14" type="ground">
               <head>The Fourteenth GROUND.</head>
               <head type="sub">In what conditions the Subject may
resist Governement.</head>
               <p>NOw, to returne to the former
part; it is evident, if it be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
to resist the Governement, it
will be lawfull also to break and
remove it: For, these two actions
are of the same nature; and, in
truth, pure resistance and disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is the annulling it. For, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement,
consisting in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of commanding, that is, of having
no resistance; to resist is not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it, but maintaine there
is no such power, at least, in this
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58869:64"/>
case; that is, to take it away in
this case; that is, to set another Judge
or knower when obedience is due
and when not; that is, not to keepe
the Subject in the nature of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
in which is grounded his
being a Subject. This being the
nature of this disobedience or resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Magistrate is bound with
all his strength to crush and breake
it; and, by consequence, it draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
along the concussion of the whole
state, if the Subject bee able to
make good his resistance. Out of
this it is cleare, that a Subject may
not use this resistance; but in case
when it is fitting to attempt the
dissolving of the Governement.</p>
               <p>It followes first, that it cannot
be done, but when the occass<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on is
greater then the value of the publick
peace and good of the Common-wealth.
No man therefore can just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attempt such a disobedience, to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58869:64"/>
save his owne life and goods, or the
life and goods of his owne family,
how great soever, if contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the bounds of a private family,
or but a part of the Common-wealth.
Now, how farre this extendeth, I
dare not subtilize; it being a kinde
of morall consideration and a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiall
esteeme to weigh it in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;
the common notion reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no farther, then that it be not
so notorious a part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
that it bee a homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neall
part of it, such as is fit to
make a Common-wealth of it selfe,
to determine whose nature, is not
the intent of our present embarque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The next consideration is, that
neither an universall harme, if
moderate and such as may bee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with lesse dammage then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
out of the State, is a sufficient
cause of resistance to the Soveraigne
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58869:65"/>
Magistrates command. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
an enormous Taxe (such as
was thought to be that which revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Guienne</hi> from <hi>Edward</hi> the third of
<hi>England,</hi> or the <hi>Low Countries</hi> from
<hi>Philip</hi> the second of <hi>Spain:</hi>) as both
their wars may well testifie; in which
the taking of any one Towne was
of more consequence then all such a
Taxe would have been. How farre
this also reaches is not for mee to
esteeme; Who should aske me, if
the Governour exacted for one time
all the Subject had, so there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a ground to worke upon of
new, and within a little time to live
contentedly; I should be troubled
to confesse it were a sufficient injury
to take up armes against him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I cannot judge which were the
greater mischief to the Subject.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if the wrong be of that
nature as to ruine the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
yet not suddenly but
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58869:65"/>
after many yeers, if often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
I cannot allow it a sufficient
cause of open resistance. The reason
is cleere; for, on the one side there
is no inconvenience so small but (in
processe of time) may grow to bee
the ruine of the Common-wealth, if
it bee often repeated and so excessive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
multiplied; and on the other
side, long time breeds so great
changes or, at least, is subject to
them, that the pure nature of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
is not able to justifie a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
and breach of unity in a
Common-wealth, and so, not the
resistance to the Governour. How
much the time in which the ruine
would follow should bee, to make it
a sufficient cause, who can judge?
Onely this wee see, that what will
not ruine in a set time, wil never
doe it; and I have seen people live
happily, where it was said, they
paid the value of their whole subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58869:66"/>
to their Magistrate once in
seven yeers. Nor doe I pretend, by
these instances, to set any rule for
enfranchising the subject; more
then this, When <hi>evidently</hi> the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Governour is greater then
the mischiefe hazarded. When
ever this happeneth, bee the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
conditions what they will, the
subject is free: And if this bee not,
whatsoever the circumstances bee,
the subject ought not to stirre. For,
this and this onely is the finall cause
measuring all attempts, <hi>What is best
for the People;</hi> and knowne it is
that, if it bee not evident to bee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to stirre, it is evidently better to
remaine quiet: for, not-a-cause is
sufficient for not changing; but, for
a change and such a change, it
ought to bee <hi>a cleer and evident
abbetterment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is further to be looked into
what part of the Common-wealth it
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58869:66"/>
ought to bee that is sufficient to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
such a quarrell. For, as there
is no doubt, but the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
that is, such a portion
of it as makes the Governours party
inconsiderable, is sufficient: so, there
will bee lesse doubt on the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme,
if the number resisting bee a
pure single part, it is not sufficient to
proceed to this extremity. The
question then is, whether the party
rising ought to bee the <hi>major</hi> or
equall or, at least, inconsiderably
lesse then those who side with the
Magistrate. But here wee must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the greatnesse of the Common-wealth
divided. For if such parts
bee of themselves, fit to make Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths,
nothing considered
but the quantity or the number; it
cannot bee doubted but that will sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
now what that quantity is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to another science.</p>
               <p>Besides all these considerations,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58869:67"/>
there remaineth another; that it
can bee effected: For who is to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
an action, ought as well to
weigh the cost of compassing, as the
worth and recompence when it is
compassed: so that, unlesse the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of missing and the labour of
obtaining, beeing both added into
the ballance with the present quiet,
bee all overswayed; it cannot bee
prudently done to engage for a
change.</p>
               <p>Some will tell mee, never did
people expect with so much patience
as I require: And your Gallants,
who pretend to generosity, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime,
it is better to dye in the
field then suffer such indignities:
Nay, some will think or, at least,
vaunt it fitter to lye in prison or rot
in a dungeon, or seeke his fortune
in <hi>Barbary,</hi> then to be under such
a slavery. My answer to these last
Gallants is, that they should first
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58869:67"/>
try what it is to rot in a Dungeon,
or to wander amongst Barbarians;
before they engage themselves and
other ignorant persons in such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures.
To the second, that I
understand not those spurgalls of
honour, which disquiet their fiery
humours: I onely discourse of what
is fitting to make a sweet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
life, to them who thinke it
consists in enjoying naturall goods
of Science and Vertue for our
mindes, and the accommodation of
our sences for our bodies: Those
high and aereall goods of honour,
and vapouring words I esteeme as
<hi>Ajax</hi> (when his eyes were open) at
his death; <hi>Vertue</hi> (said hee, meaning
honour) <hi>I followed thee as a thing,
but I finde thou art but words.</hi> To
the formost, I answer, I doe not
averre men either have been wise
or will bee so wise; onely endevour
to lay before them what it is to bee
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58869:68"/>
so; let them look to the exercise.
Neither on the other side doe I ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
the Prince who putteth his
subject to such extremities, or think
it prudence in him to doe it, or that
he doeth not deserve all the mischiefe
which may light upon him for it: I
leave both to the force of nature, to
their wit or folly, and to the force of
reason or passion which governes
in persons and present circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
keeping my self in the
common notions which belong to
Science.</p>
               <p>Still there remaines one difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which may breed great variety in
the resolution; and it is, who is to
bee Judge, Whether the neglect of
the Magistrate bee so great, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
resistance? For, if the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
himselfe bee endowed with
that power, it is a folly to thinke
that circumstance will ever come;
and, if it belong to the people,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58869:68"/>
such hot-spurres, as wee spake
of, will make it come long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the season bee ripe for it. But,
the truth is, this question seemeth in
a manner superfluous: For it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
there is a question and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
to bee decided; and by the
conditions put, it is cleer there can
bee no question of the necessity of
the resistance; for they are such as
to put the question beyond all ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity
in the very conscience of the
Magistrate, the objects beating on
the subject in every ones particular
beyond denyall and dispute. And
besides, as long as truly there is any
disputablenesse, the trust reposed in
the Magistrate makes him Judge;
For, beeing entrusted as a man both
knowing and good, and the people
taking themselves as ignorant in
what they trust him; cleerly hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
sole Judge, as long as there
remains a case to be judged. And
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58869:69"/>
therefore his either ignorance, or
carelessenesse, or Tyranny ought to
bee so evident, that it bee beyond all
question; or else the subject must
have patience for his owne good,
which is his aime in putting himselfe
under governement.</p>

               <head type="sub">Wherein consists the power and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Subject.</head>
               <p>YEt may some think, on the other
side, that the doctrine delivered
contradicts it selfe. For, it beeing
before determined, that the people
hath alienated all right of judging
or medling in governement; how
can it ever happen that they should
have a right to interpose againe, or
that such circumstances can possibly
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58869:69"/>
fall out in which they may resist the
Magistrate? And this objection is
so much the stronger, by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
so great a power in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
of breaking all Lawes and
limitations of Governement, by the
force of reason placed in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of power and authority, as
hath been declared: whence it
seemes, since that authority in the
Magistrate cannot consist with an
opposite authority in the subject, to
bridle and curb him; they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have this power to resist.</p>
               <p>And the truth is, the people act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not what it doeth in such a case,
by any authority acquired, but by
the force of nature; that same force
by which the Magistrate overswayes
the Lawes, but in other circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
And first that the people hath
no authority to oppose their superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
is manifest: For, authority is a
thing instituted by consent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58869:70"/>
on promise; but here is no
need of consent nor any thought of
it; here is no publicke meetings or
<hi>Ligues;</hi> and if there were, they
would bee of no value against a
former tradition of their wills to
their Magistrate: It cannot bee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the people proceed by any
such contract.</p>
               <p>Whence is it then that the people
come to any such power? The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
is, As, when they first insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
Government, they did it in
the force of Nature; without having
any other Power then the pure force
of Rationality: so, if, by any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
they be devolved into the
same state of Anarchy that their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
made bindes no more; then Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionality
teacheth them and giveth
them, by force of nature, to institute
another Governement. Now, the
excessive disorders, expressed in the
forementioned conditions, make it
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58869:70"/>
evident they are not in a Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that is, in a conspiracy to the
common good, which is the offence
of Governement; but in an Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
and therefore remitted, by the
evill managing or insufficiency of
their Governour, to the force of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to provide for themselves, and
not bound by any promise made to
their Governour: the whole end
and intention of their promise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
purely, to submit to Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that is, conduce to the common
good &amp; safety; which having failed,
there is no more obligation in their
oath or promise, then if they had
never made them. This is, therefore,
the ground of the peoples opposition,
and onely circumstance to justifie
their breaking their oath and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise:
so that, in truth, the Magistrate,
first, by his miscarriages, abdicateth
himself from being a Magistrate, and
proveth a Brigand and robber in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58869:71"/>
stead of a Defender; and the people,
in the way of naturall preservation
of themselves, make resistance against
him.</p>
               <p>I should passe farther to the
change of Governement, did not the
loud and universall cry of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people, especially of our Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
Countries, diverting my pen,
force me to attend their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.
They say, this Doctrine
deliver'd ruineth their Liberty; and
people are but a knot of slaves and
Galley-birds, if this be the course
of Governement. They must be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
or, at least, their courage al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd,
by reason, if it be possible.
For this word <hi>Liberty</hi> prints it selfe
in such a letter, that it leaves unstu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
no man, as one speaketh. The
<hi>Pelagian</hi> thinkes he hath lost his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
liberty, if it may be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by Gods omnipotency. The
worldly man accounts himselfe a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58869:71"/>
slave, if rationall governement be
conserved: he must have license to
commit wickednesse and ruine Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement,
or else he is in chaines.
Let us then repeat the nature of
Governement, and see wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
the Liberty of the Subject, that
we may know when he hath it, and
what belongeth to it.</p>
               <p>The people (we said) to fall to
their owne businesse, and the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of nature, choose one or more
to manage the common interests;
holding them wise and capable, and
themselves unskilfull; and this with
a great deale of reason: for nothing
but experience, and much debating
is able to beget a sufficient art or
knowledge, in such subtle points and
turnings. Besides, they esteemed a
few fitter for resolution, and easier
to agree then their owne multitude;
where so many private aimes are
hard to be avoided, and if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58869:72"/>
to the common. Upon these
grounds, it is plaine, out of the very
nature of Governement, that they
reserve no power in themselves to
consult of common businesses. For,
how absurd is it that he who hath no
skill shall give counsell, or sway
the resolutions of those whose art
and profession it is? Or, what wise
man could undertake a Governement
with truth and honour, if, in his
greatest difficulties, he must depend
on the advice, or rather wilfulnesse
of an ignorant rabble?</p>
               <p>Let us look now what is left for
the obeying party; and we shall
finde, it is to governe their private
affaires, as farre forth as they fall
not within the verge of the common
good or harme. But, once put that
the private mans business either
hinders, or is necessary to help the
common designes: and, as evident
as it is that the common is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58869:72"/>
before the particular; so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
it is, that even his proper bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
is not to be managed, so far,
by his private understanding and
liberty. If the Souldier, when he
is commanded to stand <hi>Perdue,</hi>
should have his private considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
allow'd him, what could the
Army doe? If the Citizen, being
commanded to watch his turne upon
the walls, might bring an excuse that
he had no body to look to his shop,
the City would soone fall to the
enemies prey. Private interest, then,
must yeeld, when the publick is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
or else no Governement can
be hoped for: and, he that will leave
matters of great consequence to the
resolution of the govern'd party,
must make them the Governours.</p>
               <p>Wherein then consists the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of every Subject? In not being
controll'd in his private affaires. If
there be not justice administred both
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58869:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
against Robbers and Riotous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors,
the Citizen is not free: if
he be molested in his domestick ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
otherwise Men when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
demandeth his assistance, he
is not free. But, for serving the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
it is the freest act he hath: It
was his choice to elect it, it is his
good to conserve it, and will be his
destruction to infringe it. As it is
no liberty to have an immunity to
hang or maime himselfe, or his wife
and children, or to commit any other
unnaturall act; no more is it to be
esteem'd Liberty, to have the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to substract himselfe from the
service of the Common-wealth.
They are therefore seditious spirits,
who, using the name of Liberty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
the Subject against the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate;
and in themselves, ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it is either ignorance or faction,
which is the true Mistresse of such
attempts. Nor can it be feared, that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58869:73"/>
Governement, carried connaturally
and as it ought to be, doth any way
prejudice the Liberty of the Subject,
what seisures soever it makes either
upon goods or persons.</p>
               <p>Yes, but Governours will exceed
the moderation of the true Lawes
of Governement. First, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
hath a presumption of
their goodness to the contrary. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
admit they doe, must we
seek to remedy it by a greater
wound which is, by taking away the
life and soule of Governement?
Againe, the oppression is either in
common upon all, or in particular
upon some few: If in common, it is
almost impossible to be heavy upon
every one; for, many little summes
easily rise to a great one, and many
hands make light worke: If the
wrong be done to particulars, wee
ought to consider that accidentall
harmes cannot be prevented neither
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58869:74"/>
in nature nor in humane affaires;
and so are objects of pity rather
then of hope to be amended, and to
be tolerated rather, in respect of the
great good which is in the common
peace, then expose all to such confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
as must be, and ever hath beene
where the Governement is, in part,
placed in unexperient hands.</p>
               <p>This, therefore, is resolved, that the
plenitude of power in the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
hinders not the liberty of the
Subject: which is to bee contained
within an inferiour sphere, and the
sphere it selfe within the sphere of
Governement; and to be carried by
it, as the private good by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
when the necessity of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
requires. Likewise, the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of right of the Subject is to bee
taken, not against the Governour
or common right, but against the
encroaching of another party: as,
whoever understands what common
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58869:74"/>
and particular signifie, easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
that the common and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
are not two; as the part and
the whole make not two, because the
part is included in the whole; but
part and part make two, because one
hath no community with the other.
Therefore, it stands not with reason,
that any private person should claim
a right against the Common-wealth,
or the Governour, which is all one;
for, so he makes the Common-wealth
a part distinguished from
himselfe.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the dispossession of a supreme for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Governour, and of his right.</head>
               <p>THis rubb being taken away, our
march is free to consider the
action of the change of Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58869:75"/>
by what it is effected that the
former Governour remaineth no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in his authority, and the new one
beginneth to have the power. For,
we speake of a supreme Governour
whose power is sworne to; and so
fortified, by an allegiance due from
the people, and a right obtained by
himselfe. And, we may presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect,
that our former discourse, Of
the Peoples resistance to a Soveraign
Magistrate, reached not to the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of this. For, there we suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Magistrate to have behav'd
himself so unworthily, that he was
truely no Governour but a Tyrant
and Robber; and so had really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
himselfe, and disannull'd the
Subjects oath and obligation by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing,
in deeds and practice, the
nature of a Governour. Now, our
Question supposeth the Governour
not to have come to that extremity:
but, either to have been good or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent:
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58869:75"/>
or that it is doubtfull whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his excesses deserved expulsion:
or, at least, if they did deserve it of
themselves, yet the circumstances
were not fitting for it; but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion
happened either by the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a stranger, or the ambition
of a Subject, or some popular head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
tumult; for, these three wayes
a Magistrate comes, forcibly and
unjustly, to be outed of his power.</p>
               <p>And first, if the Magistrate have
truely deserved to be dispossessed;
or it be rationally doubted that he
hath deserved it, and hee bee actually
out of possession: In the former case,
it is certaine, the subject hath no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to hazard for his restitution,
but rather to hinder it: For, since it
is the common good that both the
Magistrate and the Subject are to
aime at; and clearly, out of what is
expressed, it is the common harme,
to admit againe of such a Magistrate;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58869:76"/>
every one, to his power, is bound to
resist him. If you say, he may or will
repent and amend, that importeth
not our Question, or Whether he be
to be restor'd? but, Whether he be
to be chosen of new? For, since it
was meerely his possession and the
interest of not changing or troubling
the Common-wealth which oblig'd
the Subject to maintaine him; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
supposed his owne desert did
condemne him, this change and
trouble of the Common-wealth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now turned on the other side and
another in possession, clearly neither
he hath any right left, nor the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
any obligation to maintaine
but rather oppose him. Now, if his
desert be doubtfull, then is it also
doubtfull whether he hath right or
no: and certaine, that the common
good is not to be disturbed for it;
Nature teaching that wee need no
reason to be quiet and remaine where
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58869:76"/>
we are, but that to make a change we
must see a strong cause and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>The next case is, if he be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and wrongfully depos'd, nay,
let us adde, One who had governed
well and deserved much of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth:
yet he is totally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess'd;
and so, that, it is plaine,
in these circumstances, it were better
for the common good to stay as they
are, then to venture the restoring
him, because of the publicke hazard.
It is cleare, in this case, there is a
comparison betweene the generall
good of the Common-wealth, on
the one side, and the particular of
this man or family on the other.
Let us, then, put the case on his
part; and see, If he be generous, if
he hath setled in his heart that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
single man ought to preferre the
common Interest before his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
safety, profit, or honour; if
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58869:77"/>
hee bee fit for a Governour, that
is, one that is to espouse the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good as his owne individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
what he will, in honour and
conscience, resolve: whether hee bee
not obliged absolutely to renounce
all right and claime to Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and, if he does not, hee bee
not worse then an Infidell: For,
if he that hath no care of his Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks,
be reputed so; with how
much more reason, he that is ready
to plunge a whole Nation in blood,
for his owne Interest?</p>
               <p>Let us cast the accompts on the
other side; and see, that the Subjects
aime ought to be the publicke
peace, and quiet enjoyment of their
lives and interests: It will appeare
that, if hee bee bound to renounce
his claime, they cannot be oblig'd
to maintaine it: and besides, that
they are wilfully blinde, if, where
the whole concernements of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58869:77"/>
their wives and children lie
at the stake, they will venture all for
an aereall fancy, without regard to
the <hi>end</hi> of Governement, publicke
peace; meerely for the <hi>meanes,</hi> this
mans Governement, without whom
the end may be obtain'd. It cannot,
therefore, be rationall on either side,
for a dispossess'd Governour to be
restor'd with hazard: unlesse it be
certaine the succeeding Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be a pure Tyranny, and so the
dispossess'd person necessary for the
quiet and peace of the Common-wealth;
and therefore, that both
sides pretend the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
as well hee that is
to be restor'd, as those who seek to
restore him.</p>
               <p>But some cry, he had right; he
hath not deserv'd to lose it; Justice
must be done whatever follows on
it; happy they that are unfortunate
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58869:78"/>
in so good a Cause, they shall not
lose their reward, however it fares
with them now. Well for them,
if this plea will serve them in the
next world; nor will I dispute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the evidence of what I deliver
be so great as that ignorance may
not excuse them: That question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Tribunall of God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
I must say that, before men,
who are clad with flesh, and whole
hearts cannot be pierced by other
mens guesses, the Law is, that not
onely the intention bee good, but
also the action be intelligent and
prudent; otherwise, we are subject
to believe, that some vanity or secret
hopes doe byass the actor and make
his proceeding irrationall. I must
also tell them, that this principle,
<hi>Fiat Justitia &amp; ruat coelum,</hi> is
seldome practised amongst the wise;
who all agree that Charity and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58869:78"/>
Prudence ought still to moderate
the rigour of Justice. It is also
too metaphysicall for a morall
way, to thinke that Justice is a
<hi>Platonick Idea</hi> in the concave of
the Moone; no waies to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by circumstantiall occurrences:
Whereas, the truth is, Justice is
but a partiall and commanded ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
and that which governes in
man, is reason or his owne nature
and inclination to make all his
actions connaturall and fit for a
rationall Creature; and so may
consult whether Justice be in some
to bee administred, and pronounce
that <hi>Summum jus est summa in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, the capitall in this matter
is, that truely there is no justice on
either the Magistrates or Peoples
side, to binde to the restoring
him: both these depending on the
promise made, and the force of the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58869:79"/>
promise being none, since the ground
of it is changed. For, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the promise made to a
Magistrate, is, To obey him as a
Magistrate, that is, as farre as is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for the Common-wealth and
peace; he being nothing but the
instrument of the common good:
Now, take away that fitnesse for the
Common-wealth, and that which
gave strength to the promise is gone,
and the promise it selfe is no more a
promise, nor can any obligation
arise from it. Who knows not,
that the promise of any man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on his intention, his intention
on his knowledge, his knowledge
reacheth no farther then his conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and present memory when he
maketh the promise? So that, in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
a promise reacheth onely to
presupposed and thought on circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances:
and who, when he sweareth
to a Magistrate, expecteth to see
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58869:79"/>
him dispossessed and turned off?</p>
               <p>Nature annulleth promises: as,
when we promise to come such a
day, and either die or are imprisoned
before. Morality annulleth them: as
if we promise to run such a horse
against another a month hence, and
the horse in the meane time falleth
lame; who will condemne the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
for not venturing on such a
race? Is not the man better then
his word? If then the man himselfe
bee lesse then the common good,
which he must violate by keeping
his word; can his word be greater?
But a promise must many times bee
kept even with losse of life? I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it not: But, first, I must bee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
it is a promise; which before
I have declared to bee none: For,
our case is case of Nature not of
Law, we admit no presumptions;
nothing what he meant to doe or
should have done, wee onely regard
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58869:80"/>
what was done. Secondly, if it
were intended to be so promised, it
was wicked and irrationall; for, to
promise to regard a private mans
good against the common, is unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
and wicked; therefore, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was a promise, can never binde
as such, nor be professed with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
either to be made, or, if made,
to bee kept. I need not insist upon
the confirmation by oath: for, every
one understands, if the Oath be but
a confirmation of a precedent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and there were no promise,
there can be no oath, to have the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and force of an oath.</p>
               <p>So that, this is manifest, a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
actually dispossessed hath no
right to be restored, nor the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
any obligation to seek to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store,
but oppose him. For, what is
man, or rather mankinde (for, so we
have styled a nation) better then a
herd of sheepe or oxen, if it bee
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58869:80"/>
to bee owned, like them, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters?
What difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
their Masters selling them to
the Butcher, and obliging them to
venture their lives and livelihoods
for his private Interest? Wee know
it is naturall, that the part should
venture for the whole; but that the
whole should venture the losse of it
selfe to save the part, I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand.
The Governour is the
highest and noblest part, yet but a
part; the People is the whole, the
End, (though not by office, yet by
worth and dignity) the Master and
Lord, for whom those who are
Lords by office are to be vested and
devested in Lordship, when it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the common good: who
thinks otherwise, deserves not the
name of a man.</p>

               <p>BUt one will object, if hee were

reason hee should have reparation.
And this cannot bee denied. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the Governement taken from
him, hee was peradventure injured
in his reputation and spoiled of such
aliments as are fit to maintaine him
according to the quality of his
birth and education: And, for
these, hee may, as a private man,
demand reparation; but so, as still
to remember he is a Denizen of that
Countrey, a member of that people,
and compared to it as a particular
to its universall; and may demand
his share, yet so that if it cannot bee
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58869:81"/>
obtained without the concussion of
the publicke, hee is to renounce it
and sacrifice that interest to the good
of his Countrey.</p>
               <p>Likewise, on the opposite side,
the Common-wealth may demand
reparations against the dispossessed
Magistrate, who abused it or his
subjects during his governement:
Not touching any thing hee did upon
intention of the publick good, though
it were breaking of known Laws or
any injurious violence offered, with
pretence of serving the Common-wealth;
For, the trust put in his
hands vindicates him from all such
actions, as long as they beare the
face of any intention of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good. But, if, for private
mens satisfaction, or his owne lust,
or covetousnesse hee did any wrong,
of that hee may bee asked an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:
not while hee is in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement
but after the dispossession,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58869:82"/>
when now the common distemper
followeth not the prosecution of
such riots, and so, his publicke pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
beeing gone, hee is but a
private man, and consequently, by
the force of nature, subject to a
stronger; obligations of common
good and former promises beeing
now faded away, and hee left in
the condition of a stranger, saving
that his demerits follow and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
him, if other merits doe not
counterballance them and exempt
him.</p>
               <p>Againe, when hee is to bee judged,
he cannot bee proceeded against by
Law; which can judge none but
the offenders against it. Now wee
have had often occasion to declare
that the chiefe Magistrate is not
under the Law; the common good
for which the Lawes themselves
were made, beeing committed to his
trust, and the end hee is to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58869:82"/>
beeing higher then the Lawes,
which are but a part of the meanes
to arrive at that end, and therefore
inferiour aud subordinate to it. But
those who could put their owne
agreements, that is, the Lawes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his feet, could not put Nature
under them, nor authorise him to doe
any irrationall or unhandsome acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Therefore, when the structure
of the Common-wealth is dissolved,
that is, disjointed from him, then
any who hath suffered wrong in
the fore-declared manner may bee
party against him and proceed as
if there were no Common-weath;
by the Law which, in a Wildernesse,
warranteth us to kill a Tyger or
Robber that seeketh to kill us, not
pretending Law for our action, but
that it is manlike &amp; rational. Neither
ought it bee called punishment that
is done against a dispossessed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
but rather revenge, or some
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58869:83"/>
other name that includeth no order
to Law.</p>
               <p>By this wee understand the truth
of that famous question; Whether
a Soveraigne bee under the Lawes?
to which is ordinarily answered,
that hee is, as farre as his example
and direction is necessary to his
subjects; but not so, that the Law,
as such, hath any superiority or
force upon him. To declare this
more plainly, wee must remember,
the Rule of his actions is, To doe
what reason teaches a man in his
posture ought to doe, that is, what is
fitting for the publicke: Now ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
speaking, the common good
requireth that the Lawes bee obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
betwixt fellowes of the same
Common-wealth; wherefore Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
teacheth him to give example of
that observance, as farre as his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
office permits.</p>
               <p>Besides, in the very person of the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58869:83"/>
Soveraigne are to bee distinguished,
his beeing one of the Common-wealth,
and beeing the head or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate:
So that, though his beeing
a Magistrate exempts his publicke
actions and also his person and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
actions from the inquisition
of the Law; yet it doth not exempt
his private actions from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to those of the subjects,
that is, from being good or bad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
like or dislike to the actions
which the Law commandeth or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth.
So that, he is not, even in
his private actions, subject to the
Lawes at his <hi>rule;</hi> for <hi>that</hi> is onely
reason; but, as they are a kinde of
way chalked out to him for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
part of his action; as the
Architect frames his house for him;
or the Gardiner his walkes: That
is, the Lawes are to him as an art
under him, an art to shew him what
is to bee done, not to command or
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58869:84"/>
punish him for not doing; nay,
not so much as necessitating him to
doe, at least, universally, whether
the businesse be purely betwixt sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
or betwixt himselfe as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
person, and his subjects.</p>
               <p>For, the principle of common
good beeing higher then the art of
making Lawes, may, nay ought in
some cases, differ from the prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
of the Law. Yet this must
not authorize him to dispense fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
with the Law; the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement
beeing not possible to
bee good in which there is no
constancy: But, if the circumstances
require any Law to bee often forced;
the Law it selfe ought to bee limited,
that the practice of the subject may
bee firme and customary, which is
that maketh the Lawe-please. Thus
in conclusion, though the Magistrate
bee not commanded by the Lawes,
nor personally subject to them, yet
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58869:84"/>
reason (which is his rule) bindeth
him to observe them as the good of
his people; and (ordinarily speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
essentiall to his end, which is
the common good. The Lawes
therefore are his matter to work
on, or instruments necessary to
work by, not his rule or Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
directions.</p>
               <p>There remaines yet untouched the
question that seemeth most trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to many, When the change
of the Governement is valid, and
such as the subjects obedience is
due to the new Magistrate and to
bee substracted from the old, how
unjustly soever hee were bereaved of
it. And, others have sought by
terme of yeers to decide the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty:
among whom, one was Pope
<hi>Vrban the eight,</hi> an intelligent and
generous Prince and well versed in
politick Governement. Hee pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
a decision that after five yeers
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58869:85"/>
quiet possession of an estate, the
Church was not bound to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
whether the title were lawfull
or no; but acknowledge the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessour,
in Ecclesiasticall businesses.
So much hee said for aimes sake.
But, wee must proceed upon other
principles, that is, the forelaid and
main <hi>basis</hi> of our discourse, that
the common good ought to bee the
rule of the Magistrates title, and
the subjects obedience.</p>
               <p>Out of which this followeth, that
when ever (considering all things)
the common good is cleerly on the
possessors side, then the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed
hath no claime. Neither
ought wee expect till wee have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
that it will not bee better
for the subject if the late owner (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
great dangers, gaineth his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
power: For, first, this it selfe
is uncertaine; secondly, the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of endevours to restore him
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58869:85"/>
must bee hazardous; thirdly, many
and great mischiefs, during the time
of the attempt, are altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable;
and all this to bee bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced
against those uncertaine
hopes. Nor, againe, must wee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that the wills of all the subjects
concurre, actually, to the acceptance
of the new Governour: For that
is either impossible or of so long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
as to ruine all dissensions
and jealousies in the meane time:
Nay, the vulgar sort are so easily
led by fancy, that they understand
not the common good, nor what
they should wish.</p>
               <p>But you may demand, How
shall it bee knowne when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good holdeth it selfe on the
possessour's hand? I answer, wee
must first see who are the common,
whose welfare is to bee preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
private interests. And pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
it appeareth that, dividing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58869:86"/>
the whole people into Governours
and governed; the governed part is
the Publicke to whose good the
Governours are to direct their
paines: And that these are they
that spend their lives in seeking
their owne profits, either by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
the Land, or in Arts and
Handicrafts: Whence, it followes,
when their good stands on the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessours
side, then cleerly hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to gaine right and power; and
this is plaine to bee, when the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
the Husbandman, and
Tradesman, with their appendices,
are in an undisturbed practice of
their functions, and begin to bee
afraid of change upon the noise of
an invasion.</p>
               <p>This resolution could not bee
doubted, were it not that one might
object, that what is said seemes true,
abstracting from circumstances;
but it ought to bee considered, that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58869:86"/>
such men see nothing but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appearances of what passes in
humane negotiations, and so there
may many circumstances lie hidden
from them, which would make them
thinke or wish otherwise if they
knew them: As, for example, home-dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,
and forraigne conspiracies;
which if understood, would make
these honest men preferre a warre,
after which there is to follow a
peace farre exceeding the present
quiet and such a one as deserves the
intervening disturbance and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.</p>
               <p>And indeed, I allow these men
understand not such mysteries of
State, nor penetrate the value of the
hazard: But, if they doe not, why
are they not also exempted from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
on those motives? and then
the rest of the Common-wealth will
bee but so many private men, who
must follow the common<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Againe,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:58869:87"/>
if they think themselves well, they
manifestly consent to the present
Governement, and therefore cut off
the title of the dispossessed Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
Besides, who can answer they
shall be better by the returne of the
dispossessed party? surely, by common
presumption, the gainer is like to
defend them better then he who
lost it.</p>
               <p>But, let us overslip this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and end of the common Good:
how long must we expect, till it shall
be suppos'd the right of the former
Magistrate is extinct? Some Ages?
as wee kept our title to <hi>France,</hi> and
<hi>France</hi> did to <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples:</hi> Or
at least some generations? as the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> warres upon
<hi>Holland:</hi> Or, till the former Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
declares the relinquishment of
his right? Or, till his followers are
weary of inventing new devices, to
blind, &amp; ruine their unwary friends?
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58869:87"/>
All these are soone discern'd to bee
meere uncertainties; and rather nets
to catch fools and bring them to the
ambitious desires of some few men,
then any grounded reason. But, what
if an open Enemy should come, could
or ought the Subjects joine against
him with their new Magistrate?
If not, the whole publick must pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish:
If they may, then the case
is the same against their old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate;
since his right stood upon
the common peace, and that is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
from him to his rivall by the
title of quiet possession.</p>

                  <hi>REason</hi> hath plaid its part; but
Authority cannot be silenc'd
unheard. Let us therefore hearken
to what it saith. And, first steps
up the Divine to preach us, out of
Scripture, the duty wee owe to
Priests and Kings; no lesse then
death and damnation beeing the
guerdons of rebellion and disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
The Lawyers come yoaked
from the Popes and Emperours
Court, taking for maxime, <hi>Tempus
non occurrit Ecclesiae &amp; Regi.</hi> The
practice seems to confirme the same;
wee seeing both some Noble men
and divers Cities make protestations
against the possession of others for
many years and ages. But, which is
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58869:88"/>
more, they will speak reason too at
least, by the Divines mouth; who
telleth us, that God, by nature, is
high Lord and Master of all; That
whoever is in power receiveth his
right from him; That Obedience
consists in doing the will of him
who commandeth; and concludeth
that this will ought to bee obeyed
till God taketh away the obligation,
that is, till hee who is to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himselfe releaseth his right.</p>
               <p>The Authorities they cite out of
Holy Writ are, for the most part,
meere commands to obey where obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
is due, without specifying
what or when it is due. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
is extended to wicked and
evill Governours as well as good.
One place there is, where <hi>Samuel</hi>
denounceth to the people the evills
that will come to them by the power
of the King; and calleth them <hi>Jus
Regis,</hi> or, as the Hebrew text, <hi>Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58869:89"/>
Regis,</hi> or, <hi>Legem Regis,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
<hi>Regni.</hi> And these words
are, in two sences, true; one, that
the King would do the wrongs there
mentioned, by force; the other,
that the people, since they would
have a King, ought not to resist him
when hee did such things. Yet doe
I not deny but, if the particulars
there mentioned, bee interpreted
gently, all that is there recited
might, with justice, bee practised by
a King: As, when it is said hee
should take away their Vineyards
and Olive-gardens; it may bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
upon confiscation and by
other lawfull wayes. Besides, they
may peradventure alledge that God,
by his speciall command, transferred
the Kingdome from <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>David,</hi>
from <hi>Roboam</hi> to <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and some
others. But, they should also let us
know, what they deduce from hence:
For in such changes, God gave no
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58869:89"/>
new Authority or Power to such
Kings, but the same their predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
had: So that, in fine, all that is
brought out of Scripture falleth
short of proving that no time can
make void the right of a King once
given him from the hand of God.</p>
               <p>The reason of this weak way of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging
Scripture is, that when they
read that God commandeth or doth
this, they look not into nature to
know what this commanding or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is; but presently imagine God
commandeth it by expresse and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
words, and doeth it by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
position of the things said
to bee done; whereas in nature the
commands are nothing but the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
light God hath bestowed on
mankinde, and which is therefore
frequently called the Law of nature.
Likewise, Gods doing a thing is
many times onely the course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
second causes, to which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:58869:90"/>
God gives the direction and
motion, hee both doeth and is said
to doe all that is done by them; as
truly as the weight of a Jack turnes
the meat upon the spit, and the
spring of a Watch makes the clock
of it strike: A notion not onely of
a large extent and usefulnesse in it
selfe, but, which gives mee just occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of complaining against these
verball and winde-blowne Divines,
as the bane of Christendome and
Christian doctrine. For, whereas
the Scripture is a book enriched with
all Science and depth of learning;
this sort of Grammar Divines, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either Logick, Philosophy, or
Morality, meerly by the vertue of
their Dictionary, and such like lip-learning,
undertake to bee interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the sacred Bible, and in
stead of the sence of the letter, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
to the Readers their owne low
and many times phreneticall fancies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:58869:90"/>
Let us instance in our present que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
The first position they take is,
That God is Lord and Master of all
things. What seems, nay truly is
more conformable to Scripture and
Reason then this assertion, as it lies
in words? And yet many not look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the nature of God and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
and intelligent substances,
make a shift to pervert it into a meer
blasphemy: For, if the sence bee
onely this, that God is omnipotent
and no resistance possible in any
creature to his absolute will; nothing
is more certaine, nothing more holy.
But, this is not the meaning of
the Divines; but, that there is an
Attribute or notion in God of being
Lord and Master, to which they do
not say we cannot, but, ought not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
and rather admit that wee
can. And herein is the first faltring,
that, in effect, they deny the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency,
and reduce that which is a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58869:91"/>
true physicall power to a Morall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.
But this is not all.</p>
               <p>The next point is, that, if even
this Morality were founded in that
great nature of Beeing, and beeing
intelligent, which is in God almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and that they also held his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
were to bee obeyed, because
they proceed from an understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which cannot erre, and which is
essentially the very order and well
beeing of all creatures; the former
would seeme pardonable: But, they
will have it quite contrary, that
therefore things amongst creatures
goe well, because not reason, not the
eminentiall beeing of themselves in
God is their off-spring, but because
a high and overpowering will or
voice commandeth it so. A positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in respect of God, absolutely
blasphemous; as far as it makes
him worke without the guidance
of his understanding, that is, like
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58869:91"/>
the lowest order of creatures, as
stockes and stones &amp;c. It is againe
afflictive and vexatious to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde;
taking away that sweetnesse
of obeying, which consists in the
perswasion that because creatures are
the participation of Gods owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
every one in its degree and
mankind in the first and highest
place, therefore all Gods command
and governement, are most conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their good, as it were salves
to their sores, and allurements to the
bringing them to their final end and
perfection.</p>
               <p>But, that which is more to our
purpose is, that, upon this
blasphemy against God, they
build the greatest inconvenience
that, peradventure, is to bee found
in man's nature; to wit, That God
gives to all in Power the likeness
and participation of this irrationall
Dominion which they conceive in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58869:92"/>
him; and that truly there is in Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours
a kinde of dote or free gift of
Mastery derived from God, in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
whereof hee is Master of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours
and what belongs to them,
either wholly or in a certaine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
according to the extent of the
power given; that, lawfully and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly,
he may dispose of all or a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
part of the things under his
charge, meerly because such is his will
and pleasure, &amp; that the subject ought
to be content to let him doe his will,
upon this score, Because it is Gods
will that this mans will should be
fulfilled. Which doctrine, though
it bee manifestly against Christs
directions left to his disciples, and
the practice of all good men; yet,
because this Treatise doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to Divinity, I will onely
insist upon its naturall inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences.</p>
               <p>As first, that it is not connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58869:92"/>
to Mankinde: which, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for its better part, in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
is not governed confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably
to its disposition, unlesse it
be so guided that the understanding
be principall and satisfied in it selfe
and leader to the will and action;
which course of proceeding when
it is observed, then is a man truely
a man and his action goes on with
sweetnesse, as is before declared.
Againe, it maketh the Governour
proud, insolent, and carelesse. Proud,
because hee taketh himselfe to bee
of another orbe then his Subjects;
that they are all slaves and beasts,
himselfe onely Master, himselfe
onely intelligent and a man. Info<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
because fully perswaded, by
this doctrine, that he can doe them
no wrong; that they are bound to
suffer what he layes on them; that
his pleasure is and must be their
content and rule. Carelesse, because
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58869:93"/>
he thinks he hath no account to
make, either to God or Man: not
to God, since he hath submitted the
people to his will and disposition;
and therefore he being incapable of
doing them any wrong, cannot bee
charged with any crime: Much
lesse is he sollicitous to content his
Subjects, in whom he taketh it for
an insolency to repine at any thing,
and esteemes it their duty to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
all he does, and to have his
authority for their rule to judge all
things by.</p>
               <p>On the other side, the Subject be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
base, restive, ambitious. For,
the worth and dignity of man,
which is his Liberty or guidance of
himselfe, being taken away, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
he must be servile and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
a slave, a body without soule
and understanding. The more
worldly and rustick part must, of
necessity, grumble and feele it harsh
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58869:93"/>
to see their labours disposed on
to people, of whom they have opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that they are idle, vicious, and
unworthy: and therefore, desire
liberty from such a yoke, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
masters of their owne goods
and labours; and are easily susce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible
of propositions tending to
that purpose, when they come from
faire tongues. Lastly, the higher
Spirits have Governement in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and take it for the onely
happinesse; and therefore have their
hearts wholly bent, how, by flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
by cunning, by force, to arrive
to this power to depose him that is
in possession, and sit downe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in his seat of glory. If their
hopes mount not so high, for the
impossibility of the fact and the
remotenesse of their quality; then
their aime is, by adulation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances,
to come neere the highest,
to bee participant of his authority,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58869:94"/>
and have the like power to rob
and oppresse, which they esteeme
vertuous and glorious in him, and
not unjust but fitting in themselves,
as farre as they can doe it by the
participation of that dote which God
hath bestowed upon the highest
Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Lastly, we must looke into the
lame proceeding of the common
good and publicke actions of such a
Governement; where the Subject,
by the consequence of this doctrine,
is set eagerly upon his owne inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
thinkes all lost that is done
for his, not Governour or Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
but Lord and Master, and
therefore alienated from him.
Whence, it must come to passe that,
what he can cousen, what hee can
excuse, what hee can delay, hee is
still forward to; and, by a secret
instinct of nature which abhorreth
such a Governement, thinketh it well
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58869:94"/>
done, though he cannot give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to justifie his action. In a
word, who sees not this Common-wealth
to be a Kingdome divided
in it selfe alwayes in affection, and
very neere in outward action;
wanting thereunto nothing but an
occasion, and some head to manage
the sedition? who sees not that the
whole Governement is violent; and
so may indeed continue whilst actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
force hangeth over it, but hath
not the possibility of a naturall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and length.</p>

he exceedeth his power, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58869:95"/>
is more absurd, then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
that Lawyers should plead
cases betweene the Soveraigne Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
and the Subject, where the
common good and Governement is
interessed: For, there, things are not
to be carried by the Dictates of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian</hi>

of <hi>Caesar</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours,
but either by the Science of
Politicks, or the certitude of Faith
and Tradition; which are the onely
two rules a high Governour hath.
If the Divine findeth any thing
contrary to the knowne Law of
God, he may speake: If the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher
finde any thing against the
Nature of Man, his mouth is not
to bee stopped: The Lawyer, what
can he say? It is against the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
heretofore made by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement
of the Countrey? The
Governour may reply, Yes; but
what you say is against the present
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:58869:96"/>
good of the Countrey, with which
I am entrusted. Is the Countrey
made for the Lawes, or the Lawes
for the Countrey? The Lawes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must give place, where the good
of the People is against the former
Resolutions. If any Law be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the Authority which made it,
or by another equal; is it the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
part to plead what was Law
before, or what is now? when a
supreme Governour speaketh as
such, as declaring what the present
necessity requires; if any former
Law bee against it, it is by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
annulled; it was Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but it is not now. But the
Lawyer will reply, There is no
Law in the Land which giveth such
authority: It is easily answered;
it is not a case for which a Law
is to bee made. See the Romane
Governement: when there came an
exigence of desperation, all their
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:58869:96"/>
Magistrates, all their formes cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
a Dictatour was made, whose
word was Law, nor could any man
appeale to Law. Such is the Case
when the high Governour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
against the Law: for hee
ought not to doe it, but when the
Law standeth not with the good
and safety of the Subject; and when
hee doth, Law is not to be pleaded
against him.</p>
               <p>Againe can any Law be enacted
of what shall bee done in case of
a conversion of the Governement?
It is clearely a folly to pretend it.
The ordering of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
is, then, in new hands:
The former's power is expired: and
to prescribe rules to them who will
assuredly be their owne Judges, is
a piece of great simplicity. The
Lawyer may peradventure reply,
There is no power in the Land to
repeale the former Lawes or to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58869:97"/>
them. I thinke hee will bee
wiser; yet, if hee doth say it, I
aske him, Who made the former
Lawes? was it not the People, by
themselves or their deputies? and
which is the stronger, if they make
them by their deputies, or by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?
Certainely, it will be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
By themselves; for the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
have no power but what they
impart to them. Is it then possible
to put a Case, in which there is
no power in a Countrey to repeale
Lawes? Evidently, who sayes so
must say there is no People in the
Countrey? For, if there be People,
there is in them a power to dispose
of themselves, more strong then in
Deputies.</p>
               <p>But the Lawyer may say, the
People cannot speake their mindes
freely. I answer, certainely, they
not onely can, but cannot choose
but speake their mindes, in the case
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:58869:97"/>
we put. Who knoweth not that
Liberty and speaking of ones minde
belo<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>geth to all circumstances a
man can be put in? The Merchant
that, in a Tempest, throweth the
precious fruits of his venture and
labour into the Sea, doth not he doe
it freely and willingly? The <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
of late made a peace with
the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> wee, both with the
<hi>Hollander</hi> and the <hi>Dane,</hi> and are
pretending to others: In any of
these, were all parts pleased? Did
no party agree to somewhat which
hee would not have done, but in
consideration of his present circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances?
Or, was there ever peace
made after a warre, but one part
grudged at somewhat? must none
of these be accounted freely done?
must none of these promises binde,
and be kept, upon Honour and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity?
This is to destroy all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
of mankinde; nay, not to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58869:98"/>
allow man so much wit as to know
what is fit for him to doe in time of
necessity. If then the People speake,
in one circumstance, something that
they would not in another; it is
not to be said they speake not their
mindes, but that, according to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
they alter their mindes,
as all wife men doe. They agree
and submit to the present conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
not because they are not
free, now as before, but because cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
are changed, and now
render it fitting. But, I said that,
in the case I put, they could not
choose but speake. My case was,
that Then a Governour is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
when the People casting off
the care and thoughts of innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
fall to their trades and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures:
Can it be deny'd that by
so doing they acquiesce to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Governement? which if they
doe, can it be questioned whether
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58869:98"/>
they consent or not to the repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of all such Lawes as cannot
stand with the present Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Such Lawes therefore are
repealed, not by deputies, but by
the Deputants and Masters of the
Deputies. The Lawyer, therefore,
must either proclaime the present
Governement none, or not plead
Law against it: for it is pure folly
to admit both, that is, faire and full
contradiction. In a new Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
all Lawes prejudiciall to it
are annulled, by the pure admission
of it: Other <hi>indifferent</hi> Lawes so
goe on, as to bee subject to its
judgement, whether and how farre
to stand; but a wise Governour will
continue them as farre as hee can
with prudence, because innovation
is contrary to the sweetnesse which
is in custome, as in a kinde of
nature.</p>

               <head>The Conclusion.</head>
               <p>BEE this then so resolved, That
God himselfe hath no irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and dead title of Lordship
over his Creatures, but onely his
all-right-setled Understanding, and
irresistible Omnipotency. And,
as hee hath none in himselfe, so
likewise not given any to those hee
hath put in Authority; but, that
their power is either in the submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Subject by promise and
agreement, or in the rationall dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the Magistrate, which
maketh him work what is confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to humane nature; and the
obedience or obligation to obey in
the Subject is out of this, That hee
hath entrusted the Magistrate with
the Governement, and is, by that,
to suppose he doth regularly what
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:58869:99"/>
is best (all things considered) for the
common good.</p>
               <p>That, by consequence, the title of
the Magistrate begins and dies with
the good of the Common-wealth;
and holdeth purely so long as it is
good for the people. That, no
Lawes made by the power or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of men, can judge betwixt
Subject and Soveraigne, in dispute
of the common good and Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but onely the Tribunalls of
God and Nature, or Divinity and
the science of Politicks: And
therefore, the maximes of Law have
no force in these questions; Now,
if Princes lose their pretences by the
force of Nature, it is ridiculous for
private men to build hopes, upon
rotten titles of ages long passed,
upon weake maximes of Law, after
Nature, by her revolutions, hath
cast all Law and mortall acts and
agreements.</p>
               <p>

And so is finished this small
Treatise, to the profit of them who
are able and willing to make use of
it. Some, by the method I have
used, something new in morall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
may imagine the Doctrine
I deliver, to bee more subtle in
explication then solid in practice:
But, let them either looke into the
Causes of Governements, or the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
they will see nature and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
both conspire to give testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to the truth. The cause of all
morall effects, if morally carried,
are the end and intention for which
they are sought and endeavoured
after; This is manifest to bee the
well-being of particulars under a
Governement. The practises, which
are the Effects, will shew, That
Governements breake when it is not
well with the Subjects, but they are
oppressed by the Governour; That
wise and good Governours are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58869:100"/>
sometimes to breake disordered
rules which hinder their free admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration;
That people, as it were,
forced by naturall changes, violate
the promises made to their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
cast them off when they think
them pernicious, and proceed against
them, <hi>per viam facti,</hi> as they speake
in the Schooles, not by Lawes,
which cannot bee made for such
matters. These are, in a manner,
the whole subject of the precedent
Discourse.</p>
