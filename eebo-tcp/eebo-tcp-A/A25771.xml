         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>2 Tim. iv. 5. latter part of the Verse.</bibl>
               <q>Make full proof of thy Ministry.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THese words are the summing up of
all those advices in general terms
which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had more distinctly
given before in this and the former
Epistle to <hi>Timothy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These particulars, as we find them in both,
will most sutably become the matter of this
days discourse. And I hope tho both the Text
and this Assembly would fairly allow us to
shew, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was a Diocesan Bishop, yet
it will not be reckon'd necessary, since the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of St. <hi>Ignatius's</hi> Epistles hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all just exception fully vindicated; and
that other the ancientest Records of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affairs
do prove Bishop and Priest to be not
meerly two Degrees, but likewise two Ranks
of Clergy-men, distinguish'd by different Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and Powers, as appears amongst seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Writings from the Apostolick Canons, which
I take the freedom to urge by this Name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56484:3"/>
they were called so before the first Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council of the Church, and are refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to by it, and have expresly this Title gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by that of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which was one of the
four principal Councils. But to return to the
propounded work, the Advices given to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi>
which concern all who are plac'd in
the Ministry, may be brought under these four
heads:
<list>
                  <item>1. To keep out of our Religion whatever
is new.</item>
                  <item>2. To improve in Divine knowledg.</item>
                  <item>3. To be diligent in all Offices of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Ministry.</item>
                  <item>4. To have a Conversation sutable to their
Office.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. To keep out of our Religion whatever
is new.</p>
            <p>Our Religion is the eternal Gospel of Jesus
Christ; therefore sutable both to Christ, and
to every other Eternal; it should be the same
yesterday, to day, and for ever. It being at
once, and at first perfect, any alteration or
addition would utterly spoil it. Hence is it
that St. <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3, to
charge some that they teach no other Doctrine,
and <hi>ch.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 6, that he should put the Brethren
in remembrance like a good Minister of Jesus
Christ, of the words of Faith and good Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
and <hi>ch.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 3, that he should so teach
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56484:3"/>
and exhort, that if it might be, not any man
might reach otherwise, but consent to whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
words; more directions of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
you may read in this second Epistle, as
<hi>ch.</hi> 1. 13. of <hi>holding fast the form of sound
words;</hi> of <hi>committing the Apostles Doctrine to
faithful Teachers of others, ch.</hi> 2. 2. the like
charge is given to <hi>Titus, ch.</hi> 2. 1. and 7. and
so before, <hi>ch.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
            <p>Now being new things made part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
do plainly destroy the rest of it, let us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
awhile whence such innovations arise,
and how they betray themselves, and how
they are most popularly carried on; they
rise from the same Original whence wars come,
from the lusts within men, from vain-glory
very oft, and from an ambitious desire of
drawing Disciples after them, so the old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
Law defines at once a Heretick and a
Schismatick to be such, who for the sake of
vain-glory either makes or follows false opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
Such the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> were men vainly
puft up in their fleshly minds, professing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be wise; such an one <hi>Novatus</hi> was,
as <hi>Cornelius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> gives an account
of him to <hi>Fabius</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Euseb.</hi> hist. l. 6. cap. 43.</note> 
               <hi>That he was
lifted up with arrogance, and that his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and longing for a Bishoprick was the
cause of his separation.</hi> The Heresie of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi>
as we learn from <hi>Tertullian</hi>
sprang from another as bad ground,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Tertul.</hi> de praescript. <hi>Epiphan.</hi> li. haeres. 42.</note> and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius,</hi> to wit, from revenge, because the <hi>Roman</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56484:4"/>
Church was then more strict and modest, and
judg'd it unlawful to receive him into its
Communion, who had been excommunicated
by his own Father, a Bishop in <hi>Pontus,</hi> for
foul conversation with a woman of that City.
Sometimes Divinity-inventions are studied out
of covetousness, so <hi>Simon</hi> thought to buy
the gift of Healing, that he might be a good
gainer by his practice. And as to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations
are much more modern than any
I have yet nam'd, if we survey the main dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
'twixt them and us, and compute the
large revenues thence arising to their Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
we should think, if their opinions had
been old enough, that they came rather from
this <hi>Simon</hi> than from St. <hi>Peter.</hi> If it were
not tedious to you to hear what already you
fully know, it would be easie to shew a like
beginning of all new whims and fashions of
deceivers; for though it were uncharitable to
question, but that some may follow a Heresie or
Schism, as some follow'd <hi>Absoloms</hi> rebellion,
in their simplicity, and knew not any thing;
yet it would be charity mistaken to believe,
that this simplicity and ignorance could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
out a Leader, that sets up his Banner in
defiance of the Church; no certainly, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
some endowments, like those of a fal'n
Angel fighting against Heaven, a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and an ill purpose.</p>
            <p>Such men do usually betray themselves, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56484:4"/>
shew that they are setting up a new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
when they quarrel with the words
us'd by the Church; so the <hi>Arrians,</hi> when
they were suspected, alledg'd that they were
only offended with the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, fearing
lest it favoured <hi>Sabellius,</hi> who taught that there
was but one Person and three Manifestations
in the Godhead; and the <hi>Socinians,</hi> when
they first fram'd into a body like a Church,
pretended they did not find fault with the
Doctrine concerning Christ and the Holy Ghost,
but only with the barbarous School-term <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi>
but for all their simpering, both these
enemies of God appear'd afterwards bare-fac'd
in their own colours; the like may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
in those who design an alteration in
Discipline, as these other did in Doctrine.
If you knew not the men, and their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
you would take them to be harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and tender, but history and experience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
us, by what has been, that they are not
like other dealers, for that they will have
more than they ask. Another way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
men discover an inclination to something
foreign to the Church of which they appear
Members, is, when they would compound with
the Church, that which were all along Articles
of Religion, should now be only Articles of
Peace; and what was look'd upon formerly
to be believ'd, should be only not publickly
opposed; but this project has too many mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
surely ever to obtain success; it would
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56484:5"/>
cast a mighty Reproach upon our first Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
and it would make us one, just as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim
made the dissenting <hi>Germans,</hi> not in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but as then it was fitly call'd, an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion.
And further, seeing our Doctrines
are plainly contain'd in our Devotions, it would
make these men, who are both for Dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Peace, the very worst of Hypocrites.</p>
            <p>Having now given you some account of the
original and tokens of Innovation, it remains
we consider the fairest Pleas on whose credit
the man excepts against what is well establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
these are chiefly two:
<list>
                  <item>1. That what has hitherto been receiv'd in
the Church, is contrary to the Rules of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Or,</item>
                  <item>2. Contrary to the enlight'ning of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. Contrary to the Rules of Reason. It was
indeed never denied of reason, by those who
might be suppos'd to have some share of it,
that it was very serviceable about Religion,
and it is yeilded among us, that it could never
find so creditable employment as in defending
that of Christians; but there is a wide diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt Instrument and Contriver, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Service and Authority. Reason was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
useful in discovering the honesty and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the first Publishers of the Christian
Doctrine; but then it has no right to take the
Doctrines asunder, and to make an exact search
whether these agree to those apprehensions of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56484:5"/>
things which flow from the alone light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and to order that as the Doctrines shall
approve themselves upon this trial, suitably
their success shall be either to be entertain'd
or rejected; no, certainly the Laws of God
do not so doubtfully depend upon the sentence
of our faculties, nor is the Scripture a fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
only that may probably be receiv'd, if
we approve the matter of it. All the power
of debate, and that is fully enough, which
God gives to our reason, antecedent to our
belief, is this, to examine the miracles wrought
in confirmation of our faith, and so to consider
whether these, and consequently the Gospel
which accompanies 'em, can proceed from any
one but the most High God; and after this hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is over, reason changes its person, it lays
down all its Ensigns of Jurisdiction, descends
from its Judgment-seat, and does homage to
this Vicegerent come from Heaven, professing
an entire obedience to its Authority; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
if it be found that some of these
Laws so Divinely authorized, shall appear ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of two meanings, or of none that is
plain to us, reason is not to take this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
for an excuse to restore it self to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
power, but it must go to consult with
those who convers'd familiarly face to face with
the Publishers of this Law. or with their near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Successors, to know what interpretation
they receiv'd of this dark saying, or what Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
were deliver'd them nearest the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56484:6"/>
meaning of this place, and so it believes
according to their true report. This is in a
manner the whole process of the Knowledg
and of the Faith of Christianity; and he who
will attribute to reason an employment higher
than this, must be requested to tell us, how by
reason he arrived at the belief of the Trinity,
and of other mysteries of the Christian Faith.
If he say, that he has as distinct a conception
of these, as of any self-evident proposition,
we congratulate his early attainments and his
being already wrapt up into Heaven; but if
his free answer prove, as we may well suspect,
quite contrary, that for his part he does not at
all believe these things, because he cannot clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understand 'em, and that Christian Religion
has nothing in it, but what is plain and easie
to conceive, it will be expected in the next
place he shew, after these incomprehensible
propositions are laid aside, what so difficult
truths there are in our Religion, more than were
in the world before; that it should be worthy
of God to make a man on purpose, in such a
wonderful manner to preach them, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
to him his own power to do those
mighty works, that men might believe on this
score that which mankind believ'd long afore
by the light of Nature. Thus, as the argument
deriv'd from divine Revelation, and the strange
attendants of it, proves that more was requir'd
to be believ'd than reason could suggest; so we
shall find, if we look into Scripture, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56484:6"/>
to contain more than human reason, even
after the revelation given, can fully conceive.</p>
            <p>2. Some plead in behalf of their novelties,
that they proceed from the enlight'ning of
the Spirit. They apply hither those promises
of the Old Testament made concerning the
latter days, whereas those latter days are by
St. <hi>Peter</hi> understood of the days of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
preaching, and so they were applied by
the primitive Church in opposition to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm
of <hi>Montanus</hi> and his fellows. We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
sufficient aids of the Spirit of Grace
in the use of means, but we say it does not
give this knowledg by inspiration in our days;
this extraordinary grant being formerly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with the gift of strange tongues,
and with that of working of Miracles, these
two, or the like, being necessary to go along
with that Spirit which distinguishes the Divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inspired from the pretending Impostor.</p>
            <p>Having said thus much concerning Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
let me further disswade you from them,
consider that what is of the greatest standing
and continuance is truth it self; truth is that
which is eternal in God, and among men it is
the off-spring of Divine perfection; whereas
error is modern and an upstart; thus was it
with the Idolatry of the <hi>Iews,</hi> they serv'd
new Gods, newly come up. In the stile of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the Ancient People signifies the same
with the true Church;<note place="margin">Deut. 2. 19</note> and the good way and
the old way are one and the same. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56484:7"/>
makes this the best trial of Doctrine,
whether it be true or no, by seeing whether
it was so from the beginning. The <hi>Iews</hi> are
directed in matters of Religion, to consider the
years of many Generations: <hi>ask thy Fathers
and they will tell thee, thy Elders and they
will shew thee;</hi> the whole Church in all ages
is but one Flock, and we that come after,
must as <hi>Solomon</hi> bids, observe the steps of the
old Flock. The first Christian Church is that
Pillar of truth on which Divine Laws were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd,
that they might be made publick; whom
may we then with better success follow than
those whose bright knowledge of what they
raught was not sullied with lusts, nor swol'n
with arrogance, nor envenomed with malice?
How can we suspect their evidence, who knew
God's will by doing it. and who rather chose
to dye than betray their Faith given to God,
or the Faith delivered to them, Blessed Saints!</p>
            <p>The second Advice of St. <hi>Paul</hi> is to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
in knowledg.</p>
            <p>He would not that they who are Teachers
should not understand what they say, <hi>Eph.</hi>
l. 7. Nor would he a Teacher should only
begin to understand, so <hi>ch.</hi> 3. Not a Novice,
lest he be filled with pride. But instead hereof,
one who hath well studied his work, 1 <hi>Ep.
ch.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Study to shew thy self approved to
God, a workman that needeth not to be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
rightly dividing the word of truth.</hi> Of
all knowledg most principally the knowledg
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56484:7"/>
of Scripture is required; this <hi>Timothy</hi> had
from a Child, which at this day many who
profess themselves great Divines do scarce at
all regard. So the History of the Council of
<hi>Trent</hi> tells us of the <hi>Italian</hi> Prelates, that they
were good School-Divines, but understood lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of Scripture. We should as the <hi>Rarraei</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Iews,</hi> cleave only to the Doctrines
of Scripture, and exercise our selves herein
continually, over and over again. So the <hi>Iews,</hi>
to intimate so much upon the eight day of the
Feast of Tabernacles, read at the same time
the last Section of the Law, and with it the
beginning of the first. We should be unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this frequent reading, as it is reported of
one who when he had read a Book of <hi>Aristotle</hi>
forty times over, wrote upon it, I will read it
again; by doing thus we shall daily grow in
knowledg. For such is the excellency of every
Word of God, and such is the narrowness of
our understandings at that end where we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
knowledg, that though our Souls are
made capable of much knowledg, yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
receive much at once. What has been said
of improving in Scripture-knowledg, concerns
all men as well as Ministers, seeing the reasons
given in Scripture why it should be search'd,
reaches all; but there is a modesty to be us'd,
as sensible they are more likely to be mistaken
now and then about its meaning, than those
whose whole study and business it is to make
it be understood. But all have an undoubted
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56484:8"/>
right to the use of Scripture. <hi>Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Stromat. l. 7.</note> advises all Christians, to <hi>grow old in
reading these Books,</hi> and adds, that <hi>as under
the Law those Beasts which chew'd the cud,
and had parted hoofs were acceptable to God;
so is the Christian who ruminates upon the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of God day and night, whence in his
going by Faith to the Father and the Son, he
receives that steadiness of gate which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from parted hoofs,</hi> thus far he. Many
more passages of the like nature are met with
among the Fathers, which we must now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear.
But as for those who are separated to
the work of the Ministry, more is required
than reading Scripture and Divinity in <hi>English,</hi>
the knowledg of Tongues, and of the true state
of the primitive Church; this must be had
from an entire reading of the ancient Records
of the Church, that we may not be deceived
with false representations under that perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
title; and human Learning must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
into the service of Christian knowledg,
many parts of it are of necessary use, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all give a good advantage to our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses;
these secular disciplines were recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by several, but most fully by <hi>Clemens
Alexandrinus</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Stromat. 6.</note>, his Scholar in <hi>Origen <note n="*" place="margin">3 Tom. in <hi>Genes.</hi>
                  </note>,</hi> and are
to good purpose used by most of them. These
accomplishments are helpful in the two great
works of our Ministry, to wit, instructing the
ignorant, and convincing gain-sayers, which
comes under the next advice of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which
is,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56484:8"/>
Thirdly, A Diligence in Ministerial duties.
Our duty has three main parts, Teaching,
Praying, and Watching over the People.</p>
            <p>These being undoubtedly necessary, we need
not enquire which is of the greatest dignity.
As to Teaching, St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires one <hi>apt to
teach,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 24. and that he be <hi>instant in
preaching the word,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. he must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
with much plainness, and not make the
Gospel to return to the likeness of the Law,
with a veil and thick darkness about it; he
must exhort with all heartiness, by the fittest
true arguments of perswasion; he must both
boldly and meekly reprove sin, not sparing the
fault, but still manifesting he has no quarrel
with the person. In short, in all the instances
of <hi>teaching</hi> there must appear what St. <hi>Paul</hi>
requires from <hi>Titus, ch.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>uncorruptness,
gravity, sincerity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The second part of duty is Prayer. Thus
the Ministers of the Lord are to cry, <hi>Spare
thy people, O Lord.</hi> This work at this time,
when Knowledg is more plentifully found than
Living well, is of the more general usefulness;
and as the profession of the same Articles of
Faith in the very same express terms, is a mark
of Communion among the distinct Assemblies
of the Church, so praying unto God in the
same words, in our several Congregations, shews
that we are not independent, but members one
of another. Such were the primitive Prayers
<hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> speaks of,<note place="margin">2. Apolog.</note> their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56484:9"/>
               <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> of their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
their <hi>appointed Prayers;</hi> and we
have greater examples, of <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi>
and of our Saviour, teaching the Disciples to
pray in set words. As the publick prayers of
the first Christians had appointed words, so
likewise they had Times and Places appointed.
Of both these St. <hi>Clemens,</hi> the fellow-labourer
of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> speaks,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Ep. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</note> telling us, that <hi>our Lord
would not have holy Offices performed rashly,
nor disorderly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Hist. l. 10. c. 3.</note> 
               <hi>but in determinate places and
hours, where and by whom he would have
these done, he hath appointed by his Sovereign
will.</hi> Several others of them speak to the same
purpose; and <hi>Eusebius</hi> acquaints us, that these
Houses of Prayer were consecrated. Which I
the rather mention, to remedy the mistake of
those who count it Popish, when-as indeed it
was done in the purest Ages of Christianity.
So much for the place; as for the Hours they
were thrice a day, and the day of the most
publick Assembly was that which we right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call the Lords day; of this St. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi>
the Companion of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> speaks <note n="*" place="margin">Ep. Catholic.</note>,
<hi>we keep</hi> (saith he) <hi>with gladness of mind that
day on which Iesus both rose from the dead,
and appeared, and ascended into Heaven.</hi> What
has been said of Prayers, why they should be
the same, holds as strongly for the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sacraments in the same words and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
for these, besides the benefits by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from God, are tokens of an agreement
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56484:9"/>
among our selves; for as right Baptism at large
is a fixing the person in the Catholick Church,
so in order to his being joined more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to a branch of the Catholick Church, the
same form of Baptism which this particular
one uses, is required. The like is to be said
of the Lords Supper, it is not only a sign of
our Communion with Christ, but of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the whole true Church upon
Earth, where the necessaries of administration
are observ'd; and when we practise in this the
same allowable differences, we manifest as by
the necessaries that we are of the universal, so
by these allowable differences that we are more
immediately of this or that particular Church,
and that (in the phrase of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>) <hi>we being
many are one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third instance of diligence is a subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
watching over the People. I call it a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
watching, because watching implies
a care joyn'd with authority, and neither of
them originally in the Presbyter, but the care
assign'd, and the authority permitted by the
superior order. The primitive Church call'd
Presbyters, which in our <hi>English</hi> abridgment
of the word is Priests,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> 
               <hi>the sacred Officers of
the second Throne.</hi> These St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> tells us<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Euseb.</hi> hist. l. 10. c. 5.</note>,
might do nothing without the Bishop; but on
the other hand, it needs not now move any
doubt what St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> writes<note n="*" place="margin">Ignat. Ep. ad trall.</note>, that he did
nothing without his Presbyters. No more do
our Bishops, when they only execute those Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56484:10"/>
made by our Provincial Councils, of which
the Presbyters are a part. The care over the
people is exercised in private and personal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving,
comforting, instructing, reconciling,
and the rest as they become necessary; and
since the ill times make it highly so, in warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to beware of separation from the
Church; of this the Apostles and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
took the greatest care that the people
should not severally entertain opposite Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
nor forget the assembling of themselves
together, and they reckon'd to them Schism e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to the most scandalous and destructive
sins. To this matter St. <hi>Barnabas</hi> speaks thus <note n="*" place="margin">Epist. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thol.</note>,
<hi>ye ought not to draw your selves apart, as if
ye were justified, for the Scripture saith</hi> (quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiog
Isa. 5. 22.) <hi>wo unto them that are wise
in their own eyes, and prudent in their own
sight.</hi> The same disswasive is the main design
of St. <hi>Clemens's</hi> Epistles, and of almost all of
St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> but most largely the empty pleas
for separation are confuted by St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">l. 3 Epist. 3.</note>.
and the aggravation and future punishment
thereof is display'd by St. <hi>Iraeneus</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">l. 4. c. 62.</note>. We must
likewise warn an indifferent sort of people, that
come both to our publick Assemblies and to
those set up through a dislike taken causlesly
against our Church; it is no light matter left
at discretion to joyn either to one or other;
we never find that the right Christians went to
the Assemblies of the <hi>Montanists,</hi> though <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullion,</hi>
who too well knew them, vouches
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56484:10"/>
that they were orthodox in Doctrine <note n="*" place="margin">Non ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam fidei aut spei re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulum ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunt <hi>Tertul.</hi> advers. <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicos.</hi>
               </note>, only
differing in some points of Discipline. We can
no more belong both to the Church and adverse
Meeting, than we can serve two Masters; to
this purpose there is an old Canon <note n="*" place="margin">Canon Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol. 63. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</note> that by
the sixth General Council is reckon'd Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <note n="*" place="margin">Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinopels 4. Can. 2.</note>, 
that he that prays with them in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles
set up against the Church, shall be
deprived of the Churches Communion.</p>
            <p>The fourth and last advice of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> is
to have a conversation sutable to the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Office. We must have a conversation which
becomes the Gospel which we preach. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
requires, that we follow after righteousness,
godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
6. 11. and the like advice, 2 <hi>Ep.</hi> 2. 22. and to
<hi>Titus,</hi> 2. 7. that in all things he shew himself
a pattern of good works; when he says a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,
he means not any thing in our conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wherein no one is bound to imitate us, but
in every Moral duty, as belonging to all men, a
Minister is bound to be first, and most remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
As we are to be patterns to others, so we
must take those that have gone before for ours.
It was said by our Saviour of the <hi>Baptist,</hi> that
he was a <hi>burning and a shining light;</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
gloss should teach us, he burn'd in his
zeal, and shin'd in his example; it is not only
he that Teaches, but who likewise does that
shall be call'd Great in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
It is a commendation given of <hi>Origen,</hi>
that his doctrine and his manners did agree;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56484:11"/>
and of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> that he never gave in charge
to his Scholars any thing which he had not first
practis'd upon himself. It is certain that all men
are drawn more readily by examples than by
fine sayings; and are like Soldiers, who more
chearfully follow their Commander than his
bare Commands. A good life makes a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
not only better heard, but to understand
better; if any man will do the will of God,
he shall know of his doctrine, for <hi>the secrets
of the Lord are with those that fear him;</hi> and
the <hi>Schechinah</hi> (say the <hi>Iews</hi>) was not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
but to the best of men. Real goodness
gives a sense and tast upon our minds of what
we recommend to others; and the good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
we give, being wrought and pointed in our
Hearts, pierces further into our Hearers. By
our living soberly, righteously, and godlily,
men will be assured that when we perswade
them to the same duties we are in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
and that we do not meerly preach these
things, as customary and expected, or as pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
clean speculation, but as our and their Duty,
as a practical truth, and as such which is not
only requir'd but possible; by this means we
shall gain both an esteem and success to our
Ministry, when our actions do not shame our
speech, when our Hearers cannot whisper, why
Does he not what he Says? To conclude now
with the exhortation of St. <hi>Peter</hi> applied to
our purpose, <hi>Let us have our conversation
honest amongst men, that when they speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56484:11"/>
us as evil doers, they may by our good
works, which they shall behold, glorifie God.</hi>
To whom, the Father, Son, and the Holy
Ghost, three Persons, and one God, be all
Honour given for ever more.</p>
