            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I being bound
to ſome of you in the bonds of affinity,
to all in affection but above all in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
I cannot but hold it my duty to
proffer you the beſt of my endeavours, and for want of
any thing worthy, I doe here perſent you my good will.
I preſume not upon your Patronage, but only beg your
acceptance; conſidering that if theſe my endeavours
be worth the accepting, they ſhall need the leſſe aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
But if any thing here brought forth be defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
it is ſure moſt fit that he which begot it ſhould fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it.</p>
            <p>The world, peradventure, may wonder that I draw
ſo large a circle, and then turn it to a cypher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to ſtamp ſo many worthy Names in the front of
this my unworthy worke, and then ſpeake nothing of
the worth of your worthy perſons in particular:
<pb facs="tcp:45447:3"/>
But let the world know that it is not for want of worth
in your ſelves that I forbear the ſame for I doe ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
acknowledge I may juſtly draw your vertues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
as large a Volume, as any other who have beene
moſt copious in that kinde. But I, for my part, do hold
it a labour little uſefull to paint over that to make it
paſſe for currant, which doth ſhine moſt perfect in its
owne colour. Beſides, I am reſolved your modeſt eares
would be rather offended, then fed, with the ſound of
your own prayſes though unfained.</p>
            <p>But the chiefeſt aime of my deſires herein is to doe
you ſome ſervice; not flatter for aſsiſtance. Therefore,
if upon peruſall hereof (if your more ſerious imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
will admit the ſame) you ſhall reap any benefit,
or at leaſt content, I ſhall, in this kind be ſufficiently ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.
Only I deſire that upon your judicious view here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
you would vouchſafe a favourable cenſure; of which
I am the more confident, becauſe I know you cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
any thing poliſhed from a hand ſo uninſtructed.
But not to be too full in a Preface, to too empty a Sequell,
I implore your pardon, and deſire to be imploy'd, your
Servant in all humility.</p>

               <l>Only the heat doth from the fire proceed,</l>
               <l>Even ſo from faith do other graces breed.</l>
               <l>Faith then is mother of each other grace,</l>

               <l>Our higheſt vertues are but morall parts.</l>

And make the working luſter of it bright,</l>

               <l>ALL holy duties then we muſt frequent,</l>
               <l>Faith, to our knowledge hath no other vent,</l>

               <l>Is but like empty ſhadowes of the ſun,</l>
               <l>Empty indeed, and when we come to try them</l>
               <l>They prove like ſmoake, we finde no comfort by them.</l>
               <l>Then in good duties we muſt labour ſtill,</l>

               <l>Some ſweetneſſe, and ſome comfort in them finde,</l>
