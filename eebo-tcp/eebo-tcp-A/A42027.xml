         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OV have been a merciful Creditor in the trust of
these <hi>inestimable Poems,</hi> so long with me, a
person inconsiderable; But I beseech you think
I have been sensible of the great obligation,
and alwayes thought it a less trespass to break
with all the world, then by the least forgetfulness of my duty,
make an unhappy forfeit of my self to your displeasure.</p>
            <p>Sir, I have brought home your <hi>Principal,</hi> and though it
be a thing beneath your generous expectation, to look at profit, yet
I thought it became my justice to tender you a small <hi>interest,</hi>
the endevours of my poor Art, to wait upon it: I acknowledge
it a bold undertaking, to compose your Words (which are so
pure <hi>Harmonie</hi> in themselves) into any other <hi>Musick;</hi> But
it was not in my ambition, or hope to mend the least <hi>Accent</hi> or
<hi>Emphasis</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they received from your own <hi>numerous Soul,</hi>
but to essay, how neer, a whole life spent in the study of Musical
Compositions, could imitate the flowing and natural <hi>Graces,</hi>
which you have created by your fancie.</p>
            <p>I have onely to say, If my zeal have not stained what you
have excellently made, I will not despair of your pardon; and
if any thing herein (the wel-meant tender of my service) may
obtain your smile &amp; permission, I shalbe confirmed in my thoughts
that I may stil write my self</p>

Faith I had committed Rape upon these
Papers, which long ere this on their owne
Wings, had One by One, hover'd o're, and dropt into
your gen'rous Breasts for Patronage, and anticipated this
my present Service and Devotion. But I forbad all single
Flights, and by degrees caged each <hi>Linnet</hi> up, till she had
learn'd her Lesson, and I compleated the whole Consort,
full and intire; which as it is, together with the whole
<hi>Aviarie,</hi> I most humbly Sacrifice to your Mercy and
Delight. Fourscore and six, a Jolly pleasant Band! all
of one true <hi>Phoebean</hi> Strain, yet each distinctly taught
her sev'ral Grace, onely to Court your various Ear and
Fancie.</p>
            <p>My Lords and Gentlemen; I onely wish you the same
Kind, Genuine Joy in the Hearing of these <hi>Seraphick
Poems,</hi> as the most <hi>Noble Author</hi> had in the Writing,
the World in Reading, and my Self in the Composing of
them; and then I'm confident, <hi>Musick</hi> will have wrought
a greater Wonder, then to animate with Sense <hi>Plants</hi> and
<hi>Vegetables;</hi> that is, to surprize and take in Refined and
Abstracted Spirits, which is a holy Invasion upon Heaven.</p>
            <p>But I detain you too long in the Porch with these <hi>Lowd
