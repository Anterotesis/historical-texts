            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The LIFE of the Reverend
Anthony Horneck<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> D. D.</head>
            <p>THIS excellent Man was born<note n="*" place="margin">Anno 1641.</note>
at <hi>Baccharacht,</hi>
               <note n="â€ " place="margin">So call'ed, as some think, from <hi>Bacchi a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi> Vid. <hi>Misson</hi>'s Trav. Tom. 1. Lett.6.</note>, in the <hi>Lower Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate,</hi>
a Town from whence we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a Wine that from the place bears
the same Name amongst us. His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was <hi>Recorder</hi> or <hi>Secretary</hi> of that
place; a very strict Protestant, and a
Person of great Reputation. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
was also bred up in the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
from the beginning: He never
was of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as hath
been falsly reported of him. His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
devoted him for the holy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
from the womb, and was not
wanting to give him such an Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as might fit him for that Sacred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
He was first sent to <hi>Heidelbergh,</hi>
where he applied himself with great
diligence to the study of Divinity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the direction and care of the very
learned Dr. <hi>Spanheim,</hi> who is now the
primary Professor of the University of
<hi>Leyden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:108689:3"/>
He had, it appears, a great desire
to come over into <hi>England;</hi> I cannot
tell what it was that moved him: `tis
certain his Father inclined not to it.
However to <hi>England</hi> he came, not
without his Father's consent. He was
about 19 years of age when he first
came over. he was then very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
not onely for his Learning, but
for his great Piety also. He who
taught him the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, does
profess, that he never saw a young
man so exemplary for Piety as this
young man was.</p>
            <p>He was entred into <hi>Queen's College</hi>
in <hi>Oxford, Dec.</hi> 24. 1663. and was in
very great esteem there with Dr. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi>
then <hi>Provost</hi> of that House, and
since Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> who valued
him highly for his great Learning, and
more particularly for his good skill in
the Eastern Languages. He was, by
his favour, made Chaplain of the said
College soon after his Entrance. He
was incorporated Master of Arts from
the University of <hi>Wittembergh, Dec. 21.
1663.</hi> It was not long after this, that
he was made Vicar of <hi>Allhallows</hi> in
<hi>Oxford,</hi> which is in the gift of <hi>Lincoln
College.</hi>
There he continued a most
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108689:3"/>
constant and painfull Preacher about
two years.</p>
            <p>Thence he removed into the Family
of the Duke of <hi>Albemarle</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">An. 1665.</note>, and was
received there as a Tutor to his Son,
the then Lord <hi>Torrington,</hi> and since
Duke of <hi>Albemarle.</hi> He was now in a
fair way to Preferment, had he been
forward in seeking it. The Duke did
indeed bestow upon him a Living in
the Diocese of <hi>Exeter</hi>
               <note n="â€ " place="margin">The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of <hi>Doulton</hi> in <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</hi>
               </note>, and did also
procure him a Prebend in that Church
from Dr. <hi>Sparrow,</hi> then Lord Bishop
there. I shall have occasion afterward
to give an account of his parting with
them. I am now on that part of the
Doctors Life which I know the least
of; I doubt not but he did well every
where, and agreeably to his holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>
            <p>He did, before he married, go over
into <hi>Germany</hi>
               <note n="â€–" place="margin">An 1669.</note>, to see his Friends, where
he preached with great acceptation,
and was entertained with great respect
at the Court of one of the <hi>German</hi> Princes,<note n="*" place="margin">Charles Lodowick <hi>Elector</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine.</note>, who shewed him a very
particular kindness.</p>
            <p>After his Return he was chosen
Preacher at the <hi>Savoy</hi>
               <note n="â€ " place="margin">An 1671.</note>, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
about 26 years, till he died.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108689:4"/>
That place deserves not the name of a
Preferment: The maintenance is small,
and, upon the matter, precarious.
And whatever it was to him at his
first taking of it, when there were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of considerable quality inhabiting
there, who were very kind to him;
yet afterwards, when his Family in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
and his necessities were grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it could not be called a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
maintenance. But whatever it
was first or last, he could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to keep his Living in <hi>Devonshire</hi>
with it: nor could he ever be prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with afterwards (whatever offers
were made to him) to accept of any
Living to hold in conjunction with it.
He was irreconcileable to <hi>Pluralities,</hi>
and to <hi>Non-residence,</hi> and would upon
occasion declare his abhorrence of
them with some considerable warmth.</p>
            <p>He was of the opinion, in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
of <hi>Bernard Gilpin,</hi> the famous
Preacher and Saint of the North, of
whom the Bishop of <hi>Chichester,</hi> who
wrote his life, gives the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
<q>
                  <hi>Mr. Gilpin</hi> was about to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
beyond the Seas, and to study
there: He was at that time possessed
of a Living, a Cure of Souls; Bishop
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108689:4"/>
                  <hi>Tunstall</hi> perswades him to keep his
Living for his better support; Mr.
<hi>Gilpin</hi> refuseth so to doe, and resigns
it. He tells the Bishop, that <hi>he had
left his Parsonage upon necessity, because
be could not keep it in his hands with
any peace of Conscience.</hi>
               </q> And when
the Bishop offered him a Dispensation
to hold it, <hi>Mr. Gilpin</hi> replied, <q>
                  <hi>The
Devil will not be restrained with any
bonds of dispensation from labouring in
mine absence the destruction of my
people committed to my charge: And
I fear that when God shall call me to
account of my Stewardship, it will
not serve my turn to make answer, that
I was dispensed withall, whilst the
Devil made havock of my Flock.</hi>
               </q>
Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> was after this, and whilst
he continued beyond the Seas, pressed
to accept of a Living: But he tells the
Bishop, in his Letter to him, his mind
in these words: <q>
                  <hi>I am fully resolved,
so long as I live, never to burden my
Conscience in this case, nor to keep a
Living in my own charge with condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to live from it.</hi>
               </q> He adds after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<q>
                  <hi>Though any other should teach
and preach for me as constantly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously
as ever St.</hi> Augustin <hi>did,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108689:5"/>
yet cannot I think my self discharged
by another man's pains taking. But
if yet I should be perswaded thus to
offer violence to my Conscience, upon
condition to remain either here, or in
any other Vniversity, my disquiet of
Conscience would never permit me to
profit in my study.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He was a very great blessing to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and indeed to the
City. He constantly resided among
them, tho' he had no House belonging to
his Place. He hired an House, and was
constant in the discharge of the Duties
of his Place. He preached with great
vehemence and ardor, with mighty
force and conviction. He spake the
sense of his Soul, and entred into the
Hearts of his People. He soon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
his Auditors that he was in
great earnest, and that he had a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
sense of the worth of Souls, and of
the vast importance of those Truths
which he delivered to them.</p>
            <p>His Auditors were convinced that
he was a Man of God, and sent by
him for the good of Souls. He used
great freedom of Speech, and instead
of using <hi>enticing Words of human Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
he spake like his Master with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108689:5"/>
great Conviction and Authority.</p>
            <p>His Fame grew exceedingly, and
very many were his constant Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
some of the highest Rank and
Quality, and a very great number of
very devout and pious Persons. A
vast Crowd there was that followed
him, and such a collection of most
devout and conformable Persons as
were hardly to be found elsewhere;
it was no easie matter to get through
the Crowd to the Pulpit.</p>
            <p>He administred the Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
on the first Sunday of every
Month, and preached a Preparation-Sermon
on the Friday preceding. He
did it also on the great Festivals. He
administred it twice on a day, in the
Morning at eight a Clock, and at the
usual time after the Morning Sermon.
The number of the Communicants held
a great proportion to that of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
and their Devotion was very
exemplary. The number was so great
at both times, that it will hardly be
believed by those Clergymen who
have been confined to the Country,
and have seen the small number of
those who attend upon this holy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
So great was the number, that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108689:6"/>
there was need of great help of Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen
to assist in the delivering of
the Bread and Wine; and with such
assistance it was very late before the
Congregation could be dismissed. I
will add, that I do not remember that
I did ever behold so great numbers,
and so great signs of Devotion, and a
due sense and profound reverence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
this great act of divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
in my whole life. The Doctor
took indefatigable pains on these oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
but he was encouraged to do
so from the great success his Labours
met withal.</p>
            <p>He was not only very diligent in
Preaching and Administring the Holy
Sacrament, but in all other parts of
his Duty.</p>
            <p>He took great pains in Catechising
and instructing the Youth, in visiting
the sick, and directing and satisfying
the doubtfull and scrupulous, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
all good beginnings, and
promoting worthy designs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
those he conversed with to
love and good works.</p>
            <p>He took great pains also in his own
Family. He spent very much time
with his Family in constant Prayers
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108689:6"/>
Morning and Night, in Reading the
Holy Scriptures, Singing of Psalms,
in holy Conferences, and all the
Duties incumbent upon him as the
Master of a Family. No Weariness,
no weighty Business abroad, excused
him from the discharge of these Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Nor did he perform them slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and perfunctorily, but spent very
much time in them; he was very as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siduous,
very earnest and vehement,
and shewed a very great concern and
ardor therein. He would rise early
in a Morning to these Exercises, and
not spare his pains even after the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great and wearisom labours of the
day.</p>
            <p>Nor did he forbear his Studies and
Closet-Devotions. He spent much
time there. It appears by a Diary
found since his Death, and which he
kept for a long time, that he called
himself to an account every Night
for the Words, and Actions, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
of the Day past; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
few men living were more strict
and severe than he was in this matter. If
he had done any good that day, he gave
God the praise of it before he slept. And
few men that lived passed fewer days
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108689:7"/>
(if he passed any such) without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good. But when any Words or
Thoughts escaped, which he judged
to have wanted due care, he animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
upon himself in a severe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
before he went to rest. He was
one of the kindest men to others that
ever lived, and one of the severest to
himself. He needed no Confessor to
call him to account, or to enjoyn
him any Penance. He did not spare
revenge upon himself, who could
most easily forgive his Enemies, and
wanted no compassion for the greatest
Criminals. He kept a continual watch
over his own Soul, and strictly watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
over its actings, and tendencies,
and was therefore very fit to watch
over those who were committed to
his Charge.</p>
            <p>Besides the constant care that was
upon him from his Parish, his Family,
his Closet and Studies, he imployed
himself in doing good to those who
were more remote. He encouraged
Piety where-ever he came, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in the younger sort. He had
the care of several Societies of Young
Men, whom he directed and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.
And because this matter hath
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108689:7"/>
been mis-understood, and that to my
certain knowledge, there was an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
since this Revolution, to black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
the Doctor on this account, I shall
represent the matter just as it was.</p>
            <p>Certain it is that there were some
Societies of religious and devout Young
Men under the Doctor's Government
and Inspection. But whether the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
did move these Young Men at
first to enter into such Societies, or
whether they first applied to him, and
he only gave them Rules to govern
themselves by, I am not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.
Thus much is certain, that
he gave them Rules, and they were
these that follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> That all that entered into such a
Society should resolve upon an holy and
serious Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>II.</hi> That no person shall be admitted
into this Society till he arrive at the
age of Sixteen, and hath been first
confirmed by the Bishop, and solemnly
taken on himself his Baptismal Vow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III.</hi> That they chuse a Minister of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> to direct them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:108689:8"/>
               <hi>IV.</hi> That they shall not be allowed in
their meetings to discourse of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
point of Divinity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>V.</hi> Neither shall they discourse of
the Government of Church or State<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>VI.</hi> That in their meetings they use
no Prayers but those of the Church, such
as the Litany and Collects, and other
prescribed Prayers; but still they shall
not use any that peculiarly belongs to the
Minister, as the Absolution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VII.</hi> That the Minister whom they
chuse shall direct what practical Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
shall be read at these meetings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VIII.</hi> That they may have liberty,
after Prayer and Reading, to sing a
Psalm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IX.</hi> That after all is done, if there
be time left, they may discourse each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
about their spiritual concerns; but
this shall not be a standing Exercise,
which any shall be obliged to attend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>X.</hi> That one day in the Week be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for this meeting, for such as
cannot come on the Lord's Day; and
that he that absents himself without
cause shall pay three Pence to the Box.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XI.</hi> Every time they meet, everyone
shall give six Pence to the Box.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:108689:8"/>
               <hi>XII.</hi> That on a certain day in the
year, <hi>viz. Whitsun-Tuesday,</hi> two Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
shall be chosen, and a moderate
Dinner provided, and a Sermon preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Money distributed (necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Charges deducted) to the Poor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XIII.</hi> A Book shall be bought, in
which these Orders shall be written.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XIV.</hi> None shall be admitted into
this Society without the consent of the
Minister who presides over it; and no
Apprentice shall be capable of being cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XV.</hi> That if any Case of Conscience
arise, it shall be brought before the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XVI.</hi> If any Member think fit to
leave the Society, he shall pay five Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
to the Stock.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XVII.</hi> The major part of the Society
to conclude the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XVIII.</hi> The following Rules are more
especially to be commended to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of this Society, viz. To love one
another: When reviled, not to revile
again: To speak evil of no man: To
wrong no man: To pray, if possible, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
times a day: To keep close to the
Church of <hi>England:</hi> To transact all
things peaceably and gently: To be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108689:9"/>
to each other: To use themselves to
holy Thoughts in their coming in and
going out: To examine themselves eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
night: To give every one their due:
To obey Superiors both Spiritual and
Temporal.</p>
            <p>This is the substance of what the
Doctor directed on this occasion. I
did many years ago lay these things
before a very great and worthy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
(who is now living) to whom
I thought it was highly fit that they
should be communicated. I advised
with him upon the whole matter. And
the occasion was this: There was a
certain number of Young Men<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> who
were desirous to make such a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
and to be concluded by these
Orders. They applied to a Minister
in <hi>London</hi> to take upon him the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
and Care of them. I was
concern'd for that Minister, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
laid the whole case before that
Prelate. He was clearly of opinion
that the Young Men were not to be
discouraged, and that it was best to
take care of them, and secure that
zeal which they expressed, in the right
Channel; he was well contented to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108689:9"/>
leave them to the care and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Minister of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> Upon which encouragement
they were admitted. That time in
which this Prelate was consulted, was
not over favourable to any kind of
Religious Meetings. And yet the
Doctor had the hard measure to be
censured very severely, even since
this happy Revolution, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
Endeavours were used to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
an ill opinion of him in the late
Archbishop, and in others, But upon
due Information, the Archbishop was
intirely satisfied, and was a true Friend
to the Doctor to the last.</p>
            <p>The Doctor had so much business
generally upon his hands, that he had
hardly time to eat his Meat. He was
often sent for to sick and dying Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
frequently consulted by those
who were doubtfull and scrupuious,
and addressed to with Cases of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and sometimes with Cases that
were very extraordinary. He was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
beyond all measure followed by
the Poor and Needy, by them that
wanted Money, or wanted his favour
to procure them some Boon or other.
He was extremely prone to do good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108689:10"/>
this was well known, and it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with him accordingly.</p>
            <p>But in the late Reign his labour
was much encreased. Great endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
were used to introduce Popery,
and to delude the poor People. No
man was more stout and diligent than
the Doctor at that time. He preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
most vigorously against that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Doctrine, prepared his Auditors
against the day of trial, and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
(I doubt not) for Martyrdom
himself. 'Tis very well known that
he declined no labour, shunn'd no
Conference with the Popish Priests,
omitted not what was in his power
to do to stemm the Tide. There are
those living, of the greatest figure and
character, who very well know the
truth of this matter.</p>
            <p>But thanks be to God, the fear of
Popery vanish'd upon his present Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
coming to the Crown. But
then the Doctor had another tryal.
His Maintenance at the <hi>Savoy</hi> was but
small, and in great measure precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
And yet was that all his Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
excepting a Prebend of the
Church of <hi>Exeter</hi> of but 20 <hi>l. per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
without any Corps belonging
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108689:10"/>
to it. But it was really much less
than that, Charges deducted. This
was all his Preferment at that time,
and for some considerable time after.
He had not any house to live in, but
what he hired at a considerable rate.
He had himself, a Wife, and four Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to maintain; and his Children
so far grown, that they required now
a more chargeable Maintenance than
formerly. His Maintenance was very
little. Those who formerly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
withdrew their kindness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he submitted to the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
He lost very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
that way. This I had from his
own Mouth. But yet I cannot say
he complained of it. I confess I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
him complain but once, and
that was a little before his last Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and then he complained that
he wanted Money to give to the Poor.
The Poor did in great numbers resort
to him at that time; he gave of
his own little a very great proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and perhaps something more than
might seem consistent with what was
owing to his own Family. But he
had a generous Soul, and knew not
how to deny him that asked. The
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108689:11"/>
words of our Saviour, <hi>Give to every
one that asketh thee,</hi> made a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon his Mind: I found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
discourse with him, that he was
so very much under the power of those
words, that he thought he could
hardly be at liberty even from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Beggar: And sometime I have
taken occasion to discourse him on that
subject; but I shall not trouble the
Reader with any thing farther in that
matter.</p>
            <p>In these mean circumstances he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
for several years after the late
Revolution. But he went on in his
labours, and chearfully pursued the
great end of his Ministry, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
for which he was sent into the
World. It pleased God to raise up a
friend who concerned himself on his
behalf. It was the Lord Admiral <hi>Rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,</hi>
now the Right Honourable the
Earl of <hi>Orford.</hi> He, before he went
to Sea, went to the Queen to take
leave of her Majesty, and when he
was with her, begged of her that she
would be pleased to bestow some Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
on Dr. <hi>Horneck.</hi> The Queen
told him that she could not at present
think of any way of preferring the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108689:11"/>
Doctor, and with this answer the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
was dismissed. Sometime after
this, the Queen told what had passed
on this occasion to the late Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.
She added withal, that she was
concerned, lest the Admiral should
think her too unconcerned on the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's
behalf, and advised with him
what was to be done for the Doctor's
advantage, and satisfaction of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral.
The Archbishop advised the
Queen to promise him the next Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend
of <hi>Westminster</hi> that should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to become void. This the Queen
did, and lived to make her word good
in the year 1693. The late Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
upon notice that the Prebend
was void, introduced the Doctor to
the Queen, and he was made Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendary
of that Church. I had this
relation from the late Archbishop. And
I mention that noble Lord, who spake
to the Queen on the Doctor's behalf,
with all the honour imaginable. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that noble Family, the Duke of
<hi>Bedford,</hi> and his noble Relatives, had
a great kindness for the Doctor, and
it ought not to be forgotten in this
place. I have often heard the Doctor
mention them with respect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:108689:12"/>
He was now in easier circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and provided of an House, and at
a small distance from his People, of
whom he took the very same care
which he did before. He preached
very constantly among them, and
discharged other Ministerial duties as
before. He kept in his hands some
part of the House he formerly lived in,
and was constantly there a day or two
in a Week, (besides his other occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
times) on purpose to attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those poor, and afflicted, and scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
People that resorted thither for
help and advice. He did very often
stay all night in that place, that he
might be in a readiness to assist those
that expected him there.</p>
            <p>His Prebend of <hi>Exeter</hi> lying at a
great distance from him, he expressed
an inclination to resign it, and he did
so the next year. The present Bishop
of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> had a small Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend
which that year became void,
little better as to the annual Rent than
that of <hi>Exeter,</hi> but then it had a Corps
of some value, and two lives were
gone. It required no Residence, and
if it had, it was much nearer to him
than <hi>Exeter.</hi> The Bishop made him
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108689:12"/>
an offer of it, hoping that he might
receive some Fine for the better sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of his Family. He was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to it upon <hi>Sept.</hi> 28. 1694. He
enjoyed it to the day of his death, but
I fear he made no advantage of it, his
charges considered; or if he did, it
was very small. He was offered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a Fine, and (considering his
small income) a considerable Summ,
but yet not above one half of the real
value. 'Twas supposed, I presume,
that he would have greedily laid hold
of the present advantage and gain, (as
too many have done) without consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
what was decent and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with respect to the Church and
to his Successor. But they that
thought so were deceived in their Man.
He generously refused the offer, and
left the Lives to be filled up by his
Successor. But it having a Vicarage
annexed in his gift, he went and
preached to the People, and gave out
good Rules in his Visitation, for the
good of the Souls in the Peculiar un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Jurisdiction. In this Journey
of his, he happened to meet with the
Lessee of the Corps, from whom alone
he might expect a Fine. Instead of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108689:13"/>
minding his own gain, and addressing
to the Lessee with art and complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance,
in order to make a wordly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
he plainly reproved the Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
of Immorality; which others were
prone enough to spread abroud, but
perhaps no other had the courage to
reprove. He chose rather to lose his
Fine (as he did) than omit his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Upon this occasion I cannot but
add, that he had in great measure the
Spirit and Courage of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist.</hi>
He durst reprove a great Man; and
perhaps that man lived not that was
more conscientious in this matter. I
very well knew a great Man, and Peer
of the Realm, from whom he had just
expectations of Preferment; but this
was so far from stopping his Mouth,
that he reproved him to his Face; and
that too in a matter that few men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
would have adventured on. He
missed of his <hi>Preferment</hi> indeed, but
<hi>saved his own Soul.</hi> He could not
fawn or flatter, cringe and comply,
for his own gain and worldly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>Upon this consideration, his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
and Friendship were very
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108689:13"/>
desirable by every good man, that
would be better. He would in him
be very sure of a Friend that would
<hi>not suffer sin upon him.</hi> I may say of
him what <hi>Pliny</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Plin. l. 1. ep. 12.</note> says of <hi>Corellius Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus,</hi>
whose death he laments, <hi>amisi
vitae meae testem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I have lost a</hi>
faithfull <hi>witness of my Life;</hi> and may
add, what he said upon that occasion
to his Friend <hi>Calvisius, Vereor ne neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentiÃ¹s
vivam,</hi> i. e. <hi>I am afraid</hi> (says
he) <hi>lest for the time to come I should live
more carelesly.</hi> Certain I am, that his
Friends and Familiars have a great loss
upon this account. They have lost a
great Pattern of Vertue, and a very
faithfull Monitor and Reprover of Vice
and Folly.</p>
            <p>A faithfull Reprover is a very great
help in our Christian Course. He is
to be valued above the greatest trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
<hi>He that would be safe</hi> (says one
of the Ancients) <hi>must have a faithfull
Friend, or a bitter Enemy,</hi> that he
may fly from Vice by the Monitions
of the one, or Invectives of the other.
We need one of these to set us right.
We read that the Grandees of <hi>Japan</hi>
do each of them maintain in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
houses one or two persons, whose
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108689:14"/>
office and business is to observe the
actions of their Masters, and freely
to admonish them when they do any
thing <hi>imprudently</hi> or <hi>wickedly</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Varen. <hi>descript.</hi> Japon.</note>. 'Tis
worthy of our imitation, and highly
expedient. Great men are followed
and corrupted by Flatterers; they
have but few Friends who have Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Honesty enough to tell them
of their faults.</p>
            <p>But this may be thought too great
a Digression; I therefore return to
give a farther account of this excellent
Man. He was now in better circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
as to the world, than he had
been, but not less diligent and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
He went on in his Master's
work with most unwearied labour,
and spent his whole time and strength
in it. And it was his delight and his
choice. Indeed those who were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him thought he did more than
he was able long to bear. He grew
soon after this very infirm and sickly.
He fell into dangerous fits of the
Stone<note n="â€ " place="margin">The learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>W. Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> us'd to call this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper, to which he himself was much sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diosorum flagellum.</hi>
               </note>, made very little, and that
a bloody Water. He walked with
difficulty, and could hardly bear a
Coach. I have often told him, that
he could not long continue under the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108689:14"/>
labour which he underwent; and I
plainly saw that he declined, and
would do so more and more, unless
he did remit his very great labours. I
convinc'd him abundantly of the truth
of what I observed of him. He was
sensible of it, and seem'd very incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to retire from the multiplicity
of business with which he was almost
overwhelm'd. He went on in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
labours to <hi>Christmas,</hi> 1696.
Then his work increased upon him,
and whereas other men's labours are
then intermitted, his were augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
For at that time he had more
frequent Communions, besides an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
number of Applications from
poor People, who then expect relief
and assistance; which gave him great
diversion and trouble, He neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
went through all this labour and
trouble, with as great chearfulness as
was possible. But not long after I
found a plain alteration in him for the
worse. On the 23d of <hi>January</hi> I was
much concern'd for him. He was to
preach the next day at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and
I was of opinion that it was not safe
for him to do it. I was very earnest
with him to spare himself that day,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108689:15"/>
but could not prevail. He preached
there, and it was the last Sermon that
he preached. In the Evening I found
him (to my great sorrow) in great
disorder. From that time his illness
encreased upon him. His Urine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the matter totally stopped; he was
in pain, and greatly indisposed all that
Week. And yet when I ask'd him
(which I frequently did) if he were
not in great pain, all the answer that
I could get from him was, that <hi>the
pain he felt was tolerable.</hi> There was
nothing wanting that could be thought
of towards giving him ease. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
Physicians were consulted, and
they consulted and advised upon his
case, and attended him with great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
and tenderness, but without
success. On Sunday Morning, <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi>
31st, he was worse than ever he
had been, insomuch that those about
him thought him dying about eleven
in the Morning. I was then at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster-Abbey,</hi>
and was sent for out of
the Church to pray with him. I found
him very sensible. I asked him, if
he were sensible that he was dying,
he replied that he was. I asked him
if he were also resigned, and willing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108689:15"/>
to die, he replied very readily, that
he was willing to die. I asked him if
he had considered the words, <hi>Heb.</hi>
II. 14, 15; and whether or not he
found himself delivered from all the
slavish <hi>fear of death,</hi> he replied very
quick, looking up to Heaven, that
he was delivered from that fear.
He was in an excellent frame, and
joyned with the Prayers which the
Church appoints on such occasions,
with great expressions of Devotion,
Sometime after this, I found him
delirous, and not long after speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.
After some few hours Groans he
expired, <hi>viz.</hi> at Eight a Clock that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening,
being then about the 56th
year of his Age<note n="*" place="bottom">Before this last Illness, of which he died, he fell (in the year 1678) into along and languishing Sickness, occasioned through his indefatigable Application to the Duties and Functions of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry. It brought him well nigh to his Grave. The good Man ascribed his Recovery, under God, to the tender Care of his vertuous Wife, with whom he always liv'd in great Concord and Union, and to the Prayers of pious People put up to Heaven on his behalf; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from some devout Meditations which he compos'd on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and which have been found since his Decease among his Papers. In Thanksgiving to God for his Preservation at that time, which he himself look'd on as next to miraculous, he kept a Day Monthly in his Family ever after, and preach'd yearly a Commemoration. Sermon to his beloved Congregation at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> wherein he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed God's Mereies to him, and excited others to hope and trust in him in the like Extremities. He also distributed largely to the Poor upon that Day. This was his constant Method<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to treasure up God's Providences to him, and to sanctifie and improve them not only to his own Use, but to the Use and Benefit of others.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:108689:16"/>
His Body was opened, and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
quickly what was the cause of
his Death. Both his Ureters were
stopped: One of them was stopped as
a Bottle with a Cork, with a Stone
that entered the top of the Ureter with
a sharp end, the upper part of which
was thick and much too big to enter
any farther: The other was stopped
also with Stones, of much less firmness
and consistence than the other.</p>
            <p>His Body was interred on <hi>Feb.</hi> 4.
in the Abbey Church of <hi>Westminster,</hi>
with great Solemnity, and a vast num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Attendants. Several of the
Lords the Bishops, very many of the
most eminent Clergy about the City,
and an incredible number of other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
were present on that occasion.
And it must be said that the Church
of <hi>Westminster</hi> shewed the great
kindness they had for him, by the
great care they took of his very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and solemn Interment.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed any farther, I
shall reflect upon his undaunted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
when Death look'd him in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108689:16"/>
face. 'Tis certain that there were a
great many considerations that might
have disposed him to desire a longer
life at that time. I well knew his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
and those of his Family,
and how desirable his life was upon
many accounts. But yet this pious
man was not only willing to die, but
was entirely delivered from the fear
of it, and did with great cheatfulness
and alacrity receive the tidings and
sentence of Death.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Hierom</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Hieron. vit. Hila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion.</note> tells that <hi>Hilarion,</hi>
just when he was expiring, spake
these words, <hi>Egredere, quid times?
Egredere anima mea, quid dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas?
Septuaginta propÃ¨ annis servisti
Christo, &amp; mortem times?</hi> i. e. <hi>Go
out, O my Soul, why dost thou fear?
Why dost thou doubt? Thou hast served
Christ near seventy years, and art thou
afraid to dye?</hi> There was, it seems,
some fear and some doubt in <hi>Hilarion.</hi>
This Servant of God was, by his
Grace, delivered intirely from all such
fear or doubt. I say, by the Grace of
God he was delivered, and special
Grace it was. Very good Persons,
when they come to die, have their
doubts, and their great fears too. It
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108689:17"/>
is an easie thing to discourse wisely
and Philosophically of the Contempt
of Death; but they which do so, have
not the same Presence of Mind when
Death looks them in the face. We
have a famous story to this purpose,
concerning the Father of <hi>Clinias,</hi> who
was wont to despise Death in his
Health, and was in great dread of it
when it drew near to him, as <hi>Plato</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
it<note n="*" place="margin">Platon Axiochus.</note>.</p>
            <p>It must be confessed, that this good
Man had taken the right course to be
freed from the fear of Death, by lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a very painfull and laborious, a
very usefull and charitable, a very
devout and pious Life.</p>
            <p>His Life was very painfull and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious.
Few men ever took the
Pains which he did. He was mortified
to all worldly Pleasures, and sensual
Satisfactions, and used himself to
great Labours and most exemplary
Diligence. There is nothing renders
us more afraid to die, than a soft and
voluptuous Life. <hi>Oh Death, how bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is the remembrance of thee to a man
that liveth in rest in his possessions? Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus.</hi>
XLI. 1. We have an example
of this in <hi>Agag.</hi> He came delicately,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108689:17"/>
and was <hi>pinguissimus &amp; tremens</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Vulg. lat. in locum.</note>, i. e.
<hi>very fat and trembling;</hi> and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

<hi>the bitterness of death:</hi> For so certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he does, however our Interpreters
come to render his words. Death
must be bitter where voluptuousness
makes life sweet.</p>
            <p>His Life was also very usefull and
very charitable. Multitudes they were
that received relief and advantage by
him. And there is a particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to such men, that God will <hi>streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
them upon the bed of languishing,</hi>
and <hi>make their bed in their sickness,</hi>

<hi>Sabbath.</hi> One of the Fathers<note n="â€ " place="margin">Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact. on Matth. 24.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodates
the words to my present
purpose. <q>Happy is that man that
does not, when he leaves this World,
lead an <hi>unfruitfull</hi> life, nor yet an
<hi>idle</hi> one. The Winter is the <hi>barren</hi>
time of the year, and the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
was a time, not of Labour, but of Rest.</q>
            </p>
            <p>His Life was also very devout and
pious, of which more afterward. I
mention only in this place, his very
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108689:18"/>
devout and frequent receiving the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Communion, which is a great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
to a comfortable Death. I will
repeat the Doctor's own Words, which
many years ago fell from him to his
hearers at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and which were
verified in him many years after. <hi>A
worthy receiving of the Lord's Supper</hi>
(says he) <hi>is the best preparative for death.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Crucific. Jesus, p. 557.</note> 
               <hi>No man can die uncomfortably,
that makes it his business, as often as
he comes to this Table, to receive wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily.
Death cannot hurt him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for
by his worthy receiving, he hath laid
up a good foundation for the time to
come,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I shall now more particularly give
the Character of this excellent Person,
and the kindness I had for him shall
not prevail with me to exceed in his
commendation.</p>
            <p>First, I shall begin with his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Piety towards God, of which
he was a very conspicuous Example.
His Religion had its full power and
force upon him, it transform'd him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the image and likeness of God. It
hath always been esteemed safe advice,
<hi>imitare eum quem colimus,</hi> i. e. <hi>to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
him whom we worship.</hi> On this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108689:18"/>
account some of the Heathens excused
their vices, because their Poets, and
men of the Stage, represented their
Gods as having practised the same
things. He worshipped the true and
living God, the holy and mercifull,
the God of truth and righteousness,
and not only the greatest and most
powerfull, but the best of Beings. He
was a follower of God, and his Divine
Image was fairly stamped and impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon his Soul. He imitated God
in those two things which one of the
Ancients tells us will make us like
God, <hi>viz. speaking truth, and bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
benefits.</hi> A man of greater simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and veracity I never knew; and
there are multitudes that will witness
that <hi>he went about doing good.</hi> He did
vow in his Baptism to renounce the
Devil, the World, and Flesh. Some
men go no farther. All their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
comes from the Font. This good
Man perform'd his Vow, he cast out
of himself the Evil One, and renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
all his Works, overcame the World
in the noblest sense, and subdued and
mortified all the sinfull desires of the
flesh. He was a Conquerour, and <hi>more
than Conquerour.</hi> He devoted himself
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108689:19"/>
intirely, and without reservation, to
the service of his God. It was not
only his business, but his choice and
delight, his meat and drink. I need
not say that he was much in Prayers
and Fastings, in Meditation and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Discourse, very frequent in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Communions, in reading and
hearing the Word, in watchings and
great austerities. He wisely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that these were the <hi>means,</hi> and
not the <hi>end</hi> of Religion; that these are
not <hi>godliness,</hi> but only <hi>helps,</hi> and the
<hi>way</hi> to it. He arrived at the <hi>end</hi> of
these things. He had an ardent love
of God, a great Faith in him, and
was resigned to his Will: He had an
unspeakable Zeal for his Honour, a
profound regard to his Word, and to
his Worship, and to all that had the
nearest relation to him, or did most
partake of his image and likeness. He
was a Man after God's own heart. He
lived under a most gratefull sense of
his Mercies, he was governed by his
fear, and had a lively sense of God's
special Care and Providence. He had
that sense of God's Mercy in giving
us his Son to die for us, that it was
observed of him, that when he discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108689:19"/>
of that Argument, he used no
measure, no bounds, or limits of his
Discourse. His heart was so affected
with that Argument, that he cou'd
not put a stop to himself. <hi>Jesus</hi> was
his Lord and Master, and he had his
Life and Example always before him,
and conformed himself to it in the
whole Tenour and Course of his Life.
His Religion was unaffected and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial,
it was genuine and primitive,
and so great a pattern he was, that he
might have passed for a Saint, even in
the first and best times of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>He was of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and a most true Son of that Church,
and gave the greatest proofs of it. Far
was he from the Innovations of the
<hi>Roman Church</hi> on the one hand, and
from Enthusiasm on the other. His
Writings are a sufficient proof of this.
I very well know that when the
Church of <hi>England</hi> hath been traduced
and disparaged, he hath not forborn
to make so vigorous a Defence, that
he lost a very great Man's friendship
by it, and felt the Effects of it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
by the loss of a consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
worldly advantage, which he
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108689:20"/>
would otherwise have stood very fair
for. He shewed his Zeal for the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> when she was in
greatest danger from many Enemies,
especially from the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi>
At that time, when some were so wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
as to change their profession, and
others so tame as to sit still, and not
to concern themselves when the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were at the Gates; (for there
were too many, that professed to be
Sons of this Church, and do so still,
who were over-awed, and durst not
appear with that Courage which God
and all good Men might justly have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from them) then did this good
Man bestir himself, and <hi>lifted up his
Voice like a Trumpet,</hi> and undaunted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
defended the Church, when she
most needed it. God be praised there
were others who did so likewise, with
great vigour and resolution, and great
hazard of their liberty and worldly
Comforts. And many of these had
the hard hap to be traduced by their
lukewarm Brethren, who cry up the
Church, as if these were not the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Sons of this Church. It hath
not been for the advantage of the
Church, that those Men have been
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108689:20"/>
decried as not genuine Church-men,
who have done her the greatest ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
on the other hand, some vaunt
themselves to be such, who have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been any support to their Mother
in her greatest distress. There are some
of these who are like the Images we
see in many Churches, that are so
placed in that bending Posture, as if
they bore upon their Shoulders the
weight of the Building, whereas in
truth they are only the fancy of the
Architect, and bear no weight at all.
The Doctor believed the Doctrine of
this Church, obeyed her Injunctions,
and conformed to her Constitutions:
Headmonished and diligently instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Charge, kept Multitudes in her
Communion, and lived up to her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Rules, and was ready to sacrifice all
that was dear to him in the World to
promote the true Interest of this
Church. He would not indeed take
the Cure of Souls, and then put them
out to nurse to some cheap and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Curate; receive the <hi>profits,</hi> and
leave another man to take the <hi>pains:</hi>
He would not take a <hi>Vicarage,</hi> and
<hi>swear</hi> residence before his Ordinary,
and afterwards refuse to <hi>reside,</hi> on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108689:21"/>
of some privilege or exempt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> as very many have
done. But a Church-man he was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding.
Indeed the best of men
have been mis-represented. And there
are a Number of the most useless men,
that yet in all places are crying up
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
regard to her holy Rules. I knew
two men of the same Faculty, in the
same neighbourhood. They were in
their profession very eminent. One
of these had the Name of a Church of
<hi>England</hi> man, the other of a Fanatick.
And yet it is well known that the first
very rarely (if at all) came to the
Church or Communion, the other
was a great frequenter of both.</p>
            <p>The Doctor was a man of very
good Learning. He had very goods kill
in Languages. He had addicted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the <hi>Arabic</hi> from his younger
time; and retained it in good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to the last. He had great skill in
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> likewise, nor was his skill
limited to the <hi>Biblical Hebrew</hi> only,
(in which he was a great Master) but
he was seen in the <hi>Rabbinical</hi> also. He
was a most diligent Reader of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures in that Language in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108689:21"/>
which they were originally written.
<hi>Sacras literas tractavit indefesso studio.</hi>
This Dr. <hi>Spanheim</hi> says of him in his
youth; <hi>viz. that he was indefatigable
in the Study of the Holy Scriptures.</hi>
He adds that he was then one of an
<hi>elevated wit, of a mind that was cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and covetous of making substantial
proficiency:</hi> And also that he gave a
Specimen of it about the year 1659,
(when he was very young) by a
publick defending a Dissertation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Vow of <hi>Jephtah,</hi> touching
the sacrificing his Daughter. This
upon his own request and motion he
publickly defended with great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of mind. He had very good
skill in Ecclesiastical History, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversial
Divinity, and Casuistical al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
Perhaps few men in his time were
more frequently applied to with Cases
of Conscience than the Doctor was.
As he had vast numbers of these ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
so many times the Cases
were very rare, and surprizing, and
such as are but very seldom to be
met with. He would often relate the
Case to me, and tell me what his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
was, and how he delivered it. I
do solemnly declare that I neve heard
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108689:22"/>
him deliver his opinion, but I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
satisfied with it. And I did think
him as valuable for this skill, as for
any other whatsoever. He was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
constant Preacher. He was very
affectionate and lively in his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
plain and pathetical; he spake
from his own, and pierced the hearts
of his hearers. I will not in this place
speak of his Writings, I may have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to mention them afterwards. I
shall only say here, that there is a great
strain of Piety and Devotion in them,
and they are very instructive to the
well-disposed Readers. He had great
correspondencies with learned Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Seas, and was often visited
by them, and this preserved in him
that readiness which he had in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Latin Tongue with considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ease and freedom.</p>
            <p>As for his Pastoral care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
he was a great Example. He
was a pattern to those of the Holy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
whom they might securely
follow. He well understood not only
the <hi>Dignity,</hi> but the <hi>Duty</hi> and Charge
of his Holy Function. He had a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
sense of the worth of Souls, and of
the great care that is to be had of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108689:22"/>
them. Hence it proceeded that he was ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable
to <hi>Pluralities,</hi> and <hi>Non-resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:</hi>
Hence it was that he laboured
indefatigably Night and Day: Hence it
was that he was so very painfull a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
so very hard a Student: Hence
it was that he was so very diligent in
Catechizing the youth, in visiting the
sick, and in all the parts of his holy
Office. His heart was wholly set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
gaining Souls to God. In this
work he labour'd incessantly. And
those who were thus disposed among
the Clergy, he honoured greatly, and
served them to his power. A consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
number of such Ministers were
well known to him, and some among
them that were not well provided for.
These upon occasion, he recommended
to Cures and Imployments, as he had
opportunity offered him from Persons
of Quality, who did many times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to the Doctor on these occasions.
And happy were they who took this
course, they might securely rest upon
his Recommendation. No man was
ever more faithfull in this trust; I know
not but I may say, no man was
more happy than the Doctor in this
matter. I have tried him several times,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108689:23"/>
and was not deceived. Had I been
Patron of many Livings, I could se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
have relied upon his Wisdom
and Fidelity in disposing them all. He
went by a true measure. He looked
on a Living (as we call it) as a <hi>Cure,</hi>
rather than a <hi>Benefice.</hi> He valued the
<hi>Flock</hi> more than the <hi>Fleece,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
preferred those who did the
same. On this very account, the
Death of the Doctor was a loss un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable;
and I reckon my self a
very great loser upon this account.
When he was alive, if I wanted a
Parish-Minister, a Curate, a Master
of a School, or Chaplain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I was
secure, that by him I might be well
supplied. His Recommendation weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more with me than many Hands,
than Seals, and ample Forms and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonials
from great Names and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
of Men. I well knew that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could bribe him to commend
that Person to a place of trust, whom
he did not know to be fit for it. I
heartily wish his Example in this were
followed. Nor do I think that what
I said last is any Digression, when I
speak of his Pastoral care. For his
care in recommending those only
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108689:23"/>
whom he knew to be fit, was an effect
of it. It cannot be that he who will
commend any person to holy Orders,
or the cure of Souls, should have a
due sense of the Pastoral care. And I
heartily wish that the Clergy would
be very cautious whom they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
for Orders, or for Institution;
and that College-Testimonials were
given with greater care than they
have been.</p>
            <p>I add, that he had a very great zeal
for <hi>Reformation.</hi> This will be no
Commendation of him to the luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm,
and formal Christians: Nay
it will render him less in the eyes of
some men, who mightily cry up the
Church. And therefore I must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
my self in this matter, lest I be
mis-understood, and the Memory of
the Doctor suffer upon this account.</p>
            <p>When I say that he was zealous for
<hi>Reformation,</hi> I do not mean that he
was for reforming or altering the Laws.
For though he did not think the Laws
<hi>immutable,</hi> yet did he not plead for
the changing them. He was well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in the Laws of Church and
State, and was not for Innovations.
He was no Enemy to the Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:108689:24"/>
The <hi>Reformation</hi> which he was for,
was such a one as might be consistent
with the Law, and indeed was the
end of the Law it self. He was very
much for a Reformation <hi>usquÃ¨ ad le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem;</hi>
and it will be very strange that
any considering Man should be against
such a Reformation as this; 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that he that is so, is against the
Law at the same time. He was for
Reformation of <hi>Manners,</hi> and a strict
regard to the Discipline and holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
of the Church. He lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Profaneness and Disorders
which had broken in among us, and
threatned our Ruin. He endeavoured
to keep up the Life and Spirit of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
and perhaps, considering his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Capacity, he did as much this
way as any man that lived in his
time. He never needed any Dispensation
himself, and could not without great
grief of heart, see the best Laws tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
upon by worldly and ungodly
Men, or defeated and eluded by the
craft and artifices of others. I need
make no apology for him, that he was
against Non-residence and Pluralities,
that he was for frequent Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and for a strict care in Catech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108689:24"/>
the Youth. All this is agreeable
to the Sense of our Church. And his
great Zeal against all profaneness and
immorality cannot be blamed, because
he was <hi>zealously affected in a good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For his Justice to all mankind, he
was a great pattern. He gave all men
their <hi>due,</hi> in the greatest latitude of
that word. He did not only pay his
debts, and discharge his trust, but
paid all due honour and respect to
worth and vertue, where-ever he found
it. Nothing could render him partial.
No friendship, no power, no interest
whatever could turn him aside, or so
much as set a false <hi>biass</hi> upon him.</p>
            <p>His Charity was Divine, and a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
imitation of the love of God and
of Christ. He sought not his own,
but with great industry pursued the
good of others. There are multitudes
alive that have received great relief
and comfort from him. He did not
spend his time in court and caress,
in visiting great Persons, and hunting
after Preferment or Applause. <hi>He
went about doing good.</hi> And in this he
was indefatigable. His heart was set
upon it, and this made him despise tbe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108689:25"/>
difficulty which lay in his way. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he went, this was his business and
design. His Charity was large, and
diffusive. It extended to the Bodies,
the Estates, and Souls of Men. He
fed and taught; He instructed and
comforted, and relieved those who
wanted help. I cannot but apply to
him what <hi>Libanius Sophista</hi>
               <note n="â€ " place="margin">
                  <hi>Socrat.</hi> Apolog.</note> said of
<hi>Socrates,</hi> in his Apology for him.
Thus he pleads for him to the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
his Citizens. <hi>Ye men of</hi> Athers,
(says he in his Declamation) <hi>save and preserve</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, i. e.
<hi>a sincere Friend, a kind Man, a good
Counsellor, a righteous Citizen! He
could not lead an Army, but he knew how
to reprove,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Your laws and suffrages
are of great value, and</hi> Socrates <hi>is of
no small price, who watcheth those who
transgress, reproves the injurious, that
dischargeth this publick Office for the
City. How many, think ye, that once
neglected to educate their Children, by
his means took that care upon them?
How many that quarrelled with their
brethren, did he reclaim? How many
that abused their parents, did he bring
to do them reverence? They feared the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108689:25"/>
reproofs of</hi> Socrates <hi>more than the
Courts of Justice. They knew they could
buy off an Accuser there; but they that
did amiss could not escape his reproofs,
nor bribe him to be silent.</hi> So it was;
this holy Man was a great Blessing to
the Publick, and more especially to
the City, where he reproved the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors,
encouraged the vertuous,
directed the scrupulous, and relieved
the indigent. <hi>Libanius</hi> goes on, and
represents what Strangers and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners
would say when <hi>Socrates</hi> was
dead, and what Discourses they should
be entertained with, who should come
to <hi>Athens</hi> to fee the <hi>man,</hi> and coming
too late for that, shou'd visit his Tomb.
<hi>One,</hi> says he, <hi>shall say to another, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the place, Here he discoursed of
Fortitude, and there of Sobriety, and
in yonder place of Justice: Here is the
place, where he run down</hi> Prodicus; <hi>and
there, where he was too hard for</hi> Prota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras:
<hi>In another, he overcame</hi> Eleius,
<hi>and</hi> Leontinus. I am very sure it may
be said of this holy Man, The places
may be shewn where he was doing
good; where he taught, and where
he relieved; where he entred the lists
with Papists, and where, with the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108689:26"/>
other Enemies of the Church; where
he instructed the Youth, and where
he encouraged and directed the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Christians, and where he exhorted
the elder. There are those who can
point to the places, and truly say:
Here is the Family whom he relieved,
and here live the poor Widows whom
he provided for; Here is the place
where he preached, and where he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
his Auditors to frequent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and brought vast Multitudes
of Men and Women to constant atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on that holy Ordinance! The
truth is, if the particulars were enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
(I say the particulars of his
Charity) they alone would make a
Volume.</p>
            <p>One piece of Charity deserves to be
remembred to his honour, and that
was his telling Men of their faults,
not only publickly, but privately too.
His reproofs may well be reckoned
among his Charities. I may truly say
of him, as <hi>Libanius</hi> does of <hi>Socrates,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, i. e. <hi>He
made those better whom he did bite.</hi>
He bit and healed at once. There was
no gall, no venom in him. It all
proceeded from unfeigned Charity to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:108689:26"/>
the Souls of Men. He could not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
sin upon his Brother. He had
the zeal of <hi>John Baptist,</hi> and durst
and did admonish, and reprove the
greatest. Of which matter I could say
more than I think is convenient for
me to be particular in. In truth he
had the Spirit of the Ancient Prophets,
and of the Holy Confessours of the
Primitive Church. A Man that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
with him much, wou'd be sure
to hear of it if he did amiss. He was
far from slander and detraction, from
that <hi>lingua tertia,</hi> as it is called among
the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which does three mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
at once, <hi>viz.</hi> to the <hi>speaker,</hi> to
the <hi>hearer,</hi> and to the <hi>slandered. There
is that speaketh like the piercings of a
sword, but the tongue of the wise is
health,</hi> Prov. XII. 18. He had the
perfect mastery of this member, and
used it to the benefit of his Brother.
I never knew any Man living that
was more stout than this good man in
reproving Vice, and in appearing for
the Truth; never any Man that was
farther removed from flattery and
dawbing.</p>
            <p>He was a Friend of a thousand. He
made little shew, and was sparing in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108689:27"/>
his profession of kindness. But when
he had occasion to serve his friend,
he was very industrious to do it, and
did not think much of pains and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
therein. There are multitudes
now alive that can attest this.</p>
            <p>He was temperate to the greatest
degree, I had almost said to a fault.
I have often feared that, considering
his great and constant labours, he
hardly gave himself that refreshment
which was fit. He drank very little Wine
at any time, and in the latter part of
his Life he did upon the matter
wholly forbear it. He had <hi>benÃ¨ mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
ventrem,</hi> as <hi>Seneca</hi> phraseth it, a
<hi>Stomach that was well nurtured,</hi> not nice
or curious; it received the meanest
Provision contentedly. After the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue
and labour of the day, he would
sup with an Apple or two, with a
little Bread, and small Ale or Milk-Water.
This he would receive with
great thankfulness to God, and great
chearfulness among his Domesticks.
He was very thankfull to God for a
Morsel of Bread, and received the
meanest Provision with the greatest
expressions of Gratitude. And yet
when he entertained his Friends, he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108689:27"/>
did it liberally. He was always least
concerned for himself in these things.
He very much deny'd himself, but to
others he was liberal and open-hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and rather than the Poor should
want Bread, he would fast himself.
He led an <hi>Ascetick</hi> Life, kept under
his Body, and with great industry ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
in Holiness, and a Life that
was spiritual and heavenly.</p>
            <p>For his Contempt of this lower
World he hath given sufficient proof.
He despised both the sides or appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of it, I mean the Smiles and
Frowns of it. It is well known, that
when he lived with the Duke of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemarle,</hi>
he might very easily have
made his Fortunes, as we usually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
it. Had he made his Court, he
could not have failed. But instead of
that, he minded his charge, and the
duty of his place. He minded the
heavenly Kingdom, and the doing
good to Souls. He would often speak
very contemptibly of Riches, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that the whole design of the
Christian Doctrine tended to bring
contempt upon Wealth and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>eat Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
He was of opinion, that Riches
were (as a great man hath it) <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimenta
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108689:28"/>
virtutis,</hi> i. e. <hi>the impediments
of virtue;</hi> and that a man could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
arrive to any great pitch of virtue,
but he must be, <hi>aut pauper, aut pauperi
similis,</hi> i. e. <hi>either poor, or like him
that is poor,</hi> as <hi>Seneca</hi> hath it.</p>
            <p>He likewise despised the Frowns of
the World. He met with sore afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The loss of a considerable part
of his worldly estate at once, I reckon
the least of them. I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that ever I heard him once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
but have often heard him give
solemn thanks to God for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Some of his Friends would some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
speak their Resentment before
him, because he was not better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.
But he would never side with
them; he diverted the discourse, or
stopt it, by saying, <hi>I shall never want.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was a most humble and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Christian; of great patience and
resignation to the will of God; a most
mortified man to the World, and to
all the Glory and Pageantry of it. He
led an innocent and inoffensive, and
a most usefull Life. He spent his
hours well, and lived many years in
a preparation for Death and Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:108689:28"/>
One thing must not be forgotten,
and that was his great Meekness under
Obloquies and Reproaches, his great
exemplariness in forgiving Enemies.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be supposed that he
had no Enemies, and it will easily be
granted, that he could deserve none.
But they do not know this world, that
think innocence and usefulness will
protect any man against Malice, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
and Ill-will. <hi>Nulla unquam magna
gloria sine magnÃ¢ fuit invidiÃ¢, Worthy
actions will always be followed with En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy.</hi>
'Tis by <hi>Julius Celsus</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Jul. Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus de vit. J. Caesaris.</note> reported,
that when <hi>Alcibiades</hi> asked counsel of
<hi>Socrates,</hi> what course he should take to
avoid Envy, <hi>Socrates</hi> replied, <hi>vive ut
Thersites,</hi> i. e. <hi>live like Thersites.</hi> Had he
lived a soft and trifling life, he might
have avoided it easily: But he did his
duty with great exactness, and that
was the occasion of Envy. The old
Monk, that was asked by a young
one how he might pass easily and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
through the world, told him, as
one rule, that he should <hi>fungi officio
taliter qualiter,</hi> i. e. <hi>That he should
not be exact in doing his duty,</hi> but <hi>do
it</hi> (as we say) <hi>so, so.</hi> The Doctor
could not live like <hi>Thersites,</hi> he could
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108689:29"/>
not do his Masters work negligently,
and as this drew many followers and
admirers after him, so it did Envy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
The truth of the case is this. His
exemplary Life was a standing reproach
upon those who were negligent, and
always trudging after Preferment and
Wealth. That some of the worst
should endeavour to blacken him, hath
nothing strange in it at all. This I
am very certain of, that the Clergy of
the greatest name, and the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous
for Vertue and good Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
had a very great opinion of him.</p>
            <p>He forgave his Enemies, and I could
never find him in the least disturbed
on that account.</p>
            <p>He wrote several Books which he
published; a Catalogue of them will
follow the close of these Papers. He
left also many excellent Sermons in
MSS. upon the most weighty Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
particularly upon our Blessed
Saviour's Sermon on the Mount, one
Volume of which is herewith Printed;
the rest will be set forth with all conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
speed; and likewise several others,
as these find encouragement; <hi>viz.</hi> upon
the Parable of the Ten Virgins; the
Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus;</hi> seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108689:29"/>
Sacramental Discourses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For those
which are already published, they are
well known. There is a great vein of
Piety and Devotion which runs through
them. They savour of the primitive
Simplicity and Zeal, and are well fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to make men better. They are
weak men that are much taken with
Flourishes and tall Metaphors, with
quaint and picquant strokes of wit.
His Discourses are all medicinal and
healing, and fitted to make the Reader
serious and devout. That Food is best
which is nourishing, and that Physick
which cures and restores. This good
man had no greater aim than to do
good.</p>
            <p>I will say of him, as <hi>Pliny</hi> did of
<hi>Virginius Rufus, Tanti viri mortalitas
magis finita est quam vita,</hi> i. e. <hi>His
Mortality is ended rather than his Life.
He lives and will live for ever; and
now that he is withdrawn out of our sight,
he will more than ever continue in the
Remembrance and Discourses of Men.</hi>
            </p>

ON THE
Fifth of St. Matthew.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>St. Matth. Ch. V. Ver. 1.</bibl>
               <q>And seeing the Multitudes he went up
into a Mountain, and when he was
set, his Disciples came unto him.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I intend, with God's Assistance, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
to you Christ's famous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
on the Mount, contain'd in the
<hi>Fifth, Sixth</hi> and <hi>Seventh</hi> Chapters
of St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Gospel. A great Work,
and which will take up much time;
some years may be to dispatch it in;
and whether I shall live to finish it, he
alone knows, in whose hand our time is;
but a Work, I am sure, exceeding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
and usefull for all, that name
the Name of Christ, and are desirous to
know whether they belong to that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
whose Name they bear, and whose
Patronage they crave.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:108689:34"/>
And I chuse to begin the Exposition
of this celebrated Discourse of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
at this time, because of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Account, which saith, this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
was deliver'd, the second Year of
Christ's Ministry, about this time of
the Year, the middle of <hi>May.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Sermon may justly be call'd the
Pandects of Christianity, the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
Body of practical Divinity, and
the most perfect System of the Duties
we owe to God, and Man. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
not only all that's good and sound
in Moral Philosophy, but a great deal
more, and gives the best Directions for
perfecting of humane Nature, and how
a Man may come up to emulate the
Life of Angels: And yet, this doth not
make the particular Lessons here laid
down unpracticable, or impossible to be
perform'd; so far from it, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven, and the everlasting
Enjoyment of God, is denied to those
who refuse to live up to these Canons,
<hi>Matth.</hi> V. 20. and VII. 24, 25, 26. which
shews, the Life prescribed here is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable,
the Duties practicable, the
Neglect inexcusable, and the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
possible; it being contrary to the
infinite Goodness, and Righteousness of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108689:34"/>
God, to require things for which he
gives no Power, or Capacity.</p>
            <p>So that he, who aims at a Happiness
greater, and higher than the present
World affords, sees here the Steps he
is to make, and the Way he is to walk
in.</p>
            <p>By this Sermon, the Christian World
will be judg'd in the last Day, and by
the Particulars of it, we all must either
stand or fall.</p>
            <p>All that's necessary to Salvation is
plainly deliver'd here, and lies within
the narrow Compass of three Chapters;
so that no Man (if his Reason be
sound) can pretend either want of time
to read them, or want of Memory to
remember them; for in less than half
an Hour's time, the whole Duty of a
Christian may be survey'd, and there is
no Man scarce of so weak a Memory,
but doth and may remember a great
deal more, than is contain'd in this
Sermon: in the handling of which, we
shall meet with great Variety of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
and though heretofore I have
occasionally treated of some of them,
picking here and there a Flower, yet I
shall not upon that Account forbear to
consider those Passages over again; not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108689:35"/>
only because I judge it profitable for my
Auditory to do so, but because the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
and Manner of handling them, will
be different from the former, and besides,
several material things, which God's
Spirit, and Study, and Time, and a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Judgment may suggest, will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the former Observations.</p>
            <p>I begin with the Preliminaries of this
admirable Sermon; a Sermon preach'd
by the Great Saviour of the World,
deliver'd by the Son of God, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
by him, in whom are all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Wisdom and Knowledge, even
by him, who could not be mistaken in
the Law he gave, or in the Sanction
of it, who knew very well what with
the Assistance of his Grace we are able
to do, what the neglect of so solemn a
Message doth deserve, and how great
the Encouragements are, that are here
given to those who have the boldness to
force their way through the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of this present World, into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Glory.</p>
            <p>The Words, I have read to you, are
purely historical, and shew what was
the occasion of the ensuing Sermon;
for <hi>seeing the Multitudes, he went up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Mountain, and when he was set, his
Disciples came unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:108689:35"/>
This is the Introduction or Preface
to the following Discourse: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I am loath to leave any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd,
that is material in these three
Chapters: I shall,</p>
            <p>I. Endeavour to reconcile the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
relations of the Evangelists, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Sermon of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>II. Enquire, what the Multitudes were
that appeared here.</p>
            <p>III. Why Christ ascended into a
Mountain to teach the People.</p>
            <p>IV. What his sitting down doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
            <p>V. What, and who the Disciples were
that came unto him.</p>
            <p>I. To reconcile the different relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Evangelists concerning this
Sermon (for St. <hi>Luke</hi> ch. VI. 12. seems
to contradict St. <hi>Matthew,</hi>) you must
know,</p>
            <p>1. That the Evangelists, St. <hi>John</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
who seems to be more accurate,
do not always concern themselves in
declaring the exact Order of time, when
every thing was spoke, or done, but
content themselves with amassing, or
collecting the Matters of Fact, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108689:36"/>
Parts of Christ's Discourses, his
Miracles, and his Actions, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very curious about every Minute
circumstance, or order, or method; for
their business was not to make men
Chronologers, but Christians. This is
the reason, why one brings in a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of Christ, after such a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Passage, another before it, which is
suitable enough to their Design; which
was to give us an Account of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
no matter in what order the
Jewels lie. And accordingly St. <hi>Luke</hi>
sets down the Delivery of this Sermon,
or the Substance of it after the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Cure wrought upon the Man who
had the wither'd Hand, <hi>Luke</hi> VI. 12.
but St. <hi>Matthew</hi> chuses to speak of it
before he mentions the Miracle; not
that one saith, it was done before, and
the other after, that would be a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
Only one thinks fit to take
notice of it before he records the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle;
the other thinks it convenient to
record the Miracle first, and then the
Sermon.</p>
            <p>2. The Agreement of the Evangelists
appears chiefly in this, that none denies,
what the other saith; One mentions a
Circumstance, which another leaves out,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108689:36"/>
but though all do not mention the
same, yet none denies the thing. To
apply this to the Sermon before us,
St. <hi>Luke</hi> ch. VI. 12. saith, <hi>Christ went
up into the Mountain to pray,</hi> which
St. <hi>Matthew</hi> takes no notice of; yet his
silence is no denial of that Circumstance,
St. <hi>Luke</hi> adds, <hi>That going up into the
Mountain,</hi> he chose Twelve Disciples,
which might very well be, though
St. <hi>Matthew</hi> says nothing of it in this
Chapter. Both these Evangelists agree,
<hi>That Christ went up into a Mountain;</hi> one
indeed seems to affirm, that he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
this Sermon on the Mount, the
other after he came down from the
Mount. Both are in the right, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if we say, that he deliver'd this
Sermon on the Mount at large, and
when he came down, by way of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary,
or Epitome, for the easier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of his Hearers; for indeed
St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s relation is nothing but a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
of this Sermon. And we know,
it's customary with the Evangelists, not
only for one, to set down the very
Words of Christ, for the other, the
Sense; but also, for one to repeat such a
Discourse in its full Scope and Latitude,
and for another to give us only the Heads
of it. But,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108689:37"/>
II. What were the Multitudes that
appear'd here? and why did they come?
St <hi>Matthew</hi> ch. IV. 25. tells us, <hi>They
were great Multitudes of People from</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,
<hi>and</hi> Decapolis, <hi>from</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and
from</hi> Judaea, <hi>and from beyond Jordan;</hi> and
so saith St. <hi>Luke</hi> ch. VI. 17. who adds,
<hi>That some came from the Coasts of</hi> Tyre,
<hi>and</hi> Sidon.</p>
            <p>1. It was a mixt Multitude, some
good, some bad, some well inclin'd,
others averse from Seriousness, some
whom meer Curiosity brought hither,
others whom a Sense of another World
encourag'd to come; and this is what
we may say of all Multitudes, that press
into our Churches at this Day; some
are of <hi>Gallio</hi>'s Mind, and care for none
of these things, only, come for fashion's
sake; others of <hi>Lydia</hi>'s Temper, whose
Hearts God opens, to attend to the
things spoken by his Messengers. Some
with <hi>Festus</hi> make themselves merry
with the Preacher's Discourse, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions;
others like <hi>Agrippa</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
perswaded to be Christians, but
very few prove true Converts.</p>
            <p>2. The end for which they came was
partly to hear, and partly to be healed,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108689:37"/>
as we find, <hi>Luke</hi> VI. 17. Though in
hearing it was with them, as with the
Seed in the Parable; <hi>Some fell by the
Way-side, some in stony ground, some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thorns, some in a good natur'd soil,</hi>
as it is <hi>Matth.</hi> XIII. yet hearing was
their end; and I wonder not to find
them ambitious to hear this wonderfull
Person, who to his Doctrine join'd the
Testimony of Heaven, which is Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
Had all <hi>Judaea</hi> believ'd him to be
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> where one ran after him,
Thousands and Millions would have
come to hear him; however the greater
part took him for a Prophet, mighty
in Word, and Deed, and inspired, and
one that had more than ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with God, and this was Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
enough to hear him. They had
for many Years heard the insipid Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of the Scribes, and Pharisees,
and were even tired with their supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Niceties, and Traditions, and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
and pressing the cleansing of
the out-side of the Cup, and Platter.
But here was a Person, that spoke to the
Heart, and with Authority, and things
solid and great, and weighty, without
design, or interest, or affectation of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause,
and there appear'd in his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108689:38"/>
something more than humane,
even a Divine Light and Power, which
made them leave their Work, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
to hear him.</p>
            <p>Another reason of their coming was
to be cured of their Diseases, and Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.
Though Christ's curing <hi>Gratis,</hi>
without Fee, or Money, might be a
Temptation to many of the poorer sort
to make use of him; yet to others, his
miraculous Way of chasing away Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers,
with a Word and By-way of
Command, and healing Diseases, which
mock'd all the Attempts of Surgeons,
and Physicians, might be the greater
Motive. Christ's curing Distempers of
the Body, was in order to heal their
distemper'd Souls.</p>
            <p>To set up for a Physician only, had
been too mean an Employ, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must suppose, that his Charity
to their outward, was in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
a greater Charity on their inward
Man; and their acknowledgment of his
Power and Goodness was to lead them
to a holy Obedience to his Precepts,
and particularly to Repentance, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of Life; and though it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
few came with that intent, I
mean, to have their Souls freed from
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108689:38"/>
the Corruptions they had no Sense of;
yet being come, many found by blessed
Experience, strange Cures wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Consciences, and went away
not only sound in Body, but with a
lively Sense of their Duty: The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Cure astonish'd them into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of their ways, and they
thought they could do no less in Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
than become Subjects to his
Will, who had conquer'd their Diseases.
Christ's Touch went farther than their
Bodies, and their Souls felt the Power
of it, as much as their Flesh; and he
that felt his Distemper departing, found
at the same time, that his love to sin
stole away, and a new love succeeded,
a fervent love to God, and his Holy
Precepts. But,</p>
            <p>III. The next thing, that occurs in
this Historical Part, is <hi>Christ's going up
into the Mount;</hi> St. <hi>Jerom</hi> takes notice,
that some weak Brethren of his time
took this Mount to be the Mount of
<hi>Olives;</hi> others believe it to have been
a Mountain distant about three Miles
from <hi>Capernaum.</hi> But the Scripture gives
the Mount no Name, and therefore they
only speak their Guesses, that are not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108689:39"/>
content with these general Notices.
There is a Mountain at this Day in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea,</hi>
they say, which is call'd <hi>Christ's
Mount;</hi> and the Fryars that get Mony
by shewing Ancient Monuments, will
needs have it to be the Mountain spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of in the Text, and for Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Story, pretend to shew the
very Stone on which Christ sat when
he deliver'd the ensuing Precepts, but
there is no Credit to be given to such
Reports, nor indeed is it material to
know what Mountain it was. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
why he ascended into a Mountain
will be more to the purpose, and they
are briefly these.</p>
            <p>1. It was to imitate the Eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that at divers times, and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
manners spake to the Fathers of
old. He gave his Law to the Jewish
People on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> Exod. XIX. II.
The Son being to give a Law to the
Christian World, begins the Promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it on a Mountain too, and in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so, discover'd his Divine Authority;
and it was an <hi>Item,</hi> that the same God,
that spoke on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> spoke in
this Mountain too; only here lay the
difference; the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>
was publish'd in the Midst of Thunder
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108689:39"/>
and Lightning, for which reason we
find it call'd a <hi>Fiery Law,</hi> Deut. XXXIII. 2.
The Law of the Gospel was deliver'd in
a sweet and still Voice, to represent the
Nature and Temper of it, to express
the Calmness of Mind, the secret Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
the spiritual Joy it causes, and
the Rest it leads to, both Temporal and
Eternal.</p>
            <p>2. He thought fit to deliver this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
Sermon on a Mountain, to
shew the Sublimity and Grandeur of
his Doctrine and Precepts, that the
Law he intended to give transcended
the Laws of all Nations in the World
in wholsomeness and excellency; that
the Laws, which had hitherto govern'd
Mankind, were low, creeping things, to
what he was going to publish, and
what an Excellent, and Heroick Spirit,
Obedience to his Precepts would give
to his true Followers, raise them above
the World, make them despise subluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Vanities, advance them above the
common level of Philosophical Vertues,
and fit them for dwelling at last on the
everlasting Hills, on the Mount where
God is seen, and will be seen to Eternal
Ages, even the Kingdom, that fades not
away. But,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:108689:40"/>
I must go on, and take notice of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Circumstance here mention'd, and
that is</p>
            <p>IV. Christ's sitting down on the
Mount. Even this Posture hath some
Mystery in it: For,</p>
            <p>1. In doing so, Christ asserted the
Greatness and Majesty of his Person,
even in sitting down to speak, while
the Multitude, and the Disciples stood
round about him. This may be call'd
an Early Act of his Royalty, as Kings
do sit, while their Subjects of all sorts
and degrees stand about them. Sitting
among the Jews was a Posture denoting
liberty, and freedom from slavery, which
was the reason why the Synagogue
chang'd the Posture of standing at the
Passover, a Posture, or sign of Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
into sitting, or leaning; and with
very good reason might Christ sit down
here, when he taught the People; whose
business it was to proclaim liberty to the
Captives, to free the World from the
bondage of sin, and to rescue them
from the Tyranny of the Devil. But,</p>
            <p>2. In sitting down to teach, we may
add, Christ imitated the Jewish Custom
which was, that the Teachers sat, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108689:40"/>
the Hearers stood: Unto this St. <hi>Luke</hi>
alludes, <hi>Ch.</hi> IV. 20. where speaking of
Christ teaching in the Synagogue, he
says, <hi>He closed the Book, and gave
it again to the Minister, and sat down,
and the Eyes of all that were in
the Synagogue, were fastened upon him.</hi>
In these Synagogues, which were in the
Nature of our Parish-Churches, there
was a Seat, whereon the Teacher sat, and
the Auditours stood at his Feet, which
gave occasion to that proverbial Phrase,
That such a one had been brought up at
the Feet of such a Teacher, as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
saith of himself, That he had been
brought up at the Feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> Acts
XXII. 3. And of this Nature was the
other Expression, the Jews made use of,
<hi>viz.</hi> To wallow, or roll in the Dust of
such a Master's Feet; whereby they no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Humility, that the Auditour
ought to shew to him that teaches him.
But,</p>
            <p>V. One circumstance more must here
be consider'd, and this relates to the
Disciples that came unto him. The
following Sermon being directed to
them, it concerns us to know who these
Disciples were. And,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:108689:41"/>
1. They were the Twelve Apostles,
who are call'd so by way of Eminency,
as being the Chief, the principal Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Christ, by whose Life and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
men were to conclude, and learn
the Nature of Christ's Kingdom. The
word Disciple <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Talmid</hi> in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Mathetes</hi> in the Greek,
is one that is taught by another, and
puts himself under his Tuition, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
following his Doctrine, and way
of living. And so did the Holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
with respect to Christ, and though
<hi>Judas</hi> proved a Devil, and an Apostate
afterward; yet at first, without all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure,
he shew'd the same Zeal that
the rest did, and was true to his Master's
interest: These Twelve Christ chose as
Patriarchs of the Christian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
in imitation of the Twelve Sons
of <hi>Jacob,</hi> which were the Pillars, and
Foundation of the Jewish Republick,
and these Apostles trod exactly in their
Master's Steps (the Son of Perdition ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
and therefore call'd Disciples.</p>
            <p>2. Not only these Twelve, who were
Christ's Domesticks were call'd so, but
all such of the Multitude, that believ'd
in the Great Jesus, and took him for the
Messiah, or Saviour of the World; for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108689:41"/>
to such also, the Name of Disciples is
given, <hi>Luke</hi> VI. 13. <hi>Acts</hi> IX. 26. <hi>Acts</hi>
XI. 26. <hi>John</hi> VI. So that all, that have
given their Names to Christ Jesus, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
themselves to the Rules of his
Discipline, and profess his Religion, are
concern'd in this Sermon; <hi>Every one
that names the Name of Christ:</hi> The Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
here given reach all such, whether
high or low, whether Princes, or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
whether rich or poor, whether
Nobles, or Peasants. Christ in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Sermon lays down one way for
all, nor must any Man be so foolish, as
to hope to be excused from the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the following Commands, upon
the Account of his Rank, and Condition;
and as impossible as the Practice of some
of the following Precepts, particularly
that of forbearing private Revenge, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good to them that hate them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
may seem to Gentlemen, and Persons of
Quality; yet Christ considered Men
here not as Gentlemen, or Noblemen,
but as Christians; if Christians, they
must be his Servants; if Servants, they
must do what their Master bids them
do; if not, the bare Name will never
save them.</p>

               <head>Inferences.</head>
               <p>1. Christ seeing the Multitudes, and
touch'd with compassion to their Souls,
went up into a Mountain to teach them.
A Man in whom the Spirit of Christ is,
cannot but be touch'd with the same
compassion to behold the great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of People, that go astray from the
way to Salvation: Ah! how many
Thousands do we see ride Post to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Misery! It's true, all the Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
in the World cannot make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
so much; but so it is, and if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
such and such Qualifications, there
is no inheriting the Kingdom of God,
what must we think of so many Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who never have so much, as a sad,
or melancholy Thought about these
Qualifications; and is not this making
haste to be miserable? And can a Man,
that hath a Sense of the Veracity of
God in the Gospel, behold such Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
without being griev'd, or concern'd,
or venting some charitable Wishes, that
he might be instrumental in their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation?
But as I said, to do so, a Man
must have the Spirit of Christ; to be
touch'd with the Temporal Misfortunes,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108689:42"/>
and Calamities of Men; a Man needs no
more, than common and natural Pity.
So the Persian Monarch fell a weeping,
when from a Hill he beheld his well
disciplin'd Army, to think, that in less
than a hundred Years, all these brave
Men would be dead, and gone; but to
be touch'd with the everlasting Misery
of Men's immortal Souls, there must
be an Illumination from above, and the
Spirit of Christ, and a deep Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that must affect the Heart with a
profound Sense of it. A Soul taken up
with the World, and the Pleasures of it,
is unconcern'd, who perishes, or who is
saved.</p>
               <p>But he that understands what Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
means, and labours hard after it
himself, and understands, that the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of the Gospel are no Bug-bears,
but very real things; cannot but spend
many a sad Thought about a concern of
that consequence. And, oh! that there
were such a Heart; not only in all the
Ministers of the Gospel, but in other
private Men, even in you all, and that
in your actual Endeavours to reclaim
your wicked Neighbours; you might
discover the concern you have for their
spiritual and everlasting Welfare! If the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108689:43"/>
World did not grow better under this
Attempt, your own Souls however
would grow in Grace, and in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>2. The Multitude came to hear
Christ, so do you at this Day. It's true,
you cannot hear Christ in Person, but
you hear him in his Messengers, of whom
he hath said; <hi>He that heareth you, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
me:</hi> Take heed therefore, how you
hear; Faith comes by hearing; but if
you hear, and for all that hearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not, your hearing will aggravate
your Condemnation. It's true, you do
believe, but it is after the common
Rate. By believing, I mean, obeying,
which is the true Scripture Notion of
believing how you are to hear; the
<hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> hath taught you by her
Example; for hearing the wonderfull
things spoken of her Son, it is said, she
kept them, and <hi>ponder'd them in her
heart,</hi> Luke II. 19. This is true hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to ponder in our Minds what we
hear, to ponder the reasonableness of
the things which are spoken to us in the
Name of the Lord, to ponder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of them; and what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of us if we neglect things of that
importance, and to rouze our selves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108689:43"/>
to suitable Actions? Actions, that may
bear witness of our deep Sense of our
danger, and that we are really concern'd
about our everlasting State; and that
our resolutions are strong, and invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to secure God's Love. Such men
as they hear, so they shall see in the
City of our God. They hear of very
glorious things in the Mansions Christ
is gone to prepare for all his true Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and their Eyes shall see them, and
they shall see more than their Ears did
hear, and look so long upon the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Objects, till their sight is turned
into Ravishment and Extasie.</p>
               <p>3. The Multitude came to Christ to
be healed. So do you at this day come
to the Ministers of the Gospel, I hope,
with the same intent. It's true, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
cure the Dropsie, and Stone, and
Gout, and Strangury, and such other
Diseases of the Body. But we can cure
Diseases in your Souls which are very
like the Distempers, I just now spoke
of; the Tympany of Pride, the Fever
of Lust, the Dropsie of Covetousness,
the Leprosie of Sensuality, the Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Envy, and the Stone in the
Heart, &amp;c. When, I say, we can cure all
these, the meaning is not by our own
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108689:44"/>
strength and power, but by prescribing
such Remedies and Medicines; which if
you will but take you will recover in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly.
Infallible Medicines, I know,
are matter of sport among Men; but
here we may talk (for we have God on
our side) of infallible Remedies very
seriously. <hi>Cicero</hi> wonders, since Man
consists of Soul and Body, that the
Cure of the Body should be so industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
sought after, and admired; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that they are not ashamed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
<hi>Aesculapius</hi> into the Number of the
Gods, but few or none touble their
Heads about curing their Souls; but
the Wonder will soon cease, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that Men feel the Diseases of their
Bodies, but have no sense of the Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of their Souls; and indeed, how
should they feel them when they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their sins with Names of Vertue,
and Titles of Innocence; their Luxury,
by generosity; their being ashamed of
the Gospel of Christ, by modesty; their
breaking their most solemn Vows and
Promises, by weakness and infirmity;
their notorious mispending their time,
and extravagance in their Speeches,
Dresses, and Behaviour, by Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
their Covetousness, by discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108689:44"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To be cured of your Sins, which
are the Diseases of your Souls, the first
thing to be done, is to take off the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zour
from them, to abjure the false
Glosses, and to renounce the soft Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations,
you put upon them. And
yet after all one cannot but wonder, that
at this time of day there should be so
many Souls sick. Is there no Balm in
<hi>Gilead?</hi> Are there no Physicians there?
Yes, yes; There is Balm in <hi>Gilead,</hi> there
are Physicians, and very faithfull ones.
But, <hi>O</hi> Jerusalem, Jerusalem! <hi>How often
would I have gather'd thy Children, as a
Hen doth gather her Chickens, and you
would not.</hi> Ay! that's the dreadfull
Cause, why so many of you are sick,
and sick to death, and find no cure.
There are excellent Medicines given,
there are admirable Remedies prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
but like untowardly Patients you
will not make use of the Physick that's
administred to you, and thus you pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
and thus you are undone. But,</p>
               <p>4. St. <hi>Luke</hi> takes notice, that when
Christ intended to deliver this Sermon,
he was a whole Night before engaged in
Prayer to God. Surely this was to
teach us not to attempt or begin any
thing of Concernment without Prayer.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108689:45"/>
This is to be observed both in rellgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and civil matters. Even before you
go to Prayer, send up some short E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaculations
in your mind to God, to
give you Hearts to pray, and Power and
Wisdom, to offer to him the desires of
your Hearts. Before you read a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Bible, beg of God to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
your Minds, and to work upon
your Wills, that you may chearfully do
what he requires of you in his Word,
and to bestow spiritual Wisdom upon
you, that you may understand what
you read. Before you go to Church
beg of him to give you attentive
Minds, sober Thoughts, and a great
sense of his Presence in the Assembly
of the Saints. Before you begin a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Fast, beg of him to quicken your
Hearts, to raise your Devotion, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
you with humble thoughts, and to
accept of your Humiliation, and teach
you to perform it so, that it may be
acceptable in his sight: This Rule is to
be observed in all other religious Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises;
and not only there, but in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Concerns of your Lives. Custom
hath made it fashionable before you eat,
and drink. Let Religion, and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
oblige you to use it, in, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108689:45"/>
all your other lawfull worldly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns:
Before you go about your law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
business, let it be your earnest
Prayer to God to bless you with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
if it be for his Glory, and your
own good, and withall to furnish you
with that even Temper of Mind, that
your obtaining your Desires may not
swell, or lift you up, nor your miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ying
in your Attempts deject, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirit
you. This is the way to sanctifie
all your Actions, and to preserve the
Spirit of Religion: For want of this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Wisdom, you fall too often into
great Anxieties of Mind, and very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
Passions, when you miss of your
prey. Prayer will quiet your Spirits.
This is conversing with God; and
while a great and glorious God is the
Object of our Thoughts, we are arm'd
against immoderate Sorrow; can tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over Losses; find comfort in our
Disappointments; learn to despise the
World, and encourage our selves to set
our Affections on the things which are
above.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>HAving resolv'd upon an Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ's Sermon on the
Mount, and begun already with the first
Verse; I proceed this Day to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
which is part of the Evangelist's
Preface or Introduction; and though
this Passage as well, as the preceeding, is
purely Historical, yet it affords very
usefull Lessons and Instructions: Of this
I have already given a <hi>Specimen</hi> or Proof
in the first, and do not doubt but I shall
make good the Assertion in the Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the second. <hi>And he opened his
Mouth, and taught them, saying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the understanding of which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
you must know, that this Phrase
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108689:46"/>
               <hi>opening the Mouth,</hi> is used in Scriprure,
when the Oratour or Speaker intends to
speak something great, and weighty,
and of mighty Importance. To this
purpose it is, that when <hi>David</hi> was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to rehearse the wonderfull Works and
Providences of God toward the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Israel,</hi> he thus begins. <hi>Give ear,
O my People, to my Law; and incline your
Ears to the word of my Mouth. I will
open my Mouth in a Parable,</hi> Ps. LXXVIII.
1, 2. so Ps. XLIX. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Hear this
all ye People, give ear all ye Inhabitants
of the World: Both low and high, rich
and poor together. My mouth shall speak
of wisdom, and the meditation of my
heart shall be of understanding. I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
mine Ear to a Parable, I will open
my dark saying upon the Harp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that this word, and <hi>he open'd his
Mouth,</hi> bespeaks the Attention of all
considerate Men, and imports that the
Lord of Preachers is going to publish
things of the greast Consequence,
things of that Concernment, that a
Soul that hath any Sense of a future
Salvation, is bound to listen to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
and not to do it is as much as
our life is worth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:108689:47"/>
To be sure, the Son of God would
not spend his sacred Breath in vain:
There never dropt any thing from his
Mouth but what was grave, and serious;
and being to teach the whole World, as
it were, the way to Bliss; we may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that matters relating to that Bliss
are things of greater Concernment,
than all the Intrigues of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> or
any Politician in the World.</p>
            <p>And therefore it will be neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitable
to Christ's design in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
nor any way injurious to the
Context, or Connexion of these Words,
with the following; To take notice
here,</p>
            <p>That <hi>Matters relating to the Bliss and
Happiness of men's Souls, are matters of
the greatest weight and moment.</hi> For, of
these Christ is going to speak here in
the following Discourse; and in order
thereunto, it's said, <hi>And he opened his
Mouth;</hi> which, as it hath been already
hinted, imports uttering things of more
than ordinary Consequence.</p>
            <p>To be happy, is that which most men
seem to endeavour after; for this the
Souldier takes the Field, and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
plows the Sea; for this the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
dresses his Ground, and the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108689:47"/>
Artificer sits up late, and rises early, and
puts himself into a sweat; for this the
Man of an Estate applies himself to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Sports, and others run out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
monstrous Sins and Vices. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as Men fancy happiness, one in
one thing, another in another, so they
follow hard after it, and pursue it with
very great Eagerness.</p>
            <p>Thus all desire to be happy, though
the greater part mistake Pebbles for
Pearls, and the Meat which perisheth
for that which endures to everlasting
Life. And yet all this does not make
true Happiness a matter of fancy only;
for though the generality act as if it
were so, yet it is not; and there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Laws, and measures of real Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which like the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi>
and <hi>Persians,</hi> alter not: Men's mistaking
the true Object of their Happiness, shews
indeed their Nature is corrupted, and
their Understandings vitiated; but is no
Argument, that there is no true standard
of solid Happiness, no more than a blind
Man's missing of the Mark, proves there
is none to shoot at.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be call'd true Bliss with
respect to Man, but what makes the
Soul happy; for that being the great
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108689:48"/>
Agent, that moves, and orders, and rules,
and actuates the Body, it must needs be
infinitely nobler than the Body; and
consequently, if the nobler Part be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of its proper Happiness, all the
other Felicity the Body shares in, must
be nothing but shew and vanish.</p>
            <p>This Happiness peculiar to the Soul,
cannot possibly consist in living, or in
having and enjoying Life; for Plants, and
Trees, and Herbs do that, as well as the
most Godlike, and Angelical Spirits;
nor can it consist in smelling, or tasting,
or seeing, or hearing, or feeling, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Objects, or in eating and drinking,
or in gratifying a sensual Appetite; for
that Brutes can do as well as we, nay
better. The Soul as it doth surmount
all vegetable, and sensitive Creatures in
dignity and excellency, so its Bliss must
necessarily exceed theirs, and it must be
a Bliss that's adaequate, and suitable to
her Nature, which being rational, it
must necessarily follow, that the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Soul consists in living up to
the Dictates, and Principles of right
Reason.</p>
            <p>But because Reason through the Fall
of <hi>Adam,</hi> is become dull and dim-fighted,
and hath lost much of its Beauty and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108689:48"/>
Splendour, God hath thought fit by the
Revelation of his Will, and Word, to
polish and brighten these Principles, that
we might not mistake in this reasonable
Service; and Christ particularly in this
Sermon on the Mount, hath set Reason
on its Throne again, and specified the
true Principles of it, shewing how and
in what manner we are to live up to
these Principles.</p>
            <p>In this consists the happiness of the
Soul, while it sojourns in this World;
and this fits and qualifies her for a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
more lasting, and more glorious
Happiness hereafter.</p>
            <p>And that matter relating to this Bliss
and Happiness of the Soul, are matters
of the greatest moment and consequence,
will appear from the following Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p>1. Name me any one Concern in the
whole World that is so great, or of that
Moment. The Prosperity of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is a great Concern, but you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reap half the Comfort, and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from that Prosperity, which you
can do from the Bliss and Happiness of
your Souls. The welfare of a Family is
a great Concern, but the bliss of your
Souls is much greater; for the want of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108689:49"/>
the former may be sweetned by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but the want of the other can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be excused, or qualified by all the
Logick in the World. Health is a great
Concern, but the bliss of your Souls is
greater; the former makes you robust,
and fit to bear Burthens, but the latter
enables you to conquer Sin, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Temptations, and to vanquish
Lusts, and vain Desires. A livelihood
or competency in the World is a great
Concern, but the bliss of your Souls is
greater. The former indeed may give
you credit, and reputation among your
Neighbours; but the other is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to God and his holy Angels, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and honour you. A good Name
is a great Concern, but the bliss of your
Souls is greater; for if you be deprived
of the former, you are still in a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of being loved of God, and enjoying
the light of his Favour, but wanting
the other; God can have no kind
thoughts, no favourable inclinations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you.</p>
            <p>2. Matters which concern the bliss
and happiness of your Souls relate to
Eternity, and therefore must needs be
the weightiest Concern; whatever is in
this World fades, perishes, and dies.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108689:49"/>
Nothing is firm, or stable, or perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent;
and therefore, what lasts but for
a few moments, cannot be comparable
in Excellency to that which lasts for
ever. The happiness we speak of hath
indeed a beginning, but knows no end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
it is a Bliss which doth not fade
with your Death, nor expire when the
Breath goes out of your Nostrils; but
a happiness which as the end of your
days, qualifies you for the embraces of
Angels, and these deliver you into the
Arms, and Care, and Protection of an
Omnipotent God, who will love you
with an everlasting Love; and, whereas
your Comforts here were in the Nature
of dim-burning Candles, he'll increase
that shine into a light equal to that of
the Sun, and the light of that Sun he
will multiply seven times, and make it
as the light of the seven days in the
first Creation. <hi>The things which are seen
are all Temporal,</hi> saith the Apostle,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> IV. 18. <hi>but the things which are
not seen,</hi> and such are our Souls, and
the Bliss they are design'd for, they are
<hi>Etergal;</hi> and then it is soon decided
which are the weightiest Concerns, the
Temporal or Eternal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:108689:50"/>
3. The very Heathen have look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the things belonging to the Bliss of
their Souls, as things of the greatest
moment. It is enough to astonish the
considerate Reader, what Pagans and
Infidels have done for their Bliss, more
than they would have done for Father
and Mother, for Brethren and Sisters,
for Wife and Children, for Women and
Concubines. It's granted, that with all
this, they have retain'd their customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Sins, and Vices; yet the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Acts of Justice, and Revenge,
or Cruelty rather, they have sometimes
inflicted upon themselves, Punishments
they would not have undergone for the
dearest Friends they had, sufficiently
shew in what esteem the things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Bliss of their Souls were with
them. Time was when they sacrificed
their dearest Children unto <hi>Moloch,</hi> and
caus'd their Sons and Daughters to pass
through the Fire to the Honour of that
God, or Devil: And at this day in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan</hi>
and <hi>China,</hi> some starving themselves
to Death, others shutting themselves up
in Caves and Dens, and receiving Air
thro' some hollow Canes or Pipes; others
charging themselves with heavy Iron-Chains,
others putting themselves to most
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108689:50"/>
uneasie and tormenting Postures, and
continuing in them a considerable time,
and all this for the Bliss of their Souls;
is an Argument, that they look upon
the Concerns relating to the Bliss of
their Souls, as Concerns of the greatest
weight and moment.</p>
            <p>4. The wisest Men in all Ages have
thought so: Who wiser than <hi>Solomon?</hi>
He hath God's own Testimony, that
none was so wise before him, and none
should be so wise after him. It's true,
in his Old-age be plaid the fool, but
while his Wisdom was vigorous, and in
its Prime and Glory, he was fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that these Concerns were of the
greatest Importance, and made it his
business to draw others into the same
Belief; and what is the Book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi>
and the other of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> but a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of this Truth. Nay, men
of all Conditions have been of this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
how different soever in other
matters. If Divines and Preachers of the
Word only, had spread this Doctrine,
the profaner Sort would have imagin'd
that it was Interest, which made us cry
up these Concerns, as the weightiest of
all; but men of divers Callings, Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Professions have judg'd so;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108689:51"/>
               <hi>David</hi> a King, <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> a Governour
of a Province, <hi>Cornelius</hi> a Captain, the
<hi>Souldiers</hi> that addressed themselves to
<hi>John</hi> the Baptist, <hi>Zenas</hi> a Lawyer, <hi>Luke</hi>
a Physician, <hi>Lydia</hi> a Purple-seller, <hi>Simon</hi>
a Tanner, <hi>Stephanas</hi> a Jaylour, <hi>Aquila</hi>
and <hi>Priscilla</hi> Tent-makers, <hi>Zachaeus</hi> a
Publican, <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a Ruler, <hi>Joseph</hi> a
Rich man, <hi>Lazarus</hi> a Beggar; and when
Men of various Professions do all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr
in this Assertion, their Testimony
deserves to be valued.</p>
            <p>5. Even wicked Men either in some
great Affliction, or upon their Death-beds,
do look upon the things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Bliss of their Souls as the
greatest; and their Testimony is the
more considerable, because it is press'd
and forc'd out of them as it were. Take
them in their natural bent and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or in their Prosperity, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
nothing less than this, but at such
times by a secret instinct, or strong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse
which they are not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
they are compell'd to acknowledge
so much. A wicked Man ordinarily is
a profess'd Enemy of this Truth, <hi>viz.</hi>
that the Concerns relating to the Bliss
of his Soul are of any great importance,
for he labours hard, and doth what he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108689:51"/>
can to ruine the Happiness of his Soul;
but upon a Sick-bed or Death-bed, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he is not able to smother this
Truth; and now you hear him cry out,
<hi>O how have I hated Instruction! how hath
my Heart despised Reproof! O that I had
obeyed the Voice of my Teachers! O that
I had inclined mine Ear to instruction! O
wretched Man, that I am, who shall deliver
me from the Body of this Death! Now he
would give all he is worth for the Bliss
of his Soul.</hi> This was the Sense of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh,</hi>
when the Iron enter'd into his
Soul. This was the Judgment of the
Prodigal, when he was denied so much
as the Husks that the Swine did feed on;
this is the Sentiment of thousands, and
thousands, whose Eyes do not open till
approaching Death doth clear them, and
the Testimony of an Enemy is sometimes
very considerable. But,</p>
            <p>6. What matter is it what Men think.
God surely cannot be mistaken, and he
is intirely of this mind: <hi>For what shall
it profit a Man, if he gain the whole World
and lose his own Soul, or what shall a
Man give in exchange for his Soul,</hi> saith
Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> XVI. 24. a known place,
a place most Children can repeat, a place
often quoted in Sermons; but where are
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108689:52"/>
the Persons that are concern'd at it, I
mean concern'd like Men that are in
danger of losing so great a Treasure?
When a Man is in danger of losing an
Estate, or a few Acres of Land, or his
good Name, or his Goods: How pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
how melancholy doth he grow!
His mirth all flies away, and how doth
he storm and fret, and rage sometime!
This very Man many times is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of losing his Soul, yet he is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and chearfull, and sings and dances,
and one would think nothing ails him.
Notwithstanding all this, the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God stands sure; and God having
affirm'd, and pronounc'd, that the gain
of the whole World cannot counterbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
the loss of one Soul: The matters
relating to the Bliss and Happiness of
our Souls, must needs be the greatest
and weightiest Concerns imaginable.</p>
            <p>I might easily enlarge upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
but it's needless. Your understandings
are commonly better than your Wills and
Affections; and being sensible that it is
a greater and nobler Work to prevail
with the latter, than to convince the
former; give me leave to turn these As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions
into a serious Expostulation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:108689:52"/>
1. Are the things belonging to the
Bliss and Happiness of your Souls the
greatest Concerns of all; how is it that
they are minded no more than they are?
How are they the greatest when they
are regarded least of all? How the
weightiest when a Trifle is preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them? What doth it signify to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
so much when your Actions give
your Mouths the lye? And do not you
expose your selves to the laughter of all
judicious Men, when your Practices do
so manifestly contradict your Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
How will you answer this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the last Day? How can you
hope to come off, when the Judge shall
argue with you from this Topick? Did
you really look upon the Concerns re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the Bliss of your Souls, as the
greatest, how could you be so indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
as to knowing whether your Souls
are in a State of Bliss, or not? How
could you forbear examining your selves
by the Rules laid down by Christ in this
Sermon, whether Happiness is like to
be the Portion of your Souls at last, or
not? Can it be safe to take it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that your Souls are in a blessed
State, when a mistake in this matter is
the most dangerous thing in the World?
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108689:53"/>
What satisfaction can it be to you to
believe at random, that all is well, when
that very Confidence is an Argument
that the Foundation is rotten, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound?
If you do in good earnest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
these Concerns to be of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
importance, I will tell you what
the Effects will be, and to avoid Prolixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I shall only name them.</p>
            <p>1. Your thoughts will be much em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
about them, you will certainly
find time to think of them, and all the
little Excuses, that you have a Trade and
Business, and a Family to look after will
be laid aside, for all this you may do
in a moderate way, and yet make these
weighty Concerns the frequent Objects
of your serious Thoughts. What? Are
these the greatest Concerns and doth it
not deserve one sober reflection, have I
Soul that is immortal? Is this Soul ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of being either happy or miserable?
Is there a way to make it happy? What
is that way? Where shall I find it? If
God hath revealed it in his word, is it
not worth enquiring or searching into
it? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. In your lawfull Callings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
you will be very cautious
of doing any thing that shall hurt or
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108689:53"/>
spoil, or prejudice the Bliss and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of your Souls, as all sins against
Knowledge, and all wilfull sins will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
do.</p>
            <p>3. You will take care that the Briars
and Thorns of the World, I mean, the
Riches, the Cares, the Pleasures of this
Life do not choak your Care and Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude
about this Bliss of your Souls,
and to this end you will avoid burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your selves with over-much Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which will engross your Care, and
Thoughts, and Time, and drown the
other.</p>
            <p>4. You will not content your selves
with general Notions of this Bliss, but
you'll go deeper, and descend to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
and examine the special Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
that must make your Souls truly
happy, and which are described in this
admirable Sermon of our Saviour, and
take them into consideration.</p>
            <p>5. You will pray hard, and with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and importunity to be strengthen'd
from above, in order to a chearfull Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of the Rules specified in this
Sermon.</p>
            <p>6. If at any time you find that you
grow dull and lazy in the conscientious
observance, and performance of these
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108689:54"/>
particulars, you will rouze your selves
by fresh Arguments into your first love;
and if at any time surpriz'd by a strong
Temptation, you neglect any Lesson
injoin'd here, you will chide and check,
and force your selves into a more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
watchfulness and diligence.</p>
            <p>7. You will not neglect the proper
means, whereby this Bliss of your Souls
must be promoted, one of which is the
frequent and conscientious use of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Lord's Supper; for here
you see how dear your Souls were to the
Son of God, what he did for them to
make them happy, how he laid down
his Life to procure their Life and Bliss,
and can there be a greater motive to
prosecute the Bliss of your immortal
Souls?</p>
            <p>These will certainly be the effects of
your Belief, <hi>i. e.</hi> if from your Heart you
believe, that the Concerns relating to
the Bliss and Happiness of your Souls,
are the greatest and weightiest Concerns;
if these effects appear not, it's plain,
you do not look upon these Concerns as
things of the greatest importance, and
consequently you are unfit for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:108689:54"/>
2. As Christ open'd his mouth and
taught the People; so the Ministers of
the Gospel after their Great Master's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
are to read and learn their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for they are sent by Christ to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
his place on Earth to the end of the
World. Teaching is their Business, not
only with their Lips, but with their
Lives. Their lives must be visible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon the word they publish; and
as one said, they must be like <hi>Gideon</hi>'s
Souldiers, carry Trumpets of sound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
in one Hand, and Lamps of good
Lives in the other. A Minister whose
Life contradicts his Preaching, is one of
the worst Men in the World, and makes
himself Two-fold more the Child of
Hell than his Hearers, that imitate his
ill Example; and if there be one place
hotter than another in the burning Lake,
that will be his Portion.</p>
            <p>As Christ taught his Hearers nothing
but what was grave and solid, and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
so the Ministers of the Word must
feed their Auditours with solid Food,
not with Trifles, or Legends, or dry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipid
Stuff, but with things that may
make them wise unto Salvation.</p>
            <p>This Phrase, <hi>opening the mouth,</hi> is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
used in Scripture, for speaking
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108689:55"/>
with boldness and courage in the Name
of the Lord, as <hi>Ephes.</hi> VI. 19. Pray for
me, <hi>that I may open my mouth boldly;</hi> So
the Ministers of the Word must not be
meally-mouth'd, but <hi>Cry aloud, and spare
not, lift up their Voices like Trumpets, and
shew the People of God their Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and the House of</hi> Jacob <hi>their Sins,</hi>
Isa. LVIII. 1. There is no dallying with
the sins of Men, no complementing
their Souls with flattering and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing
Words. Their Sores must be
rubb'd, and Salt and Vinegar thrown
into their Wounds where it is so that
gentler means will do no good: Nor
must we fear the anger, or displeasure
of Men, for we have a greater Master
to please, who will bring forth our
Righteousness as the light, and our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as the Noon-day; nay, and make
our very Enemies to be at peace with
us; however, if he doth not, there is
huge comfort in the discharge of a good
Conscience, to which purpose Christ
bids his Messengers, or Ministers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
when they are reviled, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spightfully
used; and accordingly of
the Apostles we read, <hi>That they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the Council rejoycing, because
they were counted worthy to suffer shame
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108689:55"/>
for the Name of the Lord Jesus,</hi> Acts
V. 41.</p>
            <p>3. As it is our Office to teach you,
so it is your Duty to be taught; I say,
to be taught not to quarrel with our
Admonitions, to shew your selves tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable,
to suffer the Word of exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to admit the good Seed we sow,
into a good and honest Heart. It's true,
you are not to be believe every Spirit, but
to try the Spirits, whether they be of
God, 1 <hi>John</hi> V. 1.</p>
            <p>But then, when you have try'd our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and find them agreeable to the
Word of the living God, there is no
Tergiversation to be used, but our words
must be receiv'd, as if God himself
spoke to you; for we press no other
things upon you, than God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
you in the Scriptures. These
Scriptures you have in your Hands, and
with the <hi>Beraeans</hi> you are exhorted to
search whether things are so, as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
them.</p>
            <p>What a sad thing is it in Popery; not
one of the common People, not a
Lay-man dares bring a Bible to Church
with him; if he doth, he is no good
Catholick; nay, in some Countries in
danger of being burnt for a Heretick. A

               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:108689:57"/>
good Catholick must have no Bible,
must not read it, must not meddle with
it, it's a dangerous Book, he must not
look into it, for fear he should learn
Heresie there; or rather, for fear he
should discover how he hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
by the Priests, and taught for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
the Commandments of Men.</p>
            <p>See here the mighty advantages the
Reformation hath brought to you: You
can come to Church with your Bibles
under your Arms, and have not only
leave, but are entreated to compare
what we say with the Oracles of God,
to satisfie your selves of the Truth of
what we deliver, and to believe your
own Eyes. But then, as I said, having
found that our Exhortations and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
are according to the Law, and to
the Testimony; let it not be said of
you, as it was of <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Hearers,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> XXXIII. 31. <hi>They came and sat
before the Prophet, they heard his words,
but they would not do them; with their
Mouths they shew'd much love, but their
hearts went after Covetousness.</hi> What a
happiness doth that Minister enjoy,
that can say of his Disciples, as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
of the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> 2 Thess. 1. 3. <hi>We
are bound to give thanks to God always for
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108689:57"/>
you, as it is meet, because your Faith
grows exceedingly, and the Charity of you
all toward each other abounds.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Admonition, <hi>Heb.</hi>
XIII. 17. <hi>Obey them that have the Rule
over you, and submit your selves, for they
watch for your Souls, as they that must
give an account, that they may do it with
Joy, and not with Grief; for that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
for you.</hi>

Verses; we go on to the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
And here a very glorious Scene
opens; a Scene of admirable Truths, of
Truths which are Paradoxes, to persons
who rise no higher than the Animal
life, perfect Mysteries, which the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of this World know not, which the
Great understand not, and which the
sensual part of Mankind are ready to
laugh at, and which none but a think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or thoughtfull Person can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:108689:58"/>
As the inspired <hi>David,</hi> or whoever
was the Collectour of the Psalms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
that Volume with the way to Bliss,
so our Saviour begins his Sermon with
the same Subject. Indeed, this was his
peculiar Province, and of the weighty
and momentous Errands he was sent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
this was one, to teach Men the
true way to Bliss endless and eternal.
<hi>Moses</hi> had done it before, the Prophets
had attempted the like, Philosophers
had made some Essays of that kind, but
their Notions were imperfect, and they
had no distinct notices of all the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
necessary and convenient for that
excellent Structure; and there was a
Providence in it, because the fuller Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of God's Will was reserv'd to
the coming of the Messiah, or the Son
of God: And it is remarkable that Christ
in his Directions, how to attain to solid
Bliss runs counter to the World; and
such as are commonly counted the
most wretched and miserable, are here
pronounc'd blessed. It's like some that
were by when Christ deliver'd this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
expected he should have begun
in another strain, such as Blessed are the
Rich, and the Men whose Barns are
large, and who have much Goods laid

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108689:59"/>
up for many Years, who have Money
at command, can eat what they list,
and drink what they please, whose
Lands bring forth plentifully, and whose
Presses run over, who are courted and
respected by all that know them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
great or low, and are in a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of denying themselves in nothing
that their fond Appetite craves. <hi>But
my thoughts are not as your thoughts,</hi> saith
God: He takes other Measures, and
therefore Blessedness is here ascribed to
Persons, where a Man would least ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
or expect to find it, even to the
poor in Spirit. <hi>Blessed are the poor in
spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three things do here very naturally
offer themselves to our Consideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> Who the poor in Spirit are, or what
poverty in Spirit is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>II.</hi> In what sense the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is theirs, and belongs to them. <hi>And,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>III.</hi> How their Title to this Kingdom
makes them blessed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> What poverty in Spirit is. <hi>And
here negatively, it is not,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:108689:59"/>
1. A bare outward Poverty, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
destitute of the Necessaries and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
of this Life; not a Poverty
in Purse, not a worldly Poverty, not a
State of Beggery. We do not deny
but Poverty hath great advantages, with
respect to being good, and the poor
Man is more expedite in his Journey to
Heaven; for he hath none of those
Clogs, none of those Briars and Thorns,
which too often hinder the Richer sort
of Men from discerning or prosecuting
their everlasting Happiness. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the Heathen Philosophers saw,<note place="margin">Vid. Grot in Loc.</note>
who therefore spoke a Thousand pretty
things concerning Poverty; what a help
it was to Virtue, what a means to become
truly wise, what an Advantage to arrive
to solid goodness? Nay, some went so far
as to abandon their Riches, and throw
their Gold and Silver into the Sea, that
they might be more at leisure to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
their Minds, and to enrich their
better Part.</p>
            <p>And indeed, Our Saviour seems very
much to favour this Condition; and
there are so many things spoken against
Riches, and rich Men in the Gospel, as
are enough to make Men that enjoy
any Plenty or Prosperity afraid, for fear
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108689:60"/>
their Reward should be with Men, who
have their Portion in this Life; and it
is to be noted, that Christ says a very
great thing concerning this state of
Poverty. <hi>To the Poor the Gospel is
preach'd,</hi> and this he reckons among
the Miracles he wrought to prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the promis'd Messiah, or Redeemet
of the World. It is <hi>Matth.</hi> XI. 5. <hi>The
blind receive their sight, the lame walk,
the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the
dead are rais'd up, and the poor have the
Gospel preach'd unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The poor!</hi> It must be confess'd our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
did not go to Court, nor did he
associate himself much with Rich men,
except they were of a better Temper
than ordinary, and he seem'd to be the
poor Men's Preacher, as if he thought
the Rich were not capable of receiving
his stricter Discipline, and as if the Poor
were the most likely Persons to espouse
his severer Doctrines. Carnal reason
would have thought, that when Christ
appear'd first on the Stage of the World,
he should have made his first Addresses
to the Grandees of <hi>Judaea,</hi> and Men of
Estate and Fortune: But no, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
was chiefly with poor Fisher-men,
and the needy Multitude; and here lay
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108689:60"/>
the Miracle, and the Reason of it we may
guess at, <hi>viz.</hi> to shew, that the Poor are
in a greater Capacity of listening to his
Oracles, than the Rich, who have so
many things to divert them from the
way to Eternal Bliss; so much Business
and Pleasure to mind here on Earth, that
they are not at leisure to think of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>And yet, notwithstanding all this, a
bare outward Poverty doth not entitle
a Man to the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>It's a great help to Seriousness, if san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
and improved; and the want of
Comforts here on Earth, be made a
motive to seek them in Heaven; but
the bare outward want doth not make
Men happy; for we see too often, that
the poorer Men are, the wickeder they
are, and their outward want makes them
more daring in Impiety; and surely,
this can be no qualification for Eternal
Bliss.</p>
            <p>The Punctilio's of State, which the
Richer sort of Men think themselves
obliged to observe, the Luxury they are
apt to run into, the pampering of their
Bodies, their pride in Cloaths and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Habits, their sinfull compliances
with Persons of their Rank and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108689:61"/>
their Care to encrease their Riches,
to get an Estate suitable to the figure
they make in the World, their ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
oppressions, and domineering over
the meaner sort, and their study to keep
up their Credit with the Great and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
all which too often are very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
imediments in the Richer sort to
be truly wise to Salvation; These the
poor Man is freed from, nor hath he so
great an Account to give, there being
but little given him, and consequently,
is in a greater Capacity, and possibility
of being wise, and good, and happy;
but his bare outward Poverty will not
do the Work, and therefore is not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
here. Nor,</p>
            <p>2. A vowed voluntary Poverty. This
some Champions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
contend for, as if their Monastick vows
were commended here. Even a Poverty
whereby Men and Women do volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
renounce their Estates and Riches,
and bestow them either upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
or the Poor, or the Church;
and thereupon entring into a Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or Nunnery, Vow perpetual Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Chastity, and blind Obedience; and
this they make a piece of Evangelical
perfection, which all Men are not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108689:61"/>
to, but such as some Persons do vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
undertake to encrease their own
Merits, and sometime to merit for others
too.</p>
            <p>But certainly this cannot be the sense
here; for the Poverty here mention'd,
is represented as a Duty incumbent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Men, and without which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
will certainly miss of a future Bliss;
for thus saith Christ in the Conclusion
of this Sermon; <hi>Whosoever heareth these
sayings of mine, and doth them not, him
will I liken to a foolish Man, that built
his House upon the Sand, and when the
Rain descended,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We make do doubt of it, but that
God is pleased with Self-denials in our
Estates and Fortunes, if well-grounded,
and proceeding upon very good Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and we believe that such free Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings
are very acceptable to him,
and by his special Grace and Favour,
may encrease a Man's glory and felicity
in another World. A Man that hath a
thousand Pound a Year, and resolves to
live upon two or three Hundred, and to
consecrate the rest to pious Uses; or
whatever a man's Income is, greater or
lesser, if he religiously confines himself
to a small Pittance, that he may be in a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108689:62"/>
greater capacity of doing good: We are
so far from discouraging such a Person,
that we commend and applaud him,
and believe the Love of God is strong
and vigorous in his Soul, and do no:
doubt, but he will be recompens'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
in the Resurrection of the
dead, provided this self-denial be not
intended as a way to satisfie God, or
to make him compensation and amends
for some sins, men are loath to part
with.</p>
            <p>But we cannot be so foolish as to
think, that by such self-denials a Man
merits any thing of God, or may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
a higher degree of Glory, as his
due for that savours of monstrous Pride,
and instead of exalting to, will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exclude the Soul from the Kingdom
of Heaven. And what need Men talk
of Merit, when they have a most boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
Master to deal with, who rewards
those that diligently seek him, beyond
what they are able to think, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press.
Nor can we be so sottish as to
think, that a Man who thus denies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
can spare some of his good Works,
or that the Vertue of them may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to others, who are either defective
in goodness, or suffer in Purgatory, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108689:62"/>
consequently such a Poverty cannot be
intended here.</p>
            <p>To quit therefore the Negative, and
to come to an Affirmative resolution of
this Point. By poverty in Spirit, is
meant, True CHRISTIAN HUMILI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY;
for we cannot suppose, that Christ
would here lay down the way to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life, and forget to press this darling
Vertue, and of all Accomplishments the
most amiable, and most charming, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the very Foundation of all saving
Religion; and since there is no formal
mention made of it in the ensuing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
we must necessarily referr it to
this place, and believe it to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in this Expression; the rather,
because nothing expresses this Christian
Humility better, than poverty in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p>A poor spirited Man, we know, is a
Coward, but such a poor Spirit could
never be design'd by Christ here, whose
intent was to enable all his Followers to
tread on Serpents and Scorpions, and to
trample on all the Powers of Darkness,
<hi>Luke</hi> X. 19. and they that do so, or
can do so, are sar from being Cowards;
so far, that nothing argues greater Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Magnanimity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:108689:63"/>
To represent to you the Nature of this
poverty in Spirit, or Christian Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I shall describe it in the following
Particulars.</p>
            <p>As Humility is nothing but a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
contempt of our selves; so this
felf-contempt imports,</p>
            <p>1. A lively Sense of God's Greatness,
Holiness and Goodness. That's it which
gives Humility being; that's it where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the sacred Fire is kindled. A lively
Sense of God's greatness, gives the Soul
a clear sight of her own nothingness; A
lively Sense of God's holiness, a clear
sight of her sinfulness, a lively Sense of his
goodness, and a clear view of her own
Unworthiness. The greater this Sense
is, the greater is the Humility; while
that Sense lasts, this Humility lasts
when that decays, this vanishes. This
lively Sense sows the seed of Humility
in the Soul, and makes it grow, and
advance into fruitfulness; it produces it
waters it, cherishes, and keeps it warm.
Where that Sense is very lively, the
Soul knows not how to lay low enough
before God. A lively Sense of God's
greatness makes <hi>Abraham</hi> cry out, <hi>I
have undertaken to speak to the God of
Heaven, who am but dust and ashes,</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:108689:63"/>
Gen. XVIII. 27. A lively Sense of God's
holiness makes <hi>Job</hi> fall down and say, <hi>I
ahhorr my self in dust and ashes,</hi> Job XLII 6.
A live Sense of God's goodness compels
<hi>Jacob</hi> to prostrate himself before God,
and forces him into this Ejaculation; <hi>I
am not worthy of the least of all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and of all the Truth which thou hast
shew'd unto thy Servant,</hi> Gen. XXXII 10.
And though I grant that all this may be
said, and is said daily by Hypocrites,
and Persons in whom Sin and the World
are predominant; yet it is not the bare
saying so that makes a Man humble,
but the Sense which dictates these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions.</p>
            <p>2. From hence flow very low and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicable
thoughts of our selves, not tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory
thoughts in the nature of flying
Sparks, once in a Month, or once in a
quarter of a Year, or once in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
Fit; but habitual, lowly
thoughts, which are constant Guests
with the Soul, and whereby the Soul
for the most part entertains a very low
or small opinion of her self; or worth,
or any thing that belongs to her; and
if any proud or arrogant thoughts arise,
presently pulls them down again, with
such considerations as these.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:108689:64"/>
What a poor contemptible Creature
am I? What have I, that I have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd?
My Body, what is it, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
of God's bounty? My Soul the work
of his hands; what Parts, what Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
what external Accommodations and
Conveniencies I have, they are Effects
of his liberality; what Gifts, what Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments,
what Perfections, what
Excellencies, what Graces, what Vertues
I have; what are they but the Products
of his undeserved Charity? Of my self,
what am I but a sinner, a Name which
must fill me with horrour, when I think
of it; a wretched Creature that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
the wrath and indignation of an
offended God, and the burning Lake!
a very poor inconsiderable thing, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an inconiderable nothing! And
shall so vile, so pitifull a thing, the sport
of Winds, and whose Life is a shadow,
a dream, and a vapour, be proud of any
thing? Who live upon Alms, and am
maintain'd by the pure Charity, and
Compassion of an Omnipotent God? Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain'd
by his breath, upheld by his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
cherish'd by his providence, subsisting
by his Will, and moving at his pleasure,
and a thing no better than a Tennis-ball
in his hand, which he may strike away,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108689:64"/>
and call for another. What? proud of
being in debt, and having a severer Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to give? For of this Nature are
all my Mercies, shew how much I am
indebted to God, and how great my
Account will be, when the Great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the World shall come and reckon
with his Servants! These are some of
the low and despicable thoughts the
humble Soul entertains, I <hi>Tim.</hi> I. 15.
And from hence flows,</p>
            <p>3. A hearty detestation and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
of self-conceitedness, self-admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and desire of vain-glory; so that if
the humble Soul at any time admits
vain imaginations, whereby she pleases
her self with what she hath done, as
her own Work, or let drop a Word,
which look'd like admiring her own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
or done any thing which
tended to raise her Credit, and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with Men, though it was but by a
side-wind, that she sailed to that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Port, she presently chides her self,
laments her weakness, cries out against
her folly, is angry with her inadverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and declares an everlasting War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all such sinister and preposterous
Purposes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> XI. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:108689:65"/>
4. From hence flows Humility to Men
too, and preferring others in honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our selves, according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and Character of Humility given,
<hi>Rom.</hi> XII. 10. Surely that Man cannot be
truly humble to God, that is not so to
Men; and in vain doth he talk of lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that shews no respect to his lawfull
Superiours and Magistrates; that will not
let abler and wiser Men speak, or sit, or
go before him; that cannot be content
Men of greater worth should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
to the Place he aim'd at; that
knows not how to condescend to Men
of low Estate, and is loath to shew civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to Persons that are good, because
they are miserable in the World; that
thinks it below him to lend his helping
hand, and to minister unto those whose
Condition is mean; or never learn'd yet
in his practical Esteem, to preferr a poor
Saint before a rich Man, who is a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to real Goodness; that will not go
one step out of the Road of his humour,
and will be affable and courteous no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than is consistent with his Interest.
To be sure, such a Person doth not think
better of others than of himself, which
yet is the great ingredient of Humility.
It's true, the humble Soul is not to think
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:108689:65"/>
of Persons openly profane, and atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
better than of her self; yet the
Rule holds, where others appear to be
vigilant, and watchfull, and sober, at
least live in-offensive, and without scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal;
and the ground upon which this
piece of Humility rises, is partly the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
defects the humble Man finds in
himself, and which he hath a greater sense
of, than of the faults of others, and which
really appear greater to him, than the
offences of other Men, partly the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Gifts, and latent Vertues, that may
be for ought he knows in another Man.
Upon this Account, the humble Person
is to think of others better than of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
yet with this caution, so to think
of others better than of himself, as not to
run into despair, nor to conceal, or hide
the Grace of God bestow'd upon him,
when the Edification of others requires
a declaration of it, as is evident from
<hi>Psal.</hi> LXVI. 16. and 1 Cor. XV. 10.
And from hence flows,</p>
            <p>5. A holy Contentedness in the mean
Condition, God hath placed us in. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
is particularly seen in outward
Poverty, and he whom Providence hath
brought to a very mean and low Estate
in the World, and who is contentedly
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:108689:66"/>
poor, is truly humble. For he humbles
himself under the mighty hand of God,
submits to his Will, and bears it chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
because he is confident it will
work for his good. The same is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to other outward Afflictions. The
humble Man gives his back to the smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and when he suffers, he threatens
not only from a sense of the Demerit of
his sins, which he knows have deserv'd
worse Usages; but from consideration
of the mighty alteration of his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when the Lord Jesus shall appear
from Heaven, to be admired in all his
Saints. Humility is more seen in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Afflictions and Reproaches, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
than any where. In these cases,
for our thoughts to work downward,
and to strike the Soul into an humble
Sense, and to quiet her as a weaned
Child, this looks like the Humility of a
Disciple of Christ, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> II. 19, 20, 21.
But,</p>
            <p>6. And lastly, This Humility is not
complete, without a chearfull and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Submission to what God requires to
be done. Pride is the cause of Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
and because Men insolently
oppose their Wills to God's Will,
<hi>They walk in the imagination of their
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:108689:66"/>
hearts.</hi> Hence we read, <hi>Jer.</hi> XIII. 15.
<hi>Hear this, and give ear, be not proud for
the Lord hath spoken:</hi> To shew that Pride
causes Men to turn their backs to the
wholsome Commands and Admonitions
of the Lord: And if this be the Nature
of Pride, it must necessarily be the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of Christian Humility, chearfully
and humbly to take Christ's Yoak
upon us, and let the Commands of the
Gospel, be never so contrary to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of Flesh and Blood, where Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
reigns, there none of those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
will be grievous, 1 <hi>John</hi> V. 3.</p>
            <p>This as near as I can guess, is the true
<hi>Idea</hi> of Christian Humility commanded
in the Text; for though it be no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Command, yet a Blessing being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed
upon the Vertue, which Blessing
is not to be had without the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it must be <hi>Tantamount</hi> to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
But, <hi>Why is this Humility call'd
poverty in Spirit?</hi> I answer: Poverty
it's call'd,</p>
            <p>1. Because the humble Man hath no
good thing of his own. He carefully
distinguishes what is God's, and what is
his own. He is sensible, that all the
Evil he hath is his own; and if what
he may call his own be consider'd,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:108689:67"/>
he will appear a very poor, miserable
Wretch destitute of Mercy, and Favour,
and Comfort, and fit only to fall a Prey
to the rage of the Devil. What good
he hath or finds in himself, he ascribes
to the true cause God blessed for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.
<hi>Not I, but the grace of God,
which was in me,</hi> I Cor. XV. 10. He
freely and feelingly acknowledges, that
he is nothing, hath nothing, and can do
nothing that's good, without the power
and influence of God. He sees nothing
in himself that can help, or save, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
him. All his riches, hope, life and
power, and strength and vertue is in
Christ Jesus: And having nothing of his
own, that he can boast of, he may tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be call'd poor.</p>
            <p>2. Poor, because he is always in want,
always in want of God's grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to guide him, to lead him, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
him, to strengthen him, to keep
him, to preserve him. He is always
begging, always imploring the Divine
goodness to remember him. Begging is
his Trade and Profession, I mean beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the Mercy and Charity of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Mercy; and he gives not over
begging, till his Prayers be turn'd into
everlasting Praises.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:108689:67"/>
But he is not only poor, but poor in
Spirit.</p>
            <p>1. Because Humility must take up its
chief Residence in his Spirit, and inward
Man. Outward prostrations, humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
cringings, bowings, raggs, a sordid
habit, sackcloath; and the course cloath
he wears, signify nothing except the
Soul, or the Mind be lowly: If that be
so, the outward Man will be truly so,
if the inward Man be a stranger to this
Humility, the leathern Girdle, and the
Garment of Camel's-hair without, will
soon be seen thorough. And therefore
the young Man in <hi>Cassian</hi> for all his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
aggravations of his sins, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
semblances of an humble mind,
discover'd his Hypocrisie, when he could
not endure a reproof from <hi>Serapion.
Lucian</hi> makes himself very merry with
a <hi>Cynick,</hi> a Man who pretended to more
than ordinary Humility and Austerity
of life; A friend of his searching his
Pockets, and thinking to find there some
old Raggs and mouldy Bread, and the
Parings of Cheese, or some such stuff,
to his surprize found there a Bale of
Dice, a Box of Perfume, and the Picture
of his Mistriss. A very fit Emblem of
a Person, who makes a shew of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108689:68"/>
without, but within is self-conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and an admirer of his own worth.
The heart must feel the power of this
Virtue. That's the Garden where the
Flower must grow, and there it must take
root, if not, it's not a Plant of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father's planting; and a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
may easily perceive, that it is lodged
in his inward Parts, by the lowly and
humble Thoughts he cherishes within.
It was from what he felt within, that
the Martyr said, <hi>Lord, I am Hell, Thou
art Heaven;</hi> and another, <hi>I am the most
hypocritical Wretch, not worthy that the
Earth should bear me;</hi> and a third, <hi>I am
the unfittest Man for so high an Honour,
as suffering for Christ, that ever was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to it;</hi> and a fourth writing to
his Friend, that was going to be burnt
at the Stake for the Gospel of Christ;
<hi>O that my life, and a thousand such Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
lives, might go for yours! Why doth
he suffer me, and such other Caterpillars to
live, who can-do nothing but consume the
Alms of the Church, and take you away a
mighty Workman, and Labourer in his
Vineyard.</hi> The inward Humility sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
these Expressions; and whatever
indiscretion might be in such Speeches,
the humble Sense of their own vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:108689:68"/>
within made them rational and
elegant.</p>
            <p>2. Poverty in Spirit; because this Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
is an effect of God's spirit, the Holy
Ghost breathes upon the Soul, and plants
it there. The Spirit of God disposes
and inclines the Soul to these humble
Sentiments, scatters the strong holds of
iniquity, and the vain imaginations,
that exalt themselves against the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of Christ Jesus; throws down the
high Conceits the man did formerly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in his mind, and suggests to the
Soul, arguments to baffle and resist the
Reasons of Flesh and Blood, and of the
World; for where a Person endeavours
to bring his Heart to an humble Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
the Devil is present with his Baits;
What? will you be a Fool? will you be
laught at by your Neighbours? what?
put up such affronts, which no Flesh is
able to endure? what? shew your self
tame under such an Aspersion? what
will Men say of you? But the Spirit of
God teaches the Soul, how to answer all
such Objections with the Example and
Command of Christ, and the hope of
the Grace and Glory of God. And
therefore this Humility is justly call'd,
<hi>Poverty in Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:108689:69"/>
II. <hi>How the Kingdom of Heaven is
theirs, and upon what Account it belongs
to them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Kingdom of Heaven, in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
particularly in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is meant, sometime the Kingdom
of Grace, sometime the Kingdom of
Glory. The Kingdom of Grace is that
sweet and gentle Government which
Christ Jesus, the Son of God, the Head
of his Church, and the King of Saints,
doth by his Spirit exercise over his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
Followers, and such as have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
themselves up to his Conduct; by
which Spirit he teaches, enlightens,
guides, assists, strengthens, and comfort
and preserves them, makes them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and obedient, and communicate
strength and life, and power to them
more or less, according to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Stock committed to their
Trust. This is the Kingdom of Grace,
and in this Sense the Expression is used,
<hi>Matth.</hi> III. 2. <hi>Matth.</hi> XIII. 44. and in
other places. The Kingdom of Glory
is the future reward and recompence,
God intends and designs for those, who
have resolutely taken Christ's Yoak up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:108689:69"/>
them, even that Glory, Honour and
Immortality St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of, <hi>Rom.</hi> II. 7.
consisting in seeing God face to face,
and triumphing over Hell, and Devils,
and enjoying him, in whose Presence
there is fulness of joy for ever. This is
the Kingdom of Glory, and in this Sense
we find the Phrases used, <hi>Matth.</hi> VII. 21.
<hi>Matth.</hi> XIII. 43. <hi>Matth.</hi> XIX. 23.</p>
            <p>In both Senses, the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
belongs to the Poor in Spirit, or to
the Humble.</p>
            <p>I. The Kingdom of Grace, and this
you cannot doubt of, if you reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the signal Favours, God on this side
Heaven confers on the Soul that's truly
humble. <hi>To the humble he gives Grace,</hi>
saith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. V. 5. Nay, <hi>more
Grace</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> notes, <hi>Ch.</hi> IV. 6. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as this Humility takes deeper
root, or runs out into larger Branches.
The humble Man is dispos'd to receive
the warmer and stronger influences of
God's goodness and mercy. The Soul
that purifies, and cleanses her self from
all high and losty thoughts, or rejoyces
in her meanness and low Estate; and
being nothing, renders her self apt and
fit for the Almighty's abode in her, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108689:70"/>
invites him to take possession of her;
and from God's dwelling there, a Man
may date a thousand Blessings. To such
a Person the Father of Lights commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates
wonderfull Treasures; to such
there arises a light in darkness, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such low and humble Valleys, the
richest Showers, and the clearest Rivers
flow: O that you were all sensible of
this Truth! O that you did but feel this
Christian Humility working in your
Souls! You would find what Wisdom,
what spiritual Wisdom God would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
into your Souls, even that Wisdom
which <hi>is from above; first pure, then
peaceable, gentle, and easie to be entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
without partiality, without hypocrisie,
full of good works,</hi> James III. 17. <hi>I thank
thee, O Father, that thou hast reveal'd
these things unto Babes,</hi> saith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<hi>Matth.</hi> XI. 25. These Babes are
the humble, the poor in Spirit: To these
God reveals the heighth, and breadth,
and depth, and length of the love of
God; such may promise themselves the
larger Portions of God's Spirit; such
Persons are most likely to grow in
Grace, to advance in Goodness, to a
rise to perfection, and to be satisfied
with the Corn of Heaven, with Angel's
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:108689:70"/>
Food. Such a Soul is fitted for Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Obedience; the severest Laws of
the Gospel go down with her, and she
embraces the Yoak with Joy. Who can
express the Comforts, the Peace, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
that the humble feel! It must
needs be so, for it's the lowly in heart
that are promised Rest for their Souls,
<hi>Matth.</hi> XI. 29. Such get strength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Corruptions, Temptations,
Lusts, and sinfull Inclinations; such
make a mighty progress in Goodness,
and get Courage in the greatest fiery
Trials.</p>
            <p>For this, I might appeal to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of the Saints of Old, but I need
not go so high; I will appeal to the
Experience of some pious Christians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, who feel what <hi>David</hi> said of
himself; <hi>O God mine heart is not haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
nor mine eyes losty; surely, I have
behaved and quieted my self as a Child,
that's wean'd of his mother,</hi> Ps. CXXXI.
1, 2. Let such among you tell me, when
they have been in a very humble frame,
when they have had a lively sense of
God's greatness, and goodness, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and a very deep Sense of their
own vileness; have not you seen more
of God than ever; have not your Souls
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:108689:71"/>
been satisfied as with marrow and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
have not you been ready to go
through Fire and Water for God; have
not you baffled and scorn'd the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
assaults of the Devil, and torn the
snares and grins that were laid for you,
with as great ease as <hi>Sampson</hi> did his
Bonds? Have not your hearts been rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to leap within you, and your joys
like mighty Rivers, been ready to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow
your Souls? This is the Kingdom
of Grace, and this belongs to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
But,</p>
            <p>II. The Kingdom of Glory is theirs
too; theirs by purchase, theirs by pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
taken already in their Names,
theirs by promise, theirs by way of
earnest.</p>
            <p>1. Theirs by purchase, and therefore
call'd the purchased Possession, <hi>Eph.</hi> I. 19.
Purchas'd, by whom? Even by Christ
Jesus, the great Shepherd of the Sheep,
who laid down his life for them, and
thereby obtain'd an everlasting inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for them. None could purchase
it but he, for whoever undertook the
Work, must be not only a Man inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
spotless, and without sin, and die,
but of that Divine excellency too, as
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:108689:71"/>
to be able to give his Death an infinite
value; the vertue whereof might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it self to all Ages, and to all sorts
of Persons too: This none could do,
but he that was the Son of God, and
the Son of <hi>David</hi> too. He did it, and
wonderfull was the Enterprise; nothing
was ever attempted like it. He died,
and purchas'd this Kingdom of Glory
for the humble; his purchase makes it
theirs. He was both able to purchase it,
and when he had done, to apply it to
those for whom it was purchas'd. If a
rich Man buys an Estate for a Beggar,
the Beggar may justly call it his; for he
that had right, and means, and power,
and ability to buy it, bought it for his
Use.</p>
            <p>2. Theirs by possession taken already
in their Name. The same Jesus, that
purchas'd this Kingdom for them; he it
is that hath taken possession of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
for them, and in their Name. <hi>For
in my Father's house are many mansions</hi>
If it were not so, I would have told
you. <hi>I go to prepare a place for you,</hi> saith
Christ, <hi>John</hi> XIV. 2. All the Christian
World knows, that Christ ascended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Heaven. There he actually enjoys
the Kingdom of Glory, which he keeps
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108689:72"/>
for the humble. He is the great Trustee,
that secures and manages that vast Estate
for their Use: So that it may ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ly be call'd
theirs, because of the forerunner Jesus, who
is enter'd into Heaven, being made a
<hi>Priest for ever after the order of</hi> Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedeck,
as it is said, <hi>Heb.</hi> VI. 20. There
he appears for them as their Advocate
and keeps their places for them, against
they come thither: As a Guardian takes
care, and possession of the Orphan's
Estate, till the Pupil comes to Age; so
Christ takes possession of this Kingdom,
with an intent to deliver it up to the
humble, when they come in the Unity
of the Faith unto a perfect Man in Christ
Jesus, to the measure of the Stature of
the fulness of Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> IV. 13.</p>
            <p>3. Theirs by promise; for so we read,
Matth. XVIII. 3, 4. <hi>Except ye be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and become as little Children, ye
shall in no wise enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven. Whosoever shall humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as this little Child, the same is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> He hath
promis'd it, who is able to give it, even
God, who cannot be worse than his
word. The humble Man may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon this Promise, more than he
can upon Bonds, and Bills, and Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:108689:72"/>
that Men can give him of an Estate
in the World. God cannot fail him, he
cannot disappoint him: He not only
will not, but cannot, as the Apostle saith,
<hi>He cannot lye, Tit.</hi> I. 2. because that
would imply an imperfection. If a
Man of Honour doth faithfully promise
his Neighbour a living, a place, or an
office in his gift, the Man makes bold
to call it his, for he hath confidence in
his honesty, and word, knowing him
to be a Person that stands upon his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
and reputation, and scorns to do
any thing that's base and mean: How
much more then may the humble Soul,
call the Kingdom of Glory hers; since
the God, the Fountain of Truth, and
Truth it self, hath peremptorily said, it
shall fall to her share; and though such
Persons do not actually as yet enjoy it,
yet they shall enjoy it as surely, as if they
did already walk through that <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
and view the Towers, and Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works,
and all because they have to
deal with a God, who changes not,
<hi>Mal.</hi> III. 6.</p>
            <p>4. Theirs by way of earnest. In hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Contracts men give earnest, and
that makes the Bargain sure; and tho'
the Covenant, God makes with Men,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:108689:73"/>
is not such a formal Contract as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Man and Man, in buying and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
yet some resemblance there is in
that, God a most bountifull Master, is
willing to give earnest to the humble
Soul, to assure her, that this Kingdom
of Glory shall be hers.</p>
            <p>This earnest is his Spirit, which is
therefore call'd, <hi>The earnest of our future
inheritance,</hi> Eph I. 14. This Spirit is no
fancy, but a real thing, which the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Soul feels as much as other Men do
the moving of the Wind, by the effects.
This Spirit of God is discover'd by its
operations, which are kindly, and great,
and powerfull, and make a very wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
alteration in the Soul for the better.</p>
            <p>This Spirit works Grace, and that
Grace is the earnest of Glory.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>How, and in what manner a Title
to this Kingdom makes the poor in Spirit,
or the Humble, blessed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Greek it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, which
is as much as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, Men that

great reason to rejoyce; or as much as

                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, Men not subject to
Death or Corruption. the word an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:108689:73"/>
to the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
a perfection, or confluence of all
good things. The Isle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> was
anciently call'd <hi>Macaria,</hi> because of the
mighty affluence, and abundance of all
good things, that wer to be had there,
which was the cause, why the <hi>Romans</hi>
seiz'd it for their use. But what is all
this to the Kingdom of Heaven, to the
Kingdom of Grace and Glory? Where
all things that can make a Man truly,
and eternally happy, do concur; where
there is no want of any thing, that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
can desire; and all things that fill
and satisfie the Soul are present; where
God gives himself the perfection of
Beauty, and Wisdom, and Greatness,
and Love, and Delight; which gift, as
it is begun in the Kingdom of Grace;
so it shall be perfected in the Kingdom
of Glory.</p>
            <p>The humble Man is blessed:</p>
            <p>1. Blessed in himself: 2. Blessed in the
sight of God: 3. Blessed in the Eyes of
all good Men: 4. blessed in the midst of
all his outward Miseries: 5. Blessed in
the opinion of all Reprobates: 6. Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
because he hath a Title to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:108689:74"/>
1. Blessed in himself: He hath reason
to rejoice. His humility gives him that
content and secret Satisfaction, that it
may justly be call'd the Philosopher's-stone;
Content, which surpasses all the
Satisfaction, that the luxurious, the
proud, the voluptuous, the sensual, the
carnal part of Mankind boasts of.</p>
            <p>He hath Riches within, and Pleasures
within, and a new Name within him,
even the white Stone, which no Man
knows, save he who receives it. Nor is
he subject to corruption; for when he
dies, he dies into an immortal life.</p>
            <p>There is nothing of him dies, but the
garment of flesh; nothing of him cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts
but the Clay and Dust, he wears
about him; the earthly Tabernacle in
which his Soul, that noble Inhabitant
lived, decays and moulders, and falls;
but his Soul at his Death is born again,
gets new life, new light, new irradiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
nay, and his Body must at last fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his Soul to Glory; and therefore
blessed, blessed in himself, for he feels
that Bliss within, which all the Gold of
<hi>Ophir</hi> cannot purchase. So true is that
saying of our Saviour. <hi>He that believes
in me shall never die,</hi> Joh. XI. 26.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:108689:74"/>
2. He is blessed in the sight of God:
God counts him so; God looks upon
him as happy, and he must needs be so,
whom God judges to be so. God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be mistaken: He cannot be out in
his Verdict. He sees his heart, sees the
lovely, the amiable, the charming Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
he is most enamour'd withal, a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
very agreeable to his Divine Nature,
a Vertue which very much resembles
the Great God, who dwells on high;
yet humbles himself to behold the things
in Heaven, and in Earth; and seeing
his own Image there, he counts him
blessed.</p>
            <p>3. Blessed in the Eyes of all good Men.
A good Man that beholds Humility shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in his Neighbour, and finds that this
Grace hath taken deep root in his heart,
that he hath very low thoughts of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that he is willing to submit to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
wiser and abler in things ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and doubtfull, that he thinks more
kindly, and favourably of others than
of himself; that he ascribes all his Gifts
and Blessings to the free and underseved
Bounty of God, and attributes nothing
to his own merits and desert; that he
thinks himself unworthy of Honour, and
is not ambitious of worldly Glory; that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:108689:75"/>
he speaks humbly of himself, and is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to converse with Persons, mean,
yet good, and to contribute to their
welfare; that he can bear reproof, and
bear injuries well, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The good Man,
that sees these admirable effects of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
in his Neighbour, what doth he
see, but the Character of God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?
And what can be more blessed
here on Earth than a Child of God,
than a Son or Daughter adopted in Christ:
Jesus?</p>
            <p>4. Blessed in the midst of all his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Misery: Blessed he is in the midst:
of stripes, and lashes, and reproaches,
and calumnies. Blessed in a Prison, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in Dungeon, blessed when Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
and despise him, when all things
go cross, when he is reviled, abused, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued,
and despightfully handled<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
for while this spiritual Poverty like a
good Angel dwells in him, while this
Humility reigns in his Soul, God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
hovers over him, the Almighty
carresses him, Angels visit and attend
him, his Conscience justifies him, and
the Lord Jesus, that Pattern of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
loves him, and therefore blessed
still.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:108689:75"/>
5. Blessed in the opinion of all Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
not in this World, but in the
next; when they shall see the humble
Man advanced above the Stars of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
seated among the Elder Sons of
God, rais'd from this dunghil World,
and made to sit with Christ together
in heavenly Places; then the proud, the
vain, the foolish, that counted the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Man's life madness, will all change
their Notes; and they that once look'd
upon his Humility, as baseness of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
will then be forced to acknowledge,
that such a Man chose the better part,
understood himself, and was truly sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the Veracity of what God had
said so long ago. <hi>I am the lofty and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one, who inhabits Eternity; with him
also will I dwell that is of an humble Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
Isa. LVII. 15.</p>
            <p>6. Blessed because he hath a Title to
the Kingdom of Heaven. The World
calls an Heir to a great Estate, or
Honour, or Dignity a happy Man.
And must not then the humble Man be
happy and blessed, that is Heir to the
Crown immarcescible, Heir to all the
vast Territories of Heaven, Heir of all
the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Heir to all the huge
Tract above, that flows with Milk and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:108689:76"/>
Honey? Nothing can make a Man so
happy, as the full enjoyment of God.
Is God happy or not? The <hi>Epicureans</hi>
held, nay the Devil himself dares not
deny, that God is the most happy Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and is it possible to enjoy that
God, to be united to him, to live in his
glorious Presence, and to participate of
his Felicity, and not be happy? This
blessedness the Kingdom of Heaven gives
the humble Man. He hath a right to
the Tree of life; and therefore blessed,
as we read, <hi>Revel.</hi> XXII. 14.</p>
            <div type="inferences">
               <head>Inferences.</head>
               <p>1. Seeing so much depends upon this
Humility, and spiritual Poverty; Is it
not fit, we should examine whether we
are possess'd of this spiritual Treasure or
not? Though the words of the Text be
express'd in the Affirmative, yet a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
is implied, and it naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that those who are not humble,
not poor in Spirit, have nothing to do
with the Kingdom of Heaven; and
therefore are in no blessed State or
Condition. Surely, this Consideration
is enough to make a thinking Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive;
and indeed it is impossible se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108689:76"/>
to believe it, and not make appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to our selves. But where Men
are superficial Christians, and suspect
that they are proud, and high, and
lofty, and self-conceited, and strangers
to Christian Humility, and that they
shall find all nought within, if once they
examine things, and bring them to the
Touch-stone; there they will be loath
to venture upon this Task, for fear they
should discover and see their Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and be obliged to reform. So care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
do most Men shun their own Cure,
and shut their Eyes, that they may
not see the Sores, and Ulcers of their
Souls.</p>
               <p>There is no Spiritual temper, or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification,
or perfection, but God hath
left Characters in his word, whereby we
may certainly know, whether we are
Masters of it, and whether that which
we have and looks like it, be genuine
or not, and this is particularly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to Humility. There is a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and counterfeit Humility, which
hath base and sinister Ends, and Designs,
and Pride may lie at the bottom of it;
But this Hypocrisie may soon be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
by the Characters before laid
down, I mean the Characters of that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:108689:77"/>
truly humble Spirit, which is in the
sight of God of great Price. St. <hi>Bernard</hi>
very ingeniously observes, and from him
others have taken and improv'd the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
True Humility, faith he, like the
Violet, grows low to the ground, hangs
the head downward, and hides it self
with its own leaves. It prefers the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of a good Conscience, before
the applause of the World; and were
it not that its fragrant Smell betrays
it to the observation of others, it
would chuse to live and die in its own
well pleasing Secrecy.</p>
               <p>Truly Christians, did you know what
stress God lays upon this qualification,
did you know the consequence, the
worth and necessity of it; were you
sensible what an influence it hath upon
the whole frame of Religion, and what
power it hath with God, and how its
absence renders your spiritual Sacrifices
useless, and ineffectual; you would not
only examine your selves to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you have it, and how much you
have of it, but labour to arrive to higher
Degrees of it than ordinary.</p>
               <p>That which turns the Religion, which
many of you seem to have, into meer
Formality, is the want of this qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:108689:77"/>
Pride lies unmortified in your
Souls, that makes the Ground barren,
and no Grace will thrive in you. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to Religion, while this Grace is
neglected, is as insignificant, as building
a House without laying the Foundation;
you are not fit to obey the Gospel, till
you cultivate this Plant in your Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
               <p>But then, as I said, in the preceeding
Discourse, the Heart, the Mind, the
Soul, the Spirit, is the Place where Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
must first display its Beauty and
Glory. An humble Sense of your selves
within; humble, low, and despicable
Thoughts of your worth; in a word, a
very low opinion of your selves wrought
up by frequent Meditation into a habit,
that's it which will make you truly
humble to God, and Man: That will
make you thankfull for the least Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
that will make you admire God
in the meanest Blessing you enjoy;
that will make you pray often, and
fall low before God's Foot-stool; that
will make you resist such Temptations,
as would put you upon despising and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing
of your Neighbours, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
little inconsiderable things ill at
their hands; that will make you cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:108689:78"/>
and affable even to the poorest,
and mercifull, and peaceable among
those you converse with; that will
pull down all self-conceitedness, and
self-admiration, and prevent your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tickled with the Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Applauses of Men, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
your Ambition, and Hunger, and
Thirst after the great things of the World;
that will have an influence even upon
your outward Dress and Habit, and make
you go plain and decently, and modest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and keep you from imitating the
Fashions of the World; that will make
you modest and moderate, and discreet
in your Speeches, Answers, and Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
In a word, That will make you speak
and act like Disciples of the humble, and
self-denying Jesus; so that upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
of these effects Humility produces,
I may justly call upon you as <hi>Solomon,</hi>
Prov. IV. 23. <hi>Keep your hearts with all
diligence, for out of them are the Issues of
Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. We see here, that neither outward
Riches, nor Poverty makes Men bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
nothing but a just Title to the
Kingdom of Heaven. This is evident
from the reason here given, why the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:108689:78"/>
poor in Spirit, or the humble are bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
even because theirs is the Kingdom
of Heaven; as if our Saviour had said:
These poor in Spirit may be outwardly
rich, or outwardly poor, but neither the
one, nor the other makes them blessed,
but their Title to the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Indeed without this, the Richest
of you are miserable Men, and the poor
among you are doubly miserable here,
and hereafter. If this Kingdom be yours,
if this belongs to you, fear not, though
the Earth be moved, and the Hills be
carried into the midst of the Sea. I
know, the Judgment of the World is
this; if a Man get a loss in his Estate, or
if he breaks, or if such a great Man, or
his Relations abandon him, presently he
is miserable; but if he gets a good Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall,
or lights upon a good Bargain, or
thrives in the World, presently we count
him happy; but these are the wild Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes,
which Flesh and Blood leads us
into; gain but a Title to this Kingdom
of Heaven, and you'll be happy though
you are never so great losers in the
World. This Kingdom, O that I had the
Tongue of an Angel to represent it to
you in lively Characters! This King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is large, ample, great and spatious;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:108689:79"/>
it holds not only all the blessed Angels,
but all the Saints that have lived since
the Foundations of the World, and are
like to be to the End of it. It is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
rich; there is such plenty there,
that the Banks are overflow'd, and the
Cup of Joy runs over. It is infinitely
safe, safe beyond all the Castles and Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadels
in the World; for all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
are Brethren, love one another
with a pure heart servently, and are
everlastingly faithfull one to another;
so fearless they are, that the Gates of
this Kingdom stand open Day and Night.
It is durable beyond Rocks and Marble,
for it is incorruptible, and fades not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
The Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> counted <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>'s
Servants happy, because they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in his House; what then must the
Inhabitants of such a Kingdom be, where
the King is the Fountain not only of all
Honour, but of all Bliss and Felicity,
and the Subjects drink of that Fountain,
drink and never thirst again; where the
Company is glorious, and splendid to
admiration, and the lowest Person there
is an Angel; where everlasting Content
reigns, and all are free from sin, from
the assaults of the World, the Flesh and
the Devil; where all are fill'd with
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:108689:79"/>
Grace and Glory, and all are satisfied
with the Rivers of God's Pleasures.</p>
               <p>Sirs, This Kingdom of Heaven we have
Commission to offer to you, not a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of this World; and if we could of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to you an Earthly Kingdom, that
would not make you so happy, as this
Kingdom of Heaven will, for Kings on
Earth we see are not always the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest
Men: They have their fears and
losses, their discontents and vexations,
as well as other Folks. This King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven, the richest Prize that
ever was heard of, we offer to you:
But we must tell you withall, that there
is no coming to this rich and weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Empire, except you become poor.
The Palace is stately and magnificent,
but the Gate is low. The richest,
the greatest, the wealthiest of you all
must become poor, poor in Spirit, and
humble as a Worm, if you mean to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the Bliss of yonder Kingdom. If
we should bid you, as Christ did the
young Man in the Gospel; <hi>Go and sell all
you have, and give it to the Poor,</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
a poor Saviour, and you shall have
Treasure in Heaven; there is none of
you but must confess, that it were worth
parting withall to get this Treasure: But
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:108689:80"/>
such a Poverty we do not press upon
you, nor think it absolutely necessary,
except in case of Persecution; when Men
must hate Father and Mother, Brethren
and Sisters, Lands and Houses, and Life
it self for the Gospel's sake; but God
hath shewed thee, O man, and what doth
the Lord thy God require of thee, even
to walk humbly with thy God. Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is the readiest way to a glorious
Exaltation; and how often doth our
Blessed Saviour repeat that Golden say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>He that humbles himself shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted!</hi>
This not only Saints, but Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
agree in; this the wisest Men of
most Nations, Countries, and Religions
confess. The truth of it is so evident,
that it shines through the very chinks
and crevises of Nature. Need I ask any
of you whether you have a mind to be
happy, and blessed. I know, you all
would be so; and if this be your reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
behold, here lies the way: <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
are the poor in Spirit, for theirs is
the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>

               <q>Blessed are they that mourn, for they
shall be comforted.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the Account our Saviour gives
of blessed Men; the mourners you
see succeed the humble, or the poor in
Spirit. It was very convenient it should
be so; for Humility is the cause of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
mourning the effect of Humility,
or spiritual Poverty; and therefore we
find the one immediately subjoin'd to
the other. The poor Man mourns; it's
natural to do so, and so doth the poor
in Spirit. As the poor Man mourns for
the presence of Temporal Evils, and the
absence of Temporal Blessings, so the
poor in Spirit mourns for the presence
of Spiritual Evils, and the absence of
Spiritual Blessings; and this mourning,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108689:81"/>
as will appear in the Sequel, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
great and loud, and vehement,
like the mourning of a Funeral, but as
great as it may be there is comfort in
it; for <hi>Blessed are they that mourn, for
they shall be comforted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three things will deserve our consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>I. Whether all mourners are blessed,
and if not, who they be that are so.</p>
            <p>II. Wherein their Blessedness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.</p>
            <p>III. How, and when they shall be
comforted.</p>
            <p>I. Whether all mourners are blessed,
and if not, who they be that are so.</p>
            <p>1. There is a natural Sorrow, or
mourning for the Loss of Parents, or
Children, or other Relatives, or Friends,
or Goods, or Necessaries, or outward
Accommodations. This Sorrow even
the best of Men are subject to; and if
it be moderate, not long, not violent,
not excessive, not bordering upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair,
as if all our happiness were gone,
not join'd with mistrust of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vidence,
but sweetened and qualified
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108689:81"/>
with thoughts of the Will of God,
and our own Demerits, and God's holy
and wise Designs, it is allowable, and
there is no hurt in it; but still this
cannot make a Man blessed, for at the
best it is but a natural Infirmity, and
that's no ingredient of Blessedness. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
mourning for outward Losses,
or an impatient Sorrow, is a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Sin; and I need not tell you, that
this is incapable of making a Man bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
And of this Nature is sorrow or
mourning, because we cannot accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
our wicked Design, or because we
cannot revenge our selves upon an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,
as we would, or because we
cannot have that Plenty, and Estate, and
Fortune, and Prosperity, which other
voluptuous Men enjoy. All such mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is offensive to God, and makes Men
miserable, and therefore cannot make
them blessed. There is besides all this,
a sorrow proceeding from melancholy,
which makes People lament and mourn,
and take on, and sigh, and look sad, and
they cannot tell why: This must needs
be the effect of a Distemper, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can be no part of Blessedness, or
true Happiness. And therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:108689:82"/>
2. The mourners who are pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
blessed here, must be mourners of
another sort. And they are,</p>
            <p>1. Such as mourn for their sins: Such
a mourner was <hi>David,</hi> whom Sin and a
due Sense of it, made even <hi>roar by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the disquietness of his heart,</hi> Psal.
XXXVIII. 8. Such a mourner was <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
who after the denial of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>went out, and wept bitterly,</hi> Matth.
XXVI. 75. Such a mourner was <hi>Mary
Magdalen,</hi> or whoever the Woman was,
<hi>that wash'd our Saviour's Feet with her
Tears,</hi> Luke VII. 38. The mourners, that
are said to be blessed here, are Persons
that deny themselves, mourn not for
such things as the World mourns for, but
such as sensual Men take no notice of.
There is no self denial in mourning for
outward Losses; even Children can do
that; but in mourning for his sins a
Man must go contrary to the stream of
natural inclination, and offer a kind of
violence to himself, and that makes it a
pleasing Sacrifice, and he mourns happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that takes on, because he is sensible
how evil a thing, and how bitter it is
to forsake the LORD, and that his fear
hath not been in him, as it is said, <hi>Jer.</hi>
II. 19. Repentance cannot but make a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:108689:82"/>
Man happy, and the Nature of it is said to
consist in this, in looking at that Jesus,
that Saviour, that Redeemer whom we
have pierc'd by our Sins, and whose
Love and Blood we have affronted, <hi>and
to mourn, as one that mourns for his only
Son,</hi> Zachar. XII. 10.</p>
            <p>2. Such as mourn for other Men's
sins, whether publick or private; such
a mourner was the Royal Prophet; <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of Tears ran down his Eyes, because
other Men did not keep God's Laws,</hi> Psal.
CXIX. 136. Such a mourner was <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi>
whom we hear wishing, <hi>Jer.</hi> IX. 1, 2.
<hi>O that my head were Water, and mine eyes
a fountain of Tears, that I might weep day
and night; because my People are Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
an assembly of treacherous Men.</hi> Such
mourners were those pious Men we read
of, <hi>Ezek.</hi> IX. 4. Who <hi>cried for the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of the House of</hi> Israel; and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
such were the faithfull <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
who sorrow'd after a Godly sort; for
having given the incestuous Person too
much incouragement to come into their
Congregations, a sorrow upon which
St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes this remark, 2 Cor. VII II.
<hi>What carefulness hath it wrought in you,
yea what clearing of your selves, yea what
fear, yea what vehement desire, yea what
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:108689:83"/>
zeal, yea what revenge?</hi> Such mourners
are Persons of true Christian compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
their sorrow is noble and generous,
and like the sorrow of God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> VI. 9.
<hi>I am broken with their whorish heart,
which hath departed from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Such as mourn for the loss or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God's spiritual Blessings; I say,
Spiritual; because there is a favour of
God, which relates to the gay, and great
things of the World; such as Riches,
Plenty, and outward Prosperity, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
bestow'd even upon the worst of
Men, and to mourn for the loss or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of this favour makes no Man hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py;
that which makes us so, is mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
for the loss or absence of God's spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Blessings, such as being deprived
of the use of God's publick Ordinances,
a remarkable instance where of we have
in <hi>David,</hi> when forced during <hi>Saul</hi>'s per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
to wander in Deserts and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesses,
among Heathens and Infidels,
where he had no opportunity of visiting
the House of God, and participating of
the Prayers and Praises of God's People
a lively Description of which mourning
he gives us, <hi>Psal.</hi> XLII. 3, 4. <hi>My tears
have been my meat day and night, while
they say daily unto me, where is thy God?
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108689:83"/>
When I remember these things, I pour out
my soul in me, for I had gone with the
multitude, I went with them to the house
of God, with the voice of joy and praise,
with the multitude which keeps holy-day.</hi>
How this afflicted him he expresses more
fully, <hi>Vers.</hi> 5. where he talks of his Soul
being cast down, and disquieted within
him: And of this nature is the mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of many pious Christians, who
have sometime felt great peace, great
joy, great satisfaction in the practice of
Religion, but find the light of God's
countenance withdrawn, terrour dwells
in their minds, and horrour fills their
Souls, they find not that chearfulness,
that fervour that alacrity in God's ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
which once they felt, and for this
they mourn; blessed are these mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>4. Such as mourn, because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
as yet perfectly overcome the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
which do so easily beset them.
Indeed the Reign, the Tyrannizing Power,
the Dominion of sin is broken in them;
but as it was with the seven Nations,
after that their Empire was destroyed,
some of the Enemies here and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
to exercise the Courage of the
<hi>Israelites;</hi> so in good Men, after they
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:108689:84"/>
have shaken off the Yoak of the Devil;
some reliques of their old sins remain,
against which they fight; they strive,
they labour, they watch, they pray,
that their Pride, their desire of vain-glory,
their passion, their hastiness of
Spirit, their pusillanimity and cowardice
in speaking for God, their timorousness
in reproving their Neighbours, their
mistrust of God's mercy, their love and
affection to the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be gone,
that God would arise, and that these
Enemies may be scatter'd, they use
means, they enquire what they must do
to mortify these unruly desires, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
themselves, they fast, they are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with these Corruptions, yet ever
and anon before they are aware they
fall, and imprudently yield to Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of this nature; they would feign
be Masters of those vertues, accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and perfections, which did shine
so bright in the primitive Saints, but
cannot as yet arrive to that excellent
Temper; for this they mourn, and are
dejected, and sorrow seizes upon their
hearts and minds; yet still, blessed are
these mourners.</p>
            <p>5. Such as mourn, because their stay
in this World is long, because they are
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:108689:84"/>
kept out of Heaven, and from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
enjoyment of God, because they
are obliged to continue in this barren
Wilderness of the World; where they
must see their God dishonoured, his
Name profaned, his Creatures abused,
his Ordinances derided, his Providences
disregarded, his Precepts slighted, his
Promises undervalued, his Threatnings
scorned, and Charity grow cold, and
Iniquity abound: This draws from them
<hi>David</hi>'s complaint, <hi>Wo is me, that I
must dwell in</hi> Mesech, <hi>and have my habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in the Tents of</hi> Kedar, <hi>Ps.</hi> CXX. 5.
Indeed such mourners are but few, most
Men being desirous to enjoy the World,
as long as they can; yet some there are
that have made their Calling and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
sure; and long to be gone, long
to be dissolved and to be with Christ,
and to be cloath'd upon with their House
from Heaven, long to join the Quire of
Angels, long to be freed from this
Earthly Tabernacle, and all this upon
the excellent Principle of the love of
God, not from impatience under their
pain and sickness, or frowns of the
World, or their mean condition here;
but because the love of God is shed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
in their hearts, and because they
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:108689:85"/>
are kept from enjoying their desire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the amorous Needle is with-held
from clinging to the beloved Magnet,
they mourn; blessed mourning!</p>
            <p>But what? You'll say, do no mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
under Temporal losses and crosses
come into the Number of these blessed
Men? I answer, yes.</p>
            <p>1. If the cause for which, and in which
they suffer losses of their Goods, or
Friends be great and noble; if they sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for the Gospel's sake, upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Righteousness, and a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
in this case their mourning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Temporal losses may inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
them to blessedness, provided that
their mourning be mingled with faith
and hope, and a holy self-resignation;
and that they mourn more for the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
of the Person, who are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of their Persecution, than for
the want of their Corn and Wine, and
Oil, and the Garlicks, and Onions of
<hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. If under their Temporal losses they
mourn chiefly for their sins, which have
both caused and deserved these suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
Sorrow, barely for Temporal los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and for being deprived of the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions
of the flesh, cannot be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:108689:85"/>
to that Spiritual life the Gospel
presses; something there must be to
sweeten that sour Sop; as it stands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
it comes under the notion of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of the World, and that we are told
works death, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> VII. 10. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
happiness cannot be the fruit
or effect of it. The Soul therefore that
mourns under such outward Calamities,
must look off from the Calamity to the
cause of it, or Sin which hath procured
it; and that sanctifies the sorrow, and
makes the mourner blessed.</p>
            <p>Yet to prevent mistakes, I must
necessarily add these following cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>1. We are not to think, that in order
to arrive to this Blessedness, a Man or
Woman must do nothing but mourn:
There is a time for every thing, and
there are other things to be done besides
mourning, even the particular Duties,
and Vertues, and Self-denials, required
and commanded in this Chapter; so
that when it is said here, blessed are they
that mourn, the meaning is, blessed are
they that do so as they have occasion
to reflect either upon the Spiritual Evils
which are present, or upon the Spiritual
Blessings that are absent from them.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:108689:86"/>
It's enough that there be a disposition
or aptitude to mourn, which exerts it
self whenever any opportunity offers it
self to consider, and to think of such
Objects as deserve and require our
mourning, else Spiritual Joy would be no
Duty; and if our lives were to be fill'd
with mourning, the Apostle's Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had been useless, <hi>Phil.</hi> IV. 1. <hi>Rejoyce
in the Lord always,</hi> i. e. <hi>upon all occasions,</hi>
and again I say, <hi>Rejoyce.</hi> Neither,</p>
            <p>2. Must the stress be laid upon the
bare mourning, as if the mourning and
weeping, and sadness alone were pleasing
to God, and groans were the only livery
of Heaven; but this mourning must be
in order to a greater end, even to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
our Souls in the love of God, to
strengthen our graces, to corroborate
our repentance, and aversion from sin,
and to purifie our outward and inward
Man more and more, and therefore it is
emphatically call'd, <hi>sorrowing to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
2 Cor. VII. 9. Nor,</p>
            <p>3. Are we to think, that a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of mourning is always necessary,
even mourning expressed in so much
weeping, and sorrowing, as we find in
other Christians of our Acquaintance.
All men's conditions are not alike; a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:108689:86"/>
Person that hath been profane and lewd
hath reason to mourn more, than he, whose
Sins have been of a lesser size; not but
that it was commendable to weep bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
even for infirmities, but the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of mourning is greater certainly upon
a rapacious Publican, than upon the
pious Couple, <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
Besides, all men's Constitutions are not
alike, some being of that tender Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
that the least touch or sense of
things makes them weep; others of a
hardier make, who may be astonish'd
and concern'd at great things, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make that outward shew of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that others can. It's enough there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the sorrow be rational, and
that the mind be so affected with the
object, that causes or deserves mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
as to work in us a willingness to
mourn more if we could, and an indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
against the Spiritual Evils which
are present, and an earnest longing and
endeavour after the Spiritual Blessings
which are absent, and we stand in need
of.</p>
            <p>Having set down these cautions, I
proceed to the second Part to acquaint
you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:108689:87"/>
II. Wherein the Blessedness of such
mourners consists.</p>
            <p>1. This mourning is the Character of
Saints, <hi>Ezek.</hi> IX. 4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> XII. 21.
Why? what Blessedness is there in this?
will some say. How? no Blessedness in
being a Saint? what's the reason then
that Kings and Princes wish they were
so? what's the reason that most wicked
Men, when they come to die, would
fain be of that Number? Nay, what's
the reason that in your Creed you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
a Communion of Saints? Is it not
in this Creed, that you profess the greatest
Blessings, that were ever bestow'd upon
the Children of Men? And if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints be one, must it not
be a most blessed thing to be a Saint,
and of that Communion? According to
the account the Holy Ghost gives of
a Saint, such a Man must be a greater
Person, than the most potent Monarch
of the World; and although <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
Treasure in all his Glory was not so dear
to God, as a Saint is, one that is really
so; not one that proudly assumes that
Title; not one whom Men in civility
call so; not one who out of self-concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedness
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:108689:87"/>
thinks himself one, but one in
whom the true Characters of Sanctity
meet.</p>
            <p>2. He that particularly mourns for
the sins of others, for the sins of the
Times, or for the sins of the Nation,
or of the whole Christian World, is
thereby made conformable to the Son
of God, of whom we read, that <hi>he drew
near the City and wept over it, because
of the impiety that reigned in it,</hi> Luke
XIX. 41. And to be like the Son of God,
must be both a great and a blessed State.
Greatness and Blessedness do not always
go together, but here they do; for as
nothing can be greater than the Son of
God, so nothing can be more blessed:
Seems it to you a small thing to be the
King's Son-in-law, said the shepherd's Son,
and is it not more magnificent to be like
the Son of God? If he were blessed in
this mourning, certainly he that imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
him in that sort of mourning must
be so, for he was the Pattern both of
our Vertue and Reward.</p>
            <p>3. Such mourners are the Eriends of
God; God takes care of them, and in
the midst of their mourning is concern'd
for them; his Bowels yearn over them;
and though he lets them mourn for their
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:108689:88"/>
good, because their Souls thrive and
prosper under it, yet he leaves them not,
forsakes them not, but is with them in
that mourning Condition; his Eyes are
open upon them, not to punish but to
bless, not to destroy but to build up,
not to kill but to revive; and as despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
as their State may seem, they
shall be comforted, which calls me to
the last Part.</p>
            <p>III. How, and when they shall be
comforted.</p>
            <p>They shall be comforted in this World,
and in the World to come.</p>
            <p>1. In this World, and the steps or
particulars of this Comfort are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <p>1. They shall be supported by God's
Spirit, and in their weakness shall be
made strong, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was, when he
mourned under strong Temptations, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the buffetings of Satan's Angel; <hi>My
Grace,</hi> saith God, <hi>is sufficient for thee,</hi>
2 Cor. XII. 9. that is, though I do not
think fit to deliver thee as yet, there
shall be sufficient Grace given to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
thee under the Temptation; Or,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:108689:88"/>
2. They shall be enlightned in the
midst of their mourning, and they shall
see the wise and holy Designs of God,
who suffers them to mourn, which
sight shall cause a serenity and calmness
in their minds; such a calm as shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create
them in darkness, and make their
Burthen tolerable, or easie to be born:
And this is the effect of that famous
Promise, <hi>Psal.</hi> CXII. 4. <hi>Vnto the upright
there arises a light in darkness.</hi> Or,</p>
            <p>3. God will send Men to comfort
them, as he did <hi>Philip</hi> to the Eunuch,
who was perplexed about a place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and knew not how to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
His good Providence will so order
it, that either some faithfull Minister of
the Word, or some other good Man
shall come to them, and speak a word in
season to them, whereby their Souls
shall receive strength and courage to
hold out; as it was in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s case,
<hi>Isa.</hi> XXXVIII. 2, 3. and following Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
Or,</p>
            <p>4. His word shall comfort them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
publickly preach'd, or read in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate:
When they are meditating in the
Law of God, something shall come in,
that like the dawning of the day shall
revive the weary Traveller, and this
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:108689:89"/>
               <hi>David</hi> found by experience: <hi>This is my
comfort in my affliction, for thy word hath
quickned me,</hi> Psal. CXIX. 50. Or,</p>
            <p>5. They shall be deliver'd from the
Temptation, or vanquish the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
under which they groan, and such
Power shall be given them, as shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
them to mock all the fiery Darts
of the Devil, and to overcome the Evil
with Good, as we see in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom.
VIII. 2. Or,</p>
            <p>6. God will make their very mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
sweet to them, make their Tears
their Cordials, their Sorrow shall be
comfortable to them; and they shall
find greater content and satisfaction in
their Tears, than others do in their
Corn and Wine, and Oil, as we see in
the Apostles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> VII. 4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> XII.
10. Or,</p>
            <p>7. God will give them a livelier sight
and clearer apprehensions of the things
which are not seen, and these shall buoy
them up in the Flood that rises against
them, and with these Bladders they shall
swim through the salt Sea, and be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
from sinking, as we see in the
Believers spoken of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> IV. 16, 17,
18. Or,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:108689:89"/>
8. Their death shall comfort them,
which shall deliver them from all their
Miseries and Annoyances; put a stop to
all the rage of their Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Enemies, and make an end of all
their bitter Draughts; insomuch that
they shall be able to say with old <hi>Simeon,
Lord now lettest thou thy Servant depart
in peace; for mine eyes have seen thy sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
Luke II. 29, 30.</p>
            <p>Some of these ways they shall be
comforted in this present World. But,</p>
            <p>2. More amply, more fully, more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
in the World to come.</p>
            <p>The comforts to come are comforts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
These comforts <hi>David</hi> speaks of,
<hi>Psal.</hi> XXIII. 2. <hi>He shall make me to lie
down in green pastures; he shall lead me
beside the still waters.</hi> To this purpose
Isaiah, <hi>Chap.</hi> XXXV. 10. <hi>The ransom'd
of the Lord shall return, and come to</hi>
Zion <hi>with songs, and everlasting joys
upon their heads, they shall obtain joy
and gladness, and sorrow, and sighing shall
fly away. They shall have beauty for
ashes, the oyl of joy for mourning, and the
garment of praise for the spirit of heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
Isa. LXI. 3. When such mourners
leave this World; such a scene of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
will open to them, as will make
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:108689:90"/>
them for a while like unto them that
dream, the surprize and the comfort
will be so great. St. <hi>John</hi> describes their
comforts more particularly, <hi>Rev.</hi> XXI. 4.
and <hi>Rev.</hi> XXII. 4, 5. <hi>God shall wipe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all tears from their eyes, and there
shall be no more death; neither sorrow nor
crying; neither shall there be any more
pain; for the former things are passed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
And they shall see his face, and
his name shall be upon their foreheads
and there shall be no night there, and
they need no candle, neither light of the
sun, for the Lord God gives them light,
and they shall reign for ever and ever.</hi>

               <head>Inferences.</head>
               <p>I. Let not every Man that hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in a Fit mourned for his sin, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
imagine that he is one of the
Number of the Blessed in the Text: It's
true, they that mourn for sin, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>n
part the Men here aimed at; but the
manner of the mourning makes the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
you have mourn'd for such a
sin, but how? Is the sin gone? is it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd?
is it dead? is it mortified? is it
likely to die upon this mourning? do
you act like Men that are resolv'd to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:108689:90"/>
subdue, and master it? I grant some
sins are not so easily vanquish'd, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are; The secret sins of the Soul,
such as pride, passion, vanity of mind,
love of the World, backwardness to
self-denial, irresoluteness, impatience,
peevishness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and such are not easily
taken notice of without a diligent search,
are not so soon beaten down, as gross
outward sins; such as drunkenness, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ill company, swearing, cursing, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
extortion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet let the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
be more facile or more difficult, if
you mourn for such a sin, some good
effect will appear. Doth your mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
put you in a striving, or wrestling
condition? do you swim against the
stream? do you cut the hair as soon as
it grows again? do you give the sin no
quarter, when you see it appear again?
do you allow the dangerous Guest no
harbour? do you hugg it, embrace it,
caress it no more? If your mourning
produces not such effects as these, it's
nought, and they are counterfeit Tears
you shed. If your mourning does not
make you groan, and long to be rid of
your sins, if it doth not make you
watchfull against Temptations, if it doth
not make you cry out with the Apostle,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:108689:91"/>
                  <hi>Who shall deliver me from the body of this
death!</hi> If you smile upon these Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Hell again, after you have mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
if you grow careless and admit
them into your Bosom again, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
the falshood and hypocrisie of your
sorrow, and God will answer you, as
he did the Jews, <hi>Zech.</hi> VII. 5. <hi>When you
fasted and mourned in the fifth and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
month, did you at all fast unto me,
even unto me?</hi> If your mourning be right
it will make you hunger, and breath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
God; God's favour will be better
than life to you, you will look upon
sin as the greatest evil, you will be
griev'd for the sins of others, and for
the effects of other Men's sins, under
which good Men groan, you will run
to Heaven with Prayers and Confessions
in your Mouths; if you have wronged
any Man, you will make him restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or satisfaction: It will moderate your
sorrow for losses Temporal, prevent
needless sorrows; in a word, it will
work an Universal Reformation.</p>
               <p>II. Carnal mirth is not such a happiness,
as some imagine. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Chains is
happier than <hi>Dives</hi> in his Purple; Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
are far happier Men in Christ's
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:108689:91"/>
Account, and <hi>Peter</hi> in a Prison is in a
better State, than <hi>Herod</hi> on a Throne.
By carnal Mirth I do not mean a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Joy or Complectional, which is
a modest, well-composed, rejoycing in
the Blessings God bestows upon us, and
our Neighbours; this is both lawfull,
and a Duty, but by carnal Mirth, I
mean sinfull Mirth; such as rejoycing in
iniquity, laughing at our Neighbour's
infirmities, being glad at the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
of our fellow Christians, making
a mock of offending God, taking plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in the follies and extravagancies of
others; being merry with ill company,
breaking Jests upon Religion; and being
pleased and tickled with any thing, that
favours of wantonness, lightness, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness
of mind, abusing of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
Voluptuousness, or unlawfull
Sports and Recreations, or Luxury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Such merry Men the World counts hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py;
strange Happiness! which God
frowns upon, and is abomination in his
purer Eyes! such Mirth makes a <hi>David</hi>
weep, and what good Man can forbear
mourning, that beholds Men making
sport with Fire-brands? The mourners
at this are infinitely happier than such
Players; and though he can rejoyce
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:108689:92"/>
in little but Trifles, may for a while
pass for a blessed Man among Fools, and
Sots, and Persons as very Beasts as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
yet Men whose Senses are exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to distinguish betwixt Good and
Evil, must ever look upon him as a
very miserable Man; for his Joys are
false deluding Joys, which will end in
sorrow, and such sorrow as will grieve
all the Veins of his Heart. To such Joy
a Man may truly say, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did,
<hi>Thou art mad,</hi> or rather as Christ, <hi>Luke</hi>
VI. 25. <hi>Woe to you that laugh now, for
you shall mourn and weep;</hi> as if he had
said, <hi>Woe to you,</hi> for you have your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
you desired a merry Life, and
you have it; but when that is done,
you must give God leave to fulfil his
Threatnings, to be as good as his word,
and to bring that black and dismal
Cloud upon you, which fell upon and
crusht the jolly Man in the Gospel, that
cloathed himself in Purple, and far'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously
every Day. <hi>Son, remember, that
in thy life time thou receivedst thy good
things, and likewise</hi> Lazarus <hi>evil things,
but now he is comforted, and thou art
tormented,</hi> Luke XVI. 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:108689:92"/>
III. But these are not the Men that I am
at present concern'd to speak to. They
are the mourners I am to comfort, and
therefore step forth ye mourners of <hi>Sion;</hi>
you that either mourn for your own sins
or for the sins of the Nation, or for the
sins of your wicked Neighbours, and
Relatives, or mourn for the absence
of God's joyfull Communications; or
mourn under your Corruptions and
Temptations, because you cannot yet
totally subdue them; or mourn, because
your Graces are not stronger, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you must sojourn so long in this
Valley of Tears. Fear not ye of little
Faith, for ye shall be comforted. The
Son of God assures you of it: Believe
not a lying Devil, that would break
your Confidence, and dissuade you from
laying hold on this gracious Promise.
It must stand, it must come to pass:
Comfort is promised you, and Comfort
shall be your Portion. Search your
Hearts, consult your Experience, and
see what God hath done for you alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
Look back and reflect what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
you have felt formerly, what Joys
in the midst of Tears, what refreshments
in your Sorrows, what Gales of Peace,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:108689:93"/>
what Characters of God's Goodness, what
Marks of his Favour: These are <hi>Item</hi>'s
that a more plentifull Harvest is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
<hi>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that
you shall weep and lament, but the World
shall rejoyce, and you shall be sorrowfull
but your sorrow shall be turned into joy,</hi>
saith Christ, <hi>John</hi> XVI. 20 And he adds
immediately this Comparison; <hi>A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
when she is in Travail hath sorrow,
because her hour is come; but assoon as she
is deliver'd of the Child, she remembers
no more the anguish for the joy that a man
is born into the World.</hi> This admirably
expresses both the Nature of your sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for sin, and the Nature of your Joy,
which will be the Consequence of it:
A Woman in Travail hath pain, so your
mourning for sin, or for the absence of
Spiritual blessings, causes throes and
pangs, and anguish, but your sorrow is
usefull and profitable: As a Woman in
Travail brings forth a Man-child, that's
the effect or result of her sorrow, so
your mourning produces the Fruits of
Righteousness; for Tribulation works
patience, and Patience experience, and
Experience hope, and Hope makes not
ashamed. But this is not all: Behold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in this similitude the Nature of your
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:108689:93"/>
future Joys; when the Child is born,
the Woman for Joy forgers her anguish
so when your Fruit is ripe, it shall be
laid up in the granary of Heaven, and
when you shall put off this Body of
Flesh and Sin, for the Joy that will crown
your Temples, you'll forget all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
anguish you labour'd under; God
will comfort you, and your Eyes shall
see it; the Lord Jesus will call to you,
and your Ears shall hear it, <hi>Enter you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Joy of your Master.</hi> Heaven is the
vast Store-house of all Comforts; there,
where-ever you cast your Eye, you'll
behold nothing but Comfort, Comfort
in the Spirits of Men made perfect,
Comfort in the general Assembly of the
first born, which are written in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
Comfort in the innumerable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Angels, Comfort in the Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah's
of Cherubin, and Seraphin, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
above you, Comfort within you,
Comfort round about you. There your
Heart will break no more, there your
Understandings will be clouded no more;
there no storms, no enemies will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compose
you any more; there all that
can make Men sad will be removed
from your sight, for sin will be gone,
and Devils will tempt no more; there
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:108689:94"/>
you will lie incircled in the everlasting
Arms, and Rivers of Joy will flow round
about you; your present <hi>April</hi> Showers
will produce a glorious May; and after
your gloomy Night, the Son of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
will shine upon you with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
under his Wings; and as one hour
changed <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Fetters into a Chain of
Gold, his Rags into shining Robes, his
Stocks into a Chariot, his Prison into a
Palace, his Water into Wine; so in that
moment, that your Souls shall enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Regions of endless Comfort, your
mourning will be changed into dancing,
your tears into laughter, your sackcloth
into silks, your ashes into garlands,
your thorns into lawrels, your fasts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
festivals, and your unutterable sighs
and groans into unspeakable joys.</p>

            <p>THIS Blessedness, or Beatitude in
some Latin Copies of the New
Testament is the second, but in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
and in the Syriack and Arabick
Versions it is the third; and these as the
most authentick, our Translation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows;
what is said of Meekness here, is
taken out of <hi>Psal.</hi> XXXVII. 11. where
we read as it is in the Text, <hi>The Meek
shall inherit the Earth.</hi> Christ came not
to reverse the Morals under the Law,
but to ratifie and confirm, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
them into greater perfection, and
to enforce them with new Motives, and
Arguments. Moral Vertue hath been
the same in all Ages; and being founded
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:108689:95"/>
on the Law of Nature, must needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable:
The encouragements for the
practice of it, are greater in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, than in any other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foever,
and the lines of the Duty are
here drawn in livelier Colours, but the
Vertue it self, like the Nature of that
God from whom it flows, receives no
changes.</p>
            <p>In the explication of the Text, we
are to consider, as in the preceding Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</p>
            <p>I. What Meekness is, and who the
Meek are, and what their Character is.</p>
            <p>II. Wherein their Blessedness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.</p>
            <p>III. How they shall inherit the Earth.</p>
            <p>I. What Meekness is.</p>
            <p>1. To be meek is not to be mealy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth'd,
or gentle, or calm, when it
is our Duty to be angry; and it is our
Duty to be so partly with our selves,
when we sin against Heaven, and in the
presence of an Omnipotent God, and
that is the anger or indignation spoken
of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> VII. 11. partly with others
when they do notoriously affront the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:108689:95"/>
Divine Majesty, and wrong their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
<hi>Gall.</hi> III. 1, 2. particularly,</p>
            <p>1. With those who are under our
Command, and Power, and Jurisdiction,
such as Children, Servants, and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;
or Persons whose Masters, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
Guardians, Teachers, or Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
we are, when they prove incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
in their sins, <hi>Gen.</hi> XLIX. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>2. Even with others of our Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and Persons whom we converse
with, when they profane the Name of
God, or run out into licentiousness, and
will not be reclaim'd by softer means,
<hi>Gal.</hi> V. 12. <hi>Moses,</hi> though one of the
meekest Men in the World, yet his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
justly wax'd hot, when he saw the
<hi>Israelites</hi> commit Idolatry, <hi>Exod.</hi> XXXII.
19. And our Saviour himself, tho' the
Pattern of Meekness, yet could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the profanation of the Temple
without anger, <hi>John</hi> II. 15, 17. and St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> though Preachers
of this Christian Meekness, yet were
obliged to break out into Passion, when
they saw the Priest of <hi>Jupiter</hi> bringing
Oxen, and Garlands to do Sacrifice to
them, <hi>Acts</hi> XIV. 14, 15. <hi>Elis</hi> Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to his Children prov'd his folly,
and his Calmness is a Cause where God
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:108689:96"/>
was dishonour'd, pulled down God's
Vengeance upon his Posterity. A soft
Expostulation here was altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable;
and instead of saying to his
Sons, why do you do so, he should
have severely punish'd them, when their
stubbornness baffled all the gentler means
of their Reformation.</p>
            <p>Meekness properly relates to injuries
done to our selves, where the injury is
directly offer'd to God, our Meekness
must turn into Zeal; in all sins against
our Neighbours, and our own Souls:
God is wrong'd because all sin is a Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
and dishonouring of the Law
of God, but some sins are more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
levell'd against God; yet even in
God's cause, where the anger is just and
lawfull, discretion must guide the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
in a good Cause men may be too
hot; and where the anger turns into
fury, it becomes madness; and instead
of advancing, diminishes and darkens
the glory of Religion. There is a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
anger, which with some warmth
and heat, pleads and argues for God's
Honour, but runs not out into unseemly
Behaviour, or into reviling Language.
And this is that anger we are to shew,
when God is dishonoured, when we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:108689:96"/>
him, and when others do so.
So that Meekness doth not exclude all
anger; for as all Meekness is not lawfull,
so all Anger is not sinfull. <hi>Be ye angry,
and sin not,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Eph. IV. 26.
which shews that some sort of anger is
innocent: And it is so, when it is,</p>
            <p>1. In God's cause, and from a sense of
his Glory, which we see dishonour'd by
the sin, or by the wrong our Neighbours
do either to God, or to their fellow
Christians; for though it be lawfull
sometimes to be angry at a fault we see
in our Brethren, yet the anger must be
more upon the account of the indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
offer'd to God by the offence, than
upon the Account of the wrong, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
we our selves suffer by it.</p>
            <p>2. It must be kept within due bounds
and limits, must not turn into rage, and
throwing about Coals, and Fire-brands,
and odious and offensive Names. Nor,</p>
            <p>3. Must it turn into malice, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
but must still be follow'd with Acts
of Charity. And,</p>
            <p>4. It must be after that we find gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
means useless, and ineffectual. There
are indeed some extraordinary occasions
which require a present indignation, as
it was in the case of <hi>Zimri,</hi> and <hi>Cozbi,</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:108689:97"/>
when <hi>Phineas</hi> executed Judgment, <hi>Numb.</hi>
XXV. 7. but ordinarily the rougher re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
is not to take place, till the softer
medicine be refused and scorn'd, <hi>Matth.</hi>
XVIII. 15. And from hence,</p>
            <p>2. You may easily guess at the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of that Meekness which my Text
saith, makes its Votaries blessed. Its
Definition or Description rather is brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this. It is a temper of Mind, a Grace,
or Gift of God's Spirit, whereby a man
is enabled to curb, and subdue, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
his Anger, Wrath and Passion,
and Peevishness, and cholerick Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
when it is necessary; and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
himself with Calmness, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and great Modesty and Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in his Speeches and Answers, in his
Actions and Transactions with his
Neighbours. I call it a gift of God's
Spirit, because, though some are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
meek, and no Choler seems to
mingle with their Blood and Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and though they are born as it
were into Vertue, yet even this natural
Meekness must be resin'd and polish'd
by Grace, and the Spirit of God before
it can be truly acceptable to God in
Christ Jesus. This Spirit must inspire
it with Wisdom and Discretion, when
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:108689:97"/>
and where it is to keep within, and
when and where it is to go beyond it's
natural bounds, when and where it is
to use a Staff, and when and where it
is to turn that Staff into a Rod. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
do commonly reckon up five de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of this Christian Qualification.</p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">Vid. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. Ã  Lap. in Luc.</note> Conversing with, and speaking to
all sorts of persons calmly, gently, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly,

Rage, or Fury, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<hi>Tit.</hi> III. 2. <hi>Shew all Meekness
unto all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. By our calm and soft Speeches and
Answers to endeavour to break, and
asswage the Rage and Anger of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
and offended Neighbours, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s rule, <hi>Prov.</hi> XV. 1.
<hi>A soft answer turns away,</hi> or ought to
turn away <hi>Wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Calmly to bear and to endure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries

to the Precept we have, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> IV. 13,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:108689:98"/>
14. which imports, <hi>Rejoycing in such
cases, in as much, as we are partakers of
Christ's sufferings:</hi> for so Christ suffered
Reproaches, Threatnings, Calumnies,
Injuries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>committed himself to
him that judges righteously,</hi> 1 Pet. II. 23.</p>
            <p>5. By acts of Meekness to endeavour

feed him; if he thirst, give him
drink: Be not overcome with evil, but
overcome</hi> the <hi>evil with wood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the degrees of which I shall
have occasion to speak more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when I come to explain <hi>v.</hi> 22. In
the mean while, give me leave to tell
you, that he that arrives to one of these
degrees, must not rest there, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
till he come to the top of the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
This is the race a Christian is to
run in. He that will not go on to the
furthermost Stage of his course, hath
reach'd the first and second in vain.
The difficulty of the task must be no
discouragement; if it be, we are not
truly sensible of the blessedness which
attends this Meekness, which is the
second point I am to speak to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:108689:98"/>
II. Wherein the blessedness of meek
Christians doth consist.</p>
            <p>1. This Vertue renders us acceptable
to God and Man. How acceptable it
makes us to God, St. <hi>Peter</hi> shews, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
III. 4. where we read, that <hi>a meek and
quiet Spirit is in the Sight of God of great
price.</hi> God sets a mighty value upon it,
and the vertue makes men great and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
in his Eyes. What pains do
poor Mortals take to gain credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
with men of high rank and
quality, when they are to act, or speak,
or do any exercise before them, they do
their best, and all the powers of their
Soul are employ'd to come off with Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause.
But how few take the way to gain
credit and reputation with God the
great rewarder of them that diligently
seek him. To be meek is the way to
his esteem, and to gain his approbation
and commendation. Meekness exalts
the Soul, and hath such charms about
it, as make a glorious God look with a
very favourable Eye upon the person a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
with this wedding Garment. Its
the very Livery of Christ's Disciples,
the mark of his Sheep, and therefore
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:108689:99"/>
cannot but be acceptable to the great
Shepherd of Mens Souls. Add to all
this, That it makes us acceptable to
men too, not only, because most men
had rather deal with a meek than with
a fiery or cholerick Person, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the vertue hath such advantages in
it, as even force esteem and veneration.
Brutish and sensual Men esteem nothing
that serves to aggrandize the Soul, and
indeed their Verdict is so inconsiderable,
that it is not worth regarding. But
Men of Sense, and Reason, and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
cannot but value the Person
in whom this Meekness shines, it being
an argument of the noblest Conquest,
greater certainly than <hi>Pompey</hi> or <hi>Caesar</hi>
could boast of. <hi>Esau,</hi> though a profane
Person, could not but admire it in his
Brother <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> XXXIII. 4. And
if the great Saviour of the World, was
justly counted blessed, because he grew
in favour with God and Man, the meek
Christian must needs be so, for his Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
hath the same Vertue, and renders
him acceptable to God and Man.</p>
            <p>2. It fits and dispose a man for the
influx of Celestial Wisdom, for it is of
the same nature with Humility; and
that, as I said before, prepares for the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:108689:99"/>
richer influences of God's Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Humility and Meekness, like
Twins, live and die together. He that
would be meek, must first learn to be
humble; for it's Pride makes men fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and fly out into Passion; and as
these two Vertues go hand in hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
so they participate of the same
blessings. <hi>Elisha, 2 Kings</hi> III. XV. was
unfit for the Illapses of God's Spirit,
while he was in a Passion, and therefore
a Minstrell was brought to play before
him, to compose his Thoughts, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
the Storms his Soul was in, and to
rock the Waves of his disorder'd Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
into a calm; and when this was
done, the Spirit descended upon him in
gifts of Prophecy. It is this Spirit of
God, that must illuminate the Mind,
and fill it with Celestial Wisdom, and
no subject so fit for it, as a meek and
quiet Spirit. This is no new Divinity,
but as old as <hi>David</hi>'s time, for thus he
saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> XXV. 9. <hi>The meek will he
guide in judgment, the meek will he teach
his ways.</hi> And this even some Heathen
Philosophers have been sensible of, and
with them agrees the <hi>Author of the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Solomon,</hi> ch. I. 4. Turbulent
Passions keep out this Spirit of God.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:108689:100"/>
But where the Soul is calm, this Spirit
spreads his wings over it, as a Hen over
her Brood, and teaches her the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Godliness, displays to her the
glories of the Gospel, represents to her
the designs of God's Providences, given
her a lively sight of God's Goodness,
and the Reward to come, and at once
discovers to her, and presses upon her
the powerfull arguments of the Love of
God, which prevail with her to follow
the Lamb whithersoever he goes. And
since the meek have the honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
blessed with this Celestial Wisdom
whatever the World thinks of them
they must be blessed and happy.</p>
            <p>III. Blessed they are because they shall
<hi>inherit the Earth,</hi> and how they do
that must be our last enquiry.</p>
            <p>1. Some by inheriting the earth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the millennary Reign, or the
Reign of the Saints here on Earth for a
thousand Years. But surely this cannot
be the meaning of it, for if there be such
a millennary Reign, which I will neither
affirm nor deny; it is evident from <hi>Rev.</hi>
XX. 4. that that Reign is confin'd to
Martyrs, and those that have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:108689:100"/>
for the Testimony of Jesus;
and surely men may be meek, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a reward of God without being
Martyrs. Therefore others more justly
understand it of the present Earth we
all inhabit, and referr the blessedness
here spoken of to the quiet possession
the meek enjoy, or have of the blessings
God's liberal hand bestows upon them.
For though sometimes they lose all they
have in the world, though they are
harrass'd by their enemies, though their
Meekness is sometime their loss, though
barbarous men sometime take advantage
of their meekness to undo them, yet
for the most part they quietly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly
enjoy, what God gives them,
be it more or less; to be sure they have
the best means in their hands to possess
what they have in peace. And that's
their Meekness which makes them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
frequently from their right for
peace and quiet's sake: and God will not
suffer them to be losers by their Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and therefore rewards that with
content which they seem to want in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, it being his method to take
care of, and to fight for those who will
not fight for themselves. But though
the meek may in this sense be said to
inherit the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:108689:101"/>
1. With respect to their quiet Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the temporal things God gives
them.</p>
            <p>2. With respect to the favour of men
God makes them Heirs of.</p>
            <p>3. With respect to the success that
some times attends their temporal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
as a present recompence of their
Vertue, as it was said of a great man in
this Kingdom, that rose from a small
to a very great Estate, and used to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
the malice of his Enemies with
Meekness and Patience; that he never
sued any man, nor any man ever sued
him: Though I say, we must grant,
that in this sense the meek may be said
to inherit the Earth: Yet,</p>
            <p>2. This sense methinks in this place
is not great enough, where we find our
Saviour intends to encourage his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
to the noblest Enterprizes by the
noblest and most excellent Rewards.
When <hi>David</hi> spoke these words, <hi>The
meek shall inherit the earth;</hi> it's like he
meant the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and a quiet
Possession of their own in that Country:
but as the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
of the Land of eternal Glory: so
Christ, whose Province it was to bring
Life and Immortality to light, must be
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:108689:101"/>
supposed to speak of this Earth in a more
sublime and exalted sense, and therefore
by <hi>the Earth</hi> here must be understood
something greater, even the happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of immortal Bliss, call'd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>the new Heaven and the new Earth,</hi>
Rev. XXII. 1. sometimes a <hi>heavenly
Country,</hi> Heb. XI. 16. sometimes <hi>the
Land of the living,</hi> at least in the sense
of some of the Fathers, <hi>Psal.</hi> CXVI. 9.
even those Regions which were prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured
by the Land of Promise, by the
Land that flow'd with Milk and Honey.
In a word, the Holy Ghost in Scripture
loves to express those happy Regions of
eternal Love and Felicity by various
Names; sometimes by a River, because
the Joys are in a perpetual Flux and
Motion there, sometimes by a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
or Hill, because the glorified Saints
will be exalted to Seats high and lofty,
and overlooking all the World; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by a City, because of the Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the Inhabitants; sometimes by
a Kingdom, because of the Splendor and
Glory of that State; and here by <hi>the
Earth,</hi> because of the affluence of all
things, that can make the Meek rich,
and blessed, and happy. And they are
said to inherit this glorious Land.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:108689:102"/>
1. Because as Children they have a
right to it while they live here, as a
Son hath a right to his Father's Land.</p>
            <p>2. Because after death they shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
possess this Estate of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is in Heaven: so that their
inheriting, speaks them Children, Sons
and Daughters of the Almighty, to
whose share the rich Demesnes of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World will fall, not after their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
death, who is immortal and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
die, but after their own death;
and this shews the difference betwixt
inheriting Estates here on Earth, and
inheriting the Regions of eternal Bliss.
There Men inherit after their Father's
death, here after their own death.</p>
            <div type="inferences">
               <head>Inferences.</head>
               <p>1. It's evident from hence, how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
and unfit a solitary life is for the
practice of the noblest Precepts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
Meekness and subduing our
wrathfull, cholerick, peevish and angry
Inclinations is certainly one of the most
excellent rules of our holy Religion.
But how shall he that retires from all
company, lives in a desart, in a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in a wood; where he lives' out of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:108689:102"/>
all converse, how shall he live up to
the strictness of this rule, who hath
none to offend him, none to displease
him, none to affront him, none to do
him an injury, none to talk imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
before him, none to oppose or
cross him. Its temptations must try
this vertue. To be chast upon Mount
<hi>Athos,</hi> where no Women come; to be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in <hi>Scythia,</hi> where no Wine, no strong
Liquors grow, is pitifull and mean, and
at best but a negative innocence; but
with <hi>Lot,</hi> to be chast in <hi>Sodom;</hi> sober with
<hi>Anacharsis</hi> in debauch'd <hi>Athens;</hi> with
the Salamander to lie in the Fire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being consumed; and like Fishes to
swim in the Salt Sea, and to contract no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of its Saltness; this is vertue, this
is heroick, this is Christian like. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations,
Insolencies, Injuries, these
are the Touchstone that must shew
whether our Meekness be genuine or
not. The most cholerick Man alive
may fansie himself to be the meekest
Creature under Heaven, while there is
none to disturb or disorder his Passions.
But in your Trade, in your Commerce,
in your Traffick, in your Callings and
Employments, in Company, in Society
of others, when you are slighted, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:108689:103"/>
undervalued, dishonoured, called
ill Names; when things are said and
done, which are against your interest,
opinion, judgement; and when you are
crost by your Neighbours in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
then to be meek, then to be si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
then to say nothing, or to answer
with Moderation and Discretion, then
to return nothing that may favour of
revenge in word or deed, that's Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that's the Tryal, that's the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
we speak of; then to curb your
Passions, then to refrain, then to hush
and quiet your unruly Affections, not
out of Policy, but out of Love to God
and Charity of your Neighbour, that's
great, that's to prepare for inheriting
the land where Angels live. Some are
such cunning Artists, that they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
their Passion, when it is their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
not to shew it, but whenever they
have a fair opportunity to shew their
Spleen, they will not fail to let the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
know that they have not forgot
the injury offer'd them. But this is Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
not Meekness, Malice and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
not Calmness, in a word, a perfect
Cheat. It's a sense of God, a sense of our
duty a sense of the necessity of it, a sense
of the love of Christ, a sense of the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:108689:103"/>
weight and importance of the Precepts
of the Gospel, that must plant this
Meekness in our Souls, and this is it
that must check and over-awe our unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Appetites. Sinister ends and designs
spoil all vertue whatsoever. It's not
suppressing a Sin, but destroying it,
not hiding it from men for the present,
but laying the Axe to the root of the
Tree, that makes men Favourites of
Heaven. Besides, this Meekness must
be universal, exercis'd not only when
Persons great and powerfull, whom we
fear, or from whom we expect some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
give the Provocation, but
when our Equals, or Inferiours, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
whom we have some command o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
say and do things which are apt to
stir up Passions within us. How far
we may lawfully be angry with such
Persons, I have shewn in the beginning
of this Discourse, but for the most part
in the affairs of <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> in things
where our Honour, Profit, Ease and
Pleasure and Interest are touch'd, that's
the Theatre on which this Meekness
must be shewn.</p>
               <p>II. Since such a Blessedness attends
this admirable Vertue, no less than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:108689:104"/>
the Regions of Eternal Bliss;
need I give you any other Arguments
to make you enamour'd with it? when
the present and the future favour of that
God, in whose Power it is to make us
happy or miserable for ever, is promis'd
and entail'd upon this qualification:
What strange Hearts must you have, if
such Motives cannot prevail with you
to resolve upon the serious Study, and
Practice of it?</p>
               <p>But I am naturally fretfull, a. small
thing discomposes me, and I cannot help
it. How sinner! Naturally fretfull?
Hath grace then done thee no Service?
Hath the Gospel done no good upon
thee? Art thou yet in a State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and art not thou afraid? What?
in the Flesh yet? and a stranger to the
Spirit of Christ, and unconcern'd at the
solemn Protestations of God, that they
that are in the Flesh cannot please God,
and that he that hath not the Spirit of
Christ, is none of his? Is that thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
which ought to be thy sorrow?
or shall that serve as an Apology, which
deserves thy deep Repentance?</p>
               <p>Ay, But I have such provocations gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me, that Flesh and Blood is not able
to endure them; the meekest Man alive
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:108689:104"/>
could not forbear being in a passion, if
he had to deal with such Men as I have.
Ah Christian! Christian did I say, thou
art none, till thou studiest Meekness;
yet I know, thou art proud of that
Name, and be it so. Christian, how
willing art thou to believe, that none is
truly meek, because thou art not! How
willing to believe that none hath such
provocations as thou hast, and that
none is able to bear them, because thou
art loath to endure them! Doubt not,
vain Man, there have been, and are
thousands in the World, that with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
calmness of mind have born, and
do bear far more than ever thou hadst
occasion to bear; What? Doest thou
think thy God commands thee impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities?
Dost thou take him to be so
hard a Master, that he bids thee remove
Mountains, and gives thee no strength
to touch them with one of thy Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers?</p>
               <p>There are means, which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously
used will curb thy raging
Passions, and turn thy Wrath and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
into the Meekness of a Lamb, and
they are these following.</p>
               <p>1. Next to fervent and importunate
Prayer, which must ever be used in all
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:108689:105"/>
Attainments of Vertue, great Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
must be used; Consideration I
mean of the Dignity and Excellency of
this Vertue, and the Deformity, and
unseemliness of its opposite Anger, and
Wrath, and inordinate Passion. What
harmony, what sweetness, what excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Musick doth this Meekness cause in
the Soul; what disorder, what confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
doth anger stir up in that noble part?
How amiable is the one, how detestable
the other. Behold an angry Man, what
a disfigured Creature is he? The Picture
is loathsome, and the Shape abominable.</p>
               <p>2. When you find the passion of anger
stirring in you be silent, say nothing,
do nothing till that inward heat be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and then speak, and do what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Religion, and Conscience shall
dictate. It was very good advice of
<hi>Athenodorus</hi> to <hi>Augustus</hi> the Emperour,
whenever he was angry with a Man,
to repeat the four and twenty Letters of
the Alphabet, before he proceeded to
the Execution of the sentence; for he
thought by that time, his thoughts
would be cooler, and he would judge
better.</p>
               <p>3. Think of the many peremptory
Commands, that press this Meekness
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:108689:105"/>
upon you, <hi>Eph.</hi> IV. 2. <hi>Col.</hi> III. 12. <hi>Matth.</hi>
XI. 28, 29. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> II. 21, 22. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
III. 4. Surely these Commands were not
given in vain; and did you reflect what
the Name Christian imports, not to go
to Church, not to profess the Gospel,
not to call your selves Protestants, but
to live up to the Commands of Christ
Jesus, your Lord, and your God, and
how he protests, that he will own none
for his Disciple or Follower, that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to do what he Commands. Such
serious reflections would work upon you,
make you venture all to arrive to this
grace, the rather, because while you
live in neglect of this Vertue, you live
in sin, and to live in sin is a state of
Enmity against God, and is this the
Coat of God's Children?</p>
               <p>4. The Example of Christ hath mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and perswaded others to this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and can it not move you? Behold
that Lamb of God, who endured grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
reproaches, injuries, calumnies? yet
like a Sheep before his Shearers, he was
dumb. It's true, he calls the Pharisees
sometimes Fools, and blind Guides, and
Serpents, and a Generation of Vipers;
but these are only just Descriptions of
the Nature of those Beasts, not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:108689:106"/>
of a disorderly Passion. In affronts
offered to his Person, how calm, how
gentle was that Lamb! Behold the scene
of his sufferings, and you will see this
Truth written with Sun-beams. Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
that are now in Heaven have been
wrought upon by this great Example,
and shall it have no influence upon you?
Strange! you should hope to be saved
by him, and neglect the way he hath
appointed in order to Salvation.</p>
               <p>5. Take heed of a rash misconstruing
of your Neighbour's words and actions
Nothing provokes to passion sooner
than such misinterpretations. Either
this Man said so to reflect upon you, or
he did not bow low enough before you,
or he did not shew you that Civility he
ought, or he did such a thing to express
his contempt of your Person, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Put fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
constructions on your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's
Deportment toward you, and
you will prevent those Fits of Anger,
which now you fall into to the scandal
of others, and the ruine of your Souls.</p>
               <p>6. Consider how profitable this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is; profitable to others who will
sooner hearken to you, and listen to
your advice, when deliver'd with Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
you will edifie them, engage them
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:108689:106"/>
to praise God for the grace which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd
upon you; profitable to your
selves, it will be a safe-guard to you,
you will not only enjoy what you have
more quietly, but you will be able to
bear adversity better when it comes;
and we know that God very often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
these Acts of Meekness with tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Hearts of Enemies toward the
Meek into mercy, and compassion.</p>
               <p>To this purpose I remember a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
in <hi>Moschus,</hi> of a certain pious old
Man, when some Thieves broke into his
House, the good Man stood silent by,
while the Barbarians rifled his Coffers;
having taken what they thought fit,
they departed; but the old Man spying
a Bag of Money, they had either over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd,
or forgotten to take with them,
he runs out and calls after them, that
they had left something of value be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them, and there it was if they
would come back and fetch it. The
Thieves looking upon it as raillery, or
mockery had no mind to return; but
Curiosity at last prevail'd with them to
go and see whether the Man were in
good earnest, and finding him real in
what he said, they were so confounded
with the calmness and meekness of the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:108689:107"/>
Man, that they restored him all they
had robb'd him of, and cry'd out, this
is a good Man indeed. I conclude with
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s obtestation, <hi>Eph.</hi> IV. 30, 31, 32.
<hi>Grieve not the holy spirit of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ye are sealed unto the day of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Let all bitterness, and wrath, and
clamour, and evil-speaking, be put away
from you with all malice. And be ye kind
one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving
one another, even as God for Christ's sake
hath forgiven you.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>There is nothing more common in
Scripture, than to express the
Doctrine or Lessons God hath thought
fit to reveal to us, by Meat, and Bread,
and Food, and Milk, and Wine, and
Water; and our docility or readiness
to imbibe, or digest, and obey these
Lessons by eating and drinking; all
which is done on purpose, to give us
clearer, and livelier apprehensions of
things spiritual and unseen, and as our
knowledge comes by our senses; so by
those external Objects and Actions, to
lead us to higher thoughts, sublimer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:108689:108"/>
This being so, we need not
wonder to find our Saviour speaking
here of a hunger and thirst after Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
for this is but a continuation
of the same Metaphor, for though hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and thirst be properly the office and
function of the Body, yet there being
an appetite in the Soul which is very
like it, Christ chuses to express it by
these known natural actions or inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And lest this hunger and thirst
should be interpreted as a punishment
rather than a mercy; the God-like
Preacher here not only pronounces a
blessing upon it, but encourages to it
by a very weighty and precious promise
in the Text, <hi>Blessed are they which do
hunger and thirst after righteousness, for
they shall be filled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THree things, call them Doctrines, or
Propositions, or Conclusions, or what
you will, are here suggested to us.</p>
            <p>I. That there is a hunger and thirst
after Righteousness, which is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable.</p>
            <p>II. Without this hunger and thirst af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Righteousness, a man cannot be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
or happy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:108689:108"/>
III. The happiness of those who do
hunger and thirst after Righteousness,
consists in being filled.</p>
            <p>I. There is a hunger and thirst after
Righteousness, which is very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.
That's as little as a man can ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the Text; this State being
pronounc'd blessed, that Blessedness
makes it commendable at least. By
Righteousness here, some do piously un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
Christ Jesus, who is call'd,
<hi>The Lord our Righteousness,</hi> Jer. XXIII. 6.
and is said to be made unto us of God,
<hi>Righteousness,</hi> 1 Cor. I. 30. and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
why he is called so, are,</p>
            <p>1. Because he is the Fountain of all
Righteousness.</p>
            <p>2. Because he is the Author of that
Righteousness which is in us.</p>
            <p>3. Because by his perfect righteousness,
he covers the accidental and unallow'd
of defects of our sincere, though imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Righteousness. And no doubt they
that truly hunger and thirst after Christ,
desirous to be taught by him, as their
Prophet; to be saved by him, as their
Priest; and to be ruled by him, as their
King, may be said to be in a blessed State;
but though the word here used, may
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:108689:109"/>
lawfully be applied to Christ, yet this
cannot be the direct sense of it in this
place, where Christs design is to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
all the Graces a Christian is to be
adorn'd with; and therefore by Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
here, must be meant the whole
circle of Vertues, the whole compass of
Goodness, which a Christian is capable
of on this side Heaven, and this is the
common acceptation of the word, and
in this sense we find it oppos'd to a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
life in general, <hi>Rom.</hi> VI. 20. <hi>When
you were servants of sin, you were free
from righteousness,</hi> and this Righteousness
is afterward, <hi>v.</hi> 22. call'd <hi>becoming ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of God, and having our fruit unto
holiness.</hi> The righteous man is indeed
represented in Scripture, as a just man
in his dealings: and Righteousness stands
often for doing justice, and rendring to
all their due, and doing every man
right; but it is not with an intent to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
the other vertues from it, but
to shew, that the good man, who is
faithfull and conscientious in his worship
and doing the will of God, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vertues which he practiseth, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
this also, and doth by others as he
would have others do by him. So that
by Righteousness here, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:108689:109"/>
an universal Goodness in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
and relations, whereby both the
outward and inward man becomes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
subject to God; and without it
he cannot be said to deal justly and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously
with God; and after this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
it is that a hunger and thirst
is commended here, which hunger and
thirst imports,</p>
            <p>1. A great sense, that there is no true
satisfaction either in sin, or in a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carnal life. This we must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suppose; for how should a man hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or thirst after Righteousness, except
he be sensible, that here is not his rest
neither in sin nor in the contentments of
this present world, these being the grand
impediments of that Righteousness.
That's the reason why men, who place
their chiefest happiness in sublunary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,
have nothing of this hunger
and thirst after Righteousness, till they
become sensible of the vanity of this
world, and the danger of a sinfull life,
their appetite after Righteousness is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant,
nor can their feeble wishes
be call'd so, but when they have a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
view of the rottenness of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
they have sailed in; then they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and desire this plank to swim out of
the gulph of perdition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:108689:110"/>
2. It imports a high esteem of this
Righteousness and Goodness, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, it's impossible to hunger and
thirst after it, for men do not use
to long after things they do not value,
nor are their desires very strong after
objects they see no satisfaction in. A
man hungry and thirsty, prizes the
meat and drink that is before him, so
must he the righteousness we speak of
that doth truly hunger and thirst after
it. If he doth not prize it above Gold,
and Silver, and Pearls, and precious
Stones, his hunger and thirst after it
cannot be considerable, but when he
comes to count all things dross and dung
in comparison of it, then he is most
likely to hunger and thirst after it.</p>
            <p>3. It imports a very earnest desire to
be righteous and good in all points. Such
a desire, as men very hungry and thirsty
have after meat and drink, and that
we know is not very faint. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
therefore expresses by a very em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical
similitude, <hi>Psal.</hi> XLII. 1. <hi>As
the Hart pants after the water brooks, so
panteth my soul after thee, O God.</hi> The
Hart or Stag is a creature naturally hot,
but being chas'd and hunted, his desire
after the cooling streams becomes more
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:108689:110"/>
earnest and vehement; and such must
be this desire after righteousness, even
as it is, <hi>Psal.</hi> LXIII. 1. <hi>My soul thirsteth,
my flesh longs for thee in a dry Land,</hi> i. e.
as a man or traveller spent with the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
or the trouble of his journey in a dry
land where no water is. These expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
import a very strong desire, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
which hath no reserves, no sinister
ends and designs, but is sincere, and
lively, and vigorous, and importunate,
which will not be denied, and prevails
by its fervour and importunity.</p>
            <p>4. It imports actual and earnest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to be truly good and righteous,
by a diligent and conscientious use of
the proper means. We do not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a man that talks of having a thing,
or pretends his heart set upon it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in good earnest, if his endeavours
be not suitable to his desires. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
or Trades-man that desires to be
rich, we know what pains they take;
nay the Day-Labourer that desires a
livelihood. So he that hungers and
thirsts after Righteousness indeed, will
enquire, and hear, and read the word of
God, and ponder it in his mind, and
pray hard, and deny himself, and break
off from loose Company, and meditate,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:108689:111"/>
and think, and shun occasions of evil,
and follow God, as the man in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
did his Neighbour at Midnight for
three Loaves, and will leave no stone
unturn'd, to compass this Goodness
and Righteousness, as a man who is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hungry or thirsty doth not sit still,
but bestirs himself to get Food and
Drink which he stands in need of.</p>
            <p>5. It imports a Progress in this hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and thirst, and when we are arrived
to such a degree of Righteousness, then
to hunger, and thirst, and endeavour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
higher degrees of it. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
are those frequent exhortations,
<hi>Grow in Grace, and see that ye abound
more and more in faith, in love, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:</hi>
And give all diligence to add to
your <hi>faith, vertue; unto vertue, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
unto knowledge, temperance; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
temperance, godliness; unto godliness,
patience; unto patience, brotherly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and unto brotherly kindness, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
1 Thess. III. 12. IV. 1. 2. Pet. I.
5, 6, 7. II. 18. A Christians labour,
like the Husbandmans, is never at an
end; when one lust is mortified, he
must begin to subdue and mortifie ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and when he hath made one ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
his domestick, he must take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:108689:111"/>
into his Family. The hunger and
thirst here spoken of, is not a momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
appetite, which is to last for a day,
or so; but an appetite perpetual, which
is to run through the whole course of
our lives, and which is still encreas'd
by being filled; insomuch that if a good
Christian were to live here a thousand
years, he would still find degrees and
acts of Righteousness to hunger and
thirst after.</p>
            <p>6. It imports such a spiritual hunger
and thirst, or such a desire after Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
as is content to undergo and
endure bodily hunger and thirst, and
other temporal inconveniencies both
for the attainment and preservation of
it. He that is loath to be at any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for it, or unwilling to abridge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in any thing that's pleasing to the
flesh either for the gaining of it, or
the maintaining of it, hath but a weak
appetite after it, to be sure no such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
as the man of honour hath after
worldly Glory, who can dispence with
scratch'd faces, with scars, and wounds,
and hard lodging, and puddle-water,
and a homely dyet, and all to attain to
an empty name of a valiant man. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
righteousness deserves as generous a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:108689:112"/>
desire; we see what men will do in a
Famine, even venture reproach, and
contempt, and being abused, and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
to get food convenient; such must
be this hunger and thirst after Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:
for to be truly righteous, a
Christian must reckon upon afflictions,
persecutions, and calumnies, and nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names,
and being laught at; and he
that longs for the fragrant Rose, must
not stand upon its being encompass'd
with pricks, but resolve out of love to
the one, to dispense with the other. And
that which enforces the duty, is the</p>
            <p>II. Proposition, That without this
hunger and thirst after Righteousness, a
man cannot be blessed or happy. As
the former Proposition made this hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and thirst commendable, so this
makes it absolutely necessary; for if he
is blessed who hungers and thirsts, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
he is not so that wants this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite.
And that there is no true bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
without it, will appear from
the following considerations.</p>
            <p>1. Without this hunger and thirst the
Soul is sick, as much as we conclude
a man is not well, when his appetite is
gone, nay if he have no appetite at all
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:108689:112"/>
we conclude him dead. A Carkass hath
not appetite, and most certainly, he
that hath no hunger and thirst after
Righteousness at all, is dead in God's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
dead in Law, dead in the Law
of the Gospel, a sad condition, and
which deserves to have the Motto of
the Plague written over it, <hi>Lord have
mercy upon him.</hi> The Scripture gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
makes him who is dead to Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
a very miserable man, gives
so dismal an account of him, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be supposed more wretched.
You know the Parable of the Prodigal,
till he got a hunger and thirst after Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
the holy Ghost represents
him as a very contemptible person, as
one sent <hi>into the field to keep swine, and
that would have fill'd his belly with the
husks the swine did feed on, but none
gave unto him,</hi> Luke XV. 14, 15. nay
v. 32. he is pronounced <hi>a dead man,</hi>
dead to the favour of God, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of God's Spirit, and to any right
to the precious promises of the Gospel;
so is the man that hath no hunger at
all after Righteousness, and if his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
to it be weak and feeble; still its an
argument of sickness, and neither the
one nor the other is a sign of bliss and
happiness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:108689:113"/>
2. He that doth not hunger or thirst
after Righteousness, is a Fool, so <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> I. 7. For the wisdom
he speaks of there, is this Righteousness,
and he that despises it, <hi>hates his own
soul, and loves death, Prov.</hi> VIII. 36.
than which there cannot be a greater
argument of madness, and surely this
is no sign of blessedness. Wisdom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
such a man hath, who is a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to this hunger and thirst, but it is
<hi>earthy, sensual, devilish,</hi> Jam. III. I5.
<hi>Earthy,</hi> i. e. he minds nothing but earth,
his contrivances are altogether how to
compass the contents and pleasures of
this life, the world is his highest and
chiefest good, the fashions of this world
are the rules of his life; he governs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by the punctilio's of State, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and worldly Policy; he doth as
the world doth, and what worldly men
say or do, he imitates, and in endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
after temporal advantages, he stands
not upon the stricter rules of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is sensual too,</hi> all his caterings are
for the flesh, and how to live easie and
delicately is all his care. He suffers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be discourag'd from things truly
good by carnal reasons; and if his flesh
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:108689:113"/>
and carnal desires be but gratified,
he is pleased, and more than pleased,
than with all the comforts of the Holy
Ghost. His flesh is his sovereign, and
the Lord that rules in him, and its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
are the Law he lives by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is devilish too,</hi> for having no hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
no thirst after Righteousness, the
Devil is his friend, his companion,
though he sees him not, but he may
feel him by the suggestions which he
yields to, and whereby his mind is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
vain, and averse from real Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
That <hi>Aversion</hi> comes by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
Instigation, and in rellishing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what pleads in favour of the
brutish part about him, he suffers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be made a Prisoner, to that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,
becomes his Slave and Captive:
and surely such a man cannot possibly
be happy, and consequently without
this hunger and thirst after Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
the only thing that can make a man
truly wise, a man is a stranger to real
Bliss, to be sure he is not capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enrich'd by the Consolations of God,
nor is God concern'd to fill him in
order to this bliss, which leads me to
the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:108689:114"/>
III. Proposition, <hi>viz.</hi> That the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of those who truly hunger and
thirst after Righteousness, consists in
being filled. Filled! How?</p>
            <p>1. Their very hunger and thirst af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Righteousness shall be and is a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to them. For it is a sign of
Grace, a sign that God loves them, a
sign that he visits them with the favour
he bears to his own people, and that
they are born again; that there is a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
alteration wrought in their natures,
and that their deceitfull lusts and unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desires of the flesh are abated in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to a total destruction. <hi>This hunger
and thirst after Righteousness</hi> being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
in them, is an item that God's
Spirit hath got the better of corrupted
nature, and from hence flows a calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and serenity into their Souls, and
when the enemy beats them out of all
their strong holds, and they can fasten
on nothing to give themselves comfort,
this <hi>hunger and thirst after Righteousness
upholds their hope,</hi> and supports their
confidence, when they are so weakned,
that they dare not pretend to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
<hi>having labour'd more than all;</hi> to the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:108689:114"/>
Apostle's invincible patience under inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in all the Commandments of the Lord
blameless,</hi> to <hi>Anna</hi>'s <hi>serving the Lord with
fasting and prayer Night and Day,</hi> to the
faith of the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> which <hi>grew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,</hi>
to the <hi>Galatians</hi> readiness <hi>to
pluck out their own eyes, and give them to
their Teachers;</hi> or to the Charity of
the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who did to their Power,
nay beyond their Power, though, I say,
the hungry Soul from an humble sense
of her frailty dares not pretend to these
Accomplishments; yet this Hunger and
Thirst after Righteousness, in <hi>the midst
of all assaults of the Devil,</hi> is the sacred
Anchor, which she can make use of,
and thereby preserve her Vessel from
sinking; so that this very Hunger and
Thirst after Righteousness is filling.</p>
            <p>2. They shall be filled with Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
that goodness they did thirst
after, they shall have great store of; all
their faculties shall be filled with it, and
<hi>like the rich ointment poured out on</hi> Aaron's
Head, and running down upon his Beard,
and from thence into the very Skirts of
his cloathing it shall perfume their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and inward Man, and fill both
their Hearts and Lives; what they ask
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:108689:115"/>
for they shall have, what they seek they
shall find, and the Door they knock at
shall be open'd to them. They shall find
goodness growing in them as the Lilies,
and spreading its Roots as the Cedars in
<hi>Libanon; Their desire is, that God may
totally subdue their hearts,</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
their Souls shall become Temples
of the Holy Ghost; they earnestly with,
that every imagination which exalted it
self against the obedience of Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
may become subject to him, and
they shall have their Heart's desire, and
the request of their Lips shall be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them. <hi>They shall be filled with the
spirit</hi> by degrees; so filled, that in time
they shall be abounding in the Work of
the Lord, flourish in the Courts of the
Lord's House, bringing forth fruit in
old Age, till they become full of good
Works, and Alms-deeds as <hi>Dorcas</hi> was,
<hi>Acts</hi> IX. 36. and old Disciples, as <hi>Mnason</hi>
was, <hi>Acts</hi> XXI. 16. <hi>The duties they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
but weakly,</hi> now, they shall perform
with greater vigour, and with their
vertues their comfort shall encrease, and
the consolations of Christ shall abound
in them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> I. 5. Thus they shall
be filled in this Life: But is this promise
ever fulfilled to any? will some say, all
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:108689:115"/>
I shall say is, go and ask those, who hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and thirst after Righteousness, and
they will tell you by Experience in the
Psalmist's Language, <hi>Psal.</hi> LXXXIV. 11.
<hi>The Lord is a Sun, and Shield, he will
give grace and glory, and no good thing
will he with-hold from them, that walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly.</hi>
But this is not all:</p>
            <p>3. They shall be filled in the other
World, with the plenty of God's House,
with the light of his Countenance for
ever; <hi>when their Bodies do drop</hi> from
them, and their Souls shall be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
from this barren Wilderness, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Eden</hi> the Garden of God; and of this
fulness <hi>David</hi> speaks, <hi>Psal.</hi> XVII. 15.
<hi>As for me I shall behold thy face in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
I shall be satisfied when I awake
with thy likeness. They shall be filled
with the Joys of God;</hi> their mouths shall
be filled with laughter, and their tongues
with singing, they shall be filled with the
finest of the Wheat, and with Honey out
of the Rock shall they be satisfied, not
<hi>with material Honey,</hi> not with such Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
as enlightned <hi>Jonatha</hi>'s Eyes, but
with the sweetness of God's glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
for ever: All <hi>their senses,</hi> all their
faculties shall be filled with unspeakable
satisfaction, with water of life that springs
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:108689:116"/>
from the Rock of Ages, for they shall
be filled with <hi>infinite love,</hi> like Vessels
thrown into the Sea, all shall be filled,
and their fulness shall last while the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of goodness and the Ocean of felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
lasts, <hi>i. e.</hi> for ever.</p>

               <p>There are three sorts of Persons, that
in the Close of this Discourse, I must
necessarily speak to.</p>
               <p>I. Those that pretend to hunger and
thirst after Righteousness, but do not.</p>
               <p>II. Such as neither condemn, nor
greatly care for this Hunger and Thirst,
but hanker after something else.</p>
               <p>III. Such as do truly hunger and thirst
after Righteousness, and long to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with it.</p>
               <p>I. Those that pretend to hunger and
thirst after Righteousness, but do not.</p>
               <p>There is scarce a Vertue we speak of
but there are several that flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that they are possess'd of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have something like it: There
are few of you I believe so harden'd, as
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:108689:116"/>
to have a total Aversion, or an utter ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency
from all goodness; many have
some general desires after it; but if these
cold, general, indifferent desires be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for this Hunger and Thirst after
Righteousness, what gross mistakes must
you needs run into!</p>
               <p>Cold desires certainly do not deserve
the Name of Hunger and Thirst; to be
sure no such Hunger and Thirst, as I
have described in the Premises. What?
Shall we believe your Hunger and Thirst
after goodness real; when we see no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
no fruits, no signs of it? I suppose
if you have this Hunger and Thirst, you
have withal a great sense of the danger
of a sinfull and carnal Life, and a very
high Esteem of Righteousness, and your
desires after it are vehement and pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and your endeavours to get it are
great, and strong, and you make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious
use of the proper means; and
when you are come up to any degree of
goodness, you hunger and thirst and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to extend the borders of your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and you are not frighted with the
inconveniencies that may attend the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of it, for these are the ingredients
of this sacred Appetite. What? Shall
we take painted Fire for that which is
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:108689:117"/>
in motion? Or shall we call that Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and Thirst, which wants the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Characters? Do we take a Man of
Straw for a rational Creature?</p>
               <p>Ay! But, saith the self-conceited Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
I am sure I have it, for I desire to
pay every Man their own, to defraud
and wrong no body, and to live honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
among my Neighbours. But, why?
Is this all the Righteousness God stands
upon? What? Is one link of the sacred
Chain of Graces, the whole Chain? Is
one step of the way the full length of it?
Do all the other Vertues stand for Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers?
Is all that the Gospel requires,
comprehended in this one qualification,
Moral honesty?</p>
               <p>No, no; you do not truly hunger and
thirst after any one Vertue, if you do
not hunger after all; if your Hunger and
Thirst after Righteousness be right, you
will enquire, and take notice, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
what things are good, and just,
and honest, and pure, and lovely, and
of a good Report, and be enamour'd
with them. You will not speak of your
spiritual wants slightly, such as, <hi>we all
have all our failings, and God amend us
all, &amp;c.</hi> but with some inpatience to have
them supplied, you will hunger and thirst
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:108689:117"/>
after all the Graces of God's Spirit, not
only after Justice, or Chastity, or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
but after a lively Faith and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and Charity, and Humility, and
Fervour, and Love, and Obedience, and
a truly spiritual Temper; and after high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Degrees of all these; and your Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and Thirst will be seen, and known
by your industry and care, and labour,
and <hi>cautiousness of sinning,</hi> and resisting
of Temptations, and by Groans, which
cannot be uttered, and by your <hi>unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Attempts</hi> to climb the Hill of God,
and not to give over till you come to
the Top of it; and then expect the
Blessing of my Text. <hi>Blessed are they
which hunger and thirst after Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
for they shall be filled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. Those who neither care for, nor
condemn this spiritual Hunger and Thirst,
but hunger and thirst after something
else, even after the sweet and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Enjoyments, the Riches, the Honours,
and the Pleasures of this present World;
if they could but have such a Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
or so much a Year, or such a
Place, or such an Office, or live as such
a one lives, they would desire no more,
and this is all they hunger and thirst af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:108689:118"/>
O how happy should they be!
But such Persons I would ask, whether
they believe they have nothing but
Body and Flesh about them. Are your
Souls made for God, created for his
Service, design'd for Heaven, fitted for
an Eternal Duration, redeem'd with the
Blood of Jesus Christ, and is there no
regard to be had to these? <hi>What can make
them happy,</hi> but Righteousness? What
can satisfie them, but real Goodness?
What can fill or feed them, but the love
of God? This World cannot satisfie
them, you see it, you know it, Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is demonstration; for when you
have got as much as you can, and come
to lie upon your Death-beds, you find,
they want some other Food; <hi>Food,</hi>
which all the World cannot give; Food,
which none can give but he, who hath
protested, that without Holiness no Man
shall see his Face. <hi>Righteousness is their
life, their cordial, their nourishment,</hi> and
without this they die, without this they
are lost, and all that you can do cannot
keep them from being miserable. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>this Food they starve,</hi> and while you
deny them this Meat, you murther
them. If the World, or the Enjoyments
of it be all you are to hunger and thirst
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:108689:118"/>
after, these Souls were given in vain,
and God who gave them lost his aime:
I do not deny but you may lawfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
an honest livelihood in the World,
with submission to God's Providence,
and wish for Necessaries and Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies;
but the Word is, <hi>seek ye first
God's Kingdom, and its Righteousness, and
all other things shall be added to you,</hi>
Matth. VI. 33. It's this must have your
Hunger and Thirst: The desires after ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Comforts of this life, must have
the other's leavings: <hi>Nay you will never
hunger and thirst after Righteousness,</hi> as
ye should, till you mind the World less,
and moderate, and qualifie your greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
after it; for your <hi>strong desires after
the satisfactions</hi> of this World, will infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
drown your earnest Desires after
Righteousness, whatever opinion you
may have of your skill to keep the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
even. <hi>To be strongly carried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them both, is a thing,</hi> as hard to
conceive, and as hard to do as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
contradictions. There is such
an opposition betwixt Heaven and Earth,
that a Man may as soon serve and please
two contrary Masters, as be fond of both
at the same time. Therefore <hi>whoever
they be of you,</hi> that are very sharp set
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:108689:119"/>
upon the Wealth and Honour, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the World; your Appetite after
Righteousness, must be flat and dull, and
thus it will be to your dying Day, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
your desires after the Pomp and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of this World be kept under, and
brought into subjection.</p>
               <p>III. Those who truly hunger and thirst
after Righteousness, and I must boldly
say, for my Text warrants me to do so,
you shall be filled: <hi>Blessed are ye that,
&amp;c.</hi> How you shall be filled, I have
shewed already; and I doubt not, but
such hungry and thirsty Souls do find by
blessed Experience, that this very Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and Thirst after Righteousness is
pleasing, that God doth certainly give
his Holy Spirit to them that seriously
ask it, and gives more grace to them,
that earnestly seek it, and greater strength
against Temptations to them that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately
beg it, and greater support
to those that will not be satisfied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, and greater light to them that
supplicate for it, as they would do for
their lives: <hi>May be some of you find,</hi> that
their Hunger and Thirst after Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is not so strong, so lively as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it was; if so, the causes of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:108689:119"/>
must be search'd into; and if suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your affections to run out after the
World too much hath been the cause of
it, they must be checkt in their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer,
and reduced into the right way
again; if a vanity or secret Lust hath
beguiled your Minds, that must be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss'd
without Mercy; if want of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hath caused it, a fresh view must
be taken of the Excellency, Beauty and
glorious Consequences of this Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness;
if melancholy, or some other
bodily Distemper hath occasion'd it,
God must be considered as a Father, who
will not turn a Child that's weak and
sickly out of Doors: However, in the
first Conversion, this Hunger and Thirst
after Goodness is ever more vehement
and brisk, than afterward, when the
surprize of Grace and Mercy is over,
and the blazing Flame turns into a
more gentle Fire, but this must not
fright you. If your present Hunger and
Thirst after Righteousness hath the same
Effects, which the former desire had,
<hi>i. e.</hi> if it makes your obedience grow;
if it both confirms and enlarges your
respect to the Commands of your
Lord and Master, let not the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the former Flame discourage
you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:108689:120"/>
Look up to that God, who hath said,
<hi>Open thy mouth wide and I will fill it.</hi>
Search what Graces, what Perfections,
what spiritual Ornaments you want,
and quicken your Hunger and Thirst af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, and rest confident, that God
will satisfie the longing Soul, and fill
the thirsty Soul with goodness. But
<hi>whatever fulness you may want here,</hi> doubt
not, but Heaven will complete it. Your
Souls will there be filled, and your Cup
will run over; there you will be filled
with the Rivers of God's pleasure, fill'd
with Eternal light, fill'd with the truest
Wisdom, fill'd with Universal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
the Glory of the Lord will <hi>fill
the heavenly Tabernacle,</hi> and you in the
midst of it. In the Tabernacle of old,
his Glory that filled it, appeared in a
Cloud; in the Heavenly Sanctuary it
will appear in the sweetest Light and
Splendour. <hi>Job complain'd,</hi> that his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
had <hi>filled</hi> his Face with wrinkles,
poor Man! but <hi>these,</hi> you need not fear
in that place; where he that is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lovely, will present you to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
blameless, without spot or wrinkle,
or any such thing. <hi>Here your faces are
sometimes filled with shame,</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of your falls and slips; there they
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:108689:120"/>
will be fill'd with Joy and Gladness:
<hi>There</hi> you <hi>need not fear,</hi> that God, as
rich Men do the poor sometimes on
Earth, will dismiss you with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
<hi>Depart in peace,</hi> be ye <hi>filled,</hi>
be ye <hi>warmed,</hi> but you will be <hi>filled</hi> with
all the fulness of God, it must needs be so,
for in his presence there is fulness of joy,
and pleasure, at his Right-hand for ever
more.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A Mmianus Marcellinus,</hi> a grave Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Writer, taking notice of the
differences among Christians in matters
of Religion, and the hatred one Sect
bore to another, and the Tumults that
were caused at the Election of Bishops,
and the Blood that was spilt upon that
account, hath a very unlucky Expression
concerning it; There are saith he no
wild Beasts so cruel, or so barbarous one
to another, as some of these Christian
Sects are to those, that differ from
them in opinion; a very sad Character
this, and <hi>Pudeat haec de nobis, &amp;c.</hi> It
is a shame, that Heathens and Infidels
should have occasion given them to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:108689:121"/>
speak so reproachfully of this Noble
Religion.</p>
            <p>But surely, this cannot be the fault of
Religion but of the proud, and chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
Men, who profess it, or have the
management of it. Christ their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
never taught them to do so. His
Precepts run in another strain; they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of another <hi>Genius;</hi> No command
of cruelty, or animosity is to be found
in all the Gospel; so far from a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
that the very appearances of it
are forbidden. Mercy and Charity is
the Soul, the Breath of those lively Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;
Mercy is the Language of that
Book, and to Mercy runs the Promise
of the Text; <hi>Blessed are the merciful, for
they shall obtain mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the understanding of which words,
I shall</p>
            <p>I. Give you a true description of the
mercifull.</p>
            <p>II. Explain to you the reason of the

            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:108689:122"/>
I. To give you a true description of
the mercifull, we must search into the
nature of Mercy, and in doing so, we
shall find this vertue to be of a vast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
insomuch that there is none so
mean in the world, that can justly plead
impossibility of practising it upon the
account of his circumstances in the world,
all being capable, all able, one way or
other to exercise it. And,</p>
            <p>1. One principal ingredient of this
mercifull temper, is a compassionate
heart, or an inward pity and compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
at the sight or hearing of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
of others; and therefore we are
expresly call'd upon to put on
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Bowels of Mercy,</hi> Col. III. 12.</p>
            <p>This is so necessary, that without it
the most pompous external Acts of
Mercy, prove fruitless and ineffectual;
at least the Apostle seems to intimate
so much in that known passage, <hi>Though
I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and
have not Charity, I am nothing,</hi> 1 Cor.
XIII. 3. Where by Charity must be meant
true Christian pity and compassion, which
may be absent from the most stately
beneficence; for a Man may give all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
in a humour, or in a <hi>bravado,</hi> or
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:108689:122"/>
when he can keep his Riches no longer,
or out of a design to get himself a
Name, which makes the Charity no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worth, because destitute of true
inward pity. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> of old look'd
upon inward pity as a thing below a
rational Man; doing good and actual
liberality to Men in distress, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
was a wise Man's part, but to be
troubled within for the Calamity of any
Man, whether friend or stranger, they
said, became not a Man of reason. But
in this, they talk'd like Mad-men more
than Philosophers. Neither reason, nor
Christianity destroy the inward affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Soul; both teach indeed to
moderate and curb them, or to keep
them within bounds, but do not era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate,
or pull them up. Christ there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
whose business it was by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to shew the way to perfection,
was touch'd with inward pity; so he
commiserated <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when dead, and
the People who were ready to faint for
want of Bread, and the Multitude that
were scatter'd abroad like Sheep without
a Shepherd; and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> when her
Ruine was approaching, and his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as well as God's will in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
warrant a moderate inward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:108689:123"/>
and a compassionate resentment of
our Neighbour's Calamity. But here
Mercy rests not, if it be in a Capacity of
going farther: And therefore,</p>
            <p>2. There is required in the Exercise
of this Vertue an actual relief of our
calamitous and miserable Neighbour.
The Compliment St. <hi>James</hi> speaks of,
<hi>James</hi> II. 16. <hi>Depart you, be you warmed,
and filled, without giving such things, as
are needfull for the body,</hi> is perfect mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Poor, and of God too, who
made them so, that they might be assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
by the gifts and beneficence of the
wealthier sort. The particulars of the
Mercy, that is to be shewn to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
or Temporal Concerns of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
Neighbours, are commonly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in that Latin Verse;
<q>Visito, poto, cibo, redimo, tego, colligo,
condo.</q>
               <hi>i. e.</hi> Visiting them, when sick or in
prison, and contributing to their Cure,
when distemper'd according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Example, <hi>Acts</hi> XXVIII. 8, 9. and <hi>James</hi>
I. 27. giving them drink, when thirsty,
<hi>Rom.</hi> XII. 20. and feeding them, when
hungry, <hi>Acts</hi> XVI. 34. rescuing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:108689:123"/>
them from danger, if it be in
our Power, and the deliverance be just,
<hi>Acts</hi> XX. 10, 12. covering their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and giving them Cloaths, when
they have none, <hi>Acts</hi> IX. 39. receiving
them into our Houses, or providing
lodging and harbour for them, when
they have no place to rest in, <hi>Acts</hi> XVI.
15. and burying them decently, when
they leave, or have no means, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the Expences of their Funerals,
<hi>Acts</hi> VIII. 12. These are some of the
principal Acts of that Mercy, which is
due to the Bodies of our miserable Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
indeed we find them specified by
our Saviour himself, <hi>Matth.</hi> XXV. 35, 36.
and so great a stress laid upon them, that
they are made the chief Subject of the
last Assizes. But this is not all; and
therefore,</p>
            <p>3. Mercy must also be shewn to the
Souls of our necessitous Brethren, as we
find them oppress'd with sin and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
and the particular Duties of this
Mercy also, we find summon'd up in that
old Verse.

such, that he cannot relieve the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
wants of his Neighbour, may be in
a condition to redress his Spiritual; and
indeed where this Spiritual mercy takes
effect, and that the admonitions and
entreaties, and reproofs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> work a
Reformation in him, it proves one of
the greatest Mercies in the World, for
it is no less than saving a Soul from
death, <hi>James</hi> V. 20. But,</p>
            <p>4. This Mercy runs out into more
Branches still, and there are some higher
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:108689:124"/>
degrees of it, which mercifull Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in all Ages have justly thought
themselves obliged to exercise, and such
is particularly our relieving others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>askt,
and preventing the wishes and sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations
of the Needy by our Aims,
and Liberalities. It is therefore recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Eternal Praise of <hi>Onesiphorus,</hi>
2 Tim. I. 16, 17. That when he was at
<hi>Rome</hi> he sought out St. <hi>Paul</hi> very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
to minister to his Necessities.
Some niggardly Christians, whose Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
lies all in hearing and talking, when
they have hints given them of their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
Neglect of this Mercy, are very
apt to excuse themselves with this Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that they know no objects of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
A pitifull shift! Did you ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
did you ever consult with your pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Neighbours, or some charitable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine?
If you did, your ignorance would
soon be cured. When Christians under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
themselves better, they did not wait
to be courted to this Mercy. The Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>Antioch,</hi> Acts XI. 29. when they
did but fear a Famine, they presently and
chearfully determin'd every Man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his ability, to send relief to the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
which dwelt in <hi>Judaea,</hi> and of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Generosity St. <hi>Austin</hi> understands
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:108689:125"/>
that saying of the Psalmist, <hi>Ps.</hi> XLI. 1.
<hi>Blessed is he that considereth the poor,</hi> i. e.
He that prevents the poor Man's cry,
and the Original will very well bear it,
for there it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Maschil:</hi> He that
gives his mind to think, how he may
do good to his poor Neighbour; or he
that judiciously regards the distressed
Man, which implies doing good before
we are put in mind of it. Some whom
Providence hath reduced to a very low
condition, are bashfull and ashamed to
beg, or to make their wants known,
but their Neighbours see and perceive,
how hard it is with them, and what
shifts they make to subsist; to enquire
and to find out such objects, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them before they ask, this is Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
like, and becoming those whom
God hath given a liberal Portion, and a
liberal Heart, and is an Argument, that
we have right apprehensions of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of our Religion, which bids us go
beyond Scribes and Pharisees, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
and the sinners of the World, in
our Mercy.</p>
            <p>5. There is yet a higher Act of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and that is denying our selves even
in necessaries, and other advantages, that
we may be the better able to succour
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:108689:125"/>
others in distress. This must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have been the Case of the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Christians; who to their Power, nay
beyond their Power, express'd their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to the Churches of <hi>Judaea,</hi> 2 Cor.
VIII. 3. <hi>i. e.</hi> denied themselves even in
necessaries for their Brethren's good.
This denying and abridging our selves
in necessaries, and laying by the price
of them, that we may be in a better
condition to shew Mercy, as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
at all times, so it becomes a
very great Duty when the Church of
God is under Persecution, and Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of our Fellow-Christians suffer for
Righteousness sake. This was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why the Primitive believers sold
their Lands and Possessions, and brought
the Price of them, and laid them at the
Apostle's Feet, that distribution might
be made to all as they had need, <hi>Acts</hi>
IV. 34, 35. To deny our selves in super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities,
in order to be the better able to
shew Mercy, is far from being the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
limit of this Mercy: The Love of
God being shed abroad in the Soul, will
constrain the Soul to do it in times of
Peace and Prosperity; but self-denial in
necessaries is a Duty peculiar to a time,
when our Brethren, and such as are of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:108689:126"/>
the Houshold of Faith, like the Prophets
of old, are forced to <hi>wander about in
Sheep-skins, and Goat-skins, being desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
tormented, afflicted,</hi> as it is said,
<hi>Heb.</hi> XI. 37.</p>
            <p>6. The highest Act of Mercy, is to
lay down our lives for our Brethren,
and of this St. <hi>John</hi> speaks as a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Duty, 1 <hi>John</hi> III. 16. <hi>Hereby perceive
we the love of God, because he laid down
his life for us, and we ought also to lay
down our lives for the Brethren.</hi> This
Act of Mercy is chiefly to be shewn in
times of publick Danger; where it is so,
that by our dying we may save a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Christians alive, or contribute
signally to the Welfare and Prosperity
of God's Church, or preserve some emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Instruments of God's Glory, who
may do much good in their Generation:
The ancient Christians were loath to be
out-done by Heathens in their Heroick
Attempts, and since there was much
talk in Heathenish History of <hi>Pylades,</hi>
offering to die for <hi>Orestes,</hi> though that
was only an effect of carnal Affection,
and perhaps of vain Glory too; yet
they thought themselves unworthy of
the Name they bore, if they did not
whenever there was occasion, shew a
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:108689:126"/>
readiness to die one for another, and of
this we have a remarkable instance in
<hi>Aquila,</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> of whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
bears witness, that for his sake they
laid down their own Necks, <hi>Rom.</hi> XVI. 4.
This Act of Mercy, it's true, is out of
the common road, and there is seldom
occasion to practise it, but if there should
be such an opportunity, it's a glorious
Death, and such as a pious Man would
even be glad of, it being a Transcript
of the Death of the Son of God for us;
and Mercy can go no higher. It's like
some of you will wonder at these Acts
of Mercy, and fancy that I strain the
Vertue too high; but the proofs I have
brought for all that I have said, will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
confute that conceit. Mercy
is a very excellent Vertue, so excellent,
that without it there is no true Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which is the second thing, I am to
speak to,</p>
            <p>II. When the mercifull are pronounc'd
blessed here, a very ordinary capacity
may soon inferr, that he, who is not
mercifull cannot be blessed, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are these.</p>
            <p>1. How should a Man be happy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being mercifull, when in not being
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:108689:127"/>
so, he acts below the Dignity of Man.
Notwithstanding the Fall, Man is still a
very excellent Creature. The very Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines
of God's Image in him, even before
the Grace of God transforms and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news
him, will justifie <hi>David</hi>'s Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<hi>Lord what is Man, that thou so
regardest him, and the Son of Man that
thou visitest him?</hi> Even the Reliques of
that perfection, which was once in him,
teach him many admirable things, of
which Mercy is not the least. Nature it
self prompts him to it, and the instances
of it in the very Heathens, make it a
Dictate of the Law of Nature. Now
the Dignity of Man, considered, even
abstractedly from Grace and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
consists in acting according to the
honest Principles of Nature, so that he,
who is not mercifull sins against a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
instinct: The Gospel indeed refines
and exalts this Mercy in him, but still
Nature it self instructs him in it; nay,
Mercy is so riveted into our make, and
frame, that he who neglects it, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches
himself into contempt of it,
unmans himself. God hath furnish'd
other Creatures with Claws and Bills,
and Horns, and Arms, to secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against Assaults; but Man is born
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:108689:127"/>
helpless, without weapons, or defensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
on purpose to let us see the need
he hath of Mercy, and of being merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and helpfull to others of his kind;
so that what I have said stands firm,
that he who is not mercifull, acts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Dignity of Man, for he forgets
the end of his make, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be blessed; so far from being so,
that he makes himself worse than the
Beasts that perish; for even among these
we see so great a resemblance of it, and
the Histories of all Ages confirm it, that
to fall short of it, must be more than
brutish.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>He shall have judgment without
mercy, that shewed no mercy,</hi> saith St.
<hi>James,</hi> Chap. II. 13. And surely, this
can be no blessed Estate. God's method
in punishing, is retaliation, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
the Nature of the Punishment,
to the Nature of Sin, and so it is here;
He that is not mercifull to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
the Judge who is to sit upon him,
at last will shew him no mercy; nay in
the Flames, which by the Judge's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
shall seize him, there will be no
mixture of mercy. Wicked men, who
have been kind and neighbourly, and in
some measure mercifull: though they
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:108689:128"/>
are not capable of Glory and Salvation,
because they die without true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and Reformation of Life; yet
their former Mercy will in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
qualifie their misery in the next
World; some drops of cold Water may
be vouchsafed to them, to take off some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
from the excess of their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but he that shew'd little or no
mercy, will be forced to drink of the
Cup of God's wrath without mixture;
even of the Cup of trembling and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
without the least ingredient
of sweetness, without any interval of
comfort, as we see it fulfilled in <hi>Dives,</hi>
Luke XVI. 24. This being a very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
condition, it must be far froth
having any relation to Blessedness. But
the mercifull Man meets with other dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
which calls me to the third and
last point.</p>
            <p>III. How the mercifull shall obtain
Mercy. And here what I noted in the
preceeding Beatitudes, holds good here
too, that the recompence here promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
relates both to this, and the other
Life.</p>
            <p>And as to this present World:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:108689:128"/>
1. The mercifull Man may promise
himself great Comfort in his Trouble;
whether it be sickness, or some other
sad accident; to this purpose we have
an excellent saying, <hi>Psal.</hi> XLI. 1, 2, 3.
<hi>Blessed is he that considers the poor, the
Lord will deliver him in the time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
The Lord will preserve him and
keep him alive, and he shall be blessed
upon Earth, and thou wilt not deliver
him into the hand of his enemies: The
Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of
languishing; thou wilt make all his bed in
his sickness.</hi> These words are not much
regarded, because the generality of men
have but a very low opinion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of the Bible; though they believe
it to be the Word of their God, to which
God will stand; yet they dare not trust
his Promises; and so it fares with this
that I have mention'd; and yet would
you make the experiment with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Confidence in God's veracity, you
would certainly find extraordinary As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances
in the time of sickness: I will
not say, that you would recover with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
means or Physick, but your sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
would either become more easie and
tolerable, or you would recover sooner,
or you would prepare for a long life;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:108689:129"/>
your Acts of Mercy would be your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
that you should find mercy in
your distress. This is a great truth, and
as loath as some of you may be to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, I might furnish you, if it were
needfull, with variety of Examples, and
instances of men, who have found it by
experience; but God having asserted,
and promis'd it, it is enough to engage
you to believe it, and to make the
Trial.</p>
            <p>2. This mercy God rewards signally,
even in this present World, by blessing
the mercifull Man's endeavours; not
only by turning the hearts of other
men toward him into mercy, when he
stands in need of it, but by encreasing
or prospering his Substance. Merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is the true Art of thriving in the
World; what a multitude of examples
could I alledge here of Persons, who
have given away either the tenth, or
the fifth Part, or more of their incomes
to pious Uses, and have been blessed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to admiration. It is a mighty mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
that you will be losers by being
very mercifull. Every thing you take
in hand, will prosper the better for it,
except your unbelief or wavering, and
trembling faith should hinder God from
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:108689:129"/>
doing any mighty Works for you. In
shewing mercy you make God your
debtor, you lend him and he is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
even in this life, to repay you with
Usury, <hi>Prov.</hi> XVIII. 17. Men, that
consider not the operations of God's
hand, will continue Infidels under all
these asseverations; but we know, and
find it so, and are confident, that there
is one, <hi>That scattereth and yet increases,</hi>
scatters in Charity, and encreases in
Temporal mercies; <hi>The liberal soul shall
be made fat, and he that watereth shall be
water'd himself,</hi> Prov. XI. 24, 25. But<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
            </p>
            <p>3. The greatest mercy is yet behind,
even the everlasting Mercy of God in
the next life, which the mercifull Man
will certainly obtain. God drops only
some mercies on the mercifull man here,
but he will visit him with Showers in
the other World: He will take him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the bosom of mercy, encompass him
with mercy on every side, and make
mercy his Crown, and Diadem. He
will be mercifull to his sins, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
them no more. The mercies the
Father of mercy sheds on him here, are
<hi>Items</hi> of larger mercies hereafter, and
what is but a Brook, and a River here,
will be all Sea, and Ocean there. The
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:108689:130"/>
mercifull Man will find God exceeding
mercifull to him when he dies, and his
Soul enters into the Regions of Eternity,
a mercy which surpasses all the mercies
he enjoy'd here; to be sure the Souls in
Hell, the Spirits in the Everlasting Prison
would value God's mercy upon their
leaving this World at a higher Rate,
than all the rich Blessings they glutted
themselves with on this side the Grave.
Here the mercies God sends upon the
mercifull Soul are mixt with Clouds,
and Crosses; in the next life they will
be pure, uninterrupted, endless, high,
and like the God that bestows them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite;
and the mercifull Man will see,
and taste, and feel the meaning of that
glorious Promise, <hi>Isa.</hi> LIV. 8, 9, 10. <hi>In
a little wrath I hid my face from thee for
a moment, but with everlasting kindness
will I have mercy on thee. For this is as
the Waters of</hi> Noah <hi>unto me: as I have
sworn, that the Waters of</hi> Noah <hi>should
no more cover the Earth; so have I sworn
that I will not be wrath with thee, nor
rebuke thee. For the Mountains shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
and the Hills be removed, but my
kindness shall not depart from thee; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall the Covenant of my Peace be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
saith the Lord, that hath mercy on
thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="inferences">
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:108689:130"/>
               <head>Inferences.</head>
               <p>I. If mercy be the duty of every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Christian, it must be the duty of
whole Churches too. Cruelty can be
no mark of a true Church; that's not
the Livery of the Prince of Peace, but
of him whose Name is <hi>Legion;</hi> To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
men's lives upon the Account of
Religion, can never be agreeable to the
Nature of that God, who waits to be
gracious; and to call for Fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon <hi>Samaritans,</hi> because they will
not acknowledge the High-Priest of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
to be infallible, surely, is not
to know what manner of Spirit we are
of.<note place="margin">G. Leti.</note> A late Historian of the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
in his Life of <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> tells
us of a very strange Maxim, the Court of
<hi>Rome</hi> makes the great Rule of her Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
That the <hi>Turks</hi> must be set upon with
Arms, Heathens with Arguments and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
but <hi>Eretici col fuoco,</hi> Hereticks with
Fire. If by Fire were meant, that lambent
one, of Love and Charity, we could not
but highly extol the <hi>Motto;</hi> but when
that Church hath used so much material
Fire, whatever her Language may be at
this present, we have still reason to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:108689:131"/>
that this Maxim is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in the worst sense; and when
her unmercifull Practices, and which
she yet never publickly disown'd, and
renounc'd, stand still upon record, when
we read of her proceedings against the
poor <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and <hi>Albigenses,</hi> of whom
more than a hundred thousand were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd,
her St. <hi>Dominick</hi> being the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Incendiary, when we know the
dreadfull Court of Inquisition is in force
in <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and in <hi>Portugal;</hi> when
we read of the fatal St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi>
the Massacre of <hi>Paris</hi> in the Year 1572,
where above 70000 Protestants were
barbarously murther'd, for which the
Pope with his Cardinals gave solemn
Thanks to God; and when a Massacre
nearer home lives still in our memories,
even that of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the Year 1641,
where according to the common Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
200000 innocent Protestants were
inhumanely butcher'd, for which the
Pope gave a plenary indulgence to the
Actors in that Tragedy, when our Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrologies
have preserv'd us, the Names
and Piety of those many Protestants,
who in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days were burnt
and executed for not believing Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,
when we cannot but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:108689:131"/>
the Designs and Practices of the
Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> and are too sensible
of the late inhumane Proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Protestants in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Kingdom; to name no more, when
these things as I said stand still upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
not denied by their Writers, and
to be sure never yet disown'd by the
Governing part of that Church, and the
Writ <hi>de Haeretico comburendo,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it may be in our Church, is not
yet repealed in theirs; we cannot look
upon that Church, as a Church built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Rock, except by that Rock be meant
a Heart hard as Flint, and Adamant; I
will not deny but there is a sober Party
in that Church, which detests and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors
these Principles, but the governing
Part of that Church, who would take
it very ill not to be thought the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,
never yet by any publick Rescript
disown'd them, and therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
look upon that Church as mercifull,
except by mercy we understand such
mercies, as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks of, that the
<hi>Mercies of the wicked are cruel.</hi> Erasmus
tells us, in one of his Epistles, that a
Friar at <hi>Antwerp</hi> did in a publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
assure the People, that if <hi>Martin
Luther</hi> were there, he would tear out
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:108689:132"/>
his Throat with his Teeth, and not be
afraid with his Mouth and Teeth all
bloody, to go immediately and receive
the Sacrament of the Eucharist; as this
was an Argument of a blind or mad
Zeal, so I know not what to call this
tearing out men's Throats, because they
are Hereticks. I confess, this is a way
of answering Arguments without fear
of contradiction, but surely such a one
as the Apostles did not know of, who
command us to be always ready to give
an answer to those, who ask us the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of our hope with meekness, and
godly fear: But I pass from this sad
Theme to softer Reflections. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p>II. It is remarkable, that of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
here, it's said, that they shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
mercy; mercy, not wages: God
will reward their mercifulness, but that
recompence shall be matter of mercy,
not of debt; those that would perswade
People, that by large Alms-deeds they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
Heaven, talk like Persons who never
read the Gospel; which beats down all
opinion of merit, and makes us unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Servants after doing all we are
commanded to do; gives us right no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:108689:132"/>
of our good Works, and of the
nature of them, and doth so advance
the Glory of God's Grace in all we do,
that one would wonder Men should
cherish so much as the shadow of such
a vain Opinion; but when we see that
men dare to believe, that Communion
in one kind is sufficient, contrary to the
express Command, <hi>Drink ye all of this;</hi>
and that religious Service and Worship
is to be paid to dead Men and Women,
contrary to the express Order of God:
<hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and
him only shalt thou serve;</hi> our admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ceases in the matter of merit of good
Works. Some have been so vain, as to
tell us, that the Reformation hath spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and weaken'd the Acts of Mercy,
which the former Ages were famous for;
the opinion of merit formerly having
rais'd People's affections into greater
readiness, to leave behind them signal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of Charity; but this cavil may
be blown away with a breath: Let but
any man examine the publick Acts of
Charity since the Reformation, and
compare them with those in the time of
Popery, here in <hi>England</hi> especially, and
he will be forced to confess, that since
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:108689:133"/>
the Reformation hath been admitted,
far greater publick Acts of Charity have
been done, than were done during that
Term of Years in Popery before. It's
the Glory of our Religion, that our
People can be mercifull without an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of merit, and give their Goods to
feed the Poor from a pure Principle of
the Love of God, and I durst make
an impartial Adversary the Judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be not an Argument of a more
excellent Spirit, for men from the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
of Piety, and out of Conscience
toward God, and from a sense of their
duty, and the miseries of others, and
out of gratitude to God, to erect an
Alms-house, or some other publick Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of mercy, and in a most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
manner to depend upon God's gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Promise of a recompence in the
Resurrection of the Just, than for men
to stream out their days in sin, and
luxury; and when they can keep their
Wealth no longer, leave a large Summ
of Money to build a Monastery or Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery,
to buy off the Pains of Purgatory,
and to purchase the Joys of the Blessed:
The former to speak modestly, savours
of ingenuity; the other, were it possible
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:108689:133"/>
to buy what is intended, of a mercenary
Temper; the former looks like love, the
other like force and interest; the former
is as it ought to be, an effect of true
Christian Pity and Compassion, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of selfishness and partiality.</p>
               <p>III. Though to the Glory of our
Church and Religion, it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd,
that in its Bosom there are
found truly mercifull and charitable
Persons, both Men and Women, whose
delight is in doing good; yet too many
continue hard and churlish, covetous
and ill-natur'd, selfish and unmercifull;
and because they give now and then a
Farthing, or a Penny to the Poor that
pass by their Doors, they think they are
very mercifull Men; Vanity of Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties!
shall the chips and shavings of your
incomes pass for that mercy, which
thrusts its Head into the Clouds of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
Doth God pour out Blessings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you thick and three-fold, and do you
hope to come off with scattering a drop
now and then, and which comes from
your Hearts too like drops of Blood?
Where is your Zeal to imitate the men,
who with their Blood sealed the Truth
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:108689:134"/>
of the Reformation; the History of their
Sufferings tells you of many admirable
Men then, of one, who in a hard time
thought not much to sell his Gold, and
Chains, and Rings, and Jewels left him
by his Ancestors, for the Relief of others.
Another forbore one meal a day, to
give the value of it to them that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Another fasted one day in four to
bestow the Price of that days Diet upon
some of his poor Brethren: Another
hearing of a poor Woman that was
brought to Bed, and destitute of all Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries,
sent her his own Bed whereon
he lay, and confined himself to Straw;
and being in Prison with other sufferers
counted it an Honour to wait at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
upon his Fellow-prisoners, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
himself with their leavings: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
used once a Fortnight to call upon
the rich Clothiers of the Town, where
he lived, to go with him to the Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
to see what poor People wanted,
and to provide for their Necessities:
Abundance of such instances might be
added here. These were some of the
shining and burning Lights of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and I chuse to alledge their
Examples, because I have spoken just
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:108689:134"/>
before in the Praise of that Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
But I fear, Examples will do no
good, if God's Command, and Christ's
Promise, and your Duty, and everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Interest cannot prevail with you:
And yet when by the Grace and Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of God, you are become bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
according to this Rule; the other
Acts of Mercy, I mention'd in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of this Discourse must not be
neglected, particularly the Acts of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to the Souls of your Neighbours.
There is nothing, no Vertue that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
more in incouragements, both
Temporal and Eternal, than this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
Temper. God hath dress'd it in
such Charms, that it cannot but appear
amiable to the Attentive Considerer.
To shew mercy to others, is the way
to be mercifull to your selves: We call
upon you often to have mercy on your
Souls, and your mercy to others is a
sign that you study Self-preservation.
Hereby you secure your own Mercies,
make them firm and durable, and you
establish your selves in the favour of
God, and the good opinion of sober
Men: And therefore, what should hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you from taking fire by this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:108689:135"/>
and suffering your Hearts to be
warmed into Mercy and Compassion?
How chearfully may you go about
it, when there is a Voice behind you
calling upon you: <hi>Blessed are the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull,
for they shall obtain mercy.</hi>

               <hi>PVritan</hi> was once a Nick-name,<note place="margin">Vid. Cornel. Ã  Lap. in Jacobi 1. v. ult.</note> a
Name of Reproach, intended I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to traduce those who made a great
shew of external Piety, but were stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to good Morals; stumbled at a
Straw, and leapt over a Block; strained
at a Gnat, and swallow'd down Camels;
prayed to God, and reviled his Church;
scrupled a Ceremony, and cheated the
next Neighbour they met withall: What
justice there was in giving this Title
to a certain Party, whether they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
it, or not, and whether many of
those that were called so were not very
upright, and truly pious Men, I shall
not now enquire; but sure I am, that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:108689:136"/>
this Name rightly understood, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in that sense, it naturally bears or
should bear, is what every <hi>Christian</hi>
ought to be ambitious of: Purity is
what every good Man must and doth
desire; and indeed his goodness is mere
vanity and shew, if Purity be not the
great object of his love. A true <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
and a true <hi>Christian,</hi> are converti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Terms; and he that laughs at this
Character, understands not the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he is baptized into. He that renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Purity, renounces his Baptism; and
whatever his outward Profession may
be, he is a meer Infidel under a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd
Title. <hi>Purity</hi> is that which the
Christians of old did triumph in, not in
the Name, but in the Thing; and he
that neglects it, must needs continue a
stranger to all solid Consolation. As
ridiculous as it appears to carnal Men,
it is our greatest security; pur-blind
Souls may not see the Beauty of it, but
he that is Truth it self assures us, that
it is the way to real Bliss. <hi>Blessed are
the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The method in handling these words,
must be the same with that I used in the
Explication of the preceeding Beatitudes,
and that which any Man that hears, or
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:108689:136"/>
reads these words, would naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be satisfied in, is</p>
            <p>I. The Nature of this Purity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it consists, and who the pure in heart
are.</p>
            <p>II. Upon what account we cannot sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
those blessed, who are not pure in
heart, for that's implied here;</p>
            <p>III. How the pure in heart shall see
God.</p>
            <p>I. The Nature of this Purity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it consists, and who the pure in heart
are.</p>
            <p>Children know, that by the Heart in
Scripture, is for the most part meant the
Soul, the Spirit, and the inward Man;
and so a pure Heart, is a pure Mind, a
pure Soul, and a pure Conscience; as
we find it called, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> III. 9. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> I. 3.
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> III. 1. and the true ingredients of
this inward Purity are as follows.</p>
            <p>1. An antipathy to sinfull Thoughts,
or a setled abhorrency of such thoughts,
desires, passions, and affections, as are
manifestly contrary to the Will of God.
<hi>Purity</hi> imports cleansing, and that the
thing which is cleansed, is pure from
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:108689:137"/>
something, and the unclean thing here,
is evil thoughts, not their <hi>bare coming in,</hi>
but <hi>concurring with them,</hi> which the
Heart must be pure from. A pure Heart
is an Enemy to impure Speeches, and
all impure and sinfull Actions, but more
immediately to sinfull Thoughts and
Desires, which are the Parents and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the other; so that the pure Heart
nips the Evil in the Bud, and is so far
from yielding deliberately to a bad Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or an undecent Expression, that it
dreads an evil Thought. All men it's
true hate some evil Thoughts or other,
and there is scarce any Man so debaucht
or vitious, but hates the thought of
murthering his Father and Mother, or
the thought of some monstrous ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
or the thought of doing hurt to
an innocent Babe in the Cradle; but this
doth not make them pure in Heart, and
therefore this Purity must extend to
other, indeed all the Laws of God;
without which there would be no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
no difference betwixt the Saint
and the Sinner; the latter pretending to
the hatred of some evil Thoughts, and
Desires, as well as the other. So then
this Purity imports an antipathy, not
only to thoughts of unnatural Crimes,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:108689:137"/>
but to lascivious, covetous, malitious,
revengefull, proud, foolish, vain, impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
romantick Thoughts, even before
they break out into Words and Actions,
to thoughts whereby wronging, defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
slandering, abusing, reviling of our
Neighbours, and neglect of our spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and everlasting Concerns are sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
to us; in a word, to all thoughts
which are injurious to God, to our
Neighbour, or to the interest of our
Souls, for these assented to <hi>defile the
heart,</hi> Mark VII. 21, 22. Such thoughts
like Flies, or Bees may buz, and hum
about the Mind; but if the Mind drives
them away, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did the Birds
from the Sacrifice, the Heart loses no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of its Purity. The mind may be
assaulted with evil Thoughts, the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults
do not presently render it impure,
for if it hold out against them, gives
no consent, no approbation, shews them
no countenance, no favour, no respect,
but that like Bullets shot against a Wall
of Brass, they fall off as fast as they are
shot, the Heart still continues pure, and
therefore <hi>David</hi> expresses the Purity of
his Heart by this very Character, <hi>I hate
vain thoughts,</hi> Psal. CXIX. 113. and to
this purpose is that Expostulation of God
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:108689:138"/>
in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Chap. IV. 14. <hi>How long shall thy
vain thoughts lodge within thee!</hi> It's gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them lodging and entertainment,
that pollutes the Mind, but if they knock
at the Door, and are either permitted
no entrance, or are thrust out, the Heart
preserves its Purity.</p>
            <p>2. A pure Heart imports also a Purity
from sinister Ends, or Aims, or Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
especially in religious Actions. This
must needs be the intent of our great
Master here, since we see he finds fault
so often with Men, that aimed to be
seen of Men, to have Glory of Men, to
gain the Applause and Commendations
of Men, and designed their Profit, and
Gain in Actions relating to Devotion.
The <hi>Christian,</hi> that's free from such sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Aims in praying, praising, fasting,
giving of Alms, preaching, speaking
to others of his Experiences, and hath
nothing before his Eyes but the Glory
of God, the good of his Neighbour, the
peace of his own Conscience, and the
Salvation of his own Soul, may justly
be said to be pure in Heart, and this is
agreeable to <hi>that simplicity,</hi> which we
hear so often press'd, and which the
<hi>Apostles</hi> did so much rejoyce in, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
I. 12. Without this our services want
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:108689:138"/>
that Sincerity, which must make them
amiable to the searcher of hearts; and
the <hi>Apostle</hi> insists upon it, <hi>Rom.</hi> XII. 9.
when he saith, <hi>Let love be without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation;</hi>
and since love to God is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by our religious exercises, it must
necessarily follow, these must be free
from sinister ends, which if they be not,
they fall under the brand and character
of <hi>Dissimulation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. A pure heart delights in holy
Thoughts: These are Meat and Drink
to it, and such a person delights in
thinking of the works of God, and the
operations of his hands, of his will, and
of his commands, of his promises and
of his threatnings, of his various provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
and dispensations, of Heaven and
eternal happiness. These Thoughts
wonderfully purifie the heart, and keep
it clean; these keep up the Spirit of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and make the soul a fit temple for
the <hi>Deity</hi> to lodge in: it's true, there is
no man so holy, and who lives in the
world, or hath a lawfull calling, but
must think of his concerns in the world,
how to manage them to the good of his
family and relations and others; such
thoughts are very necessary in order to
a prudent ordering of our affairs, and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:108689:139"/>
without doubt are allowable and lawfull,
<hi>for which of you intending to build a tower,
sits not down first, and counteth the cost
whether he have sufficient to finish it,</hi> saith
our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> XIV. 28. But all
this may be done, and yet the heart
delight in holy thoughts, in these more
than in the other, in these for pleasure,
in the other for necessity; to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<hi>Solomon, The thoughts of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
are right,</hi> Prov. XII. 5. but St. <hi>Paul</hi>
more emphatically, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> IV. 18. <hi>We
look not so much at the things which are
seen, but at the things which are not seen.</hi>
Looking here, is thinking, and there is
no beholding things invisible, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of the Heart and Mind. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
represents things eternal in
lively colours, and in seeing these the
primitive Believers rejoyced more than in
gazing on the riches and glories of this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
world; temporal things they thought
on by the by, but the strength of their
thoughts was reserved for the other.</p>
            <p>A pure heart, is a heart enamour'd
with God, a heart that loves nothing
like him; a soul whose secret desires are
after him, and whose desires are strong
and vehement, and though it hath obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
to love the creature, yet it is
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:108689:139"/>
in subordination to him and for him
who is altogether lovely; a heart
which discovers its love, not only by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
obedience, but by inward breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and sighs, and groans which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be uttered, and loves any thing that
belongs to him, his word, his laws, his
sacraments, his faithfull ministers, and
those that truly fear him; what this inward
love is, the admirable <hi>David</hi> describes at
large, <hi>Psal.</hi> CXIX, and when in this
<hi>Psalm</hi> you read such expressions as these,
<hi>With my whole heart have I sought thee,</hi>
v. 10. <hi>My soul breaketh for the longing
that it hath unto thy judgments at all
times,</hi> v. 20. <hi>Horror hath taken hold of
me, because of the wicked that forsake thy
law,</hi> v. 53. <hi>The law of thy mouth is dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
unto me, than thousands of gold and
silver,</hi> v. 72. <hi>my soul fainteth for thy sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
v. 81. <hi>O how I love thy law, it
is my meditation all the day,</hi> v. 97. <hi>How
sweet are thy words unto my mouth, yea,
sweeter than honey unto my taste,</hi> v. 103.
I say, when you read such expressions
as these, you may guess at the nature
of this love which purifies the heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cassianus</hi> hath an observation, which
I cannot pass by without making some
remarks upon it, and it is this, <hi>That
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:108689:140"/>
the greatest sign of a pure heart is, when
that inward purity influences our very
dreams, and that a man instead of dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of trifles and impertinencies, dreams
of God and spiritual objects.</hi> The obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
seems a little odd, because in
dreams the <hi>fancy</hi> plays, her Mistress,
<hi>reason</hi> (because the bodily organs, the
tools whereby she works are asleep)
suspending her operations: and <hi>dreams</hi>
we know, depend much upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
and complexion of the body,
and yet there is some truth in it, for if,
as <hi>Solomon</hi> notes, <hi>Eccles.</hi> V. 3. <hi>A dream
comes through multitude of business</hi> Men
have been engaged in in the day time,
or from things they have heard, or seen,
or discours'd of: it may very well be,
that a person who hath got a habit of
contemplating things divine, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
whose thoughts are taken up all
day with spiritual objects, may find a
tincture of all this in his <hi>very dreams,</hi>
and the things he most delighted in, and
was most conversant with, may present
themselves to his <hi>fancy,</hi> and there appear
in lively shapes and dresses in the night;
and I do not doubt, where a man could
arrive to that felicity, <hi>as to dream for
the most part of Heaven and a future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:108689:140"/>
and pray and praise God in his
dreams, whenever his Imagination wakes
in his sleep,</hi> as it would argue, that the
person makes religion his business, so it
would be a very good sign of Purity of
heart, and that his heart and affections
are truly set upon God; but I will lay
no stress upon this observation, because
it hath not the Scripture for its guide:
the characters I have given of the pure
in heart, are warranted by the word of
God, and in these we cannot be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and those who are so are certainly
blessed.</p>
            <p>But then,</p>
            <p>II. If the pure in heart are blessed,
those that are not so, or will not be so,
cannot be happy; which is the second
point I am to speak to, and I shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
it by these following familiar
arguments.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Such persons cannot converse with
God:</hi> in this converse mans happiness
consists, and the reason why they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
is, because their hearts are impure.
<hi>Can two walk together except they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,</hi>
saith God, <hi>Amos</hi> III. 3. Purity
and Impurity are incapable of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:108689:141"/>
When God converses with man,
he takes possession of the heart, there he
dwells, there is his seat, but if that be
impure, and full of darkness, God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voids
the infected place. In this case,
the castle is already in possession of Gods
enemy, and therefore there is no enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
for him whose purity is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite;
for the law of this converse is, <hi>with
the mercifull, thou wilt shew they self mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull,
and with the pure, thou wilt shew
thy self pure,</hi> Psal. XVIII. 25.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>As the impure cannot converse with
God, so they cannot appropriate him to
themselves, and therefore cannot be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:</hi>
for mans blessedness arises from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to say, <hi>That God is his God,</hi> his
Friend and peculiar Treasure. It's true,
the man whose heart is impure, profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
an interest in God, as well as the
purest souls; but words, and sayings,
and boastings do not make the title
good; God will not be his God, that
will not have him reign over him; his
indeed to judge him, but not his to save
him; his to send him to Hell, but not
his to give him a right to the tree of
Life. He, whose heart is impure, lets
Sin and World reign over him, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
the Throne of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> his heart
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:108689:141"/>
to an usurper, puts the Scepter into a
Traitors hand, and sets open the Gates
for Thieves and Robbers to come in,
and surely this cannot be the way to
appropriate God to our selves, or to
take comfort in his love, and therefore
no right to blessedness.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Such are not blessed, because they
cannot see God.</hi> The sinfull worldly Lusts,
and Thoughts, and Desires which like
Vermin crawl in their hearts, darken
their sight. There is a thick veil over
their hearts, that they cannot see and
tast how sweet and gracious the Lord is.
Their Souls are oppressed, there lies
much earth upon them, a very great
weight of earthly, carnal, disorderly
Thoughts and Desires, that like Swine,
they cannot look up to things above
them. Their Souls indeed are in the
nature of Glass, but the Glass is greazy
and sullied with the Smoak of vain Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
which hinders them from <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
his goings in the Sanctuary,</hi> or at
the best, they look upon God, as men
do upon objects through the wrong end
of a perspective, which represents things
great, and near, as little, and afar off.
<hi>He that lacketh these things,</hi> saith St.
<hi>Peter, is blind and cannot see afar off.</hi>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:108689:142"/>
He that wants a pure heart, is that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and wants that which must give
him right apprehensions of God: the
impure Lusts he cherishes in his heart,
shut the eyes of his heart, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
that he hath nothing but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
Notions and Ideas of God and his
ways; an estate very different from
theirs, who are <hi>pure in heart, for they
shall see God,</hi> which calls me to the</p>
            <p>III. Third and last particular, How
the pure in heart shall see God; and
since this Vision relates both to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Life, and that to come, we must
take a distinct view of both: And,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>How they see, and shall see God in
this present Life.</hi> And here it must be
taken for granted, that God cannot be
seen with the Organs of the body, for
he is a Spirit infinite, immaterial, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compounded,
and though <hi>he fills Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth with his presence, and is
not far from every one of us,</hi> yet no man
ever saw him, and indeed <hi>none can see
him,</hi> 1 Tim. VI. 16. but this is still to
be understood of the Eyes of the Flesh;
with the Eye of the Understanding
without all peradventure, he may be
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:108689:142"/>
seen, and that's the seeing <hi>Christ</hi> aims
at here; for it's evident, he speaks of
the purity of Heart and Mind, and
therefore what he says of seeing God,
must be meant of the Eyes of that pure
Mind. Even <hi>Heathen Philosophers</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
Purification of the heart from all
gross, lustfull, covetous, and worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
without which they said a man
could never arrive to the brighter know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of <hi>Philosophy. Christ</hi> leads his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
to a higher object, and promises
not so much a clear insight into the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of Nature, as a sight of the best
of Beings, <hi>God blessed for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that no man may think, that
this blessedness reaches only <hi>Divines</hi> and
other learned men, whose Studies carry
them to contemplate God, his Nature,
Attributes, and Providences, I must
tell you, that this Blessing is pronounced
with respect even to the meanest capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and a poor man that follows his trade,
or gets his livelihood in the sweat of his
Brows, may see God, as well as the
learnedest Men alive, nay many times
better, having none of the preferments
of this World to blind his Eyes. For
this seeing God, is an affectionate seeing
him, and such a seeing as assimilates the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:108689:143"/>
Soul to him. This seeing is not a bare
Speculation, or being able to talk or
write much concerning God; but such a
seeing as charms, and ravishes, and unites
the Soul to God; and as this seeing God
relates to this present World, such as
are pure in heart, shall see him more
clearly, more distinctly, more to their
satisfaction and edification than other
men. All men that say they believe in
God, and talk of his divine Attributes,
and have occasion to take notice, and
are sensible of his works, pretend a
share in the seeing God; but none sees
him so well as the pure in heart. Their
inward purity helps them to see him;
they see him in his <hi>Word,</hi> in his <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi>
in his <hi>Providences,</hi> in his <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
and <hi>Afflictions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They see him in his <hi>Word;</hi> how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable,
how just, how reasonable all
his precepts are, how agreeable to the
divine Nature, how suitable to the Soul,
how glorious, how sweet, how precious
all his promises are, how just his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</p>
            <p>They see him in his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> what
Profit, what Advantage he intends by
them, how he designs them as Channels
or Pipes whereby to convey his Grace,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:108689:143"/>
and Spirit, and Influences to their
Souls.</p>
            <p>They see him in his <hi>Providences,</hi> how
righteous, how holy, how potent, how
orderly he is in the management of the
great affairs of the World.</p>
            <p>They see him in his <hi>Mercies,</hi> how he
condescends, how tender he is to them,
how like a Father, how like a Shepherd
he deals with them.</p>
            <p>They see him in their <hi>Afflictions,</hi> how
wise, how kind, how good he is in send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, what Favour, what Love,
what edification he designs by them.</p>
            <p>They see him in all <hi>his Works,</hi> how
admirable, how wonderfull, how pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
he is; and all this they see with
joy and delight, and so see him, as to
love him more fervently; and this is
called, <hi>Seeing him in the Sanctuary,</hi> Psal.
LXIII. 2. Thus the <hi>pure in heart see
God</hi> here. But,</p>
            <p>2. <hi>There is a vision of God in the next
life, which surpasses all understanding.</hi>
Though they see him here to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and edification; yet at the best,
<hi>they see him but as it were through a glass
darkly, but then face to face,</hi> 1 Cor. XIII.
12. There that Sun will shine directly
in their faces, and their sight shall be
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:108689:144"/>
made so strong, that they shall be able
to look upon that astonishing light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being weakned by its lustre. Here
they see but his <hi>back parts,</hi> there his
<hi>face.</hi> That seeing him in the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
kingdom, imports a <hi>comprehension.
They comprehend</hi> in some small degree
here <hi>what is the depth, the height, the
length, and breadth of the love of God;</hi>
but then they will understand perfectly
all the mysteries of his nature, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
attributes and love to them in
<hi>Christ Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And from this sight must necessarily
arise joy inexpressible, <hi>Such as eye hath
not seen, nor ear heard, nor is the heart
of man able to conceive.</hi> The Sun beams
are amiable and pleasing here, but how
would a man be surprized, if he were at
the spring of that universal fire, and saw
how it rises, and how it is managed?
So God is very lovely to the <hi>pure in heart</hi>
when they see him here, but when they
shall come near that inaccessible Light,
and be perfectly united to him, who
can express the satisfaction? indeed it
cannot be express'd, for it is immense
and infinite.</p>
            <div type="inferences">
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:108689:144"/>
               <head>Inferences.</head>
               <p>1. <hi>Here we see what a jewel that man
enjoys, that is possess'd of this inward pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
This purity of heart is a treasure
which no man knows, save he who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
it. Comfort your selves <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
with it; comfort your selves, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this Purity you are rich in the
midst of your Poverty; and enjoy more
than those who boast of Lands and
Houses. I know the world laughs at
this, but let them laugh on; the time
will come, when this Purity will stand
you in better stead, than your carnal
Friends and Relations. Men may think
they shall be able to deal with God as
they do with men here on Earth, whose
mouths they can stop with fair words,
or with a Bribe. But this is vain and
foolish to a Prodigy. Is God a Man?
Is he to be imposed upon? Can Gold
blind his Eyes? or if it could, where
would you have it, when you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
and dispoil'd of all? Is not he
the searcher of hearts? Can you deceive
him who sees through all your hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie?
<hi>Purity of heart</hi> is that which he
requires, and not only requires it, but
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:108689:145"/>
is willing to assist you in the getting of
it, and without this inward Purity he
will know none of you: but if this be
the dress of your minds and souls, the
doors of his banqueting house will fly
open to you, and all the enemies you
have on earth, or in Hell, shall not be
able to keep you out.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Here is the spring of true Religion;
a pure heart.</hi> If <hi>that</hi> be pure, the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man</hi> will be so too. If <hi>that</hi> be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
the outward whiteness will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pass for currant in Heaven. The
<hi>Pharisees</hi> exceeded all the men of the
age they lived in, in outward sanctity;
notwithstanding all this, the son of God
who saw their hearts, and the impurity
of their souls, calls them <hi>serpents, and
a generation of vipers,</hi> Matth. XXIII. 33.</p>
               <p>There are some sins so purely the sins
of the heart, that the heart can consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
and finish them without the help
of the body; such are Pride, Lust, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness,
and Discontent because Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
crosses our designs, and bitter
Envy, and black malice, and rejoycing
at our Neighbours misfortune, &amp;c. These
lying at the heart, and being cherished
there, shed a poisonous influence upon
the outward devotion, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:108689:145"/>
render the external worship (though
never so specious) ineffectual, and a
<hi>sacrifice of Fools.</hi> To pray like a Saint,
and to breath revenge like a Turk;
outward Love to good men, and secret
fondness to sinfull Lusts and Pleasures
of the world; outward strictness and
inward loosness; complying with God
without, and with the Devil within;
a punctual observance of outward duties,
and neglect of mortifying our secret
Lusts, such as Ambition, Self-conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
Self-admiration, lascivious
Thoughts and Desires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the true
complexion of Hypocrisie. Therefore, <hi>To
be a Saint,</hi> the heart must be purified;
for sins like fatal diseases invade the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
first, before they appear outwardly.
And as in such dangerous distempers of
the body, which first seize the Heart
and the Garrison of Life, and then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
themselves in little blisters and
boyles in the skin; he that should lay
a Plaister to those boyles, and use reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussives
to strike them in, cannot be
said to cure the distemper. So he that
is diseased with sin, which creeps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
and infects the soul, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
manifest at last in the outward
man: he that doth only restrain the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:108689:146"/>
outward acts, and uses means of grace;
only to cut off the outward excrescences,
but takes nothing inwardly, to eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the distemper out of his heart and
mind; makes but an imperfect cure;
and for all the outward applications will
still be in danger of Death, even Death
eternal.</p>
               <p>It's true the wise man crys out, <hi>Prov.</hi>
XX. 9. <hi>Who can say I have made my
heart clean, I am pure from my sin?</hi> which
seems to imply an impossibility of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the heart pure. But this he speaks
with respect to the rigour of the law,
not with regard to the equity of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.
Go to the strictness of the thing,
no man can say, he hath so purified his
heart, that he is perfectly free from all
vain and evil thoughts; or that he is
never surprized into an impertinent, and
foolish imagination. This the holiest
man alive cannot say. But then in a
Gospel sense, it is not only possible <hi>to
purifie the heart,</hi> but a duty, <hi>i. e.</hi> so to
<hi>purifie</hi> it, as to arrive to an habitual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in holy, serious, and heavenly
thoughts; and to an habitual aversion of
the Mind, and Heart, and inward Man,
from any thing that is directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Will of God. And this habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:108689:146"/>
Purity is consistent with surprizes
of evil Thoughts and Desires, when a
bright gilded Temptation strikes the
Heart, and dazzles the Mind, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
the Will to consent. But then,
in Persons where the Grace of God
works; within a very little while the
Spirit doth recover out of the Surprize,
puts by the thrusts of Fancy, and the
stabbs of Temptation, and reasons its
self into Health, and Resolution, and
Resistance again.</p>
               <p>He that is regardless of this <hi>Purity</hi>
hates his own Soul, knows not what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
means, and his outward perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
will never make him blessed or
happy. Christians! Do you believe this,
and will not you labour after it? I mean
after this Purity of Heart. Look into
the Gospel, examine the Places where
the Mind, the inward Man, the inside
of the Cup and Platter, are commanded
to be purified: Consider how frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this is press'd. Do not you see what
a stress the Holy Ghost lays upon it?
Why should you deceive, why should
you delude your selves? Why should
you think it needless? Is it not Wisdom
to believe him, who is the Fountain of
Truth and Wisdom? Does not <hi>Reason,</hi>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:108689:147"/>
nay, doth not <hi>Sense</hi> tell you, that if the
Waters in the Spring be muddy, the
Streams and Rivulets cannot be clear?
What? would you have the Fruit good
when the Tree is nought? How can your
Actions be pleasing to God, when your
Minds are full of weariness, and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness,
and backwardness in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice?
Can the outward Man be good
when the inward is rotten and putrefied?
Are you wise Builders, do you think,
do you hope to make a good piece of
work of it, to build the Top of the
House, when you have not laid the
Foundation?</p>
               <p>This <hi>purity of heart</hi> produces a great
sense of God, and another World; a
great sense of the Love of God, which
constrains the Soul to live in conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to his Will; and this is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all true Religion. If this sense
be setled in the Heart, if this Ground
be well manured, the whole Garden of
your Lives will abound with Flowers,
and Fruits of all Sorts.</p>
               <p>Ay! but how is this Purity to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd?
I answer, not with Laziness, not
with crying, <hi>There is a Bear, there is a
Lion in the way:</hi> Not by being over cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
about the Purity and Ornaments
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:108689:147"/>
of the Body. When People spend more time
at the Glass, than at their Prayers; take
more than ordinary satisfaction in dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and adorning the Body; seek more
to please Men than God; do all they
can to pamper the Flesh, the Mind will
run out into a thousand Vanities. But,</p>
               <p>1. By studying the Word of God. <hi>For</hi>
the Law of the Lord is perfect converting
the Soul; the Testimony of the Lord is
sure making wise the simple. The statutes
of the Lord are right rejoycing the heart,
the commandment of the Lord is pure en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening
the eyes, <hi>Psal. XIX.</hi> 7, 8. What
made <hi>David</hi> wiser than his Enemies? What
made him understand more than the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents?
What made him know more than his
Teachers? <hi>He tells you,</hi> Psal. <hi>CXIX.</hi> 97.
Oh how I love thy Law, it is my medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
all the day, <hi>Vers.</hi> 104. Through thy
Precepts I get Vnderstanding, <hi>Vers.</hi> 140.
Thy word is very pure. <hi>And it is so pure,
that if digested and ponder'd on, it will
purifie the Heart too.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>By taking notice of God in every
thing:</hi> While other Men talk of chance,
and take notice of the Shell and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
and of the little Wheels whereby
their own and other Men's affairs are
turned about; do you look still upon
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:108689:148"/>
that God that hides himself behind the
Curtain, and turns all according to his
good Pleasure. Take notice of him in
every Blessing; whether you eat or
drink, or whatever Conveniency, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Providence comes upon you, have
an Eye to him, and you will find your
hearts will become very pure. <hi>They
looked upon him and were enlightened,
and their faces were not ashamed,</hi> Psal.
XXXIV. 5.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>By calling in the aid and assistance
of his Holy Spirit:</hi> For it is the proper
Province of that Spirit to enlighten the
Mind and Understanding, and to purifie
it from gross, terrestrial, and brutish
Idea's, and Imaginations; and to reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
and fill it with a sense of spiritual
things. And this Spirit is ready to come,
ready to enter, ready to lend his help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hand, when he finds the Soul wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be purified; willing without
Tricks, without Reserves, without Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so's,
without Conditions: Such as, <hi>Lord
suffer me first to go and bury my Father,</hi>
or <hi>suffer me first to go and take leave of
those at my house.</hi> In a word, this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
loves to deal with down-right honest
Men, that mean what they say, and
think what they speak in their Addresses
to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:108689:148"/>
4. <hi>By acquainting your selves with the
true Nature of Sin:</hi> For a principal part
of this Purity of Heart consisting in an
Aversion from sinfull Thoughts, and
Desires; it is not possible a Person
should arrive to that Aversion, that sees
not that Evil in Sin, which is really in
it.</p>
               <p>What? Shall I hate a thing I see no
harm in? Shall I dread the Appearance
of a thing which I spy some Beauty and
Satisfaction in?</p>
               <p>The best, the plainest, and easiest way
to acquaint our selves with the Nature
of Sin, is by reflecting on the <hi>Wages of
Sin,</hi> which is <hi>Death,</hi> even everlasting
Death and Misery. It may be my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
is dull, and weak, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
dive into all the Tendencies of Sin,
nor find out all the Indignities it offers
to God's Attributes; but this I know,
Eternal Misery is threatned to it. This
seems indeed to be unproportionable to
its short duration. But still, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
certainly threatned it, there must
be something in it very nauseous, very
grievous, very odious, very dreadfull,
very injurious to God, and to his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Purity; the very shadow of it must
be poysonous, and infectious; and by
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:108689:149"/>
this the Heart will take fire, and hate the
very thoughts of it, even every false
way.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>By representing to your minds the
infinite Purity of God;</hi> with whom your
Souls are to converse, and who offers
to make your Heart his Temple, and
the Place of his Residence. If you are
to receive a King, a Sovereign Prince,
or a Person of extraordinary Quality
into your House, do not you make all
clean and handsome, and take care there
may be nothing wanting, that may give
him content and satisfaction; every
Chamber, every Room in the House is
set out, and garnish'd, and adorn'd, as
far as your ability reaches; and Neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is a thing that at such a time you
glory in. But what is a great Man to
Almighty God? What is a Prince, or a
King to the King of Kings, and the Lord
of Lords? This Sovereign Majesty is
willing to lodge, nay, to dwell in your
Souls. A God purer than Angels, purer
than the Sun, and Stars, and dwelling in
Light inaccessible, to whom ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times ten thousand minister, and
by whose Order and Direction the whole
Creation stands, and falls. And then
how holy, how pious, how clean, how
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:108689:149"/>
pure ought your thoughts to be to give
so great, so rich, so magnificent a Guest
suitable Entertainment?</p>
               <p>6. <hi>By representing to your selves the
vast advantages that come by this inward
Purity:</hi> I shall name some of them by
and by: In the mean while, I will men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
but this one. <hi>It will make you pray
without wandring, worldly, and base trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
thoughts.</hi> Many People complain
that they are mightily troubled with
wandering thoughts in Prayer: Purity
of Heart is a remedy against that distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
for that consists in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in an habitual delight in holy serious
thoughts. And when you go to Prayer,
your thoughts will delight to fix upon
that lovely, and amiable object. And
the secret love to God, (which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
ingredient of this Purity) will
force your desires upward, and keep
your thoughts together, and they'll wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
quit all other hold, and with cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
gather about that All-sufficient
Being, to whom you pray and offer
your Devotions. For indeed wandring
thoughts in Prayer, come for the most
part from want of fervent Love to God:
what we love we think of. Therefore
as this Purity of Heart teaches and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:108689:150"/>
you to be enamour'd with that
excellent Being; so it will procure sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
of thoughts, and affections in
Prayer; will keep your thoughts in a
great measure from roving, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
up and down among Briars and
Thorns, meaner and baser Objects. Thus
Purity of Heart is to be obtain'd. But
then,</p>
               <p>To prevent Discouragements, and to
obviate the Mistakes, and Objections of
some pious serious Christians, and to
keep them from sorrow and dejectedness
in their serious Prosecution of this Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
I must add here by way of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement.</p>
               <p>1. That from an imperfect purity of
heart, a Christian must not therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
conclude he is a total stranger to it.</p>
               <p>2. That neither contemplation of sin, nor
unallow'd of blasphemous Thoughts defile the
Heart.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That from an imperfect purity of
heart, a Christian must not presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
he is a total stranger to it.</hi> VVe
do not think that <hi>Rome</hi> was built in a
day, no more do we imagine that this
Purity of Heart is perfected in one Week.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:108689:150"/>
Indeed when the seed of God is sown in
the Heart, there is an earnest desire and
endeavour after perfection, which disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
it self in a chearfull progress; but
it is not actually perfected but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
Ye that labour to remove sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Lusts, and Desires, and Designs,
and Passions from your hearts, and to
possess them with humble, and meek,
and kind, and charitable, and religious
Thoughts, and to make God the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and joy of your Souls; be not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may'd
nor frighted, if this Purity of
Heart in you be not come up yet to that
degree to which it is advanc'd in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Those other <hi>Christians</hi> in which that
<hi>Diamond</hi> glisters, and that <hi>Star</hi> doth
shine, have been many years to pollish
it. When you have labour'd so long as
they, and as hard as they, your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
will be the same with theirs. Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Heart is that which will find us
work, will imploy us through the whole
course of our Lives; for it meets with
many rubs, with many clogs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments,
which to remove, will find
us work at all times. Stop not, stand
not still, the measure of Purity you are
arrived to, seek still to enlarge it, to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:108689:151"/>
extend it, make frequent journeys to
Heaven with your Prayers, and you
will find it will <hi>spread forth as the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
as Gardens by the river side, as the
trees of Lignaloes which the Lord hath
planted, and as Cedar trees beside the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
Numb. XXIV. 6.</p>
               <p>II. That neither Contemplation of
sin, nor unallow'd of blasphemous
Thoughts defile the Heart.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Contemplation of sin</hi> doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file
it. But here we must distinguish,
for there is a Contemplation of sin that
doth defile the Heart, <hi>i. e. when a man
acts his sin over again in his mind;</hi> and
having been in a vicious extravagant
company the day before, represents the
scene of that folly meeting to his mind
with delight, thereby to whet his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
into a desire of having such another
opportunity, and to confirm his love to
that Sensuality. Or when a man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
committed Lewdness, or been
guilty of acts of Uncleanness, by lively
Thoughts of that sin, makes the impure
Pleasure skip and dance afresh in his
memory, thereby to prompt himself to
new enterprizes in that Villainy: Then
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:108689:151"/>
indeed the Soul is stain'd with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and a Man becomes a Devil, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
in his own ruin. But when
the sins of our former life are thought
on with sorrow and Contrition, and the
particular Circumstances of it rehearsed
and represented with due Aggravations,
in order to work our selves into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
of that, and all other sins; here
the Contemplation becomes wholsom,
and instead of defiling, helps to purifie
the Heart, serves to keep it clean, and
to arm it against fresh assaults.</p>
               <p>Such <hi>Contemplations</hi> are purgatives,
restore the soul to health, give it new
strength and courage to fight against the
World and the Flesh; and if this way
were followed, we should have purer
Christians, and the World would soon
be better, and men would learn to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
their souls and bodies living sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
unto God, which is their reasonable
service.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not deny, but this <hi>Contemplation</hi>
may be driven too far, into Terror and
Consternation, and into a belief that the
sins are unpardonable; but that is not
the fault of <hi>Contemplation,</hi> but weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and infirmity of the <hi>Considerer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:108689:152"/>
2. <hi>Vnallow'd of blasphemous or other
wicked thoughts in the heart do not defile
it.</hi> This Doctrine must be often incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
because of the great number of
pious Souls, who look upon themselves
as the vilest Wretches in the World, and
are ready to run into Desperation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
so many blasphemous thoughts
and filthy suggestions present themselves
to their minds, and disturb them in their
Devotions and other religious Exercises.
But not being allow'd of, nor encourag'd,
nor consented to, as dreadfull, as hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
as they seem to be, they do not
defile the heart, no more than boistrous
Winds, and the Commotion of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
do fully the Pearl that lies at the
bottom of the River. That they are not
their own Thoughts, is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their Will is contrary to them,
their Understanding is convinc'd, they
are injurious to God, and their hearts
desire to be rid of them. The Soul in
this case is like the young Men in the
fiery Furnace, while a thousand Sparks
fly about them, not a hair of their head
is singed.</p>
               <p>Those <hi>blasphemous Suggestions,</hi> as they
are purely <hi>Satanical</hi> and thrown in by
the <hi>Devil;</hi> so when the Soul continues
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:108689:152"/>
declaring War, and Hatred, and Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
to them, not all the Legions of
the burning Lake, not all the Whirlwinds
they rouse, not all the Dust they make,
can defile the Spirit, which is secured,
by opposing its forces to those Hellish
Troops, and preserves its Purity by
Contradictions.</p>
               <p>3. It may not be amiss to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
here of the reason <hi>why the Soul is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
or punished before the body.</hi> When
men die, the Body is laid in the Grave,
and returns to Dust, and there it lies till
the Arch-Angel's Trumpet rouzes it
from its Slumber. The Soul in the mean
while is in a state of Bliss or Misery,
and the reason lies in the Text, because
of the <hi>Purity</hi> or <hi>Impurity of the Soul or
Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Soul was able to sin without the
Body, <hi>i. e.</hi> without the help and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Body; could be lewd, and
proud, and vain, and envious, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious,
without discovering it by bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Actions. This is the <hi>Impurity of the
heart.</hi> Therefore as the Soul did sin
without the assistance of the Body, so
its fit it should be punished in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:108689:153"/>
Again, in sinfull actions, when Soul
and Body are concern'd, the Mind sins
first, before the Body participates of the
Poyson; for the Will must consent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the outward Man can act. As
therefore the Soul is the first Actor in
the sin, so it's fit it should be first in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
the penalty of the Law.</p>
               <p>And so it is in the future <hi>Reward</hi> or
<hi>Recompence.</hi> The Soul performs many
excellent services in which the Body is
not concern'd; such as holy Thoughts,
and pious Meditations. And the good
which both Soul and Body are partners
in, begins in the Heart or Mind, and from
thence it runs down into the Actions,
as the precious Oyl from <hi>Aaron's head
ran down to his Beard and the skirts of
his Cloathing.</hi> Therefore as it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
and serious, without the help
of the body; and in the good works in
which the Body was concern'd, was the
first mover of the fact, so it shall see
the Glory of God before the Body, and
separated from the Body, and while the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
participates of the common Fate: But,</p>
               <p>4. Let me end all with <hi>David's</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Motto, <hi>Psal.</hi> LXXIII. 1. <hi>Truly
God is good to Israel, even to them who
are of a clean Heart.</hi> Good indeed!
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:108689:153"/>
good to them in a time of Peace, good
in Adversity, good to them in publick
Commotions, good to them in his
Promises, good to them in their life
time, good to them at their Death,
and good to them after Death. <hi>The
pure in heart</hi> they tast, they see, they
feel his Goodness; this supports them,
this comforts them, this strengthens
them. All the World see his Goodness;
but O how great is that Goodness that
God hath laid up for the pure in heart!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The pure in heart they shall see God.</hi>
Ay! that's the Goodness God hath laid
up for them. And O what a happiness
do they enjoy! the purblind World sees
not the Beauty, the Order, the Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Providence: the pure in Heart
behold it, and are thankfull. Good God!
<hi>To see thee,</hi> what ravishments must that
cause! To see the fountain of Goodness,
what delights must flow from that sight!
To enter into a Prince's Cabinet, and to
see the Pearls, the Diamonds, the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,
the precious Stones, the Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
the Rarities, the Riches, the Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the costly Things, the great Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that is there, this is something: But
what is all this, to the <hi>seeing of God,</hi> in
whom are concenter'd all the Beauties
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:108689:154"/>
and Rarities of Heaven and Earth.</p>
               <p>To see but one <hi>Attribute</hi> of his clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and distinctly, suppose his <hi>Wisdom</hi> is
enough to charm a Soul into eternal
Admiration.</p>
               <p>Behold how men run to see an <hi>Indian</hi>
or <hi>African</hi> Ambassador! or a <hi>Craesus,</hi> a
<hi>Darius,</hi> an <hi>Alexander!</hi> any thing that
is attended with Pomp and Greatness!</p>
               <p>Rejoyce ye that are <hi>pure in heart!</hi>
you run to see a greater thing than the
greatest <hi>Emperour</hi> in the World. Could
you see all the Riches and Glories of
the world at one view; all that is above
and within the Earth; all that is within
and above the sea, and all the Men and
Women that have been since the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World; it would not be so
stately a sight, as a clear <hi>sight of God</hi>
blessed for evermore.</p>
               <p>This is <hi>your shield, your exceeding
great reward,</hi> this most glorious Object
you shall see at last; see him and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
him, see him and desire to be with
him, see him and love him, see him and
rejoyce in him, see him and be united
to him, see him and cling to him for
ever.</p>
               <p>You shall see all the Patriarchs, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> and all the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:108689:154"/>
all the <hi>holy Apostles,</hi> all the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi>
that have suffered <hi>for the Testimony
of Jesus.</hi> You shall see the great <hi>Jesus</hi>
that died at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was crucified on
Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> sweated drops of Blood
in the Garden of <hi>Gethsemane,</hi> was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and rose again, and is set <hi>down on

               </p>
               <p>The Believers St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks of, <hi>saw
him not, yet rejoyced in him with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
and full of Glory:</hi> What then
will your joy be, when you shall <hi>see
him face to face?</hi> For this we want ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
and therefore I shall draw a
veil over it, and leave you to live in
joyfull Thoughts and expectations of it,
<hi>that when his Glory shall appear, you also
may appear with him in Glory.</hi>

               <bibl>St. Matth. Ch. V. Ver. 9.</bibl>
               <q>Blessed are the Peace-makers, for they

            </epigraph>
            <p>AS in this divine Sermon of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
Men and Women are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
blessed and happy, with respect
to things which the dull sensual World
spies no felicity in; or as here, those are
counted happy whom the World counts
miserable, and those miserable whom
the World counts happy; so it fares
with the persons mentioned in the words
before you, and the Blessedness which
attends them; the world, you know,
magnifies great Generals, and Soldiers,
and Martial Men who can fight well,
and are very skilfull in besieging Towns,
and in scaling Walls, in bombarding
Castles, and surprizing Forts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:108689:155"/>
Armies, and slaying Men; and he,
that with <hi>Saul hath kill'd his thousands,</hi>
and with <hi>David his ten thousands,</hi> is cry'd
up, and the Bells ring at his entrance into
a conquer'd Town, all sing his Praises,
Flowers of Rhetorick and Applause are
strow'd in his way, publick Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are fill'd with his Commendations;
and who so much talk'd of, as the man
who is very expert in making, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
and managing a War.</p>
            <p>Our blessed Master over-looks all
these partial verdicts of the World, and
knowing that Nature, and Vice, and
Profit, and Honour, Ambition, and
Lust are enough to inspire a man with
courage and Wisdom to fight, and to
cause Disorders and Disturbances among
Men, instead of commending men, who
are skilfull in making War; set a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
mark of favour on those who are
skilfull in making Peace in the words,
I have read to you, <hi>Blessed are the Peace-makers,
for they shall be called the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Blessed are the Peace-makers; what?
All Peace-makers? Then Turks, and
Infidels, Heathens, and Pagans, and the
most licentious of Christian Princes do
all come into the number of the blessed,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:108689:156"/>
and all must be Children of God. For
there is no Prince, though never so great
a Tyrant, though he hath spilt Blood
like Water in his Conquests, though he
hath made no more of destroying mens
Lives, than <hi>Tarquinius</hi> did of taking off
the heads of Poppies, or <hi>Domitian</hi> of
killing Flies, yet makes Peace some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
and tired with the Toyl and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue
of the War, concludes a Truce at
last with his Enemy; and what? Do
all these come into the society of the
blessed?</p>
            <p>To give you light into this affair, I
shall enquire,</p>
            <p>I. Who these Peace-makers are that
are pronounced blessed here.</p>
            <p>II. I shall examine the reasons of the
supposition or the thing supposed and
implied here, that those who have an
aversion from this Peace-making are,
and cannot be blessed.</p>
            <p>III. I shall take the blessedness of these
Peace makers into consideration, and
shew how, and upon what account they
are, and shall be call'd the Children of
God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:108689:156"/>
I. Who these Peace-makers are, that
are said to be blessed here.</p>
            <p>The word in the Original is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>,
which as Interpreters observe in
Greek Authors signifies and denotes
strictly those who make or procure
Peace among Persons who disagree, and
unite those who are at variance, but in
Scripture the expression is of a larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and includes a great deal more
than a bare reconciling of Enemies, and
the persons here aimed at are as follows.</p>
            <p>1. Such as do make Peace with God
and with their Consciences. To this
purpose is the exhortation, <hi>Job</hi> XXI.
22. <hi>Acquaint now thy self with him, and
be at Peace, and great good shall come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee:</hi> And from this Peace with God,
arises that <hi>Peace in believing,</hi> we read
of, <hi>Rom.</hi> XV. 13. Man naturally is
at Enmity with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> V. 10. to be
sure, an Enemy of the Cross of Christ,
for the Law of the Cross is directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to the Principles and Dictates of
sinfull Flesh, <hi>Phil.</hi> III. 18. and this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
still grows greater and greater, as
corrupt nature is improved or abused in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
more corrupt practices, and from hence
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:108689:157"/>
flows Mans misery. So that to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
a Man must be at Peace with God,
which is a Maxim so natural, that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
do not think themselves safe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
appeasing their angry Deities, and
this puts them upon offering Sacrifices
to them. But this doth not take with
the true God, who delights not in
burnt-offerings. The Sacrifices of God,
which unite the Soul to him, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
a Peace betwixt God and the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
are a broken and a contrite Heart,
and laying aside voluntarily and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
and from a sense of the madness
of the attempt, even of resisting and clash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with an Omnipotent Being, those
things which God professes and declares
his Hatred and Abhorrency of, and a
chearfull Compliance with his revealed
Will; and you all know that the things he
hates are our sinfull customs, practices
and inclinations, for <hi>your Iniquities
have separated betwixt you and your God,
and your sins have hid his Face from you,</hi>
saith God, <hi>Isa.</hi> LIX. 2.</p>
            <p>To be at Peace with God, a man
must be at War with his sinfull Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
To live in Peace with these, is
to fall out with God, and the longer
we maintain Friendship and Familiarity
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:108689:157"/>
with these, the greater becomes the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
betwixt God and our Souls, the
breach is still made wider, till we sin
away at last all hopes of Reconciliation;
where the Soul hath any reasonable as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
that God is at Peace with her,
there Joy, and Gladness, and Serenity
flows naturally into her bosom, and
that is the Peace of Conscience, St. <hi>Paul</hi>
speaks of, <hi>Rom.</hi> XIV. 17. And indeed
there are no persons more likely to be
successfull in making Peace among men,
than those who first make Peace with
God, and with their own Consciences.</p>
            <p>2. Such as make it their business to
live peaceably in humane societies, and
seek to maintain that Peace, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nature, or Religion, or Friendship,
or Neighbourhood have settled among
men, with whom we live; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this sort of Peace-making, St.
<hi>Paul</hi> speaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> XII. 18. <hi>If it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as much as in you lies, live peaceable
with all men.</hi> To maintain Peace, is
part of Peace-making, for this is to make
that Peace which is begun and which we
find settled to our hands to continue and
flourish; in a word, to preserve it, and
according to the old saying, <hi>Non minor
est vertus, &amp;c.</hi> It is as great a Vertue
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:108689:158"/>
to preserve the good thing which we
have purchas'd, as to purchase it; and
while we behave our selves inoffensive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
unblameably, and keep a Conscience
void of offence toward God and Man,
we take the readiest way to live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably.
It's granted, that the most inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
actions, nay even Acts of Duty
and Devotion may stir up the wrath
and fury of cholerick and prejudiced
men, as we see the Apostles by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Gospel, and attempting to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
men from their Vices, and telling
them their Duty, rais'd all the World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
themselves; but this is not our
fault, as long as we give no just occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to men to quarrel with us, or give
no just offence; while we are ready to
do good offices, do by others as we
would have others do by us, and in our
Discourses, and behaviour observe the
rules of Modesty, Decency, Sobriety,
and Charity; if after all, men will speak
ill of us, and be angry, because we will
not run out with them into excess of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot,
as it seems those did St. <hi>Peter</hi>
speaks of, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> IV. 4. We have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
a good Conscience, and may
comfort our selves with this, That we
have given no just occasion to break the
Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:108689:158"/>
3. And here comes in the stricter
signification of the word, such as from
a sense of Christian Love and Charity
endeavour to reconcile disagreeing Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and Neighbours, and their fellow
Christians that are at variance: And
concerning this peace-making, St. <hi>Paul</hi>
gives this grave and serious Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> VI. 5, 6. <hi>I speak to your shame.
Is it so, that there is not a wise man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you? no not one that is able to judge
between his Brethren? But Brother goes
to law with Brother.</hi> And this must needs
be his meaning in that other Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Rom.</hi> XIV. 9. where he bids us <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
after the things which make for Peace.</hi>
And indeed, where there is true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Compassion, a man will not only
be ready to run to make up differences,
when he is entreated, but of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
and before he be entreated, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
where either Friendship and a
long Acquaintance, or some near Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
gives the invitation. It was barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
language of <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> IV. 9. <hi>Am
I my Brother's keeper.</hi> Such a word must
not drop from the Hearts and Mouths
of those who are adjured by Bowels of
Mercy, not to look every one on his
own things, but every man also on the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:108689:159"/>
things of his Neighbours, as all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
are, <hi>Phil.</hi> II. 4. The common laws
of humane societies, require this Peace-making,
much more the Laws of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity;
and since we are bound to love
our Neighbours as our selves, how is
it possible to obey that Law, without
endeavouring to foder and join the clash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and dis-jointed Members of Christ's
mystical body; in doing so, we love
our Neighbours as our selves, even in
endeavouring to keep others from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing,
as we would keep our selves
from being at variance with others. <hi>How
good and how pleasant a thing is it for
Brethren to dwell together in unity; it is
like the precious ointment that ran down
from Aaron's head into his Beard, and so
on to the skirts of his cloathing,</hi> saith the
Royal Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> CXXXIII. 1, 2.
As Christians, we are all Brethren, and
then it must be our duty to see the
Beauty, Order and Harmony of that
brotherly society preserved, which is
impossible to be done, without actual
and personal endeavours of reconciling
those who are at difference, and this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<hi>Moses</hi> made use of, when he
saw two <hi>Israelites</hi> striving together,
and would have set at one, <hi>Why do you
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:108689:159"/>
wrong one to another, seeing ye are Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
Act. VII. 26.</p>
            <p>4. Such as endeavour to make others
like themselves, and do instill this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Principle of reconciling Persons,
that quarrel and live in Enmity, into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
This is still making Peace, when
we labour to make others enamour'd
with this duty of Peace-making, which
is done either by Exhortation, or Entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or Representing to others the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness,
Excellency, and Profitableness
of this peaceable and peace-making Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
It's natural for men to endeavour
to make others of the same Temper and
Principles with our selves, which is the
reason that men of all Persuasions do
what they can to make Proselytes. A
truly good man cannot forbear saying
with St. <hi>Paul, I wish that all men were even
as my self,</hi> 1 Cor. VII. 7. I mean with
respect to the good things, the Grace
of God hath infused into him: And as
no man can be sincerely good, without
endeavouring to unite, and reconcile
his disagreeing Neighbours, so that
Goodness will farther prompt him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speak
those of his Acquaintance in St.
<hi>Paul</hi>'s language, <hi>Brethren, be followers
together of me, and mark them that walk
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:108689:160"/>
so, as you have us for ensamples,</hi> Philip.
III. 17.</p>
            <p>And from hence it will be an easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to give a just answer to the Objection
I proposed at first; whether all Peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
are indifferently concerned in the
blessedness of the Text; It's plain from
hence, that not every one that makes Peace
either by force, or of necessity, or for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
and interest, or being tired with a
long and tedious War. Not every one
of these comes into the number of those
blessed men. All the four Qualifications
I have mention'd are requisite to entitle
a man to this happiness making Peace
with God, and our Consciences, living
peaceably, and from a sense of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
love and charity, endeavouring to
reconcile disagreeing Neighbours, and
instilling this reconciling Principle into
others.</p>
            <p>And having thus laid down the true
Characters of these Peace-makers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you may examine your selves, let's
go on, and,</p>
            <p>II. Enquire into the reasons of the
supposition, or that which is implied
here, that those who have an aversion
from this Peace-making, cannot be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
or happy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:108689:160"/>
The reasons are,</p>
            <p>1. Selfishness is plainly predominant
in such persons, and that's no good cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of bliss, so far from it, that the
Apostle reckons it among the Plagues of
the last days, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> III. 1, 2. <hi>This know
also, that in the last days perillous times
shall come, for men shall be lovers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
It's true to love our selves, is a
natural principle, but to love our selves
so as not to be concerned for the good of
others, is a sinfull self love, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
us contemptible to God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicable
to rational men. He that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
not whether his Neighbours fight
or agree, whether they live in love or
wrath, and sees a fire kindled in their
Breasts, a fire lighted by the Flames of
Hell, a fire which breaks forth, and
threatens to lay their Consciences wast,
and doth not offer his helping hand to
quench it, hath a Soul base and low, a
poor pitifull Spirit, guilty enough to
suffer in Hell, but alienated from that
life which must give him a title to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>2. He that doth not make Peace with
God or with his own Conscience, and
cares not for it, robs himself of the greatest
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:108689:161"/>
comfort; and surely that man can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be happy. To be at Peace with
God, is to be at Peace with our judge,
with him who hath the same power
over us, that the Potter hath over his
Clay, and is able to destroy both Soul
and Body into Hell; with him whose
voice breaks the Cedars, divides the
Flames of Fire, shakes the Wilderness,
and makes the Mountains tremble, and
who hath a Prison to tame men in, a
Prison from whence there is no coming
out till they have paid the uttermost
Farthing. To be at Peace with this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
and Sovereign Being, must
needs be a mighty satisfaction to the
Soul that knows what God is, and looks
beyond this world: To enjoy his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
to be sure of his favour, to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
of his good will, this establishes
the Soul, and gives her courage in the
time of the greatest Danger. He that
is indifferent, whether he be at Peace
with God or not, not to mention that
he is a Sot and a Fool, and understands
not his true interest, he deprives himself
of that which ought to be the greatest
stay and staff of his life, and therefore
whatever his outward conveniencies,
and Accommodations may be, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:108689:161"/>
3. He that doth not or will not live
peaceably with his Neighbours, I need
not tell you that he is unhappy, for he
himself finds by sad experience, that he is
so. The Disorders and Tumults he finds
within, the uneasiness of his condition,
the danger he is in from without, and
the vexation and discontent he runs into
are sufficient Items that he is as far from
being happy, as he is from being wise:
<hi>His lusts war within his members,</hi> as St.
<hi>James</hi> speaks, <hi>Jam.</hi> IV. 1. His Soul is
<hi>like the troubled Sea, when it cannot rest,</hi>
Isa. LVII. 20. He is no kin to God, for he
is <hi>the God of Peace,</hi> Rom. XVI. 20. No
kin to Angels, for they <hi>rejoyce in Peace
on Earth,</hi> Luk. II. 14. No kin to good
men, for they <hi>seek Peace and ensue it,</hi>
1 Pet. III. 11. If he be related to any
thing, it is to the Prince of Darkness, who
delights in <hi>wrath and envy,</hi> Rev. XII. 17.</p>
            <p>4. Such men are no Children of God,
and therefore cannot be blessed; that's
the argument of the Text, <hi>Blessed are
the Peace-makers, for they shall be called
the Children of God;</hi> therefore those that
have an aversion from this Peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
are not blessed, because no Children
of God; surely no Children of God,
when so much of that Spirit reigns in
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:108689:162"/>
them, which rules in the Children of
Disobedience: He particularly that seeks
not to be at Peace, or to live peaceably
with his Neighbour, most certainly
doth not love his Brother, and he that
loves him not, is by the Holy Ghost in
Scripture put into the number of strange
Children, for so we read, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> III. 10.
<hi>Herein the Children of God are manifest,
and the Children of the Devil: he that
works not righteousness is not of God, neither
he that loves not his Brother.</hi> Not to love
our Brother, and to hate him in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
are equivalent, different expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for the same sin; and if any man
say, <hi>I am in the light, and hate his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he is in darkness, and walks in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and knows not whither he goes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the darkness hath blinded his Eyes,</hi>
1 Joh. II. 11.</p>
            <p>So that true Blessedness lies altogether
in the opposite temper, <hi>viz.</hi> the Peace-makers,
and of these it is, that it's said,
<hi>They shall be called the Children of God;</hi>
and how, and upon what account they
shall be called the Children of God, is
the</p>
            <p>III. And last particular, I am to speak
to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:108689:162"/>
And here I must premise, that in
Scripture Language, to be called so, is
very often as much as to be so; <hi>And
thou Child shalt be called the Prophet of
the most High,</hi> i. e. thou shalt be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>Luk.</hi> I. 76. and after the same
manner, <hi>That holy thing which shall be
born of thee, shall be called the Son of God,</hi>
i. e. shall be the Son of God; so <hi>Matth.</hi>
I. 23. <hi>They shall call his name Emanuel,</hi>
i. e. he shall be so, God with us, God
and Man. And after this stile, you are
to understand the Phrase of the Text,
<hi>They shall be called the Children of God,</hi>
i. e. they are and shall be so.</p>
            <p>Children of God! Why? What great
blessedness is there in this title, beyond
what other men enjoy? Are not Princes
and great Men, who are commonly none
of the best, called the <hi>Children of God,</hi> Psal.
LXXXII. 6. and is not God the Father of
all mankind. It is very true, but still there
is a very great difference between Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and Children. All rational creatures,
both Men and Angels, are God's Children,
as they are the works of his hands, and
with this respect, even Devils come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that number, because they owe their
Being to an Omnipotent God. Princes
and great Men particularly are the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:108689:163"/>
Children of God upon the account of
Power, and Grandure, and Authority
God communicates to them, but for
all these respects, they may be everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
miserable. To be a Child of God
by Regeneration, to be born again, to
be born of God, to be begotten again
through a lively hope, by the Word
and Spirit, this is it, that makes the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
truly comfortable, and such Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are the Peace-makers commended
here. To be a Child of God in this
sense, is more, and a greater honour,
than to be related to all the greatest Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the World. For,</p>
            <p>1. Such Children of God have higher
marks of favour set upon them. They
enjoy the Blessings of God's left hand in
common with the rest, but besides these,
they have Blessings of the right hand
heap'd upon them. Besides the Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
Protection, Provision for their
bodies, and common Deliverances from
dangers, they participate of with the
greater number, their Souls are visited
by very magnificent Guests; For if <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man love me, he will keep my words,
and my Father will love him, and we will
come unto him, and make our abode with
him,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> XIV. 23.
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:108689:163"/>
God Governs them by his Spirit, and
<hi>feeds them like a Shepherd, gathers the
lambs into his arms, carries them in his
bosom, and gently leads those that are with
young,</hi> Isa. XL. 11. They are made
Partakers of the divine nature, love what
God loves, hate what he hates, desire
what he desires, and aim at the same end
God himself aims at, to wit, the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God, blessed for evermore.</p>
            <p>2. To such Children of God belong
the Promises of the everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
and there is no condemnation in
them. They are deliver'd from the
wrath to come, and Christ intercedes
for them in Heaven. For them the
balm of <hi>Gilead</hi> flows, and when their
Souls are sick, Physick is administred
to them from the Clouds. They are
wash'd, they are justified, they are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
and shall at last be glorified. To
such power is given to tread on Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
and upon all the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
For their sakes, God spares whole
Nations. To go no farther than our
own: All sober men believe we are
ripe for God to put in the Sickle of
vengeance. The Atheism, Profaneness
and Hypocrisie, the dull Formality we
are sunk into under the greatest encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:108689:164"/>
together with other crying
Sins, which are among us, are enough
to make a rational man wonder, that
the Viols of the wrath of God are not
yet poured out upon us, but it's for the
Children of God's sake, who are among
us, that we are spared thus long; for
their sakes it is that God brings the
strangest things about, and though they
are try<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>d often by Affliction, yet the
Fire, that proves them, doth only
cleanse, not crush the Frame. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
them, God sends his own Guard, a
Troop of Angels to surround their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and habitations; and if so, the
blessedness of such must infinitely exceed
the happiness of those, who are called
Children of God, upon the account ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their Creation, or Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>But to come closer to the words, the
Peace-makers are in a very special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the Children of God, if you consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them either with respect to this life,
or with regard to that to come, for to
both these states, as I have told you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
does the recompences mention<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>d in
these Beatitudes relate.</p>
            <p>As to this present life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:108689:164"/>
1. They are Children of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are like him. They express
his Nature in their own: For God is <hi>the
God of Peace,</hi> Philip. IV. 9. His Divine
Essence is the true Pattern of Peace and
Order. The ever-blessed Trinity is the
grand Exemplar of Concord and Unity.
It's God, <hi>that makes Peace within thy
Borders,</hi> saith <hi>David,</hi> Psal. CXLVII. 14.
He <hi>speaks Peace to his People,</hi> Ps. LXXXV. 8.
He <hi>creates Peace,</hi> Isa. LVII. 19. And <hi>calls
to Peace,</hi> 1 Cor. VII. 15. And <hi>is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of Peace,</hi> 1 Cor. XIV. 33. And <hi>is
the Lord of Peace,</hi> 2 Thess. III. 16. The
peaceable, and such as are of a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Temper, resemble this God of Peace;
He lives in them; There is a great simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
betwixt that inexhausted Spring,
and these little Rivulets; a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
betwixt these Copies, and that
Original. The features and lineaments
of Peace, that appear upon their Souls,
discover that they are the Children of
God.</p>
            <p>2. They are the adopted Children of
God in Christ Jesus. Christ is the true,
natural, and only begotten Son of God.
The peaceable, and such as are of a
peace-making Temper, tread in the
Steps of Christ, imitate his peaceable
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:108689:165"/>
Nature, and upon that Account are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Honour of his Filiation,
and Son-ship. The Spirit of Peace,
which dwelt in Christ Jesus, dwells in
them, <hi>Col.</hi> III. 15. Christ is the Prince of
Peace, so he is call'd, <hi>Isa.</hi> IX. 6. Nay he
is our Peace, who made both one, and
pulled down the middle Wall of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between us, having abolish'd in his
Flesh, the Enmity, even the Law of
Commandments, contain'd in Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
making in himself of twain, one
new Man, so making Peace, <hi>Eph.</hi> II. 14,
15. <hi>And he came and preach'd Peace to
them that were a far off, and to them who
are nigh,</hi> vers. 17. He is the great Peace-maker,
who made Peace betwixt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, which makes the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
sing at his Nativity; <hi>Glory be to
God on high, and on Earth Peace,</hi> Luke
II. 14.</p>
            <p>Nor doth Christ's Saying, <hi>Matth.</hi> X. 34.
<hi>Think not that I am come to send Peace
upon Earth, I am not come to send Peace,
but a Sword. I am come to set a Man at
variance against his Father, and the
Daughter against the Mother,</hi> &amp;c. I say,
this Oracle doth not at all invalidate,
or weaken the Character, or Title gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him, which is Prince of Peace; for
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:108689:165"/>
in so saying, he only describes the unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Events, and Consequences of his
Gospel.</p>
            <p>1. When a Man is truly converted to
the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,
there is immediately infused into him
a mighty hatred and indignation against
sin, and vice, where-ever he meets with
it, though it be in a Father, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or Brethren, or Sisters. To find it
in such Relations, doth not make him
like it the better, nor can all their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasions
make him have any good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of it; and therefore if the Father
be carnal and wicked, he will hate his
Son for being so holy and precise, and
keeping such a stir about Religion; or if
the Father be good, and the Son nought,
the Son will be either secretly, or open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
angry with his Father, for having so
strait-laced a Conscience. Hence arise
quarrels and dissensions, which are not
the natural Effects of the Gospel,
but of Men's vitious humours, which
hate to be controll'd by the Gospel; and
hither must be referr'd the Persecutions,
that befell the Primitive believers, when
they would not offer incense to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Gods, whereupon they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison'd,
harrass'd, persecuted with Fire
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:108689:166"/>
and Sword. The Son rose against his
Father, if he were a Christian, and the
Daughter did her best to throw the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Mother into the Fire, and the
nearest Relations became mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
one to another; not that Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
made the Christians hate their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Relations, but it made the Heathen
Relations hate their Christian Kindred.</p>
            <p>2. This Christ speaks with relation
to those Carnal and Hypocritical Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours
of his Religion, who in After-ages,
pusht on by Pride and by the Devil un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a pretence of Zeal for his Honour,
and Glory, would kill, butcher, burn,
massacre thousands of their Brethren,
who retain'd the Substantials of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
only differ'd from them in things
which Carnality, and Pomp, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
and Ambition to regulate the
Church by the Court of Princes, should
add to the ancient Faith deliver'd unto
the Saints, and of this we have seen
very sad instances: But still, these are
only accidental Effects of Men's Pride
and Passions, not the natural Products of
the Design and Tendency of the Gospel;
so that notwithstanding all these quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
and dissensions ill Men raise about
the Gospel, Christ is still the Prince of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:108689:166"/>
Peace, and the Peaceable, and such as
are of a peace-making Temper, are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that account his Brethren, for <hi>he is
not asham'd to call them Brethren,</hi> Heb.
II. 11. and therefore the Children of
God.</p>
            <p>As to the Life to come.</p>
            <p>These Peace-makers shall be, and shall
be treated like darling Children of God.
This St. <hi>John</hi> assures us of, 1 <hi>John</hi> III. 2.
Beloved, now are we the Sons of God,
and it doth not yet appear what we
shall be, but we know, that when he
shall appear we shall be like him. Like
him! How? Like him in Eternal Glory
and Honour, and Splendour. They were
like Christ in their peace-making Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
here, and they shall be like him in a
glorious Immortality. Their Father
which is in Heaven will let Men and
Angels sees that they are his Children,
that they are so not in Name only, but
in Deed. He will give the unbelieving
World a visible Demonstration, that they
are so in the last Day, in the great Day
of Account; he will place them at Christ's
Right-hand, and the Men that would
not believe and repent, shall behold how
dear they are to him; for the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
shall carry them up into his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:108689:167"/>
Kingdom: <hi>If Sons then Heirs,
Heirs of God, and joint Heirs with Christ,</hi>
saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> VIII. 17. Christ
as Man, and Mediatour, became Heir of
his Father's Royalty, and Power; so shall
they in the right of adopted Children.
As Christ ascended into Heaven so shall
they; as Christ was exalted so shall they;
as Christ was enthroned so shall they;
as Christ was advanced from a low E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
to the highest Dignity so shall they;
as Christ lives for ever so shall they; as
Christ cannot be hurt by the second
Death no more shall they; as Christ had
power given him over the Nations, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Hell and Devils, so shall they reign
over all their Enemies; as Christ shall
judge the World, and the Apostate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
so shall they; being Fellow-sons,
Fellow-heirs, they all share in his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Grandeur: It's true, all this
must be believed, for it is not seen yet;
but who can forbear to believe it, when
we have the Word of the living God
for it?</p>
            <p>In a word, They shall be Possessours
of Heaven and Earth; for not only their
Father, but their Elder Brother is so.
Crowns and Diadems are preparing for
them; Crowns which fade not away,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:108689:167"/>
Crowns which the Moth cannot corrupt,
nor Thieves break through and steal;
Crowns made of Beams of Eternal Light;
Crowns which not only adorn their
Heads, but fill their Faces with incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Beauty; Crowns such as Angels
wear; Crowns which cannot be view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
cannot be thought of, without Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Admiration.</p>
            <div type="inferences">
               <head>Inferences.</head>
               <p>I. It is easie to guess what Tempers
and Actions are contrary, and directly
opposite to the admirable Qualification
recommended, and commanded in the
Text. Peace being either publick or
private, and the publick either Political,
or Ecclesiastical, either of Church or
State; whoever they be that wilfully
pusht on by Pride or Passion, or some
worldly carnal Design, without a just,
lawfull, or warrantable Cause, disorder,
or disturb that Peace, cannot be true
Disciples of Christ, because they have
an Aversion from that peaceable, peace-keeping,
and peace-making Temper,
which Christ with all the pathetick Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurations
imaginable hath enjoin'd his
Followers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:108689:168"/>
I shall not here reflect on secular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
and Princes, who either begin or
maintain an unjust Warr, either to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
themselves by the Spoils of their
Neighbours, or to advance their own
Glory, or to enlarge their Empire, and
Dominion; for the very Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
confutes these Practices, and he
that is but a Novice in Religion may
see, nothing is more contrary to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of the Gospel. However, I cannot
but spend some Considerations on the sad
Divisions and Quarrels, that are among
those who call themselves Christians,
upon the Account of Religion.</p>
               <p>I wonder not to see Mahometans and
Jews scandaliz'd at these Divisions, the
Jews especially, when they read such
lofty Promises of the Peace and Unity of
the Church, that was to be under the
Messiah, as <hi>Isa.</hi> II. 4. <hi>They shall heat their
Spears into Plough-shares, and their
Swords into Pruning-hooks. Nation shall
not lift up Sword against Nation, neither
shall they learn War any more;</hi> and <hi>Isa.</hi>
XI. 6. <hi>The Wolf shall dwell with the
Lamb, and the Leopard lie down with the
Kid, and the Calf, and the young Lion,
and the Fatling together, and a little
Child shall lead them.</hi> Though these
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:108689:168"/>
Prophecies have been in a great measure
fulfill'd, not only in the Apostles times,
when the Jews and Gentiles, who were
mortal Enemies before united into one
Church under their common Head Christ
Jesus; but afterward when the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
became Christian, and the Heathen
Powers, who had most violently perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
the Christians, submitted to the
Gospel, and embraced those whom they
had burnt before; and though these
Prophecies may moreover be said to be
exactly fulfilled, partly with respect to
the Design and Tendency of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion, the design and intent of
Christ's Laws being to make Men peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and partly with respect to the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Change that's actually wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those who are truly, not only in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and outwardly, but inwardly too,
converted to the Faith of Christ; for
upon this Conversion their former ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and enmity to others is laid aside,
and they are all for Peace and Concord;
though I say these Prophecies are actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accomplisht in despight of all the
Sects, that profess Christ's Religion; yet
the Jews, a dull, hard, inconsiderate sort
of People, and who are guided much by
their Senses; seeing the everlasting quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:108689:169"/>
that are among Christians, and how
one party persecutes and abuses the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and upon what slight occasions
they quarrel and fall out, and break
Peace and Communion one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
I wonder not to see them offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at these doings, and harden'd in their
Unbelief; for not to mention the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
Heresies and Schisms in the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Church, at this day, the Eastern
Churches stand divided against the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern;
the Western is broke into seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Parties; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> against
the Protestants, and the Protestants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
are divided among themselves.</p>
               <p>In these Divisions the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
erects her Head, and pretends she is the
only True and Catholick Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are united among themselves.
But to shew the weakness of this boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting:</p>
               <p>1. At this rate every particular Church
must be the Catholick Church, because
the Members of every particular Church
are united among themselves. So in the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> her Members and
Pastours all subscribing to the Articles
of her Communion, and professing the
same Doctrine, Ceremonies, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:108689:169"/>
whether they be in <hi>Europe,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi>
or <hi>Asia,</hi> or <hi>America;</hi> and there is
no particular Church, that's constituted
by any publick Authority, but may boast
of this Unity.</p>
               <p>2. It is not a bare Union of Men that
makes a Church a true Church, but
that Union must have Truth for its
Foundation; else you know, Thieves,
and Robbers, and High-way-men, and
Pyrates, and Buccaneers, because they
agree among themselves might lay claim
to this Title, and the most perverse He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
because they agree in certain
Points, might say they are the true
Church, and Heathens and Pagans, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they agree in Superstition, and in
believing a Multitude of Gods, might
bid fair for this Character. However,</p>
               <p>3. The Unity the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
boasts of, is only a pretence; for all the
World knows the mighty differences
that are within her own Bosom, of the
<hi>Scotists</hi> and <hi>Thomists,</hi> of the <hi>Franciscans</hi>
and <hi>Dominicans,</hi> of the <hi>Jansenists</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,</hi>
who stick not to call one another
Hereticks; not to mention the late Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
betwixt the Disciples of <hi>Molinos,</hi>
and their Opponents; and were it not
for fear of Fire, and Prisons, and the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:108689:170"/>
Inquisition, some of these would break
out into open War against their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
and Competitours. Nay,</p>
               <p>4. There is no Christian Church that
hath been more guilty of breaking the
Peace of Christendom, than the Church
of <hi>Rome;</hi> and because several Churches
would not satisfie or gratifie her Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
would not put their Necks under
her Yoke, nor believe the falsest and
idlest thing in the World, her Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Infallibility, she hath boldly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
her self from their Communion;
this was the reason why she separated
from the Eastern Churches, and by this
insolence she hath forced the Protestant
Churches from her Communion, and
not he that is forced away, but he that
forces is the Schismatick.</p>
               <p>And indeed, that which justifies the
Protestant Churches separation from her,
or breaking Peace and Communion with
her, is</p>
               <p>1. Because she would impose that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Consciences of Men, which Christ
and his Apostles never imposed.</p>
               <p>2. Because she hath turned the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Worship of the Gospel, into carnal
and mechanical Devotion, and introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
innumerable Superstitions, which
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:108689:170"/>
have no foundation in the Word of God,
and would have them believ'd as firmly
as the Gospel it self.</p>
               <p>3. Because she hath brought in a
Worship, which with all the favourable
Interpretations imaginable, cannot be
excused from Idolatry; even the Worship
of dead Men and Women, of the Bread
in the Eucharist, of Images and Pictures,
and Reliques, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> contrary to the Design
of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>4. Because though she hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
entreated, admonish'd, and exhorted
to reform these Abuses, for some hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years together, yet she is obstinate,
and instead of reforming hath harden'd
her self in them, and thinks to hectour
Men by her Power and Authority into
a Belief of that, which cannot be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with solid Arguments.</p>
               <p>5. Because rejecting the Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Scriptures, which are the
sole Rule of Faith, she hath made her
pretended Head, and such Councils as he
shall call, or approve of, the sole Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
and Expositours of the Doctrine
of Christ, requiring blind Obedience to
their Decisions contrary, not only to
the Word of God, but to the Sense of all
true Antiquity: So that there can be
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:108689:171"/>
no peace, I mean no Peace of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with <hi>Rome;</hi> for though we are
commanded to live peaceably with all
Men, yet we are withall to have a due
regard to Truth, <hi>Eph.</hi> IV. 15. Nor must
Peace be bought at so dear a Rate, as to
comply with Men in their Sins and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
which is the Reason why Peace
and Holiness are join'd together in that
known Exhortation of the Apostle. <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
peace with all men, and Holiness, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which no man shall see the Lord,</hi> Heb.
XII. 14. Indeed an external Peace we
are to maintain with all Mankind, but
this differs much from Peace of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in Divine Worship and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The Divisions among Protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are to be deplored so much the
more, because the Points they differ in
are inconsiderable, and might easily be
composed, if Men had but peaceable
Tempers, and were resolved to lay aside
Interest, and carnal Respects, and <hi>Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilio</hi>'s
of Honour, and Credit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for
they all agree in fundamentals, all are
satisfied that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath
notoriously deviated from the simplicity
of the Gospel; and the matters in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
are things in which Salvation is
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:108689:171"/>
not concerned. And upon that account
their labours deserve great Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
who heretofore, and very lately
have endeavour'd to reconcile the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Churches into a perfect Union:
A blessed Work. <hi>Blessed are the Peace-makers,</hi>
that endeavour to make Peace
among the jarring Members of Christ's
Body; and though they may fail of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
yet they shall not lose their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>In the mean while those who widen,
or heighten these differences, and incite
the respective Parties to hatred, and
wrath, and animosities one against an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
to be sure are no Children of the
God of Peace, and had need at least be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they die, make publick Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the dreadfull Effects, their Heats
and Passions do produce.</p>
               <p>But as this Peace among Protestant
Churches is very much to be wish'd and
pray'd for, so I despair to see so glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a Work take effect, except the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Parties would resolve to stand to
the Rules following.</p>
               <p>1. That the respective Parties which
agree in the chief Points of Religion do
not make any of those Points they differ
in, fundamental, as if the Fortune of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:108689:172"/>
depended upon it, or as if those
different Points were so many different
Religions.</p>
               <p>2. That the differing Parties do not
damn one another for those differences,
there being nothing that hath done Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
more hurt, than Men's damning
one another for things, which Christ and
his Apostles have affixed no Damnation
to.</p>
               <p>3. That notwithstanding the little
differences that are among them, they
make one Church, and endeavour after
the Welfare and Prosperity of it, and
join together in publick Prayer, and in
the Sacrament of the Eucharist, which
is the Badge and Symbol of Fraternity,
and Amity.</p>
               <p>4. That one Party be not presently
jealous, and suspicious of the other, as if
the opinion which one Party espouses
were embraced, or maintain'd in a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
or for worldly Ends, but that
they charitably believe, it's Conscience,
that puts them upon it, at least, till ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Party espousing that opinion
confesses, that conscience is not at the
bottom of it, or that it appear by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
Evidences, that a worldly or si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
design is the foundation of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:108689:172"/>
5. That the differing Parties do not
multiply the controversies, which are
amongst them, make them neither more
numerous nor greater than really they
are, and that they do not interpret an
accidental unwary expression, that may
drop from the Pen, or mouth of one
party, as a new controversie.</p>
               <p>6. That one party do not charge the
other with consequences, which they do
not own, nor with Doctrines and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
which they detest from their
hearts.</p>
               <p>7. That each party defending, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their opinion do it with great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
without provoking or exaspera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or approbrious Language, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings,
or bitter reflections on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>8. That of these differing parties none
do vye with the other, except it be in
living up to the Precepts of the Gospel,
particularly those of patience, long-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
and charity.</p>
               <p>These rules I apprehend to be the
foundation of Peace and Concord of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Churches, that differ in points of
no great concernment; and were these
Maxims once put in practice, the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
controversies might soon be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promised.
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:108689:173"/>
To this purpose is that saying
of the Apostle: <hi>Nevertheless, where to we
have already attained, let's walk by the
same rule, let's mind the same things<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
and if any be otherwise minded, God will
even reveal that unto you,</hi> Phil. III. 15, 16.
But however,</p>
               <p>II. If we cannot mend the publick,
let's endeavour to reform particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
It is a sad sight to see Christians
divided among themselves, but it is as
dismal a spectacle to see so many of us
at war with God. This I know will
hardly be believed by the guilty, and
because they do not blaspheme God, or
do not trouble their heads much about
God, or Religion, they know nothing
to the contrary but that they are at peace
with God, and that they and God are
very good Friends. This is true stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
and were the stupidity invincible
as it is in Beasts, such Men would be
safe, safe as the wild Ass, or the Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medary
in the Wilderness, safe I say
from the Danger of God's Wrath. But
this cannot be the case of any of you,
that live in a Country where the Gospel
is preach'd, where you are told, that
not to love God, is to hate him; and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:108689:173"/>
that not to delight in his ways, is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr
his displeasure; that to live in those
sins, which exclude from the Kingdom
of Heaven, is to bid defiance to him;
that to be neglectfull of his Will, is to
wage war with him; that to slight the
admonitions, and entreaties of his Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers,
is to be at enmity with him;
and that to mind the World more than
his Service, or to seek to please Men
more than him, is to provoke him to
anger.</p>
               <p>And hath not this been the temper,
and is not this the complexion of many
of you? How many years have some of
you born Arms against God? Your wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
sins are the Weapons whereby you
fight against him; and though like the
Giants in the Fable, you do not heap
Mountain upon Mountain to pull him
out of his Throne; yet by espousing
that life, which is odious to him, you
affront his Sovereignty, and by living
contrary to the Gospel, you despise and
dishonour him who hath the greatest
right to command you. And is it not
high time to make peace with him? If
God be not at peace with you here, he
will never be at peace with you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
<hi>What peace while the Whoredoms
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:108689:174"/>
of thy Mother</hi> Jezabel, <hi>and her Witchcrafts
are so many?</hi> said <hi>Jehu,</hi> 2 Kings IX. 22.
So here, what peace can there be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
God and you, while you conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in that pride and vanity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance,
and other sins, against which
the wrath of God is revealed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
Do you think you are at peace
with God, because you thrive and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper
in the World? Do not the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of Men do so, and is that an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that God is their Friend? Will you
make his patience a sign of his being
reconciled to you, when it is only a
motive to a reconciliation? <hi>There is no
peace, saith my God, unto the wicked,</hi> Isa.
LVII. 20. Let them be never so potent,
never so rich, never so wealthy, their
impiety takes away all peace betwixt
God and them. He hath declared so
much, and will not you believe him?
Will you give no credit to his word,
till with <hi>Dives</hi> you lift up your Eyes in
Hell, and see that God is not your friend?
If you do thrive and prosper in the World,
cannot those Blessings move you to be at
peace with him? Do you believe he is
kind to you, and shall his kindness pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
you to be his Enemies? Nothing can
settle a peace betwixt God and you, till
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:108689:174"/>
you change your lives, and make consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of your ways, and abhorr that which
is evil, and cleave to that which is good.
Then indeed were your sins as crimson
they shall be as wool, were they of a
scarlet Dye, they shall be as white as
snow; but till then, your sin, like that
of <hi>Judah, is written with a pen of Iron,
and with the point of a Diamond,</hi> as it is
said, <hi>Jer.</hi> XVII. 1. and you do as good
as say to God with those Desperadoes, in
<hi>Job,</hi> Chap. XXI. 14. <hi>Depart from us, we
desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</hi> Till
then you can never be at peace with
your own consciences, carnal security
you may have, but peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is another thing, for this can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be at rest, while it hath reason to
believe God frowns upon it; but being
sure of the light of his loving kindness,
a Man walks in Paradise, and dwells in
the Garden of God. But,</p>
               <p>III. When Christ in the Text profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and declares how pleasing and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
a peaceable, and peace-making
Temper is to God; would not one think
that every one that believes the Gospel,
should be ambitious of those qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which God not only approves of,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:108689:175"/>
but promises to reward with the highest
Honour and Dignity? Yes, did Men love
God in deed and in truth, they would
not only be glad to know what is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to him, but even run to do it, as
good natured Children that observe their
Father's temper, and endeavour to gain
his love by a deportment and behaviour,
they know he delights in.</p>
               <p>Peace among men God delights in,
peace among Christians especially; to
whom he hath vouchsafed a higher dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation.
Among these, no noise, no
clamour, no railing, no quarrelling, no
Swords, no Cannon should be heard;
these profess themselves Disciples of
Christ Jesus, the Prince of Peace; and
there is no command that is more strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or more frequently injoin'd, than
that of Peace. This they are to pursue,
to follow, and to endeavour after by all
possible lawfull means. This is their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and the very mark, whereby they
are to be distinguish'd, even their peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Behaviour. This is the Salt which
is to keep them sweet, as Christ calls it,
<hi>Mark</hi> IX. 10. But you all know, how
contrary to this character the generality
of Men live, upon the least provocat on
they break the Peace, and all friendship
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:108689:175"/>
is renounced; especially where they have
a Purse to maintain the dispute; many
a Man that was humble and peaceable
before, when poor; no sooner doth he
find his Purse swell, but his Temper al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and now if his Neighbour doth
displease him, though there be no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
in the case, presently he talks high,
and big, and he cares as little for his
Neighbour, as his Neighbour doth for
him. This is the humour of the Age,
and instead of repenting of their heats,
and divisions, they justify their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
and oppose the reasons of
flesh and blood, and the circumstances
of their birth and quality, of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and grandeur, to the laws of that
Saviour, by whose Blood they say, they
are redeemed. Strange Christians these
that will be so, in despight of Christ,
though they have nothing of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
in them. And let us but consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what trifles they are Men quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and how frivolous the things for
which they break forth into flame, and
fury, and break the Peace which they
should maintain and keep, things, which
a Philosopher would put by with a smile,
and a wise Man think below himself to
take notice of. But what shall we say?
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:108689:176"/>
Till men come to stand in awe of the
Gospel, more than of the laws of the
Land, and the threatnings and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Magistrate, thus it will be,
and when opportunity serves will be
carried away with the stream of their
passions, and sinfull inclinations; and
upon such I cannot hope to do any
good, though the Arguments were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so convincing, or powerfull.</p>
               <p>But if there be any here, as I hope
there are several, that look upon this
peaceable, and peace-making Temper as
their duty, are perswaded that they
are in danger of God's displeasure, if
they want this qualification, and are
concern'd about it, and desire to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
of the way and method they are
to take, how to compass it; to such I
shall recommend these following Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>1. Be injurious to no man, wrong
no man, defraud no man, oppress no
man, speak evil of no man. This is the
way to make peace, and to keep peace.
It's the wrong that men apprehend is
done to them by another, that causes
quarrels and dissensions. Remove the
cause, and you remove the effect, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
prescribed by the Apostle, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:108689:176"/>
to a quiet and peaceable Life, <hi>Tit.</hi>
III. 2.</p>
               <p>2. Love to do good. This strangely
obliges, and wins, and charms, and moves
even our Enemies to be at peace with
us, and makes People desirous to live in
friendship with us, and not only so, but
hereby we weaken our quarrelsome dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
and become more tractable, and
gentle, and <hi>heap coals of fire upon the
heads of our Enemies,</hi> i. e. melt them by
kindness into a better nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> XII.
20.</p>
               <p>3. Watch against selfishness, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness,
for its greediness after profit, and
an over fondness of our temporal Interest,
that puts us into heats, if we are crost
in it. Moderation in our desires after
these outward things composes the mind,
quiets the passions, and keeps the blood
from boiling over. The Apostle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
very much insists upon this Vertue,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> VI. and <hi>Phil.</hi> IV. 5.</p>
               <p>4. Believe not every ill thing that is
said of you, for we see daily how little
credit is to be given to reports. A too
easie belief of ill things said of us, is an
instigation to break the peace, to harbour
hatred, and secret grudges, and tempts
to strangeness of behaviour, to revenge,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:108689:177"/>
to moroseness, and watching opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to be even with the supposed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendour,
charity believes the best, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
XIII. 7.</p>
               <p>5. Be not ashamed to confess your
faults, when it's evident you are in the
wrong; an obstinate defence of a fault,
is apt to make Persons, who take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it, angry and furious, because it
argues a very ill temper of mind;
whereas an ingenuous acknowledgment
of our errours, reconciles and prevails
with Persons of ingenuity to be friends
with us, and that's the reason why St.
<hi>James</hi> is so earnest for it, <hi>James</hi> V. 16.</p>
               <p>6. Bear with infirmities in others,
with such particularly, which appear to
be invincible. I do not say, bear with
wilfull sins, and habits of vice and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but with failings and imperfections,
which cannot well be remedied; either
when the understandings of your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
are shallow, or not so quick as
yours, or when their Wisdom and Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
doth not reach so far as yours, and
this according to the Command of the
Holy Ghost, <hi>Rom.</hi> XIV. 1.</p>
               <p>7. For peace sake be content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
sometimes from your own right:
Where two parties are stiff, and neither
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:108689:177"/>
will yield, or abate any thing of their
demands, the quarrel must needs conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.
But concessions and relinquishing
part of our right prepares for peace, and
so did the Father of the faithfull, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
dissensions betwixt him and <hi>Lot;</hi>
though upon the account of seniority,
it belong'd to him to determine where
he should pitch his Tent, yet he leaves it
to <hi>Lot</hi> to chuse, which part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
he would go to, <hi>Gen.</hi> XIII. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>8. In order to promote peace in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
<hi>David</hi>'s method must be taken, <hi>Ps.</hi>
CI. 6. <hi>Mine eyes shall be upon the faithfull
of the Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One great means to promote, and
preserve the publick Peace of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is to do our own business, to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of that which is good, to do our
own duty, and not to speak evil of
dignities; for it is written, <hi>Thou shalt
not speak evil of the Rulers of thy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Consider after all how your Interest is
bound up with this peaceable, and peace-making
Temper; for as Christ says <hi>of a
Kingdom divided against it self, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stand;</hi> so if by quarrels, and clamours,
and dissensions, you divide the Society
you live in, you undermine your own ease
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:108689:178"/>
and happiness. To this purpose <hi>Solomon,</hi>
Prov. XVII. 1. <hi>Better is a dry morsel, and
quietness therewith, than an house full of
sacrifices with strife.</hi> Besides, by this
you avoid innumerable sins, such as ill
language, odious names, envy, hatred,
malice, and revengefull sins, and desires,
and engaging other Men in sin with you,
and doing mischief to men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But is not the Title in the Text, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the peaceable, and peace-making
Christian, enough to make you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to attain to this Character? What?
Children of God? And do you feel no
desire to be so? Did you ever seriously
examine the privileges which attend
the Children of God, and are these no
motives to you to come into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber?
Suppose the Children of God are
not much regarded here, but is there
not a time coming, when they shall be
honoured before the whole World? Is
there not a life to come, which shall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
their Dignity, and their Glory?
The Peace of Heaven shall fall to their
share: Do not you reflect sometimes on
that Peace, which the Children of the
everlasting Kingdom shall enjoy? Or is
that Peace so inconsiderable, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
no consideration? What is the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:108689:178"/>
felicity, but perfect Peace, everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Peace, uninterrupted Peace? The
peaceable Christian shall feel it, feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, possess it, live upon it, peace with
God, peace with the Prince of Peace,
Christ Jesus, peace with all the Angels of
God, peace with all the Spirits of Men
made perfect. No war shall disturb it,
no tumult discompose it, no sedition an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy
it, no rebellion disfigure it. The
God of Peace shall live in him, and he
in the God of Peace; God will tell him
that he is his friend, and one with him,
and that no Men, no Devils shall pluck
him out of his hands. There Rivers of
Peace shall flow upon him, Rivers where
no Wind doth blow, no Storms do come,
no Tempests rise, no Hurricanes molest.
I conclude with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Obtestation,
<hi>Colos.</hi> III. 15. <hi>And let the Peace of God
rule in your hearts, to the which also ye
are called in one body: and be ye thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>
Amen.</p>

            <p>I Did once think to have joined this
Verse and the next in the Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but upon a more accurate Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
I find, that this Verse I have
read to you treats of Persecution in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
but the next of a particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
with the Tongue; <hi>i. e.</hi> Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niating
and Reviling, and therefore shall
allow them a distinct Discussion, or
Consideration. To be persecuted, is to
be robb'd, plunder'd, beaten, buffeted,
bruised, imprison'd, tormented, hanged,
burnt, drowned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And are these
marks of Blessedness, saith the Carnal
Man? What! to be beaten, and think it
a Kindness! to be buffeted, and look
upon it as a Favour! To be put in a
Dungeon, and delight in sinking into
the mire! To be led to the Stake, and
sing! To be tormented, and give God
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:108689:179"/>
thanks! To be robb'd of all, and make a
low bow for being so! What! be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in Misery! and blessed in Chains,
and glorious in Torments, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in a fiery Furnace! Yes, all this is
very good Divinity, and very agreeable
to the Doctrine of the Gospel of Christ;
and if the Cause be good, Gibbets, and
Gallows, and Chains, and Shackles, and
Fetters, and Fire, and Sword, are a
Christians Jewels, and Pearls, and Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
and Necklaces, and Ornaments;

            </p>
            <p>Three things will here deserve Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>I. What it is, to be persecuted for
Righteousness sake; and who they be,
that fall under that denomination.</p>
            <p>II. Whether these words, as well as
the preceding, imply a Negative, That
those who are not persecuted for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
sake are not blessed.</p>
            <p>III. I shall enquire into the Nature of
the Blessedness here mentioned, and
shew, how the Kingdom of Heaven is
theirs, that are persecuted for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
sake.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:108689:180"/>
I. What it is to be persecuted for
Righteousness sake, and who they be,
that fall under that denomination: In
answer to this,</p>
            <p>1. To persecute, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
is properly to follow hard after a
thing, and with great earnestness to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to seize upon a thing we desire,
or to pursue it as Hunters do their Prey,
which they quit not till they take it.
The word in Scripture is used sometimes
in a good, sometimes in a bad sense: In
a good sense, when it is applied to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
as 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> v. 15. <hi>Follow that which
is good.</hi> Heb. xii. 14. <hi>Follow Peace with
all men.</hi> 1 Cor. xiv. 1. <hi>Follow after Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
1 Tim. VI. 11. <hi>Follow after Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</hi>
In all which places, for <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi>
in the Original, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> is
used, which in other places we render
<hi>persecute,</hi> to shew, that till it be joined
with something else that alters the Sense,
it is no more, than following hard after
a thing. When it is applied to Persons,
it is commonly taken in a bad Sense,
and implies <hi>pursuing</hi> with a desire or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to hurt the Person pursued; and
that's the usual Notion and Acceptation
of the word, even to prosecute or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
a Person with an intent to afflict, or
hurt, or punish him; and that's the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:108689:180"/>
meaning of the word in the Text, where
the persecuted must be persons hunted
or haunted, teazed, tormented, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned,
abused, or, in a word, evil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated,
as is evident from Christ's scope
in these Beatitudes, which is to comfort
those whom the World counts miserable.</p>
            <p>2. By Righteousness here, is meant
the whole Circle of Religious Duties and
Offices, or Obedience to the Laws of
God or of the Gospel; and it takes in
both believing and practising, <hi>i. e.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
what God hath commanded us
to believe, and practising what God in
his Word hath commanded us to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
and consequently forbearing to
believe or practise, either what God hath
not revealed, or hath forbid to believe or
practise. I know the word <hi>Righteousness,</hi>
is used sometime for just dealing, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
for Mercy and Alms-giving, but
then there is some word in the Context
that shews, it must be restrained or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to that Sense, but here is nothing to
give it that determinate Sense; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it must be the same with Goodness
as it is opposed to Wickedness; and in
this Sense it's ordinarily used both in this
and the next Chapter; in this <hi>v.</hi> 6. and
20. in the next, <hi>v.</hi> 33. and is sometimes
called, <hi>The Righteousness of Faith,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:108689:181"/>
iv. 13. <hi>i. e.</hi> a chearfull performance of
the duties God hath commanded in the
Gospel; as the Righteousness of the Law
is complying with God's Will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
under the Law, or the <hi>Old Testament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being premised, it follows;</p>
            <p>1. That to be persecuted for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
sake, is not barely to suffer or to
endure Punishment; for at this rate all
Malefactors, and such as our Law punishes
either with the Sword, or with Fire, or
the Gallows, for Crimes which are destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to Humane Societies would fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this Notion. No, no, to suffer as an
evil doer, is a very different thing from
being persecuted for Righteousness sake.
St. <hi>Peter</hi> hath determined this long agoe,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 20. <hi>What glory<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> is it if when ye
are buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it
patiently, but if when you do well, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for it, ye take it patiently, this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
with God;</hi> and again, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iv. 15.
<hi>Let none of you suffer as a Murtherer, or
as a Thief, or as an evil doer, or as a busy-body
in other mens matters; but if any
man suffer as a Christian let him not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed.</hi>
That old Saying is very true, <hi>Not
the Suffering but the Cause makes the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.</hi>
Indeed, it is to be considered in all
Sufferings, and it skills very much what
it is we suffer, and what we suffer for,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:108689:181"/>
and what manner of man the person is
who suffers. Some we read of that have
suffer'd for Vain-glory, as <hi>Peregrinus</hi> in
<hi>Lucian,</hi> and the <hi>Gymnosophists,</hi> and <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
and <hi>Mutius,</hi> and the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and others in the Greek and Roman
Histories: And the <hi>Circumcelliones</hi> of old
were so fond of suffering Martyrdom, that
some would cast themselves down head-long
from steep Hills, or throw themselves
into Fire, or into Water, and even courted
men to knock them on the head: And
therefore the Church, <hi>Ps.</hi> xliv. 21, 22.
to remove all suspicions that she suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon a wrong Principle, or for a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
End, appeals to God the searcher
of all Hearts; <hi>He knows the secrets of the
Heart: for thy sake are we killed all the
day long;</hi> as if she had said, Thou, O Lord,
who knowest all things, knowest, that
it is not for a sinister End, or for Trifles
that we suffer, but it is for thy Name's
sake, and because we will not lift up our
Hands to a strange God.</p>
            <p>2. Nor is it to suffer for every Cause
where Conscience is pretended. He that
is persecuted for Righteousness sake suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
for his Conscience, but not every
one that suffers, and pretends he suffers
for Conscience, is therefore persecuted
for Righteousness sake. We know the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:108689:182"/>
greatest Villanies have been carried on
under a shew of Religion, and Conscience
hath been pleaded by Murtherers of
Kings, and Princes, and Bishops, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
and when such abominable
wretches have suffered for it, they have
been most justly punished, but far from
being persecuted, farther from being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
for Righteousness sake. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
Conscience when Men act against
a known Law of God is mocking of God,
and if it were lawfull to laugh at a thing
so sad and dreadful, deserves to be ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed
more than argued. <hi>Felix Mauz</hi> a
turbulent Anabaptist in <hi>Helvetia,</hi> being
put to death for practising against the
State and Government, had the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to thank God that he had called
him to seal the Truth with his Blood; and
among other expressions before his death,
said, <hi>Lord, into thy hands I do commend my
Spirit.</hi> It's like unwary and weak Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
look'd upon his suffering as being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
for Righteousness sake, but it was
nothing less, indeed no more than a just
Punishment for his Treasonable Practices,
however colour'd over with Expressions
and Sayings of Consciencious Men. He
that deceives himself, or suffers himself
to be deceiv'd into an erroneous Doctrine
or Practice, and believes that his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:108689:182"/>
dictates to him both that Belief and
Practice, and suffers for it, cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be said to suffer for Righteousness
sake, if that Righteousness he pretends to,
and for which he thinks he suffers, have
no relation to the express word of God.
Conscience must be guided by the plain
word of God; I say, plain, for I do not
think that obscure, hard, and knotty pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Scripture which have exercised
the Wits of the Learnedst Men are an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Rule of Conscience. If a Man
fancies that his Doctrine or Practice for
which he suffers is commanded in the
Word of God when really it is not, he
suffers indeed for an erroneous Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which he should have taken care to
rectify and inform better, but cannot be
said to be persecuted for Righteousness
sake, because he suffers not for a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Doctrine or Action, manifestly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the Word of God; and tho'
I grant that the Magistrate who punishes
him may be too severe upon him, and the
Officers of Justice who execute the Law
may handle him rudely and barbarously,
and though I believe God will pardon
his Error, if accompanied with simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Heart, and free from Malice or sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Designs, yet still he cannot be said to
be persecuted for Righteousness sake.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:108689:183"/>
And having told you, what being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
for Righteousness sake is not, I
must in the next place tell you what it
is. And here though you may guess at
the Nature of it by what hath been said
already; yet for Orders sake,</p>
            <p>1. To be persecuted for Righteousness
sake, is to be evil entreated for asserting
or maintaining a Principle or Doctrine
which God hath plainly reveal'd either
by the light of Nature, or by the light of
Scripture, and for not subscribing to a
Doctrine manifestly false, or contrary to
the Scripture. I mention here the light
of Nature, for the light of Nature is the
light of God as well as the Scripture. It's
granted the Scripture is the brighter and
the clearer light, but still the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is the light of God. And he that is
persecuted for asserting there is but one
God, and that Polytheism, or a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Gods is Non-sense, or a Fable, as
<hi>Socrates</hi> the Heathen Philosopher was,
who died for that Doctrine, may be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said to be persecuted for Righteousness
sake, because he suffers for a true and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
Principle of the light of Nature,
and for a Truth written by God upon the
Heart, and which every Man is bound to
assert and maintain; which is the reason
that <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> makes <hi>Socrates</hi> a kind of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:108689:183"/>
Christian, and a Martyr for a standing
Principle of Divinity.</p>
            <p>After the same manner, if a Man
should be persecuted for maintaining the
Resurrection of the Dead, or that the
Scripture is the Word of God, or that
Jesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> is the true Messiah, and
Saviour of the World, and that he is
God, as well as Man, and that he died
for our sins, and rose again from the
Dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Apostles were persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Sadduces, Pharisees, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens;
such a Person is truly persecuted
for righteousness sake; for these Truths
are very clearly revealed in Scripture,
and every Christian is bound to profess
them; and the same may justly be said
of those late Sufferers in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Kingdom, who suffer'd for not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
or not subscribing to the Doctrines
of Transubstantiation, the Sacrifice of the
Mass, Purgatory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for these Doctrines
are not only not to be found in the Word
of God, but are contrary to it.</p>
            <p>2. To be persecuted for righteousness
sake, is to be evil entreated for espousing
a Worship, or Practice, which God hath
plainly commanded; on for not yielding
to a Worship or Practice, which he hath
plainly forbid Thus the three young men
in <hi>Daniel</hi> were persecuted for righeteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:108689:184"/>
sake, because thrown into a fiery
Furnace for not worshipping the golden
Image which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had set up,
and thus <hi>Daniel</hi> himself was persecuted
for righteousness sake, when cast into
the Lion's Den, for worshipping the true
God three times a Day: Thus the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
believers were persecuted for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
sake, when imprison'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
to the mines, butcher'd, tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
thrown to the Lions, forced to fight
with Beasts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because they would not
sacrifice to Idols, nor offer Incense to
<hi>Jupiter,</hi> nor swear by the Emperours,
and their genius, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus the poor
<hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigenses</hi> were persecuted
for righteousness sake, when pursued with
Fire and Sword, for not worshipping
Saints and Angels, and for not believing
the Infallibility and Truth of the Roman
Church. And the same may be said of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Christian, that loses his place, or the
favour of his Master, Prince, or Relatives,
for not telling a lye, for not profaning the
Lord's Day, for being loath to cheat, or
defraud, or to comply with others in their
sins. In a word, to suffer for obeying any
affirmative, or negative, standing Precept
or Command of God, is to be persecuted for
righteousness sake; and such Persons are
pronounced blessed in my Text; which
leads me to the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:108689:184"/>
II. Point; whether these words, as
well as the preceeding, imply a negative
Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that they who are not perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
for righteousness sake, are not bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
You may remember, that in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the preceeding Beatitudes, I
have still proved the Negative implied,
as that those who are not poor in spirit, or
are not meek, or not pure in heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
are not blessed. Here one would think
the Negative should not hold, for it seems
impertinent and absurd to say, that those
good Christians, who have lived and died
in times of Peace and Plenty, and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility,
are not blessed, nor made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of the Kingdom of Heaven. But, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all this, the negative is as
true as the affirmative, provided we take
Christ's meaning by the right handle; as
thus,</p>
            <p>1. Those who are persecuted, and are
not persecuted for righteousness sake, their
bare Persecution will not, cannot make
them blessed, and this is very true. For,</p>
            <p>1. A Man, as I said before, may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
for his Crimes, for robbing or
stealing upon the High-way, for clipping
the King's Coin, for breaking open a
House, and may suffer for it. This may
be call'd Persecution, because the same
severities are used upon him, that are
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:108689:185"/>
upon Men, who suffer for righteousness
sake, but still, this suffering cannot make
him blessed, or happy, because he is not
persecuted for righteousness sake, 'tis true,
such a Man being apprehended, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison'd
may repent, and become a new
Creature, and upon that account he may
be blessed, but his bare Persecution doth
not make him so, because he is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
for righteousness sake.</p>
            <p>2. A Man may be persecuted for a
false erroneous Doctrine, yet that cannot
make him blessed, <hi>i. e.</hi> if the Law, or the
Officers of Justice should persecute a Man
that teaches that the Pope is Christ's Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,
and hath Power to depose Kings, and
to excommunicate them when they prove
Hereticks, and to give their Kingdoms
away to others, or that there is no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
out of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c.
Considering the Penalties and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the Law inflicts in such Cases on
such pragmatical Men, this may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Persecution, but this Persecution
cannot make the Teacher of these Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
blessed, much less intitle him to
the Kingdom of Heaven, because all this
while he is not persecuted for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
sake; and he cannot be supposed to
suffer as a Confessour or Martyr, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as a Criminal: It's true, the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:108689:185"/>
of such Doctrines may apprehend
them to be part of the righteousness
taught in the Gospel; but it's evident to
all unbyass'd, impartial, and unprejudic'd
Men, that they are not, but rather that
they are as false as God is true, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Word of God, and therefore
his suffering cannot make him blessed,
no, not if he should be canoniz'd by his
own party, because here is nothing of
righteousness in the case, no Doctrine, no
Precept plainly revealed by the Word of
God; a pretended righteousness may be,
but no real one.</p>
            <p>2. The Negative also holds, if we say,
that those who are loath to suffer for
righteousness sake, when call'd to it, are
not blessed, and cannot be; and this is
the Negative chiefly intended here; even
that those who in times of persecution
for righteousness sake, preferr their ease
and quiet, and Temporal prosperity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
suffering for Christ, are very unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Men; and the reasons are plain.</p>
            <p>1. The Threatnings of Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
against all such Persons are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dreadfull; <hi>Whosoever shall deny me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men, him will I deny before my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is in Heaven. He that loves
Father or Mother more than me, is not
worthy of me. He that loves Son or Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:108689:186"/>
more than me, is not worthy of me:
He that doth not deny himself, and follow
after me, is not worthy of me. He that
shall seek to save his life shall lose it,</hi>
Matth. X. 33, 37, 38, 39. And again,
<hi>Whosoever shall be ashamed of me, and of
my words in this adulterous and sinfull
Generation, of him shall the Son of Man be
ashamed, when he comes in the Glory of his
Father,</hi> Mark VIII. 38. And surely, this
can be no blessed Estate. It's true, we
are not to run into the Fire of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
without need, or without a call, and
the ancient Church justly blamed those
forward Men, who offer'd and accus'd
themselves to the Heathen Judges and
Executioners, and even provok'd them
to dispatch them, because they were
Christians, but when we are call'd to
suffering for righteousness sake, and God
thinks fit to try us by that Fire; there
to refuse it, and for worldly profit, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
power, and honour, and an easie life
to deny the truth, or to subscribe to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
which we are perswaded in our
Consciences are so; this is such a blot
upon Religion, such a dishonour to Christ,
such an affront to truth, that such a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
must needs appear very odious in the
sight of God, and an object of his wrath
and anger, cannot be blessed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:108689:186"/>
2. Such Persons forfeit all their Title to
the Kingdom of Heaven, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be blessed; this is implied in the Text;
and if a Man had all the Kingdoms of the
World in Possession, and were excluded from
the Kingdom of Heaven, he would be a
very miserable Man, miserable in all his
greatness, power and authority, and so much
the more miserable, because after the height
of all this splendour, he is to sink into the
nethermost Hell, from one extream to
another, from the greatest felicity to the
greatest misery. The Kingdom of Heaven
is intended for Conquerours. He that is
loath to suffer for righteousness sake, when
God calls him to it, and flinches, and shrinks,
and like the Children of <hi>Ephraim</hi> turns back
in the day of battle, is so far from conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that he falls basely, loses ground cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly,
kisses the Temptation and is enthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the worst of Enemies, and therefore
must necessarily fall a Prey to that Enemy,
by whom he suffers himself to be conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and judge you whether such a Man can
be blessed.</p>
            <p>And now, that I am talking of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven, I speak of the very blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which attends those that are persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for righteousness sake; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>y,
this calls me to explain the third, and
last Point.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:108689:187"/>
III. How the Kingdom of Heaven shall
be theirs.</p>
            <p>This reward you see is the same with
what was promised to poverty of Spirit, or
deep Humility, <hi>v. 3. Blessed are the poor in
Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
And the reason why Christ promises the
same recompence to the persecuted for
righteousness sake, he doth to the humble,
is, because there is a very great affinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
humility, and suffering for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
sake. Suffering for righteousness sake
is the deepest Act of Humiliation, especially
if that suffering be accompanied with death.
Humility can go no lower; a Man in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
and dying for righteousness sake,
pulls down all his lofty thoughts, makes
all stoop to the Cross of Christ, submits his
Faith to the Gospel, and for things invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
denies himself in all the visible comforts
of this life, and that's Humility in its Glory.
Therefore the reward is express'd in the
same language; but then, as suffering for
righteousness sake is the deepest Act of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
so we must suppose, that the
Kingdom of Heaven is theirs in a peculiar
manner; and how that is, the following
particulars, will declare.</p>
            <p>And here to keep to the rule, I have so
often mention'd in the preceding Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
that these rewards respect both this
present, and the next life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:108689:187"/>
1. The Kingdom of Heaven is theirs on
this side Heaven, because even here they feel
Heaven in their Souls, and the Kingdom of
Heaven is within them. There is hardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
History of Martyrs and Confessours,
hardly any Martyrology, but gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the wonderfull joy that poor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
Christians have felt in the heighth
of their Persecutions, and what is this but
a Kingdom of Heaven here on Earth? what
is it, but a Heaven in their Souls? The
three young Men, <hi>Dan.</hi> III. sang in a fiery
Furnace; St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> in a Dungeon,
lifted up their Voices in Hallelujah's: The
Apostles when beaten and whipt, and scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
departed from the Council rejoycing,
because they were counted worthy to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
shame for the Name of Christ, and St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. VII. 4. I am filled with comfort,
yea, I exceedingly rejoice in all our Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
But not to mention any more passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of this nature out of ancient Histories,
our own Book of Martyrs shall serve to
furnish us with instances; I mean of the
Protestant Martyrs, that suffer'd in Queen
<hi>Marys</hi> Days.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Rogers</hi> coming to the Stake where
he was to be burned, fetcht a great leap for
joy. One Dr. <hi>Taylour,</hi> approaching the Fire
in which he was to be sacrificed, danced
and skipt to the Wonder and Admiration of
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:108689:188"/>
the Sheriff. <hi>I thank God for this Prison,</hi> said
one <hi>Bradford, more than for the richest Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
more than for any pleasure I ever found,
for here I find God, my sweet God always After
I came into this Prison,</hi> said one <hi>Glover</hi> in a
Letter to his Wife, <hi>and had repos'd my self
there awhile, I wept for joy, and gladness, my
belly full, and said to my self, Lord, what am
I, that I should be counted worthy to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
among those that suffer for the Gospel's
sake! I am now in the Coal-house,</hi> said one
<hi>Philpott, as dark, and ugly a Prison, as any is
about</hi> London; <hi>but I have six other faithfull
Companions, who merrily rouz upon the Straw,
and in our darkness do cheerfully sing Hymns
and Praises to God. I was never merrier in
Cbrist, than I am now in Prison,</hi> said one
<hi>Tims.</hi> One <hi>Pierson,</hi> with a cheerfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
embraced the Stake, at which he
was to be burnt, and kissing it, said; <hi>Now
welcome my sweet Wife, for this day thou and
I shall be married together. O how my heart
leaps and skips for joy,</hi> said another. One
<hi>Bainham,</hi> when his Arms and Legs were
half consumed by the Fire, cry'd out in the
Midst of the Flames, <hi>Behold, ye Papists, ye
are much for Miracles: Here you may see a
Miracle, for in this Fire I feel no more pain,
than if I lay on a Bed of Down, it is to me as a
Bed of Roses.</hi> Abundance more I could name
to this purpose, and what was all this but a
Kingdom of Heaven in their Souls?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:108689:188"/>
2. In the next World, the Kingdom of
Heaven is theirs in a peculiar manner too,
because of the high degree of Glory, they
arrive to in the next life. This hath been
the belief of the Church in all Ages, that
for the Martyrs, the higher and loftier Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Heaven are reserv'd; the ruines of
this truth are preserv'd among <hi>Mahometans</hi>
and <hi>Heathens.</hi> The <hi>Mahometans</hi> fancy, that
those who die in the War against <hi>Christians</hi>
are Martyrs, and they assign them a higher
place in Paradise, and Geographers tell us
of a People in the <hi>West Indies,</hi> who believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Immortality of the Soul, fancy that
those who die in defence of their Country,
are advanced after death to a very high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of felicity. These are nothing but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
and remains of the Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
which Tradition hath left among
them, that those who are persecuted for
righteousness sake, are, and shall be made
partakers of higher degrees of Glory. It's
certain their Bodies shall rise before the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of other Men; for so we read, <hi>Revel.</hi>
XX. 4, 5. <hi>And I saw the Souls of them that
were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for
the word of God, and which had not worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the beast, neither his image, neither had
received his mark in their foreheads, or in
their hands, and they lived and reigned with
Christ a thousand Years. But the rest of the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:108689:189"/>
dead lived not again, until the thousand Years
were ended. This is the first Resurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the Kingdom of Heaven, they
will out-shine other Saints in brightness
and splendour. All those that by patient
continuance in well-doing, seek for Glory,
Honour and Immortality, shall inherit E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
life, but those who have been perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
for righteousness sake, their suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
work for them a far more exceeding
Eternal weight of Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> IV. 17. a
reward, enough to make a Man fond of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in love with suffering, enamour'd with
a Prison, and desirous of Chains and Fetters
for righteousness sake: Wonder at this Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
O my Soul! For, <hi>Blessed are they which
are persecuted for righteousness sake, for
theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="inferences">
               <head>Inferences.</head>
               <p>I. As one place of Scripture gives light
to another, so by this we are upon, we may
judge of a parallel Passage, which makes that
necessary, which in the Text seems only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential.
It is St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s saying, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> III. 12.
<hi>All that will live Godly in Christ Jesus, must
suffer persecution.</hi> What? Can none be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Godly, but those that are persecuted for
righteousness sake, and is there no getting
an interest in Christ Jesus, but by being
harrass'd and teaz'd, and evil entreated for
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:108689:189"/>
his Name? Are all Hypocrites tho' never
so pious, that have not suffer'd as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
did? Or must all be accounted repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
that walk softly all their days, and
never felt the rage of Tyrants, and sworn
Enemies of the Gospel? I answer,</p>
               <p>1. This saying was certainly true of the
Apostle's days, and the time when St. <hi>Paul</hi>
writ this Epistle to <hi>Timothy:</hi> There was
then no living Godly without being perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.
To obey the rules of the Gospel, was
to draw the rage of turbulent Men upon
their Backs. To profess Christ was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Prey to Jews and Heathens. To be
a Disciple of a Crucified God, was look'd
upon to be as bad as to be an Enemy to
the State, and he went in danger of his life,
that said, there was another King one <hi>Jesus.</hi>
The <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles, and the Epistles
the Apostles writ to comfort the believers
in their fiery Trials, are evidences to prove
all this; and this lasted the greatest part of
three hundred Years after Christ, during
which time, happen'd the ten famous or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
infamous Persecutions under <hi>Nero, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian,
Trajan, Severus, Commodus, Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Decius, Valerianus, Aurelianus, Dioclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi>
in the last of which, it was death to
have a Bible in their Houses.</p>
               <p>2. This saying is still true of our days,
and true it will be to the World's end, and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:108689:190"/>
so it is, all that will live Godly in Christ
Jesus, must suffer Persecution, if not from
Men, yet from the Devil, who <hi>walks about
like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi>
1 Pet. V. 8. The Temptations a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
meets, and must meet with, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which his Faith can never be tried, what
are they but Persecutions? the Soul at least
is persecuted, and tho' these Persecutions
of the Devil appear stronger and more
fiery in some than in others, especially in
Persons to whose minds their former sins
are represented in very dreadfull Colours,
with the wrath of God flaming out against
them, breathing nothing but despair and
destruction; yet be they more or less, still
they are Persecutions, and though abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Christians, that take up of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
just so much as is consistent with their
ease and profit, and pleasure, are not very
sensible of these Persecutions; yet where
Men attempt to mortifie their dear lust,
crucifie their flesh, are resolv'd to do more
than Heathens and Pharisees, and do truly
swim against the strong current of corrupt
Nature, they will find there are fiery Darts
thrown at them, and though they are not
visible, yet its enough that they are felt;
and indeed on some these Persecutions lie so
heavy that they are ready to despair, ready
to throw off all, and even to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:108689:190"/>
to a sensual course of living as their
Neighbours do. Thus Persecution is still
the lot of good Christians, insomuch, that
he who is not persecuted in this Sense can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be supposed to live Godly in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
for having sworn in Baptism to fight
against the Devil, is it possible, if he makes
good his promise, when he grows up, the
Devil will not fight against him, tempt
him to evil, discourage him from goodness,
fright him from the strait way, provoke
him to sin, throw stumbling-blocks in his
way, suggest impediments and excuses,
and entice him to prefer an easie form be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the power of Godliness; and is not
this Persecution?</p>
               <p>3. Those that will live Godly live so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
wicked Men, in wicked Families, in
wicked Societies, will not fail of suffering
Persecution, <hi>For what Communion hath Light
with Darkness? or what fellowship is there
betwixt Christ and Belial?</hi> Wicked men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure a man that is Precise, and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and Conscientious, and reproves them,
and therefore will be his Enemies, despise
him, deride him, abuse him, and do him an
injury if they may do it with safety to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and what is this but Persecution?</p>
               <p>4. The evil Works, which he that lives
Godly in Christ Jesus sees and beholds, are
a Persecution to him; as it is said of <hi>Lot,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:108689:191"/>
2 Pet.</hi> II. 7, 8. That dwelling in <hi>Sodom,</hi> in
seeing and hearing vex'd his righteous Soul
from day to day with their unlawfull Deeds
and filthy Conversation; and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
are those Expressions we meet with,
<hi>Ps.</hi> CXIX. <hi>Horrour hath taken hold upon me,
because of the wicked, which forsake thy Law,</hi>
v. 53. <hi>I beheld the Transgressors and was
grieved, because they kept not thy Word,</hi> v.
158. so that there is no need of having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to the ordinary Afflictions which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
good men, as if they were meant by
Persecution in these words. The thing is
true with respect to the Particulars, I have
mention'd, and to this day it cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
but <hi>those that will live godly in
Christ Jesus must suffer Persecutisn.</hi> And yet</p>
               <p>II. Though Persecution, like the <hi>Trojan</hi>
Horse, carries innumerable Evils in its Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
yet we must not think it unbecoming
the Divine Providence to see Righteousness
persecuted. Ever since the fatal enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Seed of the Woman, and the Seed
of the Serpent hath been proclaimed, <hi>Gen.</hi>
iii. 15. it hath been so; it began very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and they were scarce got out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
but <hi>Cain</hi> persecuted his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi>
and pursu'd him to death, for asserting,
saith the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrast, the Rewards
and Punishments of the World to come:
And this hath been the fate of abundance of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:108689:191"/>
righteous Men and Women in all Ages;
more signally, since Christ Jesus appear'd in
the World, and taught mankind a more
perfect and stricter way of Righteousness
than the World was acquainted with before.
And what was our Saviour's life, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
persecution from his Cradle to his
Cross? And when it was so with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
we cannot think his Apostles and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
should escape these uncivil and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
usages. Accordingly <hi>Stephen</hi> was
stoned, <hi>James</hi> beheaded, <hi>Timon,</hi> one of the
seven Deacons, burnt, <hi>Thomas</hi> slain with a
Dart, <hi>Simon Zelotes</hi> crucified, <hi>Jude</hi> slain in
a tumult raised by the people, <hi>Mark</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist
burnt, <hi>Bartholomew</hi> beaten to
death with Staves, <hi>Andrew</hi> crucified, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
stoned and beheaded, <hi>Philip</hi> crucified
and beheaded, <hi>Peter</hi> crucified with his head
downward, and <hi>Paul</hi> after a thousand suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
beheaded.</p>
               <p>Indeed, considering what love and esteem
God professes to Righteousness, and the
cruelties that have been exercis'd upon righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
men, Flesh and Blood will be apt to
wonder how God could suffer it; for some
had their Brains breaten out with Mauls,
some were cast to the Swine, some to the
Lions to be devour'd, some were hang'd
up by the middle, some tormented to death
with Trees, a Hand or an Arm being tyed
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:108689:192"/>
to one Tree, and a Leg to another; some
were scrap'd to death with Shells, some
were burnt with their Entrails torn out;
some broyl'd upon Grid-irons; some roast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
alive against the Fire; some Women had
their Breasts; some Men their Legs and
Thighs sear'd with hot Irons; some were
tost to death upon Bulls-horns; some
hang'd by the Neck and Heels; some were
burnt in a Furnace; some fry'd in an Iron
Chair; some had their Bones broken with
Batts; some were beaten with Cudgels;
some had sharp points thrust in under their
Nails; some were put in Vessels of boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Oyl; some dragg'd through the Streets
and Kennels; some had their Tongues cut
out; some had their Eyes bor'd out; some
were sawn asunder; some flead alive;
some torn in pieces with wild Horses;
some kill'd with Famine; some suffer'd to
perish in Frost and Snow.</p>
               <p>Where was God, where was the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
all the while? will some say; why he
was there, he was with them in all their
Torments, gave them Courage to endure
all this, Strength to bear up under all their
Miseries. Here the Power of God appear'd
more than it would have done in their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Prosperity. This made the World to gaze
and stare, and think they must be more than
Men, that suffer'd with so much Patience:
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:108689:192"/>
This gave Reputation to Religion. By this
means the Name of the Lord Jesus came to
be glorified. This converted Heathens,
wrought upon Infidels, pull'd down Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
chased the Devil from his Throne.
This made Men come in to Christ in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes.
This made them forsake the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and the World; this made them part
with their Sins and Lusts, and lay force up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Kingdom of Heaven: And thus the
World was overcome, and Scepters and
Crowns were made to stoop to the Cross
of Christ, and it's hard to say, whether
more were converted by Miracles, or by
these patient and heroick Sufferings of
Christians; their Sufferings forc'd people
into a belief of a future Reward, and the
Torments they endur'd made God amiable
that thousands did embrace him. And yet</p>
               <p>III. As in other things, so even in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Persecution great mistakes may be
committed; and therefore in judging of
Persecution we must ever attend and look
to the cause for which men are said to be
persecuted: This caution is very necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that we may not wrongfully accuse
men whose office it is to punish Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
nor flatter our selves with the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of a good work, when we have
done nothing less. Persecuting for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
sake is a very great sin, a sin that
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:108689:193"/>
cries for Vengeance, which is the reason
why God even in this present life hath pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out his Wrath upon persons guilty of
this crime. <hi>Nero</hi> was thrown down from
the Imperial Throne, proscrib'd by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
as an Enemy of mankind, and at last
forc'd to kill himself. <hi>Domitian</hi> was slain in
his Chamber, not without the consent of
his Wife, and all his Images and Statues
thrown down by order of the Senate. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
was kill'd in Battle, and depriv'd of
the common Honour of Burial. <hi>Valerianus</hi>
was taken by the <hi>Persians,</hi> and put in a
Cage, and at last flead, and his Skin hung
up for a Trophy in one of the <hi>Persian</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
<hi>Aurelianus</hi> in the very beginning of
his Persecution dies miserably, and wallows
in his own blood. <hi>Galerius,</hi> a prodigious
and unusual Sickness seizes him, a sore ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in the nether part of his Belly, which
bred such a swarm of Worms, as made him
stink above Ground; <hi>Maxentius</hi> was van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd
by <hi>Constantine the Great,</hi> and his
body thrown into the River <hi>Tiber,</hi> not to
mention any more Instances of this nature.
And I wish, that this trade of persecuting
had been confined to Heathens; but here
it stay'd not. After that the World turn'd
Christian, it was not long before one Party
began to persecute another. The <hi>Arrians</hi>
were the first that began it, and the Church
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:108689:193"/>
of <hi>Rome</hi> soon learn'd this art, beginning
with the <hi>Novatians,</hi> but practised it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
with greater cruelty upon the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses</hi>
and <hi>Albigenses,</hi> and all those whom
she is please to style <hi>Hereticks.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi>
Church, when she had Power and Princes
that favour'd her Interest hath run too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
upon the same Rock. And I know, this
very Church we are Members of, hath
been often charged by our dissenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
with a persecuting Spirit. I shall not
now enquire into the truth or falshood of
this charge, being willing to forget what
is past, even the shadow of it, the rather,
because the Point will require examining
various circumstances, which either heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
or very much qualify the pretended
sin; but whatever Errors, Rudenesses or
Insolencies have been committed by offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of Justice in executing the Law upon
Dissenters, which must not be presently
charg'd upon the Doctrine and Temper of
the Church: Blessed be God, there is at this
time in our Church a general Inclination to
Tenderness, Compassion and Mildness to
the moderate sort of those who differ from
the Sentiments of the Church, and to
hearken to a reasonable Accommodation of
Matters to the satisfaction of those who
look upon themselves as Sufferers.</p>
               <p>That which I chiefly aim at in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:108689:194"/>
is, that we must not rashly charge
every thing that looks like Punishment
with the odious name of Persecution for
Righteousness sake, neither in the persons
that inflict Punishment, nor in those that
suffer it. And indeed a person that suffers,
or is like to suffer for an Opinion or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of his own, had need consider well
before he suffers, what he is going to suffer
for, and whether the thing he is ready to
suffer for is worth it. To suffer for any
Catholick Doctrine receiv'd in all Ages, by
all Churches, or for a known Article of
Faith, or for a thing expresly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or forbid by the Gospel is great, and
noble, and Christian-like; but to suffer for
an Invention of our own, or for things
which have no solid Foundation in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
hath nothing of Glory or Christian
Magnanimity in it, nor will God give us
any thanks for it; and in this case a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
had a thousand times better endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to rectify his Judgment, especially
when no substantial Doctrine or Duty is
prejudiced by it, and comply with the
Will and Desire of the Magistrate, than
suffer for a thing for which he hath no good
Authority from the word of God. I might
apply this to some particular differences,
but I forbear; and though I do believe,
that many who have suffer'd for such things
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:108689:194"/>
which are not plainly deliver'd in Scripture,
may have found very great comfort in
their Sufferings, yet whether that comfort
was a sign that they were persecuted for
Righteousness sake, I very much question.
However, if such persons do suffer wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
they shall lose nothing by their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
for God is not unrighteous to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
our Work, and labour of love, and the
time will come, when God will bring forth
our Righteousness as the Light, and our
Judgment as the Noon-day. The truth is
Men's understandings being of various ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
and sizes, and apt to be by ass'd by
various interests, and circumstances; there
may, and will be mistakes committed,
both by those that punish Men for diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
opinions in matters of Religion, and
by those, who suffer for such opinions.
However, let us throughly acquaint our
selves with the Will of God in the Gospel,
that we may know what things we ought
to suffer for, and what not. And if it be so
that we suffer <hi>for the Name of Christ, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
are we, for the spirit of glory, and of God
rests upon us,</hi> 1 Pet. IV. 14. And in such
sufferings we have reason to be not only
patient, but cheerfull, which gives me oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to put you in mind</p>
               <p>IV. Of a fault: We that are so impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
under ordinary Afflictions, what should
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:108689:195"/>
we be if Persecution should come among us.
Blessed be God, we have for many Years
sat under our own Vines, and under our
own Fig-trees, have enjoy'd the Gospel, and
the truth of God without any considerable
disturbance, and I hope, we shall do so still.
But should it please God to send a Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
among us, because of the Word; it is
to be feared, that abundance with <hi>Demas,
Ecebolius,</hi> and the <hi>Traditores</hi> of old would
embrace this present World, and preferr
their ease before suffering, though they
buy it at a very dear Rate, with the loss
of truth, and the Shipwrack of a good
Conscience.</p>
               <p>Indeed there are very few of us, that
prepare themselves for such a Providence.
We pamper our Bodies, we consult the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of the Flesh, we give our selves all
the ease we can; we do not deny our
selves in things pleasing to our Appetite.</p>
               <p>Every thing our Flesh craves, and our
Purse can procure we are eager for; we
dread any thing that's irksome to our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
we do not acquaint our selves with
voluntary sufferings, do not keep under our
Bodies, nor bring them into subjection, and
is this a due preparation for Persecutions?
Nay, under any loss or cross, or ordinary
sickness, or sad accident; how faint, how
weak, how impatient, how uneasie, how
discontented are we!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:108689:195"/>
Thou that frettest for the loss of ten or
twenty Pound, what wouldst thou do if in
time of Persecution, thou shouldst be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
and turn'd out of all? Thou that
complainest so much, if thy Finger doth
but ake, what wouldst thou do, if in time
of Persecution, thy whole Body should be
burnt? Thou that lookest upon thy self
as a very miserable Man, because an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
distemper hangs about thee, what
wouldst thou do, if in time of Persecution
thou shouldst be tormented with Pincers,
and Tongs, and Irons heated in the Fire?
Thou that canst not bear the loss of a Child,
or a Husband, what wouldst thou do if in
time of Persecution all thy Relations, and
Friends should be torn away from thee,
thy Children murther'd before thine Eyes,
their Brains dasht out against a Stone, and
barbarous Soldiers embruing their Hands
in thy Father, or thy Mother's Blood. Thou
that art so discontented now, because thou
canst not have such outward accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as thou wouldst have, what wouldst
thou do if in time of Persecution, thy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
should be broken on a Wheel, or nailed
to a Cross, or thy Skin pluckt off, or thy
Tongue cut out, or thy Flesh kill'd with
Cold, or starved with Hunger, and so
left naked to the open shame of the
World? Such considerations surely can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:108689:196"/>
be improper for Men, who fear, and talk of
a Persecution: And were these thoughts often
upon our minds, in all probability, they would
make us less anxious about the felicities of this
World; lay a restraint upon our wild Appetites,
and the foolish desires of the Flesh, and with the
Martyr, move us to try our Finger in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
before our Bodies come to feel the Fire.</p>
               <p>Nay, this very consideration would make us
more patient under our ordinary Troubles, and
thank God he lays no greater Trials upon us, that
he deals so gently with us, and as yet suffers no
Temptation to befall us, but what is common to
Men: Whatever affliction befalls us, let us think
of the various Torments of the Saints of old, and
think this is nothing to what St. <hi>Paul</hi> endured, or
to what St. <hi>Peter</hi> suffer'd, or to what such a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
such a dear Servant of God felt. Setting the
greater Trials before us, will make our common
sicknesses and crosses seem less in our Eyes as Men
forget the pain of the Gout, or the chilliness of
an Ague, when they find the House over their
Heads on fire.</p>
               <p>V. And now that we speak of Persecution, who
sees not, that Persecution for Righteousness sake,
is a certain sign, there is a Kingdom of Heaven;
if we believe there is a God that sees all, and
knows all, and takes pleasure in them, that serve
him; is it possible that he can see Men suffer for
him, and bleed and die for his Gospel, and not
reward them? It is certain they have no reward
here, and therefore they must necessarily have a
reward hereafter. The Apostle therefore might
very well say, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XV. 19. if in this life only we
had hope in Christ, we should of all Men be most
miserable. As the impunity of Men abominably
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:108689:196"/>
profane, and the uninterrupted Prosperity of
very wicked Men, is a Demonstration that there
must be Punishments in the next life; so the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
the continued, the exquisite, the grievous
sufferings of Men, that truly love God, that obey
him, stand in awe of him, and fear him more than
the greatest Monarchs, can forego all for his Name
sake, and rather lose Lands and Houses, and Goods,
and Life it self, than offend him. Their sufferings
I say, without any visible reward, or recompence
here, are Items sufficient to any rational and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate
Man, that there must be a Kingdom of
Heaven, or a wonderfull felicity in another World,
that is to be their individual companion and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant.</p>
               <p>If there be a God, it stands to reason, he must
be infinitely perfect; if infinitely perfect, he must
be infinitely good; and if infinitely good, how is
it possible for him to see Men live and die to him,
and for him, and do nothing remarkably for them?
A great Man here on Earth, that hath any gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity
in him; if a Man hath worn himself out
in his Service, or for his sake hath lost all he hath
in the World, even life it self, thinks himself in
Honour obliged to make some provision for his
Wife, and Children, if he leaves any, or to erect
a Monument for him, or to do something after his
Death to testifie his gratefull acknowledgement of
his faithfull service. And what is the goodness,
and generosity of Man compared with the Infinite
goodness of God, a meer shadow, an atome, a
grain of sand compared with the Sun, or a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
or the vast Globe of the Earth. And as God
is infinitely good, so the rewards he gives must
be suppos'd infinite, like himself, and that's it we
mean by the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:108689:197"/>
This Argument is needless to you, that believe
the Word of God; however, to such as never se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
ponder'd the Promises of the Gospel, and
who pretend they can believe nothing but what
is agreeable to their reason, to such I say, this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
must needs be of very great Weight pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
that they seriously think of it; for let a
thing be never so rational, if it be not minded, or
ponder'd, it will do no good; and neither <hi>Moses</hi>
nor the Prophets, nor a Man's rising from the
Dead will make any impression upon them. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Man can comprehend the Immortality of
his Soul, or the Nature of its subsistence, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
after Death, or not still; if he believes a
God, this is a very natural and rational inference,
that this God will not let Men who give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
up to his Conduct, and make his Will the
rule of their life and death, go unrewarded; and
having no reward considerable here, there must be
one hereafter, and then there is a Heaven, and an
everlasting Kingdom, and an immense Felicity;
which deserves striving, and wrestling, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and watchfulness, and circumspection, and
self-denial, and industry, and a diligent care not
to be barren, or unfruitfull in the Knowledge of
our Lord Jesus Christ. And as dismal and rugged
as the Way seems to be, that leads to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven: Let me add,</p>
               <p>VI. That it is a glorious thing to be persecuted
for righteousness sake, glorious with respect to the
Company, glorious with respect to the Honour,
which attends it, glorious with respect to God's
Account and Esteem of it, glorious with respect
to the present advantages which arise from
it, and glorious with respect to the reward to
come.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:108689:197"/>
The Company, such a persecuted Christian suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
in, is no less than the Company of the Son of
God, who was made perfect by suffering; the
Company of the Holy Apostles, the Pillars and
Foundations of our Religion, the Company of so
many admirable Men, Saints and Martyrs, who
have wash'd their Robes, and made them white in
the Blood of the Lamb, and whose Names and
Memories are dear to us at this Day.</p>
               <p>To suffer in such Company must needs be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great Honour: It's true, the generality of us
can be very well content without this Honour,
and we count our selves very prudent for being so,
but surely, there were wise Men before us, who
understood themselves, and Religion better, and
were not so corrupted with ease and luxury, and
love of the World, as we are now; and they
thought it a very great Honour to be Martyrs,
and sufferers for Righteousness sake: We are
grown more effeminate, more luxurious, more
soft in our way of living, and that makes us have
so low an Esteem for those noble Sufferings.</p>
               <p>It's glorious with respect to the Account, and
Esteem God hath for such Sufferers. These are
the Champions of the Almighty, the Hero's in
his Army, the Worthies of God, and the Men
that have lost an Eye, a Hand, an Arm, a Leg, or
Life it self for his Name; of these the Sanhedrin
of Heaven is made up, and they are the Elders of
that City, which hath Foundations; for in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
rewards and preferments go not according
to seniority, or rank, or quality, or breeding, but
according to the degrees of suffering, and self-denial.</p>
               <p>It is glorious with respect to the present ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
arising from it. This cancels and blots
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:108689:198"/>
out all sin, wipes away all offences, and makes the
Blood of Jesus most effectual, and beneficial to the
Soul. This persecution for righteousness sake, is
the great deletory of guilt, the great purgative
of all uncleanness; this opinion the primitive
Church had of these sufferings, especially, when
they were accompanied with the loss of life in
God's Cause, and this was it that made so many
thousands desirous to die for the Name of the
Lord Jesus.</p>
               <p>It's glorious with respect to the reward to
come, a reward which we are forced to express
by little emblems and similitudes, taken from
things here on Earth, but it surpasses all Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
and Eloquence to express it.</p>
               <p>Happy sufferers! Their Wounds will be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into Trophies, their Scars into Sun-beams,
their wallowing in Blood into being rapt up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the third Heaven, their Prison into a Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-House;
the Banner whereof is Love, their
Dungeon into a Palace made without Hands, their
Stripes into Marks of Honour, their Buffetings
into Ensigns of Victory, their Tears into Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
their Mourning into Dancing, their Poverty
into Riches, which perish not, their Sack-cloath
and Ashes, and all their Mourning-dresses into
triumphal Chariots, and Acclamations, and Joys,
and Hosannahs, and Hallelujahs. <hi>Blessed are they
which are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs
is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>St. Matth. Ch. V. Ver. 11.</bibl>
               <q>Blessed are ye when men shall revile
you, and persecute you, and say all
manner of evil-against you falsly
for my sake.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE preceding Verse, which I
have already considered, treated
of Persecution in general; this I have
read to you, of a particular or peculiar
Persecution, in which the Tongue is
chiefly instrumental; and <hi>Blessed are you
when men shall revile you, and persecute
you,</hi> is as much as, <hi>Blessed are you when
men shall so persecute you, as to revile you,
and speak all manner of evil against you
falsly for my sake.</hi> Persecution is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Sin of the Hand or Actions; there
is a smiting <hi>with the Tongue,</hi> as well as
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:108689:199"/>
with the Hand, <hi>Jer.</hi> XVIII. 18. and
<hi>Ishmael,</hi> who was a Scoffer, is said <hi>to
persecute him that was born of the Spirit,</hi>
i. e. <hi>Isaac,</hi> Gal. IV. 29. I need not tell
you what it is to Revile; for there are
few of you but are very sensible of it,
without a Monitor or Interpreter, when
it falls to your share to be reviled: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
it is either to load a Person with
reproachful Names, or to object Crimes
to him, great and base, odious and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable:
and if this be done without a
just Cause, falsly, and for the Name of
Christ, because Men will not sin against
Christ, it seems by the Rule of the Text
that it turns to very good Account to
those who lie under the Pressure or sharp
Arrows of such evil and slanderous
Tongues: for, <hi>Blessed are you when men
shall revile you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To entertain you with something use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and edifying, I shall enquire,</p>
            <p>I. What Instances there are of Men
who have reviled, and do revile, and
speak all manner of Evil of Persons who
sincerely and conscientiously believe in
Christ.</p>
            <p>II. What it is that moves them to be
so base, as to revile, and to speak evil
of such Conscientious Persons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:108689:199"/>
III. How that which is a Sin to one,
can be a Blessing to another. Reviling
innocent Persons being a great Sin, how
<hi>that</hi> can make those blessed who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>What Instances there are of Persons
who are guilty of the Crime in the Text.</hi>
When a Sin looks black, a charitable
Man hopes that few or none are guilty
of it: So here, <hi>reviling Men,</hi> and <hi>speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all manner of evil</hi> of Persons who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously
believe and obey their <hi>God</hi>
and <hi>Saviour,</hi> seems to be a Crime of a
deep Dye; and therefore it's worth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring,
what Instances there are of such
Sinners. And here I must tell you,
That this Reviling of <hi>Conscientious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
began very early; and having
call'd the Master of the House <hi>Beelzebab,</hi>
we may suppose that his Apostles, and
those of his Houshold, could not long
escape their virulent Tongues. When
St. <hi>Paul</hi> and his Company, out of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to Mens Souls, preach'd the Gospel
at <hi>Philippi,</hi> their Reward was Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
and instead of Gratitude, they char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them with Rebellion, for they
brought them before the Magistrates,
<hi>Acts</hi> XVI. 20. saying, <hi>These men, being
Jews, exceedingly trouble our City, and
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:108689:200"/>
teach Customs which are not lawful for us to
receive, being Romans.</hi> And so in <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonica,</hi>
Acts XVII. 6. <hi>These men,</hi> cry'd
they, <hi>which have turn'd the world upside
down, are come hither also.</hi> And in the
same Chapter, <hi>Ver. 18. The Philosophers</hi>
and others, call St. <hi>Paul a Babler, because
he preach'd to them Jesus and the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Dead.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> XXIV. 5.
<hi>We have found this man,</hi> saith <hi>Tertullus,</hi>
meaning St. <hi>Paul, a pestilent fellow, a
mover of Sedition among all the Jews
throughout the world, and a Ring-leader of
the Sect of the Nazarenes.</hi> Nor did this
Trade of Reviling <hi>Conscientious Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
die with the Apostles, but their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
and those who surviv'd and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
after them, met with the same Fate;
and the Crimes the <hi>Heathens</hi> did most
commonly charge the <hi>Primitive Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
with, were <hi>Atheism, eating their
own Children,</hi> and <hi>the Vse of promiscuous
Lusts:</hi> and this Calumny being once
rais'd, spread like Lightning. There
is no Fable, you will say, but hath some
Foundation in History. What could
be the Occasion of this Calumny? Why?
in short, it was this; There were some
lewd Societies of Men, Disciples of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Magus, Gnosticks, Carpocratians,</hi> who
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:108689:200"/>
were Villains, obscene, and brutish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the rest of Mankind; these, by the
Instigation of the <hi>Devil,</hi> call'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>Christians;</hi> whereupon the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
making no Distinction at all,
charged <hi>all Christians</hi> with these Crimes;
and it's like, some cowardly <hi>Christians,</hi>
who were tortured and put to the Rack,
to be freed from their Torments confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
what the Executioners would have
them confess, and charged themselves
with Crimes they were never guilty of.
This was the Condition of the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
of the first three Centuries after
<hi>Christ.</hi> Nor was this all; for some
time they call'd them <hi>Asinini,</hi> Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of an <hi>Ass,</hi> either upon the old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
fix'd upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they
were Worshippers of an Ass's-Head, or
possibly because they were Worshippers
of <hi>Jesus,</hi> who rode on an Ass when he
made his Entrance into <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the best Name they could give
them was <hi>Semistii</hi> or <hi>Semaxii,</hi> or <hi>Sarmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titii,</hi>
Words that cannot be well expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in <hi>English</hi> without a Paraphrase, but
thus they call'd them to jeer them,
upon the Account of their Sufferings,
and because they were tied to a Post
or a Board divided or cut in two,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:108689:201"/>
which they bought very cheap, and
threw Faggots and Rubbish under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,
which they kindled, and so burn'd
them. I omit here several other odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Names they gave them, such as
<hi>Praters,</hi> and <hi>Sibyllists,</hi> and <hi>Beggars,</hi> and
<hi>Cross-worshippers, Credulous,</hi> and <hi>Night-walkers,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Julian the Apostate</hi> call'd
them <hi>Galileans;</hi> this was the Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name,
or the Name of Contempt, he
gave them, as the <hi>Arians</hi> call'd the
Disciples of <hi>Athanasius</hi> Followers of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius,</hi>
or of the Devil: and hither
may be referr'd the Vollies of Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
the <hi>Donatists</hi> shot against the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Christians.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
hath punctually follow'd this Track,
when it pleas'd God to raise Men who
had the Courage to confute or to speak
against their Errors. The <hi>Waldenses,</hi>
because they could not believe that the
<hi>Emperor</hi> depended upon the <hi>Pope,</hi> and
spoke against the debauch'd and disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Lives of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, were
accused of <hi>Manicheism;</hi> sometimes they
were call'd <hi>Arians,</hi> and Deniers of the
Divinity of <hi>Christ,</hi> because they could
not digest Transubstantiation. <hi>Wickliff</hi>
was traduced, that he call'd the Saints
of God <hi>Wicked Varlets,</hi> because in his
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:108689:201"/>
Version of the Bible, he translated, <hi>Paul</hi>
a <hi>Knave</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> which Word,
was good and harmless in those days,
being as much as a <hi>Servant,</hi> tho since
that time it hath been changed into a
Name of Reproach. It were endless to
heap together all the Calumnies and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful
Names which <hi>Jesuits, Monks,</hi>
and <hi>Friars,</hi> have vomited against <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants:</hi>
sometime <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi>
died being drunk; sometime <hi>Theodorus
Beza</hi> died a <hi>Papist;</hi> but the best of it
was, <hi>Beza</hi> was then alive when this
Calumny was published and printed,
and had the opportunity to confute it;
a Passage much like that in the Year
1621. when the <hi>Roman Missionaries</hi> gave
out, that Dr. <hi>John King,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
was upon his Death-bed reconciled
to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by one <hi>Preston</hi> a
Romish Priest; and that in his last
Sickness he composed a Book call'd <hi>The
Bishop of</hi> London'<hi>s Legacy;</hi> wherein
he gave the Reasons of his Conversion,
and exhorted all his Brethren to follow
his Example: But not only the Book
was found to be a Forgery, but <hi>Preston</hi>
being examined before the Archbishop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> openly confess'd, <hi>That he
had never been at the Bishop's House, never
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:108689:202"/>
spoken with him, nay never so much as seen
him.</hi> After the same manner they gave
out, that <hi>Bucer</hi> at his Death denied
<hi>Christ;</hi> that <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> died sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
tho' he was sixteen days sick in his
Bed. Sometimes they have had the
Confidence to tell the World, that we
<hi>Protestants</hi> teach that no God is to be
worshipp'd; that a Man may break his
Faith whenever he sees it for his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;
and that a Man must suit his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to the Times, <hi>&amp;c. Salmero</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
taught, that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> look
upon Fornication to be no Sin at all.
A little before the <hi>Massacre of Paris,</hi> the
Monks reported, that the <hi>Protestants
met together to fill their Bellies with good
cheer, and then put out the Candles, and
went together promiscuously as brute Beasts.</hi>
When the House in <hi>Black Friars</hi> in the
Year 1623. <hi>Octob.</hi> 26. the House I mean
where the <hi>Papists</hi> met to hear Mass and
a Sermon, fell upon the People assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
there, and kill'd a hundred Persons,
and among the rest, <hi>Drury</hi> the Priest,
and their Preacher, it was given out,
that the <hi>Puritans</hi> had saw'd in two the
Beams and Timber of the House, and
that this Fall came by their Treachery;
and so the <hi>Powder-Plot,</hi> if it had succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:108689:202"/>
should have been laid upon the <hi>Non-Conformists.
Bolseck</hi>'s <hi>Life of Calvin,</hi>
what is it, but a Collection of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Calumnies, where the Lyes seem to
keep pace with the Lines? And what
horrid things have the <hi>Priests</hi> in some
<hi>Popish Countries</hi> possessed their People
with against the <hi>Reformation?</hi> b. e. <hi>That
our Churches here in</hi> England <hi>are turned
into Stables;</hi> that <hi>the People here are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
barbarous;</hi> that <hi>they eat young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
and <hi>are grown as black as Devils</hi>
since the Lightnings of the <hi>Vatican</hi> have
scorch'd us, <hi>i. e.</hi> since the <hi>Pope</hi> hath
Excommunicated the <hi>Protestants:</hi> All
which I mention to let you see, that
there are too many and too sad Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Men guilty of the Sin mention'd
in the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> Reviling, and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Evil of Christians who sincerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in <hi>Christ.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>II. <hi>What can be the Motive to all this?</hi>
What it is that makes Men so base and
wicked?</p>
            <p>1. A preposterous and unhappy Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
Where Men have been bred
and born in a false Religion, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe
great Prejudices against those that
would inform and teach them better.
Education rivets Errors into the Mind
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:108689:203"/>
as well as Truths, and an Error being
taken for a fundamental Truth, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
crosses it, is look'd upon as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and heretical, and therefore abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable;
and unthinking Persons, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no convenient Means to satisfy
themselves as to the Truth of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
Doctrine, they speak as they are
taught, and talk bitterly against those
that would undeceive them, according
to the Idea's imprinted on their Mind
by ill Men, and deluded Teachers.
This was the Case of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had
been taught, that <hi>out of Galilee could
arise nothing that was good,</hi> and that no
Prophet could come out of <hi>Galilee,</hi> John
I. 46. John VII. 52. And that was the
Reason why they cast so many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
upon <hi>Christ,</hi> who was report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be a Native of <hi>Galilee.</hi> The same
may be said of the Opinion they had
suck'd in with their Mother's Milk,
That the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be a Temporal
Prince, and appear with outward Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor;
which being wanting in <hi>Jesus of
Nazareth,</hi> they despised and reviled him.</p>
            <p>2. Another Reason is, a blind Zeal,
the effect of an unhappy Education.
This blind Zeal appears chiefly in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
and cholerick Men, who being
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:108689:203"/>
bred up in a false Religion, are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
able to do, but do a world of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
<hi>their Tongues being set on fire of
Hell,</hi> with the Fool in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi>
will <hi>throw about Swords, and Arrows, and
Firebrands,</hi> and spit Flames against those
who contradict their darling and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
profitable Principles. Thus it was
in a great measure with St. <hi>Paul</hi> before
his Passion was sanctified, and himself
converted, his Zeal was blind and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and that made him not only bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spheme
<hi>Christ</hi> and his Saints, but think
it his Duty to do so; as himself confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> I. 13.</p>
            <p>3. Another, is Pride. A proud Man
is naturally tempted to slandering and
abusing those who do not please him.
His Pride makes him undervalue the
Person that opposes his Insolence; and
that undervaluing provokes him to bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Words and abusive Language. The
<hi>Pharisees</hi> were monstrously proud, swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with a mighty Conceit of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and Strictness; and this was the
Cause of the horrid Language they gave
to the <hi>Saviour of Mankind,</hi> calling him
<hi>Samaritan, a Devil,</hi> and <hi>an Impostor,</hi> and
the People that follow'd him, <hi>Cursed,
John</hi> VII. 49.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:108689:204"/>
4. A fourth Reason, is Malice and
Envy, bitter Roots, which produce ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
bitter Fruit, even bitter Language:
Malice is a Soil which evil Spirits do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in, and they dictate this hellish
Rhetorick: Malice will make Faults
where it finds none, and misinterpret
harmless Actions as unpardonable
Crimes: It turns accidental Reports
into Verities; the shadow of a Sin into
a real Crime; and idle Peoples Talk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Demonstration and Evidence. And
in this Art the <hi>High Priest</hi> that sat <hi>Judg</hi>
in <hi>Christ</hi>'s Cause seem'd to be very well
skill'd, who could spell Blasphemy out
of Christ's Confession, <hi>That he was the
Son of God,</hi> Matth. XXVI. 63.</p>
            <p>5. Another Reason is, Want of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date,
even, serious, and attentive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the Cause of such innocent
<hi>Christians.</hi> From a precipitate Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
a Man can expect little but incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate
Speeches and Expressions; and
where Men do inspect a thing hastily,
survey it only superficially, and will not
take time to weigh the Circumstances
of it, we need not wonder if they take
the Cause by the wrong Handle; and
when that appears dreadful to them,
which upon a deliberate View would be
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:108689:204"/>
found harmless, and tolerable, and very
rational, rash Censures and ill Language
will be the Effects and Consequences of
it; as we see in the Proceedings of the
<hi>Jews</hi> in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Case, <hi>Acts</hi> XXII. 27,
28, 29. They had seen one <hi>Trophimus</hi>
an <hi>Ephesian</hi> with him in the Streets;
without any Examination of the matter,
they suppose he must be his Companion
in the Temple too; whereupon they
raise a Cry, <hi>That he had brought Greeks
into the Temple, and profaned that holy
place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More Reasons might here be drawn
from Profit, and Interest, and worldly
Advantages; from the Company Men
keep, and from the high Places and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they possess in the World, and the
Figure they make in a Commonwealth,
all which very often tempt them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
those whom in their own Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
they think innocent: but what hath
been said may serve for a Taste. But
let's go on, and see</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III.</hi> How that which is a Sin to one can
be a Blessing to another. Reviling and
speaking Evil falsly of good men being a
great Sin, how this can make the Persons
who are unjustly reviled, blessed?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:108689:205"/>
1. A very ill thing may be the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a very good one. It's true, a
corrupt Tree cannot bring forth good
Fruit, nor do Men look for Grapes from
Thorns, nor for Olive-berries from a
Bramble, nor for sweet Water from salt
Springs; but tho' a bad Thing cannot
be the proper efficient Cause of a good
one, yet it may prove the Occasion of
it, as we see Mens dissolute and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
Actions are Occasions of very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Laws. And as the Man whom
<hi>History</hi> speaks of, his Enemy who struck
him with an Intent to kill, <hi>broke the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posthume
in his Body, which proved his
Health and Recovery;</hi> so the <hi>Devil's accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Brethren before God day and night,</hi>
is the Occasion of their steddy Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
After the same manner, from wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Mens reviling <hi>Conscientious Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
God takes Occasion to reward them
with Love and tender Mercies, turns
those Revilings into Blessings; as <hi>Joseph's</hi>
being sold into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and turned out of
<hi>Potiphar</hi>'s House with Infamy, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
and his Imprisonment, into Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
and Royalty.</p>
            <p>2. Not so much the Revilings of
wicked Men make such Persons blessed,
as their Innocence under those Revilings.
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:108689:205"/>
God, that sees them wrongfully abused,
and reproach'd, takes their part. <hi>An
ordinary Judg</hi> is bound in Conscience to
plead the Cause of him whom he knows
to be unjustly arraign'd, much more <hi>the
righteous Judge of the World</hi> may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to take notice of the Innocence of
his Servants whom Men unjustly calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate,
and to take them into his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
<hi>Shall not the Judg of the whole
World judge righteous Judgment?</hi> saith the
<hi>Patriarch,</hi> Gen. XVIII. 24. And this
makes them blessed.</p>
            <p>3. It's not these Revilings so much
that makes them blessed, as their Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and Deportment under them, even
their Patience, and Meekness, and Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and committing themselves <hi>to him
that judges righteously.</hi> Should he that is
unjustly reviled <hi>render railing for railing,</hi>
or <hi>reviling for reviling,</hi> in doing so, he
would spoil his Blessedness; but <hi>bearing
the Reproach of Christ,</hi> and <hi>esteeming it
greater Riches than the Treasures of the
World,</hi> without recriminating, this is it
that makes him blessed, the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this is to be a Disciple of <hi>Christ
Jesus,</hi> 1 Pet. II. 21, 22.</p>
            <p>4. That which makes them blessed,
is, the Cause for which they are reviled;
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:108689:206"/>
and therefore it is said, <hi>for my sake.</hi> In
our worldly Concerns, to be unjustly
traduced, hath something of Blessedness
in it, because we have the Testimony
of our Conscience, that we have done
what is lawful and right, much more
when we are <hi>evil spoken of falsly for
Christ's sake,</hi> because we adhere close to
the <hi>Gospel of Christ,</hi> because we obey our
Master's Will, and because we will not
dishonour him by doing things which
he hath forbid. This makes the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
great, as the Person is for whom
we suffer. So that tho' (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
these Revilings may occasion their
Blessedness, yet the Particulars I have
mention'd are properly the ministerial
Causes that make them blessed, and
consequently it's no Absurdity to say,
That a thing which is a Sin to one is a
Blessing to another, no more than we
count it a Solecism to say, that what is
one Man's Meat is another Man's Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <div type="inferences">
               <head>Inferences.</head>
               <p>I. Without my telling you, you may
gather from the Premises, That every
Man who is reviled is not therefore
blessed. A Man's Life and Actions may
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:108689:206"/>
be so bad, that he deserves to be evil
spoken of; but that's no reviling, but
speaking the Truth. I grant a Man may
speak Truth of another with an ill In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
which may make it Sin to him;
but if he have a Call to it, and his Intent
be good, speaking of another what he
is really guilty of, can be no reviling,
to be sure no unjust reviling. <hi>Christ</hi>
spoke very ill things of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and
<hi>Pharisees,</hi> but their insolent Behaviour
both justified and required such Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sives.
We are not to flatter Men in their
Sins, nor to applaud their evil Actions;
we must not call an <hi>Adulterer</hi> chaste<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
nor a <hi>Cholerick Person</hi> meek, nor a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
given to Tipling and Drinking,</hi> sober;
nor must he be stiled <hi>a good Man,</hi> who
walks directly contrary to the Rules of
the Gospel. Therefore, <hi>Christian,</hi> if
thou wouldst not be ill spoken of, do
that which is <hi>true</hi> and <hi>just,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi>
and <hi>honest,</hi> and <hi>lovely,</hi> and <hi>of a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port;</hi>
and <hi>Who will harm you if you be Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of that which is good?</hi> saith S. <hi>Peter</hi>
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> III. 13.</p>
               <p>If thy Lewdness or dishonest Actions
open Peoples Mouths against thee, thy
Misfortune is of thine own making;
God denounces a dreadful Woe against
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:108689:207"/>
those <hi>that call evil good, and good evil,</hi>
that <hi>put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
Isa. V. 20. And tho' <hi>Charity believes
the best,</hi> yet it believes with Discretion;
it doth not, neither indeed is it bound,
to believe blindly that Black is White,
or that Stones are Bread: Blessed be
God, we are not come to that extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Belief which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> asserts to
be necessary, that <hi>if the Pope should so
far err, as to make Vertue Vice and Vice
Vertue, the whole Church would be bound to
obey him.</hi> This is <hi>Bedlam</hi> Talk; and we
see what Absurdities the Reward of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
can lead Men into. Our Reason
was not given us for fashion sake, but
we are to prove that which is good, and
to <hi>try the Spirits, whether they be of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Religion bids us <hi>walk circumspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
and to take care that we be not evil
spoken of, is our Duty, not only by
avoiding Sins scandalous, and which
make us to be pointed at, but by shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
even things which tho' they seem
to have no great harm in them, yet may
give Offence to weaker Brethren. There
is a great Wisdom to be used in things
indifferent, and we must deny our selves
in speaking and doing things, in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures,
and Gestures, and Dresses, which
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:108689:207"/>
may be a stumbling-block in the way
of our Fellow-Christians, and may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make them remiss in their Duty,
or stop them in their Progress in Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or tempt them to Apostacy. To
this purpose is the Exhortation 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
X. 32. <hi>Give no offence neither to the Jews
nor to the Greeks, nor to the Churches of
God, even as I please all men in all things,
not seeking mine own profit, but the profit
of many, that they may be saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. As those who are reviled and ill
spoken of for a conscientious Believing
and Obeying Christ Jesus; as these are
certainly blessed Men, so those who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
revile such Persons must needs be
in a cursed State. Not to meddle at this
time with those profane Persons who
profess themselves Members of our
Church, and revile others that will not
swear and drink with them, or <hi>run with
them into excess of riot;</hi> it is a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing to see some Masters of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
how angry they are with their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
Apprentices, nay sometimes Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
too, for being devout, and serious,
and cautious of offending God, and
wronging their Consciences, and what
reproachful Titles they heap upon them,
calling them <hi>Fools, Sots, Melancholy, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:108689:208"/>
Fanaticks, Hypocrites,</hi> and what
not; nay are angry sometimes even
with the <hi>Ministers of the Gospel,</hi> by
whose Perswasion they have turned to
God! Mad-men these! that are angry
with the Blessings God sends them!
strange inconsiderate Creatures! Are
you angry with the means of your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation?
A religious Servant in a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Family helps to preserve that Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from being ruin'd and destroy'd, at
least keeps off some greater Evils that
did hang over their Heads: <hi>God blessed
the Egyptians house for Joseph's sake,</hi> Gen.
XXXIX. 5. A religious Servant, or
Apprentice, or Child, I mean one that
is truly so faithful to God and Man, that
makes Conscience of discharging the
Duty of his Calling and Relation, as
well as his Duty to God; not one that
pretends to Religion, and neglects his
Master's Business, but one that hath an
equal Respect to the Duties of the first
and second Table; such a Person is a
greater Treasure in a loose Family than
his Superiors think for: It is for such a
Mans sake that God blesses them, and
withdraws his Wrath and Anger from
them, or reprieves them, who are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
ripe for Vengeance. And that your
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:108689:208"/>
Profit and Trade doth not decay, it is
for such excellent Persons sakes whom
God loves; and for their Piety God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
Patience toward you. And are
you angry with us too, who exhort them
to be good, oblige them to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
when they have wrong'd you,
and admonish them to be faithful, and
to please you well in all things; when
by our Entreaties and Counsel we have
driven the evil Spirit out of them, are
you sorry that we have not let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in the House where he had taken
up his Residence?</p>
               <p>Cursed Children! who are displeas'd
with the good Angels God sends into
their Houses, and who are their Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
too, that defend them from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Danger! Instead of reviling your
Servants or Inferiors for standing in
awe of God more than of Men, you
should encourage them; and instead of
giving them ill Language for being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to visit the House of God, and to
come to the Holy Sacrament at conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Seasons, you should rejoyce that
God hath blessed you with such Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and sent you such Protectors of
your Fortunes, and adore the Divine
Goodness who hath vouchsafed such
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:108689:209"/>
shining and burning Lights to your
Houses.</p>
               <p>But this is the Nature of Vice and
Corruption: It hates the Light, and
those that walk in the Light: It cannot
be easie while it sees such Examples,
who are a perpetual Reproach to their
Lives and Conversations. Men wicked
and debauch'd do not think themselves
secure while their Domesticks chuse the
better part, and by so doing tell them
that they are in the High-way to Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
such Mens Condemnation will
not be only just, but greater than other
Mens, because they <hi>refuse</hi> not only <hi>him
that speaks to them from Heaven,</hi> but even
those who by their Deeds <hi>speak to them
here on Earth,</hi> and make the Goodness
they see in sober Men the Cause of their
Anger, which is intended as a Motive
to their Remorse and Repentance. But,</p>
               <p>III. Let no Man's Heart fail him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is reproach'd, reviled, or evil
spoken of for the <hi>Name of Christ;</hi> it is a
blessed thing to be <hi>reproach'd for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
sake,</hi> to be reviled for being seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
to be despised for doing the Will
of God. Hath not this been the Case of
the best Servants of God? <hi>When I wept,
and chasten'd my soul with fasting, that was
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:108689:209"/>
to my reproach, I made sackcloth also my
garment, and I became a Proverb to them,
they that sit in the gate speak against me,
and I was the song of the drunkards,</hi> saith
the excellent <hi>David,</hi> Psal. LXIX. 10,
11, 12. <hi>John came neither eating nor drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and they say he hath a Devil. The
son of man came eating and drinking, and
they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a
wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
saith our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> XI. 18, 19.
<hi>But Wisdom is justified of her children:</hi>
What you lose in the Opinion of wicked
Men you gain in the Esteem of those
who walk in the way of the Lord. It is
a mercy to you, that you have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to lose for <hi>Christ,</hi> and an Honour
to them, that you do lose something for
the Name of <hi>Christ:</hi> and tho' you lose
not an Arm, a Leg, a Hand, an Eye,
or Life for his sake, yet I say it is a very
great Honour that you lose your good
Name in his Cause; and yet you do not
lose it neither, but you rather raise and
make it greater, for your Names are
written in Heaven. Whatever any
Man loses for <hi>Christ,</hi> he shall <hi>receive an
hundredfold</hi> in Peace, Content, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<hi>here, and in the world to come
life everlasting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:108689:210"/>
Only, <hi>Let patience have its perfect work.
Being reproached and cursed,</hi> do you <hi>bless;
being abused,</hi> do you <hi>pray for those which
despitefully use you; being defamed,</hi> do you
<hi>entreat;</hi> and <hi>being made Spectacles to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and to Men,</hi> do you <hi>rejoyce in the
God of your Salvation.</hi> The time will
come, when those very Men which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
you now for your Obedience to the
Gospel,  will praise and admire you: If
God converts them here, they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
do so, and they cannot forbear;
but if they resist the Arguments of God,
and will not turn, the Misery and the
Torments that will fall upon them in
the other World, will extort, and force
this Admiration from them.</p>
               <p>Let Men call you all to naught, it is
enough that God respects you, and hath
promis'd not to leave them, nor to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
them. Do but wait for the Day,
for the glorious Day of the Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Children of God, and you
will see the Scene of Affairs changed,
and a greater Revolution of things than
ever happen'd since the Creation of the
World: Those that call you Fools now,
will magnify your Wisdom then; those
who count your Life Madness now,
will confess it was the most rational
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:108689:210"/>
Course; those that laugh at you now,
will weep when they behold how much
they were mistaken; and those who
now make a Mock of your Devotion,
will own then, that you acted upon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
noble Principles. Let no Reproaches
fright you <hi>from fighting the good Fight.</hi>
These are the Temptations you must
overcome. Against these Enemies you
are to fight; that's your Work, your
Task, and the Race you are to run in:
and <hi>Blessed is the man that endureth Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
for when he is tried, he shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a Crown of Righteousness, which God
hath promis'd to them that love him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amen.</p>

            <p>THE future Rewards which God
hath promised to them that love
him, are things we have often occasion
to speak of, partly because the <hi>Holy
Ghost</hi> is our Guide, partly we can never
say too much of it, and partly because
it is a thing which so nearly concerns us,
that it requires our daily Thoughts and
Contemplations: But as familiar as the
Subject is, it is always useful. <hi>Christ</hi>
having in all the preceding <hi>Beatitudes</hi>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:108689:211"/>
still shewn wherein the Blessedness of
those vertuous Men whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
doth consist, he doth the like in
this; for having in the foregoing Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
pronounc'd those Persons <hi>blessed</hi> who
<hi>are reviled, and evil spoken of for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
sake,</hi> or for the Name of <hi>Christ,</hi>
he declares in this the Nature of their
Blessedness, <hi>Rejoyce,</hi> saith he, <hi>and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
glad, for great is your Reward in
Heaven.</hi> And to encourage to a more
chearful bearing of these unjust Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
he sets before them the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the Prophets of old, <hi>For so
persecuted they,</hi> saith he, <hi>the Prophets that
were before you;</hi> as if he had said, so
they used them, so they dealt with them,
so they calumniated them. This was
the Custom of the World many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
a thousand, two thousand, three
thousand Years agone, to speak all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of evil of those excellent Men; so
they call'd <hi>Moses</hi> a <hi>pragmatical Man,</hi> and
<hi>Samuel</hi> an <hi>old Dotard,</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> a <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
of Israel,</hi> and <hi>an Enemy to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,</hi>
and <hi>Elisha Bald pate,</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah</hi>
an <hi>impertinent Fellow,</hi> and <hi>Amos</hi> a
<hi>Man ungentile</hi> and <hi>clownish;</hi> and so they
dealt with <hi>Isaiah,</hi> whom after many
Revilings they <hi>saw'd asunder;</hi> and so they
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:108689:212"/>
used <hi>Jeremias,</hi> whom after a thousand
Reproaches they <hi>stoned to Death.</hi> So
<hi>persecuted they the Prophets that were before
you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this will give me occasion to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to you,</p>
            <p>I. That the great Rewards of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
are just matter of Joy and Gladness
to pious Sufferers: <hi>Rejoyce and be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
glad, for great is your Reward in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. It's comfortable to suffer in good
Company: <hi>For so persecuted they the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
of old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The great Rewards of Heaven are
just matter of Joy and Gladness to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sufferers. If it were not so, <hi>Christ</hi>
would never have encouraged those
who are unjustly reviled for his Names
sake <hi>to rejoyce and be exceeding glad</hi> for
this Reason, because <hi>great is their Reward
in Heaven.</hi> At once to prove and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase
upon this Subject;</p>
            <p>1. The Question is not, Whether the
Rewards of Heaven are matter of Joy
and Gladness to those who are already
actually possess'd of them, who have
left this World, and exchanged this Life
for a better, and <hi>as they have heard, see
in the City of our God,</hi> and see no more
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:108689:212"/>
               <hi>darkly, as through a glass, but face to face.</hi>
There is no Dispute among <hi>Christians,</hi>
but that these Rewards are Joy and
Gladness to such. What! Can they
forbear rejoycing that lie at the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
drink of the River of God, which
is full of Water, even Water of Life?
Can they be sorrowful, that have the
Bridegroom always present with them,
and are out of all Danger to be deprived
of his Company? Can they be sad that
are united to the bright increated Sun,
which irradiates the vast Territories of
<hi>Heaven,</hi> and are perpetually warmed
into Strength and Vigor to praise and
adore the Author, and Life, and Glory
of their Being?</p>
            <p>The Question is not concerning these,
but such as are on this side <hi>Heaven,</hi> in
this Land of the Living, in this Valley
of Misery, and are afflicted, reviled,
persecuted, abused, as if they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
not only of <hi>Men,</hi> but of <hi>Heaven
too.</hi> Whether the Rewards of <hi>Heaven,</hi>
things invisible and unseen, out of their
reach and sight, and for which they
have nothing to shew but a few Lines in
a Book call'd <hi>the Bible;</hi> whether such
things as these can be just Cause of Joy
and Gladness, and to Persons who are
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:108689:213"/>
despicable and miserable, and perhaps
<hi>made the off-scouring of all things.</hi> This
is the Point I am to prove; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>2. That these Rewards of <hi>Heaven,</hi> as
much out of sight as they are, have
been, and are matter of Joy and Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to wise, rational, and inquisitive
Persons, is evident from what Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
tells us; and when I was upon the
Tenth Verse of this Chapter, I gave
you very considerable Instances of it:
nor is this Age so barren of Goodness,
but that several excellent <hi>Christians</hi> do
rejoyce and are exceeding glad at these
Rewards, and are able to say with the
Apostle, and the Believers of old, <hi>We
rejoyce in the hope of the Glory of God,</hi>
Rom. V. 2. So that the matter of fact
is certain. All the Difficulty lies here,
Whether these Rewards so much talk'd
of, are Ground sufficient and solid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to build such Joy and Gladness
upon; for Men may delude themselves
with Fancies, as we see People in <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam</hi>
do. But even this will soon be made
out; for if a Man have sufficient ground
to believe that there are such Rewards
in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and that the Book call'd <hi>the
Bible</hi> contains the Promises and Oracles
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:108689:213"/>
of the Living God, and that God hath
certainly promis'd such Rewards, and
Rewards so great, so wonderful as that
Book speaks of, to Persons duly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
then such a Man hath sufficient
reason to rejoyce in the Hope and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of it. And that what the Bible
saith of these Rewards, is the express
Word and Promise of God, is evident
from hence, because the several Writers
of that Book, and particularly the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertors
of these Rewards, whose Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication
and Aberration from the Truth
could never be proved, do peremptorily
affirm it: And that they affirm nothing
but the Truth, the Miracles they
wrought before whole Multitudes in
Confirmation of what they say, and the
Truth of which hath been convey'd and
handed down from Age to Age, and
sealed with a thousand and a thousand
Deaths, do sufficiently demonstrate.
And as true Miracles can be nothing but
the Effects of an Omnipotent Power, so
it is absurd to think, that God would
lend or vouchsafe his Omnipotent Power
to confirm a Lye. And we may as well
question the Publick Acts and Edicts in
such a King's Reign, who lived two or
three hundred years ago, attested by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:108689:214"/>
Authority, as the Records of these
Miracles; for the former we have only
the Testimony of a single Nation, for
the other the Testimony of the whole
Christian World, even that of Enemies,
not to mention, that the natural Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of Reason, and the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
speaks, though more darkly, to
the same purpose: So that there is no
room left for any rational Doubt that
there are such Rewards, which may
certainly be had, and consequently they
are just matter of Gladness and Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.
And yet,</p>
            <p>3. We see that these Rewards do not
cause this Joy in all, the generality re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
more in Temporal and Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
than Spiritual and Eternal Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings:
nor indeed do we find this Joy in
all Persons who are in Distress; for the
Sorrow they lie under, and their secret
Fondness of these outward Enjoyments,
we see, drown their Joy or Rejoycing
in these Rewards: Tho' I know <hi>Heaven</hi>
at such times is often talk'd of, yet it's
evident it moves not; the Discourse,
may be, amuses the Party, or for the
present makes him attentive; but being
over, like a Stone forced up into the
Air, when that Force is withdrawn, it
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:108689:214"/>
sinks to its Mother Earth again. We
must suppose therefore, that he who
can rejoyce in this Reward, I mean tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rejoyce, must be a Person duly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified;
and that which qualifies a Man
for it, is a lively Belief of it, a lively
Representation of it to the Mind and
Understanding, a firm Perswasion of
the Certainty, and of our Right and
Title to it, a very high Esteem of it,
and an actual preferring it before the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions
of this present World: and
accordingly we find that those who have
been thus qualified, have <hi>rejoyced</hi> in
these Rewards <hi>with joy unspeakable and
full of glory;</hi> as we see 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> I. 8. But</p>
            <p>4. Besides this, there are two Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
more which very much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
this Joy, or help towards it, and
that's, 1. A blameless Life. 2. Suffering
in the midst of that blameless Life.</p>
            <p>1. A blameless Life. A Man that
lives in Sin, or minds little but the
World, or allows himself in any thing
that's manifestly contrary to the <hi>Gospel,</hi>
cannot possibly rejoyce in these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
as well may a Beggar rejoyce in
such a Nobleman's Estate who is a meer
Stranger to him, as a Person who is
loth to submit to <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Yoke</hi> rejoyce in
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:108689:215"/>
the hopes of these Rewards, which do not
at all belong to him. Purity of Life hath
the Promise of this Reward, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the pure Liver only is the Person
that can justly rejoyce in it; especially,</p>
            <p>2. If he suffers notwithstanding his
blameless Life; for in this case, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of <hi>Heaven</hi> he takes a View of, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
him, that the time will shortly
come, when all this Troubles shall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
away like Smoak at the glorious
Presence of God; that it will not be
long before he shall be out of the reach
of all slanderous and malicious Tongues;
and that the greater his Sufferings are,
the greater will his Glory, and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
and Satisfaction be. His Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
fix his Thoughts upon this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and move him to dwell upon it.
The Bitterness of his Affliction gives
that Reward a greater Sweetness, and
is the same that makes him relish it the
more: Hence comes this Joy; and the
nobler the Cause is, in and for which
he suffers, the greater is the Joy.</p>
            <p>But 5. Though all this helps, yet the
<hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> must work with it,
and work in and upon the Heart, and
make the Impression of the future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
so lively, that it shall cause Joy
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:108689:215"/>
and Rejoycing: much depends upon
the Spirits mingling those Rewards
with the Thoughts of the Mind, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Affections are affected, and rouz'd,
and elevated into Joy and Rejoycing,
and such Joy as shall carry the Soul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
her Sufferings, and make her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly
want those Accommodations,
and Conveniencies, and Advantages,
that others do enjoy: For this Spirit, as
it must assure us of our Right to that
Reward, <hi>Rom.</hi> VIII. 16, 17. so it is
from that Assurance that this Joy rises,
which is the Reason why it is emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
called <hi>Joy in the Holy Ghost,</hi> Rom.
XIV. 17. And yet after all, it must be
confessed, that good Company doth not
a little contribute toward their Joy.
Which leads me to the</p>
            <p>Second Proposition; <hi>viz. It's comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to suffer in good Company; so perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
they the Prophets that were before you.</hi>
That's the Comfort Christ gives here to
Persons suffering, and bids them solace
themselves with the Company of the
antient Prophets. And this Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
also I shall explain in these following
Paragraphs.</p>
            <p>1. Solitariness in Affliction aggravates
Affliction; which is the Reason that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi>
               <pb n="364" facs="tcp:108689:216"/>
makes it an Ingredient of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Jerusalem</hi>'s Misery, <hi>Lam.</hi> I. 1.
<hi>How doth the city sit solitary, which was
full of people! how is she become as a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
that was great among the nations!
she that was a princess among the provinces,
how is she become tributary!</hi> All the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Nations</hi> round about swam in Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Prosperity crown'd their Labours,
and Ease and Liberty was their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> alone sigh'd under her
Load, and groan'd under her Burthen,
and wept while her Neighbours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyc'd
and triumph'd in the Success of
their Attempts and Enterprizes. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in Affliction is a kind of Balm
which supplies the Spirit, and gives
some Refreshment to a wounded Soul:
it takes off from the greatness of the
Grief, and makes the Burthen lighter.
Solitariness looks strange, like a stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Weed in a curious Flower-garden,
and coming in the shape of that, which
is unusual, it surprizes more, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
afflicts more; and that's the
Reason, may be, why Men bear a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Calamity, where many fare alike,
better than they do a private, where
they have no Partners in their Sorrows.
And yet,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:108689:216"/>
2. It's hard to conceive how a Man
can be solitary in Affliction, except by
Solitariness we mean, that in the Parish
or Street, or House, or Family we live
in, there is none that is afflicted as we
are. Set this aside, there can hardly any
Affliction be named, but some or other
in the World have been and are as great
or greater Sufferers than we are; and
in this sense a Man cannot want Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in Affliction: But then, in this
case, the Mind must call the Company
in, and the Understanding represent
their Sufferings to the Thoughts, and
Meditation must make their Afflictions
present; which being a thing generally
neglected by Persons who suffer, they
are very apt to sink into this Fancy,
That none are miserable in the World
as they are: as we see <hi>Jerusalem</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
<hi>Lam.</hi> I. 12. <hi>Behold and see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be such a sorrow as my sorrow is,
wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the
day of his anger.</hi> And yet,</p>
            <p>3. It is not suffering in every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
that is comfortable: To suffer with
Evil-doers, is a Grief rather than a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation;
and to be afflicted with Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
is made an Ingredient of the
Bitterness of <hi>our blessed Saviour's cup,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:108689:217"/>
Mark</hi> XV. Nor will Company in <hi>Hell</hi>
be any Ease to the Sufferers, but rather
increase their Torments, none being
able to help the other. The Comfort
arising from suffering in Company, is
confined to this present World; and in
this case, the Company must be such as
a Man hath no reason to be ashamed of,
and that must be the Company of truly
pious Men, whether they be present or
absent, whether they have lived lately,
or a thousand or two thousand Years
agone, whether they dwell in the same
Town, or City, or Village we are of,
or a hundred Miles off: for this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of good Men with whom we suffer
are either as good as we are, or better
than we.</p>
            <p>1. If they be as good as we our selves
are, the Reflexion is very natural. If
this be the Lot and Portion of Persons
under the same Circumstances I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
then no strange thing happens to
me, then God deals with me as he doth
with his other Children. If I am not
better than they, why should I expect
more favourable Dealings at his hands?
and yet these Dealings are favourable
too: If Men as good as my self have
look'd upon the Crosses that have befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:108689:217"/>
them as Marks of <hi>God's Favour,</hi>
why should not I look upon mine thro'
the same Glass! How can it be said that
I am as good as they, if I make not the
same pious Constructions of <hi>these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences!</hi>
if I fall short of these rational
Interpretations of God's Dispensations,
I must needs fall short of their Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Or,</p>
            <p>2. The good Men in whose Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
I suffer are better than I; and then
the Argument of Comfort will be stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
still. Have the <hi>Heroes</hi> of Religion
suffered so much, and shall I, a <hi>puny
Christian,</hi> complain? Have the great
Champions of the <hi>Gospel</hi> endured as
much or more than I, and shall a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
of an ordinary size find fault? Have
such Men as St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's</hi>
gone thro' firy Tryals, and shall I,
a Disciple of those great Masters, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at the Fire? Have <hi>the Fathers,</hi> the
<hi>strong Men</hi> in Grace, old Disciples, been
scratch'd, and wounded with Briars and
Thorns, and shall <hi>I a Babe</hi> look to tread
on Carpets? Have the <hi>Generals,</hi> the
<hi>Captains in Christ's Army,</hi> gone thro' a
Sea of Adversity, and shall I, a <hi>common
Soldier,</hi> shrink at the Waves? Have such
Men as <hi>Samuel, Elijah,</hi> and <hi>Elisha,</hi> Men
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:108689:218"/>
that could in a manner command Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by their Prayers, been reviled, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
reproach'd, and shall I, <hi>a Shrub,</hi>
take it ill that I am call'd out of my
Name? This is a very strong Argument
of Comfort. So that you see, that the
Comfort arising from suffering with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good Men, lies partly in the Ease
the Mind receives by their Society, and
partly in that their Examples give us
opportunity to make use of the same
Motives to Patience which held them
up.</p>
            <p>1. In the Ease the Mind receives from
the suffering Society. It gives a sort of
Content which all the Physick in the
World cannot give, especially if the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Company be present; for then
the Sufferers being able to disburden
their Grief into one anothers Bosom, it
gives such Satisfaction as People who
are ready to burst with Grief do find
when a shower of Tears does give their
Sorrow vent. This Ease is chiefly in
the Mind, and if the Mind be easie, the
whole Man receives Comfort; if that
be easie, it is as much as if a Man did
not suffer at all. It's our Minds and
Thoughts that make us either happy or
miserable. If a Man thinks himself hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:108689:218"/>
in Misery, he is so; and if he thinks
himself miserable in his Sufferings, he
is so. It's our Thoughts, certainly, that
make us uneasie in Adversity; and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
at such times upon wrong Topicks
and Arguments, puts all into disorder;
whereas calling to mind such Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
as are proper and suitable, allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
our Grief, and makes our Minds ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.
And of this nature is the good So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
we suffer with: For,</p>
            <p>2. This gives us opportunity to make
use of the same Motives to Patience that
those other good Men have used to bear
up under their Crosses; and in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
they will have the same Effect
upon us, and end in the same Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The <hi>Primitive Believers</hi> look'd
upon their Afflictions as Tryals of their
Faith, and that gave them Ease; so must
I: They had a regard to the End for
which God did correct them, <hi>viz.</hi> to
produce in them <hi>the peaceable fruits of
Righteousness,</hi> and that taught them
Contentedness; so must I: They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
themselves to Patience with
the Example of Christ, and that quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them; and so must I: They relied
upon the Promises of God without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,
and that revived them; so must
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:108689:219"/>
I: They look'd upon their Troubles as
short momentary things, and that made
them lightsome; so must I: They
thought their Afflictions necessary to
make them breath after their heavenly
Country, and that made them cheerful;
so must I. So that if their way be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd,
and our Fellow-sufferers be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
under these Notions, their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in suffering will certainly afford
more than ordinary Consolations.</p>
            <div type="inferences">
               <head>Inferences.</head>
               <p>1. Having explain'd the several Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
mention'd in this excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
of our Saviour, give me leave to
observe to you in the Close of all, That
though every single Virtue and Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in the preceding Beatitudes hath
a glorious Reward annexed to it, no
less than <hi>the beatifick Vision of an All-sufficient
God;</hi> yet you must not think
that he who should apply himself to the
Practice of one single Virtue, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
the rest, would upon that account
be rewarded with Heaven: This is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
as the Case stands; for <hi>Christ</hi>
expresly requires <hi>Vniversal Obedience;</hi>
but if I mind only one of these Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:108689:219"/>
and disregard the rest, how is
my Obedience universal? It's true,
<hi>Christ</hi> affixes a spiritual and eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to every particular Grace, partly
for our greater Encouragement, partly
because every one of the aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Graces tends to that Center, and like
Lines meet in that one Point, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because the future Reward shall be
suited to the several Virtues, and in
some measure answer and resemble the
Nature of the respective Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
yet still there is such a Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion
among them, that they are insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and he that sincerely, according
to the Intent of the Law-giver, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
one, cannot forbear practising the
rest, and consequently he that pretends
to observe one, and doth despise the rest,
doth not observe that one as he ought.
The serious and conscientious Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of one, will make us enamoured
with all the Links of the whole Chain:
the Beauty and Reasonableness of one
will invite and charm us into a cheerful
Compliance with all the rest.</p>
               <p>The several Qualifications mention'd
in the preceding Verses, are so many
<hi>Steps to Heaven. Humility</hi> is the first;
<hi>Mourning for our Sins,</hi> the second; <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:108689:220"/>
and composing our turbulent Passions,</hi>
the third; <hi>Hunger and Thirst after Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi>
the fourth; <hi>Mercifulness,</hi> the
fifth; <hi>Purity of Heart,</hi> the sixth; <hi>Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness,</hi>
and <hi>a Peace-making Temper,</hi> the
seventh; and <hi>a patient enduring Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Calumnies, and Afflictions in a good
Cause,</hi> the last. So that you see how
you are to rise, and by what Ladder
you are to ascend to Glory. He that
advances but a step or two, will never
reach the everlasting Hills. One Grace
is the Foundation of the other. <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
or an humble Sense of your selves,
and of your own Worth, will dispose
you <hi>for mourning,</hi> because you have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
and do offend a very great, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and gracious God; and this Sense
which makes you concern'd for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
and Affronts you have offer'd to
the best of Beings, and which makes
you mourn, will dispose you to <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
towards your Neighbours who do
offend and have offended you, and
move you to curb, and moderate, and
mortify your Anger and Pettishness at
Faults you see in others; subduing your
inordinate Passion, you will be more at
leisure to consider the Beauty and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and that will
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:108689:220"/>
make <hi>you hunger</hi> and <hi>thirst after it.</hi> This
<hi>Hunger</hi> and <hi>Thirst</hi> will dispose you to
<hi>Mercifulness,</hi> for he that desires to grow
in Grace must apply himself to Works
of Mercy, for by these Holiness is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
increased. <hi>This merciful</hi> Temper
will dispose you <hi>for Purity of Heart,</hi> not
only because Almsgiving cleanses the
Soul, and quenches Sin, as Fire doth
Water, but enlarges your Love to God.
This Purity of the inward Man will
dispose you for Peaceableness and a Peace-making
Temper; for as Strife and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
rises from an impure Heart,
from Lusts warring within us, so a
peaceable Disposition rises from inward
Purity. This peaceable and Peace-making
Temper will procure you (may
be) the Hatred and Ill-will of Men;
from hence will come Persecutions, Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Reproaches, Calumnies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
if you bear with a patient and generous
Mind, you secure your Reward in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
and then <hi>rejoyce and be exceeding
glad, for great is your reward in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. I must here take notice, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
deserves our rejoycing so much as
these future Rewards. What is there
in this World that should make us so
fond of rejoycing in it? The three
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:108689:221"/>
great Idols of the World are <hi>Riches, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
and <hi>Sensual Pleasure;</hi> but look ye,
how inconstant, how uncertain, how
uneven, and how short, are all these!
He that is rich this Year may be a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
the next, <hi>Valerianus</hi> and <hi>Androni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
who are <hi>Emperors</hi> to day, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
shall be despicable to all their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
He that wallows in Pleasure this
hour, some grievous Pain or Disease
may arrest him the next, and fill him
with Vexation. Do not we see how
these outward Enjoyments crack in the
very handling, and <hi>make themselves
wings and flee away?</hi> He that is a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of State</hi> to day, may be <hi>a Prisoner</hi>
to morrow; he that <hi>sits at the Helm</hi> to
day, to morrow may <hi>groan in a Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon;</hi>
he that <hi>gives Law to others</hi> to day,
may be <hi>exposed to the fury of the Rabble</hi>
to morrow; and he that <hi>dwells in a state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
House</hi> to day, may see it <hi>laid in Ashes</hi>
before the next Morning Light. And
are these the mighty Things you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in? Do these Butterflies deserve
such Admiration as most Men bestow
upon them? Be wise ye Children of
Men, be wise; the Rewards of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
are solid, lasting, constant Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures:
they fade not, they fail not, they
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:108689:221"/>
perish not, and are the noblest Objects
of your Thoughts and Contemplations.
Here you'll have always matter of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing;
here is something that will be
able always to support you; here is
something that will always raise your
drooping Souls: Do but secure these
Rewards, and you will be able to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
joyful, joyful in Persecution, in
Poverty, in Exile, in Sickness, in Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
under good Report and evil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
And indeed, till you can rejoyce
in this Reward, and so rejoyce in it,
that the Joy in a great measure drowns
your Sorrow, you are none of the best
<hi>Christians.</hi> It's possible to make sure of
this Reward; and how it is to be done,
Christ shews in the preceding Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.
Let these Rewards be always
rolling in your Minds, and you will
have a perpetual Antidote against Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
and Dejectedness. Whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals
you, reflect upon this Reward, and
you will be able to live above the
World, and pity the poor Creatures that
have no Props to rest on but the <hi>broken
Reed of Egypt.</hi> This is to begin your
Heaven here; and when you come to
die, you have no more to do, than to
enter upon your Estate, and to take
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:108689:222"/>
Possession of your Inheritance. Your
Death will be wonderfully sweetned
with these Thoughts, and you will be
able to die with rejoycing, because <hi>great
is your Reward in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. Hear this, all ye Sufferers; you
I mean, that suffer according to the
Will of God, that glorify God in your
Sufferings, and improve your Sufferings
into a holy Conformity to the Rules of
the Gospel. You are not alone in your
Sufferings; for besides that God is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with you, and the <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> that
merciful <hi>High Priest,</hi> is <hi>touched with the
feeling of your Infirmities,</hi> you have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Company in your Sufferings.
The <hi>Patriarchs</hi> were Sufferers, the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
were Sufferers, the <hi>Apostles</hi> were
Sufferers, the <hi>best Christians</hi> were Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<hi>Heaven</hi> is full of Sufferers. What
a glorious Society is here! <hi>The high and
lofty one, who inhabits Eternity,</hi> dwells
among these weeping and groaning
Saints. <hi>The Son of God</hi> is their Captain
and Principal; Who would not suffer
with such Society! With these suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Saints you shall rejoyce at last. As
you have <hi>mourned</hi> with them, so you
shall <hi>sing</hi> with them. As you have <hi>born
the heat and burden of the day</hi> with them,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:108689:222"/>
so you shall <hi>rest</hi> with them. As you
have <hi>drank of the cup of trembling</hi> with
them, so you shall <hi>drink with them of the
cup of salvation.</hi> As you have <hi>been revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
with them, so you shall <hi>be honoured</hi>
with them: And your Honour shall not
be like that of <hi>Haman</hi> or <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
which like a glorious sun-shiny Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
was over-cast before Night, but
your Honour shall be like that of the
Son of God, you shall rule in the House
of <hi>Jacob</hi> for ever, and of your Kingdom
shall be no end.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>St. Matth. Ch. V. Ver. 13.</bibl>
               <q>Ye are the Salt of the Earth; but if
the Salt have lost its savour,
wherewith shall it be salted? it is
thenceforth good for nothing, but to
be cast out, and to be troden under
foot of men.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>HAving consider'd the several <hi>Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,</hi>
or Blessednesses mention'd in
the preceding Verses, and which are an
Introduction to the admirable Discourse
which follows in this Chapter; we
proceed to the Characters <hi>Christ</hi> gives
of his true Followers. Divers and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
are the Names and Titles the <hi>Holy
Ghost</hi> gives of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Disciples, calling
them sometimes <hi>Sheep,</hi> to put them in
mind of the Obligation that lies upon
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:108689:223"/>
them to be innocent, and meek, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
and Enemies to Revenge; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<hi>Brethren,</hi> to shew how dearly,
how tenderly, how affectionately they
ought to love one another. Sometime
<hi>new Creatures,</hi> because it is supposed they
have put off the Old Man, and put on
the New Man, <hi>created after God in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
and true holiness.</hi> Sometimes
<hi>Babes,</hi> because of their imbibing the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Milk of the Word, that they may
grow thereby. Sometime <hi>lively Stones,</hi>
because they are built up a spiritual
House, of which <hi>Christ</hi> is the Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
and in which he dwells by Faith.
Sometime <hi>Priests,</hi> because of the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Sacrifices of Prayer and Praise, and
Righteousness, which they offer to God.
Sometimes <hi>Kings,</hi> because their Province
is to Conquer their Lusts and evil De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
and Worldly Affections. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>Virgins,</hi> because they keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
undefiled, and unspotted from the
World. Sometimes <hi>Free-men,</hi> because
<hi>Christ</hi> hath made them free from the
Dominion of Sin, and the Bondage of
Iniquity, and themselves are and must
be ambitious of that Liberty. And to
come to the Words of the <hi>Text,</hi> there
they are call'd <hi>Salt,</hi> even <hi>the Salt of the
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:108689:224"/>
Earth, Ye are the Salt of the Earth; but if
the Salt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For the understanding of which words,
I shall enquire,</p>
            <p>I. Upon what account <hi>Christians</hi> are,
and ought to be <hi>the Salt of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. How this <hi>Salt</hi> comes to <hi>lose its
Savour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. I shall examine the Consequences
of this Corruption, and the Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
added to it: <hi>It is thenceforth good for
nothing, but to be cast out, and to be tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
under foot of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. Upon what account <hi>Christians</hi> are
and ought to be <hi>the Salt of the Earth.</hi>
I proved in the beginning of these Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
on <hi>Christ's Sermon,</hi> that the
Disciples of <hi>Christ,</hi> to whom the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rules and Commands are directed
and enjoin'd, were not barely the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi>
nor the <hi>Apostles</hi> consider'd only as
<hi>Ministers of the Gospel,</hi> but all that have
enter'd themselves into the Discipline of
the <hi>Holy Jesus;</hi> and therefore the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
here is very justly extended to all
that call themselves <hi>Christians:</hi> And that
none may wonder at <hi>Christ's</hi> saying, <hi>that
they are the Salt of the Earth,</hi> as if all
that have the name of <hi>his Disciples</hi> were
actually so, either born so, or became
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:108689:224"/>
so immediately upon their Profession.
You must know, that this way of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
expresses the Nature and Tendency
of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and shews,
what those who are true Disciples are,
and what those who would be so, ought
to be; and the meaning is, If you are
<hi>true followers</hi> of me, thus it is with you,
and thus it will certainly be with you,
even as it is with <hi>Salt;</hi> what <hi>Salt</hi> doth,
you will do in a Spiritual sense, and in
your Actions and Conversations you will
imitate the Nature of that <hi>Mineral.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The dullest <hi>Papist</hi> imaginable, that
hears or reads these words cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
or from hence conclude a <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi>
as if therefore the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>Christ</hi> were <hi>Transubstantiated</hi> into
<hi>Salt,</hi> because it is said, <hi>Ye are the Salt of
the Earth;</hi> and this may justly raise our
Wonder, they should be so blind as to
fancy a <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> intended in the
words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> when the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities
flowing from the <hi>Sacramental
Bread</hi> being changed into the Natural
Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> are every whit as great
as the other would be, if we should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that every true Disciple of Christ is
<hi>Transubstantiated</hi> into natural <hi>Salt.</hi> There
is nothing more common in Scripture,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:108689:225"/>
than by the Verb <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>am,</hi> and <hi>art,</hi>
and <hi>are,</hi> to express a likeness, or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation,
or resemblance, or a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
and that must necessarily be the
meaning here, <hi>viz.</hi> If you be my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
indeed, you do, and will resemble
the <hi>Salt of the Earth,</hi> and in what things
this resemblance consists, the following
Particulars will inform you.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Salt is a very useful thing,</hi> one of
the most beneficial things in the World;
It is as it were the <hi>Balsom of Nature,</hi>
which preserves all things; <hi>Than Salt and
the Sun nothing is more profitable,</hi> said the
<hi>Philosopher;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pliny.</note> so a true Christian is a very
useful Creature: When Men of this
Profession first appeared in the World,
the rude <hi>Pagans,</hi> a great many of them,
were loath to believe that they were of
any use to Mankind; and though they
usually called them <hi>Christians,</hi> which
is as much as <hi>useful,</hi> yet this was by way
of Contempt; and in saying so, they
meant the contrary.</p>
            <p>Hence it was, that when a Land-Flood
came, or an Inundation rose, or
a Plague broke forth, or the Corn was
blasted, or any publick Calamity befell
them, the fault was presently laid upon
the <hi>Christians:</hi> Notwithstanding all this,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:108689:225"/>
they were, and all true <hi>Christians</hi> at this
Day are very useful Persons, for their
Nature and Temper, to teach, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct,
to comfort, and to edifie their
Neighbours; and as heretofore God did,
so still he doth very often, for the good
<hi>Christians</hi> sake, (who are Inhabitants
there) spare a Place, Town, City, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Country; an Emblem where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
God gave in the Case of <hi>Sodom,</hi> when
he professed his readiness <hi>to spare the City,</hi>
if but <hi>ten righteous Men could be found in
it,</hi> Gen. xviii. 32. And to this purpose
he told St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Ship, wherein he
sailed, <hi>God hath given thee all them that
Sail with thee,</hi> i. e. For thy sake they
shall be saved from Drowning: And if
Men observ'd <hi>Providence</hi> more, they
would see and admire some very strange
Instances of this nature, the safety that
is vouchsafed to wicked Men, being
clearly upon the account of the Pious
<hi>Christians</hi> that live near them, or about
them.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Salt is the Symbol of Wisdom.</hi> So
we read <hi>Colos.</hi> iv. 6. <hi>Let your Speech be
always with Grace, season'd with Salt,</hi> i. e.
with <hi>Wisdom.</hi> To this purpose is the
Saying of the Old <hi>Comick, Si quis haberet
salem,</hi> &amp;c. If a Man had that Salt which
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:108689:226"/>
yon have, <hi>i, e. that Wisdom;</hi> and that of
<hi>Catullus,</hi>
               <q>Nulla in tam magno corpore mica sali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>.</q>
There is not a Grain <hi>of Salt</hi> in that
vast Body, i. e. <hi>of Wisdom:</hi> And <hi>Livy</hi>
for this reason calls <hi>Greece,</hi> where the
wisest Men then lived, <hi>The Salt of the
Gentiles,</hi> or of the <hi>Heathen World.</hi> A
true <hi>Christian</hi> is a truly Wise Man; a
Fool indeed in the Eyes of the World,
but Wise toward God, and unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
so Wise as to <hi>walk circumspectly,
and redeem the time,</hi> Ephes. V. 15. He
<hi>walks in Wisdom toward them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi>
Col. IV. 5. and <hi>he orders his affairs
with discretion,</hi> Psal. CXIV. 5. And for
this reason he is said to be a <hi>wise and
faithful Servant,</hi> who <hi>keeps himself ready,
and doth the work his Master hath set him,
that when the Master of the House returns,
he may commend, and reward him,</hi> Matth.
XXIV. 45.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>In Salt there is a mixture of Fire and
Water.</hi> It's hot, like Fire; and yet cools
like Water. These two different qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
you'll find in a true <hi>Christian,</hi> not
that he is inconstant, and unstable in
his ways, sometimes hot, then cold
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:108689:226"/>
again, sometime all Fire, and then all
Ice again; sometime very serious, then
vain and foolish again; but by his Zeal
he warms others, and by his meek and
peaceable Temper, he lays and cools the
Feverish Heats of others: Of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> IX. 2. Of
the other, we have an instance in the
Apostles, who when Contentions arose
among the <hi>Grecians</hi> about the relief of
Widows, by their moderation composed
them, <hi>Acts</hi> VI. 1, 2, 3. and when a Fire
of Dispute was kindled about Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
by their Prudence and peaceable
Disposition quieted the Tumults that
rose about that Controversy. <hi>Acts</hi> XV.
23, 24.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Salt renders Things savoury,</hi> and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
an Appetite. In this also we see
the Temper of a true <hi>Christian,</hi> who by his
pious Discourses and gracious Speeches,
creates many times an Appetite after
Things Spiritual and Divine, in those
who hear him, and whose Hearts God
touches, that they attend to the things
which are spoken; as we read of <hi>Lydia,
Acts</hi> XVI. 14. Nor is this all, but by
his Pious and self-denying Behaviour he
renders many of those Severities he pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiseth,
Amiable and Charming in the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:108689:227"/>
Eyes that observe and take notice of
them, as is evident from the Constancy
and Fortitude which appeared in the
<hi>Primitive Believers</hi> in their Sufferings:
Virtues which look'd so lovely, that
Thousands were enamour'd with them,
and follow'd their example. And what
are the <hi>Acts of the Holy Apostles,</hi> but
Comments upon this Truth? The Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Heroick Patience of those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Men, were transcribed into the
Lives of those who beheld them.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Salt raises Thirst;</hi> so a Pious <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
by his delight in God, and the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
he takes and finds in the ways
of Religion, raises in others <hi>a hunger
and thirst after Righteousness. Paul</hi> and
<hi>Silas</hi> sing Praises to God at Midnight,
and in a <hi>Dungeon</hi> too: The <hi>Jaylor</hi> awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd
with that as well as with the
Earthquake, feels a strange Commotion
in his Soul, and cries out, <hi>Sirs what must
I do to be saved?</hi> Acts XVI. 30.</p>
            <p>6. The thing chiefly intended by this
similitude is this: <hi>Salt preserves from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction;</hi>
for it consumes the sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Humours of Meat, or extracts
them; whereby it is preserv'd from
stinking. So a <hi>true Christian,</hi> partly by
his blameless Life, partly by Entreaties,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:108689:227"/>
partly by fraternal Correption, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by friendly Admonitions, preserves,
and is to preserve others from running
into Sin and Errour. All that I have said
before concenters in this, and this is it
which is expected from us, if <hi>Christianity</hi>
be more than a Name, even as much as
in us lies to prevent the corruption of
others, whether Relatives or Strangers
we converse with, whether Friends or
Foes; As no Religion in the World presses
Love and Charity to our Neighbours,
more than that we profess, so thit hearty
endeavour to preserve others from sin,
and offending God, is the natural result
of this Charity. There is no Man but
grants, that to preserve a Neighbour
from Drowning, or doing himself a Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
is a Duty incumbent on all that
have any thing of Humane Compassion
in them; and if the concerns of the
Soul are greatest, as we ordinarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
they are, it will follow, that to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
Men from wounding and undoing
their own Souls, must be absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
<hi>Religion</hi> exalts <hi>Nature,</hi> and the
kindnesses which the Law written upon
our Hearts requires of us toward the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of our Neighbours, Religion bids us
exercise to their Souls, which are the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:108689:228"/>
substances. Religion, as it makes
us concerned for our own Souls, so it
raises a desire to do good to the Souls of
others. Till a Man comes to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
about spiritual Affairs, he is a
Stranger to Religion: As things unseen
are the proper Object of the Soul, so to
be truly concerned about things unseen,
is the proper Character of a Religious
Man. And as Religion, in imitation of
its Author is communicative, so the Soul
of another Man comes to be very dear
to us, if our care and solicitude be once
seriously employ'd about our own; and
this is the ground of the great Duty
pressed here, <hi>viz. preserving others from
Sin</hi> and Corruption; to which purpose,
our Saviour tells <hi>Peter</hi> with respect to
<hi>his resurrection from his Apostacy, when
thou art converted, strengthen thy Brethren,</hi>
Luke XXII. 32. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> in larger
terms, <hi>Exhort one another daily, taking
heed lest any of you be harden'd through the
deceitfulness of sin,</hi> Heb. III. 13. This
being the true import of the similitude
used here; Let us</p>
            <p>II. Consider <hi>how this Salt comes to lose
its Savour.</hi> And this happens,</p>
            <p>1. When a Man after he comes to know
his Duty, either by reading, or hearing the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:108689:228"/>
Word preached in season and out of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<hi>acts contrary to his Profession,</hi> and
enticed, or overcome by the Cares,
Riches, and Pleasures of this Life, grows
sensless of the weighty Concerns of his
own and other Mens Souls, and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and obstinately (maugre all the
Checks of his Conscience to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
continues so. We all know, that
when <hi>Salt</hi> hath lost its Picquancy, and
Sharpness, and Quickness, it is gone,
and it can be call'd <hi>Salt</hi> no more. Just
so it is with a Man that owns himself a
<hi>Christian,</hi> if taken with these outward
things that please the Flesh, and pamper
the Body, and gratifie his Carnal Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
he boldly neglects exerting his Zeal
and Fervour for his own and other Mens
Souls, which his Religion presses and
urges him to; he ceases to be <hi>a Christian;</hi>
for a <hi>Christian</hi> is a Person active, that
acts according to the Rules of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.
Where it is so, that the love of
the World doth so blind and intoxicate
him, that he looks neither after his own
Soul, nor the Soul of his Neighbour,
and feels no love to either; or if he
feels something of it, choaks it again
with the <hi>Bryars and Thorns of this Life,</hi>
he loses the Spirit of Religion; and then
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:108689:229"/>
               <hi>as the Body without the Soul is dead,</hi> so <hi>his
Christianity without this Love, becomes
dead also.</hi> Indeed we call the dead, Men
still; but that's only a Name: Properly
speaking, they are <hi>no Men;</hi> and so it
is here, he that is a stranger to this
Love is <hi>no Christian;</hi> for this Love is as
much of the Essence of <hi>Christianity,</hi> as
sharpness, or quickness is to <hi>Salt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This <hi>Salt loses his Savour:</hi> When
a Man hath been for some time solicitous
about his own Soul, and the spiritual
Concerns of his Neighbours, and grows
weary of it; or for Carnal Reasons
quits those hearty Endeavours of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
others from Sin and Corruption;
This the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> calls <hi>departing from
the Holy Commandment delivered to us,</hi>
2 Pet. II. 21. Though <hi>losing</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
imports sometimes, <hi>neglecting</hi> that
which is a Mans greatest interest <hi>to mind,</hi>
yet for the most part, <hi>loss</hi> supposes <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;</hi>
and that we once <hi>had</hi> that which
is now <hi>gone</hi> from us; and this is an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation
of the fault, and consequently
of the Sin mentioned in the <hi>Text:</hi> And
he <hi>loses his Savour</hi> as a <hi>Christian,</hi> i. e. loses
his <hi>Christianity</hi> and <hi>Sense of God</hi> with a
witness, that <hi>begins in the Spirit, and ends
in the Flesh;</hi> runs well for a time, and
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:108689:229"/>
suffers himself to be stopt in his Race,
hath endeavour'd to do good to the Souls
of others, and taken care that his Life
and Actions might be edifying to those
who conversed with him; but <hi>having
laid his hand to the Plough, looks back,</hi>
with <hi>Lot's</hi> Wife, who <hi>became a Pillar of
Salt,</hi> and of Disgrace and Infamy too.
<hi>Salt</hi> is used in Scripture for permanen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
that's the reason of the expression
<hi>Numb.</hi> XVIII. 19. <hi>A Covenant of Salt,</hi>
i. e. <hi>a lasting Covenant;</hi> and a <hi>Christian</hi>
that is to be <hi>Salt</hi> in one sense, <hi>i. e. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
others</hi> as much as he can <hi>from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
must be <hi>Salt</hi> in the other sense too,
i. e. <hi>continue patiently in well-doing;</hi> if he
doth not, <hi>he loses his Savour,</hi> and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
and then <hi>if the Salt hath lost its
Savour, wherewith shall it be salted?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether <hi>Salt can lose its Savour,</hi> I
leave to Naturalists to enquire and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine;
if it cannot, the possibility of
it may, however safely be supposed, for
the instruction, of the ignorant as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> supposes an <hi>Angels Preaching a new
Doctrin, If an Angel from Heaven should
Preach another Gospel to you than what
we have Preach'd unto you, let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs'd;</hi>
not that its possible an <hi>Angel</hi> can
do so, but such a supposition makes the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:108689:230"/>
Argument in hand more powerful and
convincing. And having considered how
the <hi>Salt,</hi> or the <hi>Persons</hi> represented by
<hi>Salt, lose their Savour,</hi> lets go on and
consider</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III.</hi> The nature of the Commination here
spoken of, <hi>which is,</hi> That the Salt after
that cannot recover its taste, but is cast
forth and troden under foot of Men. <hi>To
explain this,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. As <hi>Salt</hi> when it hath lost its Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is render'd incapable of recovering
that Sharpness, there being nothing in
Nature that can give it the taste of <hi>Salt</hi>
again; so where People will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
either by good Examples, or by
other means to endeavour the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of others from Sin, God very often
hardens them, and takes away from them
a Heart and Will to do it for the future.
When Men neglect their known Duty,
or delay applying themselves to it,
though they have many Motions of
God's Spirit to that purpose, and hope
to do it this time and that time, and yet
still find Impediments, there it is just
with God to put them in an incapacity
of doing it at all; and to take from them
that Grace and Power he gave them to
preserve others from Corruption, or to
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:108689:230"/>
bring upon them an impossibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
that Grace and Power, as much
as <hi>Salt</hi> cannot be <hi>Salted again,</hi> or <hi>recover
its Sharpness</hi> when it hath once <hi>lost its
Acrimony.</hi> God cannot endure to see
Men play with his Gifts. He makes
anotherguess account of his <hi>Gospel</hi> he
vouchsafes to Men, than the generality
do, and those who give up their Names
to him, and will not by the strongest
Arguments be prevail'd with to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Profession, shall be in
danger of being so infatuated, that they
shall not be <hi>salted again</hi> with the <hi>Salt</hi> of
Grace and Favour, and influences of
his Spirit; for this is <hi>to bury our Talents in
the Earth,</hi> or to <hi>lay them up in a Napkin,</hi>
and <hi>from such shall be taken away even that
which they have,</hi> Matth. XXV. 29.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>As Salt having lost its savour</hi> is
thereby rendered incapable of recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its sharpness, and <hi>is thence forth good
for nothing, but to be cast out, and troden
under foot of Men;</hi> so it shall be with
such unprofitable Servants, that would
not take any care or pains to Convert
their Neighbours from the Errors of
their ways, God will <hi>cast them out,</hi> and
<hi>tread them under foot,</hi> as base and unjust
Stewards of his Gifts, as Lyars and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:108689:231"/>
Persons, that made nothing of
their <hi>Baptismal Covenant;</hi> as Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and Despisers of his <hi>Gospel,</hi> as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
Wretches to the best of Masters,
who enlighten'd and assisted them with
<hi>his Spirit,</hi> gave them Opportunities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
his Will to them, directed them
how to order their Steps, yet would
not be moved by all he hath done for
them, nor by their own Interest, nor
by their Neighbours Necessities and
Miseries to make any Attempts to rescue
them from the Devil's Snare; and this
as it is an Argument of Cruelty and
Unmercifulness, so it follows, that <hi>they
shall have Judgment without Mercy, that
have shewn no Mercy,</hi> Jam. II. 13.</p>
            <div type="inferences">
               <head>Inferences.</head>
               <p>I. <hi>We see here the reason why the World
is so bad as it is.</hi> Even because Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
do not do their Duty; they were
intended to be <hi>the Salt of the World,</hi> but
<hi>that Salt hath lost its savour. Christians</hi>
were intended to be like so many <hi>Angels</hi>
in this <hi>Sodom</hi> of the World; and by the
Beauty of their Lives to attract and
charm even the most barbarous. And
had they continued stedfast in that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:108689:231"/>
and Purity, and Zeal the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
taught them, there would not have
been so much <hi>Heathenism,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
and <hi>Impiety</hi> in the World, as we see there
is. Their evil Lives after the Apostles
decease, confirm'd Infidels in their Vices,
and their Quarrels and Animosities made
them a Laughing-stock to the <hi>Pagans</hi> that
beheld them; and from hence rose <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometanism,</hi>
and <hi>Popery,</hi> and a Thousand
<hi>Heresies.</hi> While they continued <hi>in the
Apostles Doctrin, and in Fellowship, and
in breaking Bread, and in Prayer,</hi> and
<hi>fear was on every Soul,</hi> and <hi>they were of
one Heart and one Mind,</hi> and their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
was fervent; Thousands came in to
them daily, left their Gods and their
Sins, and shook off the Yoak of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:
But when the Piety of their Lives
decay'd, the Reformation of Mankind
decay'd also. And though I cannot say
it's altogether so bad now, especially in
<hi>Protestant Countries,</hi> as it hath been in
some of the darker Ages, when <hi>Popery</hi>
and Ignorance prevailed, yet the greater
part of <hi>Christians,</hi> instead of being <hi>Salt,</hi>
do nothing but give Scandal; and in
Countries where <hi>Christians</hi> live mingled
with Heathens and Infidels, it's hard to
say which of these live better Lives,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:108689:232"/>
nay many times, the <hi>Pagans</hi> are Men
of better Morals, and less given to
Cheating, Defrauding, Hypocrisie, and
Passion, than those who call themselves
<hi>Christians.</hi> And among our selves, what
a lamentable sight is it to behold, how
Men lead one another into <hi>Hell,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Reforming, entice and delude
one another into Vices, <hi>which should not
be so much as named among Christians;</hi> so
that we need not wonder, if the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and worthy Name whereby we are
called, be blasphemed and evil spoken
of, and Men even <hi>abhor the Offerings of
the Lord.</hi> But such <hi>shall receive the greater
Condemnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. <hi>Behold here what a Noble Profession
Christianity is.</hi> A <hi>Christian</hi> is as it were
a Tutor or Teacher to Mankind, and
therefore it is said here, <hi>Ye are the Salt of
the Earth.</hi> The whole Earth is a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian's
Theater</hi> to walk and shew himself
in; where-ever he is, whatever part of
the World he is in, his business is and
must be, by his grave and modest, and
blameless Life, to shew others the way
to Salvation; and as far as he is able,
and hath convenience and opportunity,
to purge away the Dross that cleaves to
others: A very great Honour, if People
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:108689:232"/>
had Hearts to understand it; an Honour
not to make them Proud, but Profitable
to the World; an Honour it's true, not
much regarded, and which very few
are ambitious of, yet an Honour which
you and I must be very desirous of, if
we mean to be <hi>Christians</hi> indeed; we
profess our resolution to do so, when we
call our selves so; and it's our Calling
to do it, as much as it is a Painters, or
Limners, <hi>to draw Pictures.</hi> If a Man
should profess himself to be a <hi>Carpenter,</hi>
or <hi>Shoo-maker,</hi> or <hi>Joyner,</hi> or any other
Handy-crafts-man, and yet through
want of Skill, were not able to do any
thing belonging to his Calling, you
know he exposes himself to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and Scorn of Men; and Men
will look upon him as a <hi>Cheat,</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor.</hi>
And do not you expose your
selves as much, or more, to the Contempt
and Scorn of a Just God, in calling your
selves <hi>Christians,</hi> while you labour not
to preserve others from Sin, nor endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to make them Good; for this work
is Essential to your Profession; and not
to do it is to forfeit your Right and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to the Profession. We may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
reduce the Dispute to this <hi>dilemma.</hi>
Either you are content heartily to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:108689:233"/>
after this Reformation of others
or you are unwilling. If unwilling,
leave your Profession; for you may be
<hi>Heathens</hi> more innocently than <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and do nothing that belongs to the
Profession. If willing, let us see you
go about it; but then how will you be
able to Reform others, except you first
Reform your selves? <hi>Thou that teachest
another, dost not thou teach thy self? Thou
that sayest a Man should not steal, dost thou
steal? Thou that sayest a Man should not
commit Adultery, dost thou commit Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery?</hi>
Rom. II. 21, 22. Indeed the great
reason why we are not more intent
upon the Reformation of others, is
because we have no serious regard to our
own Souls, did we prize our own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we could not but prize that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
too: But he that is unfaithful in
his own spiritual Concerns, how should
he be faithful in those of other Men?
Did we apply our selves to a steady
Conformity to the Rules of the Gospel,
a Conformity which neither Prosperity
could melt, nor Adversity break, what
abundance of good might we do? How
would People read their Duty in our
Actions and Behaviour! Wicked Men
would be afraid of sinning in our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:108689:233"/>
nay in our absence would, may
be, think and reflect on the Grace of
God they saw in us; and who knows
how this might work upon them! espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
if to our blameless Lives we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
now and then some seasonable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations,
Entreaties, and Reproofs,
as opportunity serves.</p>
               <p>Think not that this would interfere
with the <hi>Work of the Ministry:</hi> No, no:
A Kings watching over his People, doth
not, need not hinder a House keeper
from watching over his Family. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<hi>all your</hi> endeavours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
evil and inconsiderate Men, the
<hi>Ministers of the Gospel</hi> will find work
enough; nay, by this means you would
be helpful to the Ministry, and prepare
Men for our larger Instructions, and fit
them for the understanding of our <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;</hi>
and that Fire which your pious
Counsels have kindled in them, we should
be able to cherish and increase by our
Power and Authority.</p>
               <p>And what if you have seen no great
success of your Endeavours to Reform
others; may be you have exhorted and
reproved them, but have not shewn
them a good Example; or may be you
have admonish'd them carelesly, or in
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:108689:234"/>
Jest; and this is not the way to edifie;
or while you have Chid them for one
sin, suppose <hi>Swearing,</hi> or <hi>Drinking,</hi> or
<hi>keeping Ill Company,</hi> you have lived in
another, such as <hi>Wrath,</hi> or <hi>Anger,</hi> or
<hi>Covetousness,</hi> and <hi>Vncharitableness,</hi> &amp;c.
and this must necessarily obstruct their
Conversion: But suppose your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
both by a good Example, and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Admonitions have proved ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;
All that can be said is this, they
have done no good to day, or this Week,
but how do you know but they may
prove beneficial to morrow, or next day,
or next year? Industrious Men are not
discouraged with miscarrying in their
business once or twice, but fall on again,
and try again; and at last, their Wishes
are accomplish'd, and their Desires ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled;
God gives no success to the first
Attempts, on purpose to encourage us
to make more. <hi>Be not therefore weary of
well-doing.</hi> Do you but your Duty, and
leave the Success to God; You'll be no
losers by your Endeavours in the last day.
In the mean while, you make good the
Title of the <hi>Text,</hi> and have the Peace
and Comfort of a good Conscience; and
if you do any good by one act, you
bring a great number of Blessings both
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:108689:234"/>
upon your selves and others. For so we
read Jam. V. 20. <hi>Brethren, if any of you
err from the Truth, and one convert them,
let him know, that he that Converts a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
from the Error of his Ways, shall save
a Soul from Death, and cover a multitude
of sins.</hi>

            <p>IT cannot be denied, but that the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
<hi>Christ</hi> gives his Followers are
magnificent and glorious; but then it is
not to flatter, or to puff them up, but
to make them know their Duty. As
he brought the best Religion with him
into the World, so he would have his
Followers distinguish themselves from
the rest of Mankind by something ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.
Those that improve, or
rather abuse the lofty Names which are
given to <hi>Christians,</hi> into self-conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and contempt of others, mistake
their Masters design, and pervert the
hopes of his Commendations. The Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
do no farther belong to them than
they make them good, nor doth the
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:108689:235"/>
Name entitle them to real Happiness,
while that which is signified by it is
wanting. It will serve indeed to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
their future Misery, but cannot
contribute any thing to their Salvation.
God is not taken with outward shews,
and they may stand knocking at Heaven-gate
long enough before the Door is
open'd, that have nothing to plead for
their entring, but that they were <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
<hi>Children.</hi> Here on Earth Men
may be admitted into the <hi>Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi>
because of their Titles of <hi>Dukes,
Earls, Marquesses,</hi> &amp;c. but in the Court
above Men have no respect shewn them,
but such as express'd the Elegies and
Epithets given them by their Actions.
This as it is to be observ'd with respect
to the Title <hi>Christ</hi> gives to his Followers
in the preceding Verse, where he calls
them <hi>the Salt of the Earth,</hi> so it is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to be applied to that which
follows in the Text, where Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
on the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi>
and all <hi>the Lamps of Heaven,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
how beneficial they are to this
nether World, thinks fit to describe and
represent the Manners of his Disciples
by that Simile, <hi>Ye are the Light of the
World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="404" facs="tcp:108689:236"/>
And that you may see what this Title
imports, I shall</p>
            <p>I. Examine the Qualities of <hi>Light;</hi>
and then it will easily appear what Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are implied.</p>
            <p>II. Whether this addition, <hi>Of the
World, Ye are the Light of the World,</hi> hath
any thing of <hi>Emphasis</hi> or Weight in it,
or imports something more than the bare
Title; and of these in order.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>What the qualities of Light are;</hi> and
here to insist only upon such qualities,
which fall under the Cognisance of the
meanest Capacity.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Shining</hi> is the great quality of
<hi>Light,</hi> so <hi>a Christian</hi> is <hi>to shine</hi> in Virtues
and good Works; and what these Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and good Works are, you may see
<hi>Gal.</hi> V. 22, 23. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> I. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Rom.</hi>
XII. 8, 9. and following. Man is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
in a State <hi>of darkness; For ye were
sometime darkness, but now are ye Light
in the Lord,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, Eph.</hi> V. 8.
Not but that unregenerate Men may be
very quick and sagacious in Worldly
concerns, and things relating to their
gain and profit, and thriving in the
World; nay, and may be very great
<hi>Scholars, Philosophers,</hi> and <hi>speculative
Men;</hi> in which sense they may be said
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:108689:236"/>
to have a quick natural Light, but with
respect to real and substantial goodness,
they are in a state <hi>of darkness;</hi> and
though I doubt not, but that in their
<hi>Baptism</hi> they receive some degrees of
spiritual Light; for which reason they
are said to <hi>be enlightned, Heb.</hi> VI. 5. yet
<hi>that Light</hi> as they grow up, we see very
often drown'd by the Vanities and ill
Examples of the World, so that they
sink into <hi>darkness</hi> again, and sometimes
greater darkness than those, who never
heard of the Gospel labour under. But
when <hi>the Light</hi> of God's Grace, and the
Spirit of the <hi>Holy Jesus</hi> irradiates their
Minds, <hi>that Light</hi> which shines within
even in their Understandings, doth and
will certainly break forth, it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be shut up or imprison'd, and
shine without upon their Lives; and
that Shine is nothing but good Works:
And the Sun does not gild the Earth
more, than good Works the outward
Man. <hi>These</hi> adorn the <hi>Christian,</hi> and
are the Splendour of his Life; and they
transfigure him in a manner, as <hi>Christ</hi>
was transfigured on Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> of
whom we read <hi>Luke</hi> IX. 29. <hi>That his
raiment became white and glistering.</hi> Good
Works are a <hi>true Christians</hi> Raiment,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:108689:237"/>
and they are glistering too. They are
so many Stars that spangle that Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and though <hi>the Kings Daughter
be all glorious within,</hi> Psal. XLV. 13. yet
that Glory within is of such force, that
it will shine without; and in this sense
he is truly <hi>changed from Glory to Glory,
even as by the Spirit of our God,</hi> as it is
said 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> III. 18.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Light is of an illuminating Nature;</hi>
it enlightens Houses, Rooms, Caves and
Dens, and an infinite variety of things<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
so a <hi>Christian</hi> must make it his business
to enlighten other Men, those especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
who walk in the dark, are Children
of the Night, and live in sin; for that
is called darkness in Scripture. In our
Converses, Dealings, Business, Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
we meet very ordinarily with
Persons ignorant; and not only igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
but wicked; <hi>for Ignorance is the
Mother of Impiety,</hi> and there is no doubt,
abundance of Men do things odious to
God, and pernicious and destructive to
their own Souls, because they know no
better. We whom God hath enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into greater Knowledge and Purity,
give but a bad Evidence of our being
so, if we do not as occasion and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
serves, endeavour to enlighten
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:108689:237"/>
them into a better sense of things. Bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
in this case is sinful; and where
Nature is backward to the work, it
must be forced by Motives and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
into Courage to discharge this
Duty of our <hi>Christian</hi> Calling, to teach
them better Principles. The Light we
have must be communicative; if it be
not it is painted and counterfeit, not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and genuine; not is this <hi>being a
busie body in other Mens matters and things,</hi>
which do not concern us. Our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
Souls are precious things; in the
saving of which we must not be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;
but resolutely imitate the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> who finding
that <hi>Apollos,</hi> though an eloquent Man,
yet was not throughly instructed in the
Mystery of the Gospel, they took him
unto them, <hi>and expounded to him the way
of God more perfectly,</hi> Acts XVIII. 26.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Light is warming.</hi> The <hi>light</hi> of the
<hi>Sun</hi> is so. So must a <hi>Christian</hi> not only
heat and chafe the Principles of Light
God hath bestow'd upon him, into spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Fervour; but by that Fervour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to warm others into the same
Zeal and Earnestness. This must be one
great end of his Fervour, to attempt to
make others like him. <hi>Lukewarmness</hi> is
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:108689:238"/>
the great Distemper, that the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Christians</hi> who enjoy Ease and
Plenty are sick of. To Cure others of
that Malady is part of our Imployment;
and this we cannot do, except our Love
to God be strong and vehement; where
it is so, and that we love him with all our
Might, we may hope that others, who
see our ardent Desires, will write Copies
after us. This Fervour as it rises upon
Motives drawn from what God hath
done for us, and the particular instances
of his miraculous goodness to us; so if
those Motives be suggested, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to our Neighbours, they may by
the Blessing of God, have the same effect
upon them; at least, we have this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
That we have done what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
us as <hi>Lights.</hi> It was no doubt from
the mighty Zeal that appeared in St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> that the <hi>Galatians</hi> were warmed
into that Fervour, that <hi>if it had been
possible, they would have pluckt out their
own Eyes, and given them unto him,</hi> Gal.
IV. 15.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Light is comfortable:</hi> It comforts
not only the Spirit of Man, but all other
sensitive and vegetable Creatures; so
must a <hi>Christian</hi> comfort others that are
in any trouble, <hi>with that comfort where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:108689:238"/>
himself hath been comforted of God,</hi>
2 Cor. I. 4. This <hi>is pure Religion, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
the Fatherless and Widows in their Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
Jam. I. 27. And when he saith
<hi>Visit,</hi> he means such Visits as are attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with suitable Consolations; and this
we shall be the better able to do, if we
call to mind the Comforts we our selves
have felt, and the Means whereby we
have come to feel them. <hi>This is my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in my affliction; for thy Word hath
quickened me,</hi> Psal. CXIX. 50. The Word
of God affords the richest Comforts; to
which purpose the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> XV. 4.
<hi>That we through Patience and Comfort of
the Scriptures, might have Hope;</hi> so that
acquainting our selves with the Word
of God, containing so many excellent
Examples, and precious Promises, and
making use of that Word in our own
Troubles, we shall be able to Administer
Comfort to others also. A <hi>Christian</hi> is
a Person that imitates <hi>Christ;</hi> not in his
Miracles, not in Raising the Dead, not
in Curing the Lepers, not in Opening
the Eyes of the Blind; but in Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Actions: And we all know what his
Language was to Persons that were in
Distress; <hi>Be of good comfort,</hi> saith he to
the Woman who was troubled with a
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:108689:239"/>
Bloody Issue, <hi>Matth.</hi> IX. 22. so he said
to others; and this was suitable to the
Prophecies which went before of him,
particularly that <hi>Isa.</hi> LXI. 2. where the
Prophet speaking of him, expresly tells
us, That his business would be to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
the acceptable year; and to Comfort
those that Mourn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>Light is Cleansing;</hi> for it clears the
Air of Fogs and Mists. So a <hi>Christian,</hi>
as much as in him lies, is to cleanse his
Neighbour from that Filthiness which
sticks to him: And as this is to be done
by gentle Reproofs, mingled with Pity
and Compassion; so if those Reproofs
light upon a Person of Ingenuity, it will
be taken as a Kindness, and prove an
<hi>excellent Oyl;</hi> which as it doth not <hi>break
the Head,</hi> so it very often breaks the
Heart; not into Despair, but Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
not to Destruction, but Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Psal.</hi> CXLI. 5.</p>
            <p>This Cleansing the Apostle aim'd at,
when he said, <hi>Eph.</hi> V. 11. <hi>Have no Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
with the unfruitful Works of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but rather Reproach them:</hi> And he
calls the Sins of others, <hi>Works of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
with Allusion to <hi>the Light</hi> of <hi>Reproof;</hi>
which he thought would be the most
likely way to dispel them: And <hi>a Light</hi>
               <pb n="411" facs="tcp:108689:239"/>
it is, which very often shines into the
Heart, and inlightens the inward Man,
and dissipates the wrong Notions Men
had of Religion, and which makes them
<hi>come to themselves again;</hi> as it is said
<hi>Luke</hi> XV. 17.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Light is directing;</hi> so it is to the
Traveller that hath lost his way in the
Night. So a <hi>Christian</hi> seeing his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
go astray, what should he do, but
direct him into the good way? He is
bound to do so much to his Neighbours
<hi>Ass or Ox</hi> by virtue of that Law of
Equity <hi>Deut.</hi> XXII. 1. and what! not
use the same Civility to his <hi>Neighbours
Soul? Doth God take care of Oxen,</hi> and
not of the Souls of Men? But here it is
to be noted, that this Duty of directing
others, hath respect not only to errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Opinions in Matters of Religion,
but to erroneous Practices too. If
the Errour in Opinion be an Errour
of no great Consequence, it's not
worth while to take pains to rectifie
his Mistake; but the erroneous Practices
are more dangerous. And this was the
Duty intended in the preceding Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,
<hi>Ye are the Salt of the Earth;</hi> and it
is reinforced in this <hi>of Light,</hi> to shew it
is not a thing indifferent. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:108689:240"/>
being doubled, and reiterated, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
the great necessity, and the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
importance of this Act of Charity,
and God's peremptory Will. And as our
own good Example is one part of this
Direction, so our Advice and Counsel
is another; to which purpose St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
Gal. VI. 1, 2. <hi>Brethren, if any Man be
overtaken in a fault, ye which are Spiritual
restore such a one in the spirit of Meekness;
considering thy self, lest thou also be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Bear ye one anothers burden, and so
fulfil the Law of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus explain'd the qualities
of Light, and shewn what Duties are
required in the similitude, let us</p>
            <p>II. Enquire, whether this addition
in the Text, <hi>of the World, Ye are the Light
of the World,</hi> makes the Command more
Emphatical; and the Duty of being
Beneficial to others in spiritual Concerns
more Extensive. And to this I must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
in the Affirmative; for <hi>as the Light
of the World is the Sun,</hi> so we know</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That the Sun Shines at all Seasons,</hi>
Spring and Fall, Winter and Summer.
So a <hi>Christians</hi> good Works and Virtues,
are to Shine not only in Adversity, but
Prosperity too; not only in the Winter
of Affliction, but also in the Summer of
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:108689:240"/>
Ease and Plenty; both in the Spring of
his Years, and in the Fall of his Age.
His doing Good must not be confined
to a certain Time, or to a certain Stage
of his Life, such as Sickness, or a Death-bed;
but discover it self in the various
Conditions God hath placed him in. His
Goodness must not Shine by fits. Being
inconstant, it betrays its weak Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and when either a ruffling Wind
can blow it away, or the Sun melt it as
Wax, its a sign it did not fall from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Sun shines in all Places,</hi> in all
Parts of the <hi>Hemisphere;</hi> so a <hi>Christians</hi>
Goodness must shine and display its
Glory in all Companies, and Places too.
He must not with <hi>Peter,</hi> Eat with the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> and withdraw himself when
those of the Circumcision come in; must
not only maintain his strict Obedience
to the Gospel, when he is in Company
with mean, little, and inconsiderable
People; but even in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Family; not
only when it is safe to do it, but also
when he is in danger of losing by it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Credit, or Place, or Estate;
not only in private, but in publick too;
not only in <hi>Gethsemane,</hi> but in the <hi>High
Priests</hi> Palace too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="414" facs="tcp:108689:241"/>
3. <hi>The Sun, the Light of the World,
shines upon all sorts of Men and Things,</hi>
good and bad; Dunghills as well as
Gardens and Vineyards, participate of
his Shine and Splendour. So a <hi>Christian</hi>
is to bestow his pains in illuminating
and warming others, not only on the
tractable, and such as are easily wrought
upon, but even on the stubborn and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate;
and not only on those who have
already made some progress in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but on such too who are very bad,
and wholly destitute of the Life of God,
and Plough the barren Rock as well as
the kinder Soil. This makes his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
truly <hi>Catholick</hi> and Universal, and
in that resembles <hi>the Light of the World,</hi>
or the Sun exactly, which gives Life to
the Wormwood as well as to the Rose,
to the Thorn as well as to the Lilly, and
influences both the Thistle and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender.</p>
            <div type="inferences">
               <head>Inferences.</head>
               <p>1. <hi>Ye are the Light of the World.</hi> Though
this is spoken to all <hi>Christians,</hi> yet it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the <hi>Ministers of the Gospel</hi> in a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
manner. <hi>Light!</hi> How pure is it!
And how pure ought their Lives to be,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:108689:241"/>
that are to Light others to Heaven! <hi>If
those Lights be Darkness, how great must
be that Darkness!</hi> If their Lives be spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with any scandalous Sin or Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
what deformed Creatures must
they be! If they Preach one thing, and
Practise another, how <hi>uncertain</hi> must the
<hi>Sound of those Trumpets be; and who shall
prepare himself to Battel?</hi> If they that
are the Guides go astray, how shall the
Blind find their way to <hi>Paradise?</hi> If the
Sin against which they Thunder be found
in their Skirts, what hope is there that
their Hearers and Disciples should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>Wise unto Salvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If by their Holy Lives and Doctrine
they Convert many unto Righteousness,
<hi>they shall shine as the Stars in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
But if by their ill Example they
Light others into the Chambers of Hell,
<hi>they shall Shine too,</hi> but <hi>in the Flames of
the burning Lake;</hi> and there learn, that
<hi>the Servant who knew his Masters Will, and
did it not, shall be beaten with many Stripes.</hi>
To be a Minister of the Gospel, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than to be in Orders; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more, than to have a Living or
Preferment in the Church; something
more, than to perform the Offices pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by the <hi>Canons,</hi> and Law of the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:108689:242"/>
Land. Doing good must not only be
their Work, but Delight and Pleasure
too. Their Splendour lies not <hi>in shining
Dignities,</hi> but in <hi>fleeing youthful Lusts,</hi>
becoming Patterns of Virtue to those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Charge, and <hi>following Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
Faith, Charity, and Peace with all
them that call on the Lord with a pure heart,</hi>
2 Tim. II. 22.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Ye are the Light of the World.</hi> Then
surely, those who are in love with works
of Darkness, are no <hi>Christians.</hi> What
the works of Darkness are, you will find
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> III. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>This know also, that
in the last days perilous times shall come;
for men shall be lovers of themselves, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
proud, boasters, blasphemers, disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to Parents, unthankful, unholy, trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
heady, high-minded, lovers of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
more than lovers of God; and having
a form of Godliness, but denying the power
thereof.</hi> They that are in love with any
of these Works, can be no <hi>Christians;</hi>
for the fundamental Law of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is <hi>to depart from iniquity, 2 Tim.</hi> II.
19. There is scarce any similitude which
is more frequently made use of to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
a Life of Holiness, or a new Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
by, than <hi>Light;</hi> and Sin, or love
to it, is as frequently represented by
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:108689:242"/>
                  <hi>Darkness;</hi> for in this love to a sinful
course, the mind is darken'd, and hath
no right apprehensions of God, or of
the Life to come, or of the dreadful
Consequences of neglecting so great
Salvation, no right Apprehensions of the
Love of God, or of the Sufferings of
<hi>Christ;</hi> or the Apprehensions are not
bright, not brisk, not lively, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing,
not operative, as <hi>Light</hi> is, and
ought to be. The Flesh and the World
oppress the Mind, or fill it with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
Notions of Religion; which is a
sign the Spirit of God, that Spirit of
Life and <hi>Light,</hi> finds no entertainment
there, and therefore here can be <hi>no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity;</hi>
for true <hi>Christianity</hi> and God's
enlightening and sanctifying Spirit, go
together. <hi>Christianity</hi> makes us the Sons
of God; and whoever are <hi>the Sons of
God, are led by the Spirit of God,</hi> Rom.
viii. 14.</p>
               <p>As many of you as are enamoured
with any of the aforesaid sins, or any
other; and surely you are enamour'd
with them, when all the Charms of the
Love of God, cannot oblige you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from them, mince it, and qualifie it
as you will, <hi>you walk in darkness at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi>
and <hi>the God of this World blinds your
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:108689:243"/>
Eyes,</hi> which hinders you from effectual
believing, and keeps out the glorious
Light of the Gospel of <hi>Christ</hi> from shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
into, and warming your Hearts:
And what these Works of Darkness, if
cherish'd, tend to, and will end in, you
may easily know, if you will but consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what you have so often heard, that
there is such a place as <hi>outward darkness,
where shall be howling, and gnashing of
teeth,</hi> Matth. XXV. 30.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Ye are the Light of the World.</hi>
Light is not defiled by shining upon
Dunghills. No more must you, who
pretend to be enlighten'd by the Gospel
of our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ</hi> in this adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and sinful generation. Whatever
ill examples you behold, whatever vain
Company you light into, whatever vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
you see abroad, that must be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to you, your Souls must not he
defiled, nor your Minds darken'd by
such Spectacles. Your business is to
keep your selves pure, as <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom.</hi>
A multitude that does Evil, is no Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
for you to follow; for you have
heard, that <hi>the way which leads to perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is broad, and many there be that walk
in it.</hi> Numbers in sin, must be no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to do after their ungodly Deeds.
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:108689:243"/>
Among these you are <hi>to shine as Lights
in the World.</hi> While you preserve your
goodness, your Light is preserved, and
your Candle continues burning; when
that decays, your Light decays; and
should <hi>a Cry be made at midnight, Behold
the Bridegroom comes;</hi> in what Condition
will you be when <hi>your Lamps are gone
out?</hi> The Light that is soon extinguish'd
by the circumambient Darkness which
surrounds you, is a counterfeit Light.
It comes not from the Father of Lights,
nor is it a genuine Beam of the Sun of
Righteousness; for <hi>whosoever is born of
God doth not commit sin,</hi> i. e. so as to
make a trade of it, or to yield to a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of it; for <hi>his seed remains in him, and
he cannot sin because he is born of God,</hi>
1 Joh. III. 9.</p>
               <p>Ill Examples must make your Light
burn the brighter; and the greater
Wickedness you are incompass'd with,
the higher must your Zeal rise; and by
this the World must be taught, that
there is something in you which is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the World; and that in despight
of all the Miseries which befall good Men
in this World, <hi>Verily there is a Reward
for the Righteous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="420" facs="tcp:108689:244"/>
IV. <hi>Ye are the Light of the World.</hi>
When you behold the Light of the
World, what should you do, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
your Duty, which is <hi>to walk as
Children of Light.</hi> Can you complain
of want of Remembrancers and Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
when the Light of every Day puts
you in mind, what manner of persons
you ought to be? When you see the Sun
shining upon you, is not this an Item,
how you are to warm others by your
blameless Conversation? When the Light
breaks in, and displays its Glory in your
Chambers in a Morning, is not this a
silent admonition, how you are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
your selves that day? Even like
<hi>the Children of God, without rebuke; and
to walk honestly as in the day, not in riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and drunkenness, not in chambering and
wantonness, not in strife and envy; for
they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they
that be drunken, are drunken in the night,
but let us who are of the day be sober, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on the breast-plate of Faith and Love;
and for a helmet, the hope of Salvation,</hi>
1 Thes. V. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>This is the Wisdom of God, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
our Duty by things which incur
into our Senses, are familiar and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and which we daily behold; that
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:108689:244"/>
looking upon those Objects, we might
remember what we are called to, what
we are design'd for, and what our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
requires at our hands. Light must
make us reflect upon the Light of Grace
and Holiness, and put us upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
what Footsteps of the Grace of
God appear in us; and upon Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to walk worthy of the Name which
is given us; and so to guide our Thoughts,
and Words, and Actions, that by what
we do in the World, our Neighbours,
and those who behold our Conversation,
may be edified and encouraged to lay
hold on Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>V. <hi>Ye are the Light of the World.</hi> And
God hath given you a Light to walk by,
which is his Holy Word; for <hi>thy Word
is a Lamp unto my Feet, and a Light unto
my Paths,</hi> saith <hi>David,</hi> Psal. CXIX. 105.
By this Light you are <hi>to try the Spirits,
whether they be of God; for many false
Prophets are gone out into the World.</hi> There
are Men abroad, that <hi>teach for Doctrines</hi>
the <hi>Commandments</hi> and Traditions <hi>of
Men:</hi> Men that will tell you, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
you are in Communion with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Prelate, who exalts himself above all
that is called God,</hi> even above <hi>Kings</hi> and
<hi>Princes,</hi> you cannot be saved; Men that
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:108689:245"/>
will tell you, that you must Pray to
<hi>Saints,</hi> and implore the Intercession of
the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> and hear <hi>Mass,</hi> and
believe against Sense and Reason, that
Bread is <hi>Flesh;</hi> that you must hear Mass,
and Prayers <hi>you understand not;</hi> and be
content to be deprived of the comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Cup in the <hi>Holy Sacrament.</hi> There
are others that talk much of Religion,
and yet are great Strangers to the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
Virtues of Meekness, and Charity,
and not only confine the Favour of God
to a <hi>certain Party,</hi> but would straiten
yours too, and place Religion more in
talking against <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> than in the
greater and <hi>weightier matters of the Law.</hi>
And abundance of other false Teachers
and Doctrines you may meet withall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad;
for lets do what we can, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
will <hi>sow Tares among the Wheat;</hi> but
the way not to be deceived by such false
Fires, is to examin them by the clear Light
of the Word of God. <hi>To the Law, and to
the Testimony; if they speak not according to
this Word, there is no Light in them.</hi> By
this Light you may find out not only
erroneous Opinions, but sinful Works
and Practices too; not only in others,
but in your selves also. Take but a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
view of your Actions, Designs,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:108689:245"/>
Aims, Principles, Behaviour, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses;
by this noble Light, and those
spots and blemishes of your Souls which
before you took no notice of, will stare
in your Faces. This will soon tell you,
what Rocks, what Shelves, what Sands
you are to shun; for <hi>we have a sure word
of Prophecy, whereunto ye do well to take
heed as unto a Light shining in a dark place,
until the day dawn, and the morning star
arise in your Hearts,</hi> 2 Pet. I. 19.</p>
               <p>VI. <hi>Ye are the Light of the World.</hi> But
what? is no good <hi>Christian</hi> in darkness?
Do we not see many excellent Persons,
who dread Sin as Hell it self, yet see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of <hi>the Light of God's Countenance?</hi>
Its very true. There are such Persons,
and yet for all this, <hi>they are Light in the
Lord.</hi> They have the Light of <hi>Holiness</hi>
in them, though they have not the Light
of <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Gladness.</hi> They are made
partakers of the Divine Nature, and
therefore must have Light in them;
and such Light, as will at last light them
to Heaven: But through strong Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
or some fatal Distempers, it
comes to pass, that the Light they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
is clouded, and hindred from <hi>going
on to a perfect day;</hi> and they carry it as
it were in a <hi>dark Lanthorn.</hi> But all I
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:108689:246"/>
shall say to such at this time, is what
God bids the Prophet proclaim in the
Ears of Persons under such Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
<hi>Isa.</hi> L. 10. <hi>Who is among you that
fears the Lord, that obeys the Voice of his
Servant, that walks in darkness, and sees
no light? Let him trust in the Name of
the Lord, and stay upon his God.</hi> Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Counsel! In the midst of all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
darkness, clouds, and shadows
of Death, let them even resolve to
depend upon God's Mercy and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and rest there whatever comes
of it; and though they can give no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for so doing, yet let them fix here,
and upon this Resolution; <hi>If I perish,
I will perish</hi> in the <hi>hopes of God's
Mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While the Light of Holiness shines
and burns in them, there is that in
them which will secure their Title
to the Enjoyment of God's everlasting
Light.</p>
               <p>Light will mingle with Light, and
the Light of the Love of God in the
Soul on this side Heaven, by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Tendency, must necessarily at last
terminate in, and be united to him,
who <hi>dwelleth in a Light which no mortal
Man can approach unto.</hi> For <hi>with thee
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:108689:246"/>
O Lord, is the Fountain of Light, and
in thy Light shall we see Light. Lift
thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon
us, and we shall be safe.</hi>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>St. Matth. Ch. V. Ver. 14.</bibl>
               <q>A City set upon a Hill cannot be hid.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN these Words, <hi>our Saviour</hi> prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes
his Design in the preceding
Characters, he had given of his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Followers. He had called them
<hi>the Salt of the Earth,</hi> and <hi>the Light of the
World,</hi> and these Characters he illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
and inlarges upon, not only in
the <hi>Text,</hi> but in the two Verses follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
He had told them, that their Lives
must be Exemplary, their Conversation
Edifying, and their Actions such, as
might serve both to reform and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
others; to this he adds another <hi>simile,
ye are,</hi> saith he, and God expects, and
intends, you should be <hi>like a City set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Hill;</hi> now, a City set upon a Hill,
<hi>cannot be hid,</hi> i. e. Men will take notice
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:108689:247"/>
of you, as they do of <hi>a City seated upon a
Hill;</hi> if your Lives are not according to
the rules of my Gospel, your <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and Discipleship will soon be seen
through, and you will quickly betray
your <hi>Hypocrisy:</hi> Your business is, to own
and profess the Truth in the Face of
the Sun, and by your conformity to
my holy Laws, to let the World see,
that you are of the same Mind and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and Temper, that <hi>I am of: Cities</hi>
are conspicuous, all Men that pass by
them, look upon them; especially, if
they be <hi>set on a Hill,</hi> so the Eyes of the
World are, and will be upon you; and
it will soon appear, what manner of
Spirit you are of. Let it be therefore
your care, so to behave your selves, that
those who look upon you, and observe
your deportment, may be convinc'd,
that you do not profess one thing and
practise another.</p>
            <p>This is the natural Sense and Design
of our Saviour's Expression here, as will
appear to any one that shall examine
the Drift and Scope of <hi>Christ</hi> in this <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
on the Mount,</hi> and the antecedent,
and consequent Passages. But because
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> lays a great stress
upon this Place, and makes use of it to
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:108689:248"/>
prove the <hi>perpetual visibility of their Church,</hi>
I must necessarily discover to you the
Vanity of that pretence, before I draw
any Inferences from this Passage, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
you, how to govern your Lives
and Actions according to the import of
this <hi>Similitude;</hi> not that I am fond of
<hi>controversy,</hi> or love to insult over a <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Religion;</hi> but the Subject lies in my
way, and to balk it, would look like
betraying the <hi>noble Cause,</hi> we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoused,
built upon the <hi>eternal Pillars</hi>
of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The pretence therefore is this: <q>It
must be granted say they, that <hi>the
Church of Christ must have been visible
in all Ages;</hi> for it is <hi>a City set upon a
Hill,</hi> which cannot be hid; and there
is no reason it should, for how should
<hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> be converted to
the Faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> if the Church
which must teach them that Faith,
were not visible. If it had lain hid
and obscure in the World for several
Ages, confined to Caves and Dens, to
Corners and Deserts, as you <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
pretend, <hi>Christ</hi> must have
miss'd of his Design, which was by
the conspicuousness of his Church to
draw Unbelievers into the bosom of it.
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:108689:248"/>
Now it's evident, that the <hi>Church of
Rome</hi> hath been <hi>visible</hi> in all Ages,
conspicuous and splendid for many
Centuries together, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption;
<hi>yours</hi> never began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
till <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
VIII. made it <hi>visible;</hi> therefore the
<hi>Church of Rome</hi> must be the <hi>true Church,</hi>
and yours <hi>the false,</hi> because it hath
not been <hi>visible</hi> in all Ages.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Pretence, and now let us
briefly consider the Weakness and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity of it.</p>
            <p>1. Whatever may be said for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<hi>visibility of Christ</hi>'s <hi>Church,</hi> it is
plain, that from this <hi>Text</hi> it cannot be
proved; for <hi>Christ</hi> doth not speak here
of his Followers considered <hi>as a Church,</hi>
or a body of Men united under their
Pastors in the Profession of the Doctrin
of the Gospel; and in the Use and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of the Sacraments of the
<hi>New Testament;</hi> but of every individual
Disciple considered <hi>as a Christian,</hi> and a
follower of <hi>Christ</hi> to teach him how he
ought to live and behave himself in the
World to the Edification of others. And
this is evident, from the Virtues of
Meekness, and Humility and Patience,
and Peaceableness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> press'd in the
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:108689:249"/>
foregoing Verses, which are things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining
to every private <hi>Christian;</hi>
and this saying, you are <hi>a City set on a
Hill, which cannot be hid,</hi> is spoken to
the very same Persons, of whom the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
Virtues are required. So that
these Words relate to <hi>a Christian Duty;</hi>
not to the <hi>State,</hi> or <hi>Condition,</hi> or <hi>Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,</hi>
or <hi>visibility</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Church.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>2. Suppose they do relate to <hi>Christ</hi>'s
<hi>Church,</hi> considered <hi>as a Church,</hi> they must
necessarily relate to <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>universal
Church;</hi> for here is no particular Church
mention'd. <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>universal Church</hi> of
all Ages, Nations, Countrys may he
called <hi>a City,</hi> as it is in other places sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>a Body;</hi> for as <hi>a City</hi> is made up of
various Buldings, and as <hi>a Body</hi> consists
of many Members, so <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>universal
Church</hi> consists of many <hi>particular Churches</hi>
which make up that <hi>great City,</hi> and that
vast Body, and if these. Words relate to
<hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>universal Church,</hi> how can they
be applied to a <hi>particular,</hi> and especially
to the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> more then to the
Church of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> or <hi>Greece,</hi> or <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi>
and how absurd must be the
Consequence. The universal Church
of <hi>Christ,</hi> is a <hi>City set upon a Hill,</hi> which
cannot be hid; therefore the <hi>Church of
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:108689:249"/>
Rome</hi> is <hi>that Church,</hi> or therefore the
<hi>Church of Rome</hi> is <hi>that City?</hi> It's true,
they call themselves the <hi>Vniversal</hi> or
<hi>Catholick</hi> Church, so did the <hi>Donatists</hi>
of old; but what doth calling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so signify when it is evident, and
clear as the Sun at Noon, that <hi>the Church
of Rome</hi> is but a <hi>particular Church?</hi> There
were Churches in the World before <hi>the
Church of Rome</hi> was heard of, and there
are at this Day, and have been all along
Churches which may Vye with the
<hi>Church of Rome</hi> for Antiquity and Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and though they may not be able
to boast of the same outward Splendor,
Plenty and Prosperity, yet what is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Splendor and Prosperity to <hi>a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church,</hi> when in Scripture it is
made the Character of wicked Men,
more then of those who will live godly
in <hi>Christ Jesus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. We do not deny, that <hi>the Church
of Christ</hi> hath been <hi>visible;</hi> so far from it,
that we believe it to have been <hi>visible</hi>
in all Ages; indeed some of our Divines
talk of a <hi>visible</hi> and <hi>invisible Church,</hi> but
when they do so, they consider the
Church, as we consider a Man, who
consists of two Parts, a Body and a Soul,
the Body is <hi>visible,</hi> the Soul <hi>invisible,</hi> so
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:108689:250"/>
it is with the Church, the outward So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
in which true and sincere Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
live, is the <hi>Body,</hi> and that's <hi>visible,</hi>
the sincere Believers are the <hi>Soul</hi> of that
Body, and they are, and must be <hi>invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
being known only to God, the
searcher of Hearts; but the outward
Society, which profess the Faith of
<hi>Christ,</hi> and which is the <hi>Body</hi> wherein
that <hi>Soul</hi> lives, is, and hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<hi>visible;</hi> and that which makes it
so, is the Profession of the Fundamental
Principles of <hi>Christianity,</hi> contain'd in
the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> and understood in
that Sense, that the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church
understood them in; this makes and
constitutes a <hi>Christian Church,</hi> and there
is none but must grant that these Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Principles of <hi>Christianity</hi> have
been <hi>visible</hi> in all Ages, even in times of
the greatest Persecution, even in the
midst of <hi>Arianism,</hi> and consequently
the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> hath been <hi>visible</hi> in
all Ages, and shall continue so to the
end of the World; and though in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Churches for some Ages toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these Fundamental Principles of
<hi>Christianity</hi> have been mingled with
many accidental Errours, Superstitions
and Idolatries; yet still so far as these
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:108689:250"/>
Fundamental Principles have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the respective Churches, so
far the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<hi>visible,</hi> as a sound Egg swiming in
a filthy, nasty, stinking Pool of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is <hi>visible</hi> notwithstanding the Filth,
which surrounds it, and therefore as
sickly and corrupt as the Church might
be in some Ages, the essentials of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi>
being every where retain'd, <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
and <hi>Infidels</hi> had still Opportunity
and Motives to joyn themselves to it,
for in these Principles and the Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them it was visible. So that,</p>
            <p>4. To that common impertinent Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>Where was your Church before Luther,
Calvin, or Henry</hi> VIII? The answer is
this. <hi>It was all the Christian World over,</hi>
even in all the <hi>Christian</hi> Societies that
were either in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> or <hi>Egypt,</hi> or
<hi>Africa,</hi> or <hi>Asia,</hi> or <hi>Greece,</hi> or <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
or <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or <hi>Antioch,</hi> or in
<hi>Muscovy,</hi> and even in the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> her self; for since we profess the
same Faith, or the same Fundamental
Principles of <hi>Christianity,</hi> which were
profess'd in all these Churches all along,
our Church must necessarily have been
in all those Churches where those Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Principles were Retain'd and
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:108689:251"/>
Professed; so that it is in vain to urge
that our Church was <hi>not visible</hi> two
hundred Years ago; for it's enough
that the universal Church of <hi>Christ</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<hi>visible,</hi> I mean the Church of
<hi>Christ</hi> dispers'd through the four Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the World. This will be always
some where, and God will never suffer
it to decay, according to his Promise,
<hi>Matth.</hi> XVI. <hi>that the Gates of Hell shall
not prevail against it.</hi> As for particular
Churches, they may either become <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible</hi>
by being destroy'd, or become
<hi>visible</hi> whenever they appear in the
World, and hold the same Catholick
Faith that the universal Church holds;
but from thence it follows not, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these particular Churches which
have been destroy'd, or which rise at
such a time, be it sooner or later, are
no true Churches: As to particular
Churches which decay, it's evident
that the Churches of <hi>Africa,</hi> of <hi>Carthage,
Hippo, Numidia,</hi> where St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> St.
<hi>Austin,</hi> St. <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> and other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Bishops govern'd, are totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd,
but no Man will therefore say
that they were no true Churches, when
they were in being; and as to Churches
which are of no long standing, their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:108689:251"/>
of a late Plantation or Erection doth
not make them false Churches, else the
<hi>Church of Rome</hi> her self would be in an
ill case; for the Churches they pretend
to have erected in <hi>China,</hi> and in other
Eastern parts of the World, are not
much above a Hundred years Standing,
yet they will not think them false
Churches, because their Plantation is
late and they cannot boast of many
Hundred years continuance. So that
the Faith a Church holds must be the
great Standart to judge by both of the
Truth and Visibility of it; where the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
Fundamental Principles of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi>
are retain'd, professed, Preacht and
Maintain'd there the Church is <hi>visible,</hi>
and consequently the Church of Christ
hath been <hi>visible</hi> in all Ages; for in one
part of the World or other, those Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Principles have been Profess'd
and Retained from the beginning of
Christianity unto this Day, and if a
Church appear'd but yesterday, it hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these Fundamental Principles, the
Pillars and Foundations of Truth, it
would be a true Church and <hi>Visible,</hi> and
consequently hath been <hi>visible</hi> in those
Churches where the same Truths have
been Profess'd; and had the Church of
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:108689:252"/>
               <hi>England</hi> been raised but Forty or Fifty
years agon, that would not make her
either a false or invisible Church; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she retains the Principles on which
Christianity is founded. But,</p>
            <p>5. Lest any Person should infer from
this Discourse, that since the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> hath been visible for many Ages,
as well as other Churches; and hath
retain'd, and doth retain to this Day
the Fundamental Principles of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
there is no reason to separate our
selves from her, or to leave her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:
I answer, were it possible in
that Church to eat only of the wholsome
Fruit she hath kept and preserv'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Participating of the Poison she hath
added to it, or mingled with it, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
might be pleaded for continuing
in that Communion: But that's impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
now, as the Case stands. <hi>Of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren</hi>
that are <hi>Baptiz'd</hi> in that Church, and
<hi>Baptiz'd only into the Faith deliver'd in
the Apostles Creed, and die before they come
to be of Age, we cannot but entertain a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Opinion:</hi> But for the <hi>adult,</hi> and
Persons who are of years of Discretion
that joyn with that Church, It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
they cannot be Members of that
Church, except they swallow the <hi>Rats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane</hi>
               <pb n="437" facs="tcp:108689:252"/>
as well as <hi>the Milk,</hi> the unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
as well as the wholsome Food;
especially since the Confession of <hi>Pope
Pius</hi> IV. and the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi>
which hath made the monstrous Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Mass, Transubstantiation, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of Saints, worshiping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Purgatory, Indulgences, seven Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
the Belief of human Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the same <hi>necessity to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
that the Incarnation of the Son of
God is. They do indeed retain the
Foundation of Christianity; but then
they have added also Fundamental Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
which every Christian who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
God more then Men, is bound
to abhor; and since it is impossible at
once to abhor them, and to continue in
Communion with that Church, it must
necessarily follow, that <hi>Separating from
it is a Duty;</hi> and a Duty, as much as
our life is worth. But,</p>
            <p>6. Though with respect to the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Principles of Christianity, we
grant the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for many Ages, as well as other
Churches, yet in regard of those <hi>additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Articles</hi> I mention'd just now, if the
Doctrin makes a Church visible, we must
with very great Assurance affirm, that
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:108689:253"/>
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not been vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
in all Ages; for it will appear to
any impartial Considerer, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Doctrins which they have added to
the old Foundation were neither taught
in the primitive Church for the first
three Hundred years after Christ, nor
even in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her self a
Thousand years ago. Not in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church; for in all the genuine
Writers of the first <hi>three Hundred years,</hi>
we find not a Word of <hi>Invocation of
Saints,</hi> of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> of <hi>Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Images,</hi> of <hi>religious Veneration of
Relicks,</hi> or of the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> much less of her <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility.</hi>
Nay, for a Thousand years
after Christ the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> never
had the Boldness to call her self <hi>Infallible,</hi>
not till <hi>Hildebrand</hi>'s time, or <hi>Pope Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
VII. by the Confession of some
<hi>Romanists,</hi> a Monster of Pride and Vice:
He was the first that gave himself and
his Church that pompous and ridiculous
Title.</p>
            <p>And as I said, the present Doctrins of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> added to the Creed,
and made Articles of Faith, were not
believed, much less look'd upon as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Articles, even in the Church of
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:108689:253"/>
               <hi>Rome</hi> her self, a Thousand years ago,
I mean in the time of <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> the
First; the Doctrins which are visible in
that Church now were not visible then;
for in that <hi>Gregory</hi>'s time the Sacrament
was administred to the Laity in both
kinds; Worshiping of Images was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
abominable; the Title of <hi>Vniversal
Bishop</hi> was thought <hi>Antichristian; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Masses,</hi> where the <hi>Priest</hi> only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
and communicates were reputed
<hi>unlawful;</hi> the Books of the <hi>Maccabees</hi>
were not taken into the <hi>Canon; Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>
was not yet lick'd into a perfect
Shape, much less into <hi>an Article of Faith;</hi>
No <hi>Masses</hi> were yet said, for <hi>the Dead</hi>
to deliver Souls from that Fire; <hi>Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
confession,</hi> and <hi>extreme Vnction,</hi>
were not yet made <hi>Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c.
And therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> could
not possibly be <hi>visible</hi> in all Ages, since
her Doctrins she now Professes were not
profess'd, no not by her own Members
in all Ages.</p>

It follows therefore, that a hidden Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is no Piety. I mean where a Person
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:108689:254"/>
thinks it enough to Worship God in his
Chamber or Closet and to pay him due
respect in private, and when he comes
abroad into Company, vain, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and wicked, doth as they do, dares
not, or will not own his pious Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
but conceals his better Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and love of God, and makes no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of it, either by disliking the
Sins he sees, or by dreading to imitate
them, or by vindicating the truth of
the Gospel, I say, this Piety must needs
be counterfeit and nought; for it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Character Christ gives of his
Disciples and Followers, and in calling
them a <hi>City set upon a Hill, which cannot
be hid;</hi> and besides this is <hi>to be ashamed of
him and of his Gospel before Men;</hi> and
how he resents that, and will resent it
in the last Day, you may read <hi>Matth.</hi> X.
32, 33. <hi>Mark</hi> VIII. 38. I do not deny
that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> and <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi>
were Disciples of Christ, but <hi>secretly for
fear of the Jews,</hi> Joh. XIX. 38. But,</p>
               <p>1. Though they were no open Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours,
yet they consented not to the
Impiety of the <hi>Jews</hi> in traducing and
slandering the <hi>Lord Jesus.</hi> Their Blood
rose to hear him abused, and in the
midst of all their Fears, we find very
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:108689:254"/>
notable Effects of their Zeal for his
Cause and Person. Of <hi>Nicodemus</hi> we
read <hi>Joh.</hi> VII. 10, 11. that when the
whole Counsel was for condemning
Christ to Death, the brave Man stood
up and argued with them, <hi>Doth our
Law judge a Man before it hear him, and
know what he doth?</hi> And of <hi>Joseph</hi> St.
<hi>Luke</hi> reports, that <hi>he consented not to the
Counsel and Deed</hi> of the barbarous Men,
who judged him Guilty of Death, <hi>Luke</hi>
XXIII. 11. And St. <hi>Mark</hi> adds, that he
<hi>went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the
Body of Jesus,</hi> Mark XV. 43. But,</p>
               <p>2. Though these two Men were fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and had no great courage to assert
their Love and Devotion to Christ o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly,
yet it was at a time when they
were not throughly instructed in the
<hi>Mystery of the Gospel.</hi> The case alter'd
when they came to have a more perfect
knowledge of it, and then not all the
rage of <hi>Tyrants,</hi> not all the Tumults the
<hi>Jews</hi> could raise, nor all the Terrours
of <hi>Pilate</hi> could hinder them from own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Love to his Doctrin and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
We live in the broad Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and therefore must
not take example by Men who were
<hi>Novices in Christianity,</hi> and while they
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:108689:255"/>
were so. For us to be one thing at
home, and another abroad; Pious when
alone, Wicked when we do converse;
devout within the Walls of our Horses,
and profane and loose in Company,
which can bear no Strictness; this is
notoriously to dissemble with God, and
to be False and Treacherous to him.
What? Caress a Friend and hug him
in a Corner, and revile, or not to know
him in Society? Such baseness among
Men is counted abominable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cannot be supposed to be very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
when the same Affront is offered
to God, nor will your private Serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
stand you in any stead in that Day,
when your Souls must give an account
of their Behaviour before Men. <hi>A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
must be a Man of Courage, and
when he is to do a known Duty, not all
the Threatnings and Comminations of
cruel Men, not all the hopes of Gain,
not all the baits of Profit, not all the
fears of losing his Honour, Credit or
Life, must deter him from it; for let
come what will come of it; the Life to
come, which is, and must be his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Treasure, will make infinite Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
for all his Losses.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="443" facs="tcp:108689:255"/>
II. <hi>A City set on a Hill cannot be hid;</hi>
This shews that an active Life, or a
Life of Society and Converse is a much
nobler Life, than a Life solitary and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
from the World. I will not deny
that a solitary Life hath its Advantages,
and he that separates himself from
Temptations, is not very likely to be
enticed by them: Yet still it is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Act of Virtue, and more <hi>Christian like</hi>
to be good in the midst of all the enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Pleasures of the World.</p>
               <p>There is indeed greater Difficulty in
it, but then the Virtue is greater, and
the Fruit sweeter, and the Reward will
be Proportionable. The Solitary good
Man saves himself; but he that is Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
in Society is in a way <hi>of saving
both himself and those that see him.</hi> In so
wicked an Age as this is, good Men
had need shew themselves to the World,
to do something toward the Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Reformation of it: And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt some good they do; and
though it is to be wisht, that the World
were better, yet that it is not worse,
they are beholding to such Examples,
which shews that some good is done by
their Living and Conversing in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="444" facs="tcp:108689:256"/>
III. Were I to speak to <hi>Princes,</hi> to
the <hi>Nobles,</hi> to the <hi>Gentry</hi> of the Nation,
to <hi>Magistrates, Ministers,</hi> and to <hi>men in
Authority;</hi> this should be my <hi>Text.</hi> All
such Persons, who make some Figure
in the World are like <hi>a City set upon a Hill;</hi>
to such the nether World, the Plebeians,
the Commonalty, and the Ordinary sort
of People look up. Their Example they
take Notice of, and these Examples they
Ordinarily follow. I would tell them,
that as God hath raised them above the
Common level, so God expects they
should be eminent in Goodness, and be
as much above all Vice, as they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the common Rank. I would tell
them, <hi>that their Sins are spreading,</hi> and
like the Plague destroy whole Cities and
Towns. I would tell them, that in this
Case they are more Barbarous than the
Tyrants Mankind cries out upon, for
they lay several mens Consciences waste
by their ill Practices, which is more
than <hi>sacking Towns,</hi> and <hi>burning Cities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All ye, that are advanced to some
Government, and surely <hi>Parents</hi> and
<hi>Masters of Families</hi> are so; Behold your
selves in this Glass; according as your
Examples are so will your Inferiours be.
I do not say it is so always; but this is
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:108689:256"/>
ordinarily the Effect of your Behaviour.
As you are, so will your Children and
Servants be at least, there is Reason to
think, that so they will be, for your
Example strangely influences those that
are under your Charge and Protection.
If you <hi>sanctify the Lords day</hi> both in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and Private by <hi>letting the Word of
God dwell richly among you in all Wisdom,
Teaching and Admonishing one another in
Psalms and Hymns and spiritual Songs,
singing with grace in your Hearts unto the
Lord,</hi> your Inferiours in time, its possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
would do so too. If you are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to Pride, to Intemperance, to
Drunkenness, to Swearing; there is
hopes that your Inferiours will learn of
you. If you are Grave and Modest,
and curb your Passions, and deny your
selves for Heaven and Gods Service, it
is not improbable that your Inferiours
will be wrought upon to make you their
Patterns. We see, they do so in evil
Things, why should we despair of their
following you in that which is good.
At least you have this Satisfaction, that
by your Example you shew'd them the
Way, to the <hi>Land which flows with Milk
and Honey.</hi> You will have this Comfort,
that your Example did not lead them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:108689:257"/>
the <hi>Chambers of Death,</hi> nor make them
fling their immortal Souls away. All
ye that are Professours of Religion, that
pretend to be holier than ordinary; the
Eyes of the World will be upon you.
The least false step you make will be
taken notice of. <hi>See then, that you walk
Circumspectly, as wise Men redeeming the
Time, because the days are Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. Such of you, whom the Spirit of
God hath made free from the Law of
Sin, you are not only <hi>a City set upon a
Hill,</hi> but behold you are come into
<hi>mount Sion,</hi> to the heavenly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
unto <hi>the City of the living God; and to
the innumerable company of Angels,</hi> as the
Apostle saith, <hi>Heb.</hi> XII. 18. Behold God
hath called you to be <hi>Citizens</hi> of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> called you to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
of Angels, called you to dwell
on the Hill of God, on the everlasting
Hill. How high is your Calling! How
excellent your Vocation! How great
the dignity God intends you! Your <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
is to be in Heaven;</hi> and will
you mind the Trifles of the Flesh, and
so mind them, as to set your Affections
upon them? Will you, who are Born,
new Born I mean, to an everlasting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
will you be fond of this pitiful
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:108689:257"/>
transitory World, you that are intended for
the highest Imployment, will you do as the
Children of the World do? <hi>They are from
Beneath, you are from Above.</hi> Do Eagles catch
Flies, and you that are intended to soar
above the Clouds, will you disgrace your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree,
and <hi>and set your Affections on things</hi>
Below? God intends you as Conquerours,
and will you suffer your selves to fall a Prey
to filthy Temptation, and expose your selves
to the Contempt and Scorn of the Fowler,
who Flatters you till he draws you into the
Net, and then Punishes you for being tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en?</p>
               <p>Behold the <hi>glorious City,</hi> the <hi>City of our
God,</hi> the <hi>City set upon a Hill</hi> indeed, the <hi>City
which hath Foundations, whose builder and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is God!</hi> Do you hope to be Members of
that Community, and will you disparage
your selves by Actions that will certainly
exclude you from that Republick? At the
Gates of it no unclean Thing shall enter:
A clean Heart, and a clean Life must give
you <hi>jus Givitatis,</hi> make you free Denisons of
that City, and will not you prepare your
selves for the Honour of that Naturalizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Except you imitate the Manners of the
<hi>Citizens</hi> above, you can never hope to be
Partners with them in their Glory; and
what are their Manners? Why? They love.
Love is their Trade, their Employment,
their Business, their Pleasure, their Delight,
their Satisfaction. They love nothing but
God, or if they love any Thing besides him,
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:108689:258"/>
they love it for his Sake; and love God in
it. Love is their Principle, their End, their
Mark, and their Entertainment. Love is
their Meat and Drink, and their Recreation.
They love Dearly, they love Constantly,
they love Eternally. <hi>God is love, and he
dwells in them, and they in God.</hi> To be like
them, see that ye love him, that <hi>hath begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
you again unto a lively hope, by the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Jesus Christ from the dead.</hi> See <hi>that
ye love one another with a pure Heart fervently,</hi>
See that <hi>your love be without dissimulation.</hi> See
that ye <hi>love not in Word, nor in Tongue,</hi> but
<hi>indeed and in truth,</hi> and when the Thred of
your Life shall break, that Love which dwelt
in you, will exalt you to the Regions of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Love, where the Inhabitants speak of
Love, and think of Love, and sing of Love;
and tell one another, how <hi>Christ hath loved
them, and wash'd them from their Sins with
his own Blood.</hi> To him be Glory forever.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
