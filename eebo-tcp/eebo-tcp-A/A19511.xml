            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight well ſaith the Wiſeman, <hi>(gentle Reader)</hi> that there is nothing new vnder the Sunne; and further, that there is no end of writing bookes: for, how ſoever in a generality the ſubiect of any knowledge be declared, yet the particulars, that may bee gathered out of the ſame, be ſo manie, as new or more matter may bee produced to write thereof againe; and, as <hi>Horace</hi> alſo affirmeth, it is hard to entreate of any ſubiect, that hath not beene formerly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by ſome other. Wherefore ſeeing that of all the benefits that ever Almighty God beſtowed on man from the creation of the world, as there is none more glorious &amp; admirable, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his owne deare, &amp; welbeloved Son to vs, &amp; for vs to be crucified: ſo likewiſe I thought it beſt to beſtow theſe my firſt labours in the meditation of his paſſion; becauſe that of all the duties that man can do, or are required of man to be done vnto God, there is none ſo high, nor ſo acceptable vnto him, as to imbrace the ſame, his crucified, and paſſionate ſonne by faith in our hearts, (which muſt not only be done for our owne pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, or private vſe, but alſo to endeavour our ſelues, to helpe &amp; further others in the ſame.) For, it is the only doctrine, that availeth with God, the key alſo to binde and looſe ſinners, the touchſtone to try all doctrines, the lanterne &amp; light that ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth and expelleth the miſt and darknes of all hypocriſie, and a preſervatiue againſt all errour and hereſie, the mother of all goodworkes, the earneſt of everlaſting life, and title whereby we challenge our inheritance. And alſo, it is the only motiue, that I might in all humbleneſſe of duty, with theſe or ſuch like meditations, end and spend the reſt of my time in the divine ſervice of my Lord Ieſus, that hath called me from teaching of
<pb facs="tcp:15803:5"/>
Schoole, and brevity in writing, to become a Miniſter, for to inſtruct, and labour in the vineyard of the Lord. Wherefore <hi>(Gentle Reader)</hi> if I, that ſpent the whole prime of my youth in that forme or faculty, be now applyed vnto better labours, thinke though it be <hi>Serò,</hi> yet it is <hi>Seriò;</hi> and though theſe my firſt endeavors begin but in the Autumne, or declining of my age, yet doubt not, by the helpe of God they will continue the time of my whole life. Hoping you will grace mee with your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ſuſpence, vntill my deeds proue my doctrine; in which hope I kindly preſent you this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> entituled my Saviours Croſſe. The which if you balance with the zeale of my minde, I ſhalbe ſure you will not miſlike it, in regard of the matter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though happily you may finde ſome diſtaſt in the method. For, what can be more commodious to reviue, &amp; preſerue the ſoule of a good Chriſtian, then a ſerious meditation in the doctrine of our Saviours bitter <hi>Paſſion?</hi> which is the ſumme of my ſmal and vnlearned <hi>Treatiſe.</hi> Wherefore if you looke in the booke of God, where this my draught would draw you, you woulde not only finde there ſufficient ſalue to cure your owne ſoule, which conteines the full ſatisfaction of theſe my labours; but alſo it would be a motiue to animate me forwards to continue my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in the like ſtudies. In which hope of your zealous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vſing and dayly practiſing of the ſame, I commit my ſelfe, and my booke, to your favourable cenſure, praying the Almighty, to giue you ſuch ſpirituall refreſhing vnto your ſoule, that neither Sathan may deceiue you, nor the Law terrifie you, but that you may rightly enioy the abundance of Gods mercies. <hi>Vale in Chriſto.</hi>

This is the bitter fountaine <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampus,</hi> which with his brackiſhneſſe marreth the ſweet riuer <hi>Hypanis,</hi> that is to ſay, the flowing ſtreame of all Gods graces in vs. To turne bridle therfore, &amp; to the knitting vp of the concluſion of our Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it muſt needs be granted that as all mankind hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſo al mankind was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned. This argument can none reſolue and diſcharge, ſaue one, euen the Son of God, who became man, and yeelded himſelfe, in the ſupply of vs al, vnto his eternal Father, as an vnſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; immaculate Lambe, in al things obedient to the law, and ſuffered puniſhment for all mankinde, who by his own ſatisfaction, without the help of any one, hath made vs partakers of his heauenly kingdome.

            <p>The <hi>proprium</hi> or propertie of <hi>Sin</hi> is the making of a ſinner guiltie of the eternal anger and wrath of God.

            <p>Now the evill of ſin appeareth in three things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, firſt the deformitie; for God doth loath it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly the iniquitie thereof, for the Divel doth loue it. Thirdly, the infirmitie thereof, for the whole world is infected with it.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt, it is ſaid in the holy Scripture in many and ſundry places <hi>Odio eſt Deo impius &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietas eius,</hi> God hateth the wicked man and his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe <note place="margin">Wiſ. 14. 9.

               <note n="d" place="margin">Prov 24. 22. 1 Pet. 3. 10.</note>. He doth not only ſay, <hi>their houſes ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>

And therefore no marvaile, if he ſhew ſuch rigor to ſinners at the laſt day, whom he ſo greatly hateth and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in this life. Therefore let ſinners take heed, that they by true repentance, and ſtedfaſt faith in Chriſt, be able to diſcharge their reckoning; leſt they chance to heare the dreadfull ſentence of Chriſt, <hi>Qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tum in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tijs fuit, tantum dato illi tormentum,</hi> look how much he <note place="margin">Apoc. 18.</note> hath beene in delights, ſo much torment doe you lay vpon him. And thus the diſſolute ſinner is vnto God farre more vile then the bafeſt creature of all, even the Droane, Caterpiller, or Toad: for what is hee elſe but a filthie dunghill of all abhominations, &amp; vncleannes: the ſtinke whereof, hath infected heaven and earth, &amp; no perfume could ever allay it in the noſtrils of the <hi>Lord;</hi> ſaving only the <hi>Paſſion of Ieſus Christ,</hi> being a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour to Almightie God.</p>
            <p>We make it very dainty to come neere a <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that is full of botches, blaines, and ſores. But how much more are thoſe men to be abhorred, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving layne many yeares dead in their ſinnes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe now nothing but putrifie, rotte, and ſtinke in

them, like ougly and loathſome carions, lingering in their iniquitie, vntill it come to maturitie, that God in his iuſt iudgement and meaſure of time, may lay his heauy curſe vpon them when they ſhall behold the great, terrible, feareful, and angry counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of that mighty God <hi>Iehovah,</hi> aboue them to be their iudge, with a ſword of vengance in the one hand to terrifie them, and a ſcabart of iuſtice in the other hand, to iudge them, and their ſins on the one ſide to accuſe and cry vengance againſt them, and thoſe cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed caitifes <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 3. 14.</note>, thoſe ougly monſters <note n="b" place="margin">Eſa. 27. 1.</note>, thoſe damned ſpirits <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 25. 41.</note>, thoſe houling helhounds <note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 22. 16.</note>, and roaring Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note n="e" place="margin">1.

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, ſinne is evill, in that the Diuell doth loue it.</hi> Firſt let vs conſider, that it is not gold nor ſiluer that he would haue, but <hi>animas peccatrices,</hi> the very ſoules of ſinners, wherewith he is enriched and fed; whoſe note is <hi>Da mihi animas, cetera tolle tibi,</hi> giue me the ſoules, take thou the reſt; yea he is that rauenous bird that deſireth and delighteth in the heart of his prey.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:15803:20"/>
The Diuel being once asked what he beſt loued, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered three things, <hi>viz: Primam Lunam, Rotam Solis, Canis iram,</hi>

The ſecond ſigne and token, whereby wee may proue that the Diuel loueth ſin is thus; he is neuer wearied out with his ſeeking, roaring, attempting, and earneſt following after ſin. For, from the beginning of the world he hath done nothing elſe, but cauſe &amp; procure ſin; who indeed being once asked of God (as in the booke of <hi>Iob)</hi> from whence he came, ſaid, from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the whole Earth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly he loueth ſin, becauſe he is neuer ſatisfied therewith: for how many thouſands and millions of ſoules hath he vanquiſhed, devoured and overcome! and yet like a hunger-ſtarved Lyon ſtil ſeeketh whom he may devour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly ſinne is an evill, in that it corrupteth, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity that infecteth the whole world.</hi> It is like a <hi>tertian</hi>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly it is like a <hi>quartane Ague,</hi> for his 4. degrees, 1. <hi>cordis, 2. oris, 3. operis, 4. conſuetudinis.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Sin</hi> is like a <hi>quotidian feaver</hi> being continually and that by the meanes of the ſin of pride which is euery where. <hi>Sin</hi> is like a gout in the feet, by the meanes of ſluggiſhnes and idleneſſe: when we ſhould go about any good workes, we lacke both hands and feet, but the gowt makes vs feele and confeſſe, that we haue both. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:15803:21"/>
the <hi>Palſey,</hi> by meanes of anger, which makes a man often ſhake through the veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy thereof. It is like the <hi>Dropſie</hi> through inſatiable deſire of hauing; &amp; like a <hi>leproſie</hi> by the means of <hi>luxuriouſnes. Muſculus</hi> in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon places hath exquiſitely opened vnto vs the true <hi>Anatomy</hi> of Sin, drawn out of the firſt Chapter of <hi>S.

            <p>Herein is declared, how ſin beginneth in vs, encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, &amp; is perfected. There is in vs a corrupt poiſoned ſtrength of concupiſcence readily giuen vnto al kinde of evil, whereof is bred al kinde of ſin in this ſort.</p>
            <p>Firſt there creepe into our harts temptations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">Suggeſtion.</note> are innumerable ſorts of kindes: one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through covetouſnes, honoureth gold as his God; another through ambition is tempted with pride, an other through laſciviouſnes, is become effeminate, &amp; haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth after the fleſh as careleſly, <hi>as an Oxe goeth to the ſlaughter, or a foole to the ſtoekes, for correction,</hi> another <note place="margin">Prov. 7. 22.</note> hath his thoughts environed with furiouſneſſe and wrath, an other to gluttony and ſurfetting, an other to drunkenneſſe, ſwearing, backbiting and ſuch like. Now the temptation creepeth into vs by ſuggeſtion, either of Satan (as it chanced vnto <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Ananias)</hi> or of our remembrance, or of the ſenſe of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is by ſight, hearing, ſmelling, taſting, or tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Temptation</hi> is infected with a certaine <note place="margin">Delectation.</note>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:15803:21"/>

Afterward followeth a conſent to ſin; lo here is a conceiving of ſinne, done as it were in the wombe of concupiſcence, which vpon every light oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, concupiſcence the vnhappy mother of ſinne <note place="margin">4 Perfection.</note> bringeth forth: whiles that the ſin, which is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved within, by conſenting to temptation is in worke perfected abroad. But although the worke come not out, yet neuertheleſſe, the ſin is perfected before God, which by conſent is conceiued in the hart; wherof we may ſee, <hi>Mat. 5.

Fourthly, of the infinite and vnſpeakable mercy of <note place="margin">The fourth matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the fourth cauſe.</note> God towards vs moſt miſerable ſinners. The quantity of mercy is not ſtrange, it droppeth as the gentle dew from heaven vpon the place beneath, it is twiſe bleſt, it bleſſeth him that giues, &amp; him that takes, it is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt in the mightieſt, it becomes the <hi>throne of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie</hi> better then his crowne; his Scepter ſhewes the force of temporall power, the attribute to awe &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, wherein doth ſit the dread &amp; feare of kings, but mercy is aboue the Scepters ſway, it is inthroned in the hearts of kings, it is an attribute to God himſelfe, and earthly powers do then ſhew moſt like to Gods, when mercy reacheth iuſtice.</p>
            <p>Thus may wee ſpeake in ſome part and meaſure of mercy that ſhould ſomewhat lodge in the heartes of men authoriſed: But not deliver a full and cleere diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the infinite, ineffable, and incomprehenſible, compaſſionate, and provident God towardes vs moſt miſerable, and wretched ſinners. God commends his mercy towards vs, that when we were ſinners Chriſt died for vs; much more now being iuſtified in his <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 8.</note> bloud, ſhall we bee free from wrath through him: for wherefore was it that he had experience of evil, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was he abaſed? wherfore did he beare our ſins vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his body &amp; was truely broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our tranſgreſſions but that in his feeling of our ſorrowes, we might the more ſenſibly ſee, what was all his loue, and mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs. God humbled himſelfe vnto a low degree, that he might exalt vs that are truely humbled. Wee muſt ſuffer with him, that wee may come vnto him in

               </hi> thou art worſe then a Toad, and more deteſtable before God; <hi>But by Chriſt thou art aboue the Angels, for thou art ioined vnto him, &amp; made bone of his bone, mystically.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Through <hi>Adam,</hi> ſin and Satan haue rule in thee, &amp; lead thee captiue; <hi>By Christ the ſpirit of God dwelleth in thee plentiouſly:</hi> by <hi>Adam</hi> came death vnto thee, and it is an entrance into hell; by Chriſt, <hi>though death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, yet it is the only paſsage vnto life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly in <hi>Adam,</hi> thou art poore, blind, &amp; miſerable; <hi>But in Chriſt thou art rich, and glorious, thou art king on

ſhould come vnto the meditation of the paſſion, is firſt the contrition of the heart, by the nature of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> which for the moſt part little vnderſtandeth the doctrine, and leſſe practiſeth the dutie, wherefore firſt we muſt ſhew what repentance is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repentance</hi> is the conſtant turning of man in his whole life from all ſinnes vnto God, which muſt bee done ſo directly, that he muſt hate and deteſt his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer evill life, purpoſing to become a new man, that God may make him a new heart and a new ſpirit, (not <note place="margin">Ecleſ. 18. 31.</note> in ſubſtance nor quantitie, but in qualitie) ariſing from a true and liuely faith, with a full perſwaſion of Gods mercies by the merits of Chriſt, for the forgiuenes of his ſinnes. But firſt let vs conſider that there bee two <note place="margin">2. Repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces</note> kindes of <hi>Repentance,</hi> the one, a true repentance vnto life, the other a falſe repentance vnto death; and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we may haue by <hi>Iudas,</hi> who is ſaid to haue repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <note place="margin">1. The falſe.</note> and which is more, to haue confeſſed his fault, &amp; which is moſt of all, to haue made reſtitution, and yet it was a falſe repentance, becauſe it ſprang not of a true faith, but rather of the feare of death, which hee ſaw imminent before his eies, of the griefe &amp; tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe of paine, of the horrour of hel, and feare of Gods invincible puniſhment which he knew he muſt needs abide, becauſe he betraied the innocent blood. <hi>Cain</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, yet he was condemned; <hi>Eſau</hi> repented, yet hee was condemned; <hi>Antiochus</hi> alſo did repent, yet he is conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned becauſe their prolonged repentance ſprang not of faith. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> and without faith there can be no true repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Thus many <hi>Iudaſses</hi> and deſparing wretches wil ſay (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a miniſter or preacher goes about to perſwade them to amend their liues, and returne vnto God by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, in ſhewing them that God is more mercifull then man can be ſinfull, if man will be ſorrowfull) this or ſuch like anſwere; You ſay well indeed, God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, but alas, I am ſo vnworthy of my ſelfe, and finde ſo many imperfections in me, that I am not worthy of the mercie of God, and therefore I cannot expect it. Oh marke I beſeech you, this common obiection is altogether without faith, and it riſeth not from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, but from the pride of the heart, and thereby it maketh many careleſſe men to diſtruſt in God: the reaſon is, becauſe they would not bee beholding vnto God for his mercy, but would rather ſeeme to haue God to be beholding vnto them for their worthineſſe. But if they would haue God to haue the glory, as moſt of right they ſhould, they muſt not ſtand vpon their owne infirmities; for the more vnworthy they are in their owne ſight (if they truely repent and be hartily ſory for their ſinnes, with a full purpoſe to continue in newneſſe of life) the more worthy will they bee in the ſight of God, &amp; the more acceptable, becauſe gods glory is then moſt magnified, who <hi>can make their ſins</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 1. 18.</note> 
               <hi>if they were as red as crimſon, to bee as white as ſnow, &amp;c.</hi> And as our Saviour Chriſts power was not ſo much magnified in curing one that was but a few daies ſicke, <note place="margin">Ioh 5 8.</note> as in curing him that was thirtie eight yeares diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſo the mercy of God is not ſo much magnified in curing a ſmall ſinner, or a few ſinnes, as in curing of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:15803:27"/>
great ſinners his goodneſſe ſheweth it ſelfe: for when they haue ſo humbled themſelues, by returning vnto God by true repentance, that with the <hi>Centurion,</hi> they can ſend their friends (that is) their zealous and ful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing prayers vnto Chriſt with this meſſage, <hi>Lord I am not worthy thou ſhouldſt enter vnder my roofe,</hi> but <note place="margin">Luk 7. 6, 7.</note> ſpeake the <hi>word and my ſinnes will be cured,</hi> or with <hi>Peter Lord depart from me a ſinfull man;</hi> then ſhall they finde <note place="margin">Luk. 5. 8.</note> their ſoules cured, their ſinnes pardoned, &amp; Chriſt wil come to them in mercy. Thus much concerning the falſe repentance, with this ſhort perſwaſion to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe men from the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the true repentance. Wherin firſt let vs conſider, that there is no doctrine in the Church <note place="margin">2. The true repentance</note> of God ſo neceſſary, as the doctrine of repentance, &amp; ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of life; neither doth the holy ghoſt ſo much labour in all the Scripture, as he doth to beate repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into mens heads: it was the only ſermon which <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> preached, while hee prepared the way for <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 2.</note> Chriſt, <hi>Repent for the kingdome of God is at hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This repentance is not defined altogether by this word <hi>poenitentia,</hi> becauſe (as Divines ſaie) it doth not comprehend <hi>totum terminum, à quo &amp; ad quem,</hi> from whom and to whom we muſt returne.</p>
            <p>But this is the true <hi>Repentance,</hi> which the latines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret by this word <hi>Reſipiſcentia,</hi> or <hi>Conuerſio,</hi> which is not only a changing of the minde, but it is <hi>Receſsus à malo,</hi> a forſaking of euill, <hi>acceſſus ad bonum</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning vnto that which is good. <hi>reuertimini vſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ad me,</hi> ſaith the Lord, returne as far as vnto me; we
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:15803:27"/>
muſt returne vnto the Lord, wee muſt returne vnto him alone, for he is the truth, and the fountaine of all goodnes.</p>
            <p>For better proofe, that true <hi>Repentance</hi> is a turning vnto God, we may proue it by the Authority of the holy Scriptures plentiouſly, where God commandes vs to returne vnto him, <hi>O yee children of Iſrael</hi> (ſaith he) <note place="margin">Eſa. 31. 6.</note>

Now to ſpeake more largely of it let vs knowe that contrition alſo comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth theſe two things, firſt the knowledge of God, requiring obedience, and diſcommending diſobedience, and not remitting ſin without a full and perfect ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either in reſpect of obedience it ſelfe, or elſe in reſpect of puniſhment: ſecondly the diſcuſſing or examining our own nature of our thoughts, our wils, our affections, and al our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and deeds, according to the ſquare and rule of Gods lawes in every point, whereby we are lead and brought to the knowledge, as wel of our filthines, as alſo of our iuſt condemnation.

To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, this his ſacrifice cauſed the ſweet ſtreams of pure water of life, to flow out of the cleare &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſpringing fountaine of his mercies daily pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon mankinde, comfortable to coole the heat of our thirſty tongues, and as medicinable to cure the ſpreading malady of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, which infected our ſoules with the leproſie of ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Paſſion of Chriſt is threefold.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Externall.</item>
                  <item>2 Internall.</item>
                  <item>3 Conſisting of both.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt <hi>Externall,</hi> being in the body members and parts thereof, as the tearing &amp; rending of the vaines.</p>
            <p>Secondly <hi>Internall,</hi> as the ſorrow and griefe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:15803:33"/>
in the heart, &amp; the great torment ariſing out of the feare of the tearing of the body, and death, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the feeling of Gods wrath.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>that which conſisteth of both,</hi> is belonging to the body and ſoule, and to the whole Chriſt, God and man. The iniurie, afflicting, ſlandering, ſcoffing, the crowne of thornes, and other like torments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring togither in his body, pearcing (as it were) &amp; entring even vnto the <hi>Divinity,</hi> which it ſelfe never ſuffered, becauſe it is vnchangeable, and therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſible. Touching his <hi>Diuinity,</hi> it did alwaies ſupport his humanity, which <hi>Habacuck</hi> perceiving ſaith in his <note place="margin">Hab. 3. 4.</note> third Chapter thus, <hi>ibi abſeondita eſt fort it udo eius,</hi> he had hornes comming out of his hands, and that was the hiding of his power. For as the Sun when it is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a clowde is hidden, and yet it is not cleane ſpent, and gone, and that light, which ſpreading all the world over, illuſtrateth every thing, with his cleare brightneſſe, is included in a ſmall obſtacle from vs: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo was the Deity hid in that humanity which hee put on him, and yet ſeparated neither from body nor ſoule. We read in <hi>Leviticus</hi> that the ſacrifice that did purifie and cleanſe from Leproſie was on this ſort; <note place="margin">Levit. 14.</note> they tooke two male Sparrowes being aliue, one of them was killed and put into an earthen veſſel, hauing faire &amp; cleare running water, the other Sparrow that was aliue his wings, with Cedarwood, and ſcarlet cloath, with hyſſop, were dipped in the bloud of the ſlaine Sparrow, which he that was diſeaſed, &amp; infected with the leproſie, was ſprinkled withall. The ſlaine
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:15803:34"/>
Sparrow ſignifieth the humanity of Chriſt put to death: the Sparrow that was left aliue ſignifieth the Godhead of Chriſt, which was impaſſible. But yet for all this it was diverſly violated, and abuſed by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thereof, and as much as in themlay, was hurt, blaſphemed, and debaſed.</p>
            <p>As when the high Prieſts accuſed Chriſt, for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was the ſon of God, alſo whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſpat in his face, and bad him propheſie, tell who it was that ſtroke him, and alſo they bowed themſelues before him, they ſmit him with their fiſts, ſaying, <hi>Haile king of the Iewes,</hi> being mocked, crowned with thornes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verburthened, and laden with bearing of his Croſſe, which they made him to cary, nailed on the Croſſe, and being both with ieſts, and ſcoffes, gybed at in this wiſe, <hi>if thou be the ſon of God, come downe from the Croſſe, and ſaue thy ſelfe;</hi> here now was the <hi>word,</hi> even the ſon of God, yea the whole <hi>Trinity,</hi> moved both to a iuſt commiſeration, and a rightful indignation.</p>
            <p>Howbeit wee muſt vnderſtand, that this <hi>Paſsion of Christ</hi> had not then his beginning, when he was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. But all his life time after his conception, by the ſpace of thirty yeares even vnto the puniſhment, and paine of the Croſſe, to haue bin nothing elſe but a continual and full <hi>Paſſion,</hi> miſery, ſatisfaction and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for our ſins. He was borne an infant, and laid in the manger, becauſe there was no roome for them in the Inne, but in the ſtable, in cold &amp; want of all things <note place="margin">Luk 2. 7.</note> needfull, wherevpon ſaith <hi>Gregory,</hi> Chriſt came from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into a womans wombe, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a womans wombe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:15803:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
into a cratch or manger, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the manger to the croſſe, from the croſſe to the graue, and from the graue hee went to heauen againe. But to recite or ſpeake more of his troubles, (what can I ſay, but that which hath beene already ſpoken of by others?) in his infancie he fled from the tyranny of <hi>Herod,</hi> and was caried into <hi>Egypt.</hi> After his baptiſme, hee was oftentimes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly tempted, by the ſpace of two daies of Satan, whom afterwards acknowledged and openly confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <note place="margin">Mar. 5. 7.</note> him to bee the ſon of the moſt high God. The princely Prophet <hi>David,</hi> in the 110. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> ſpeaking <note place="margin">Pſal. 110. 7.</note> of Chriſts afflictions, and his paſſion through the which hee ſhould enter into his glory, vſeth theſe words, <hi>He ſhall drinke of the brook in the way.</hi> The which for the diverſitie of interpretations, I am the more bolder to inſert, that among many the plaineſt &amp; tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſignification might bee beſt knowne and allowed. The lewes which alwaies fedde themſelues with the vaine hope of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of ſuch a <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as ſhould be a certaine earthly, civill, and powerfull king, doe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fondly apply this ſentence vnto victories, for thus they expound it, <hi>Hee ſhall drinke of the brooke,</hi> that is to ſay, of the blood of them that are ſlaine; as if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſhould ſay, that the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as a mightie conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, ſhould performe ſo great a ſlaughter vpon his enimies, that the bloud of the ſlaine ſhould ſtreame &amp; flowe like a brooke, and that the whole armie as vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, and conquerours, might <hi>drinke of the brooke in in the way,</hi> as they are purſuing their enimies. In the which forme and maner of ſpeech they ſuppoſe it to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:15803:35"/>
be thus ſignified, that Chriſt will bee ſatisfied with the bloud of his enimies. But ſeeing the text in this place, ſpeaketh nothing of bloud, neither can bloud bee thought a fit drinke for conquerours; except it bee fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiuely ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as in the prophecie of <hi>Balaam,</hi> where the drinking of bloud is referred vnto the Lyon, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it ſpoken of the people of Iſrael, but by a figure among the later writers. Some think it a ſimilitude ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the circumſtance of ſtrong and valiant cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, who in their chaſe and purſuit of their enimies ſlacke nothing of their heat and fervency, neither will be hindred, with any care or deſire of meate, drinke, ſleepe, or any other pleaſure, to the end they might the better follow, and enforce the courſe and purſuite of the victorie, but content and very well pleaſed to quench their thirſt with water for their drinke, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of every brooke, which they meet withal, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leaue chaſing and purſuing their enimies. As <hi>Gede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> made triall of the valour and vertue of his ſouldiers courage by their drinking of water. <note place="margin">Iudg. 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thus therefore would they haue this verſe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Chriſt, as if by this maner of ſpeech, a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſtrength and courage were to bee attributed vnto him, that he is ſo hot and haſtie, ſo eager and reſolute in purſuing his victories, that he will not ceaſe &amp; leaue of, nor by any meanes, either for loue of meat, drinke, or any other delights whatſoever, bee revoked from his purpoſe; &amp; ſo by this meanes may ſtrike it into the hearts of his enimies, how terrible and fearefull his power and ſtrength is. Howbeit we wil hold the moſt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:15803:35"/>
plaine and ſimple ſentence that the phraſe it ſelfe doth yeeld &amp; offer vs. The Prophets ſpeech firſt tended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, the king aſcribing vnto him the chiefeſt power and victories over all his enimies; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, leaſt after the maner of the Iewes, this ſhould bee vnderſtood of a corporall kingdome, hee addeth the doctrine of his paſſion, which ſhould open, as it were, a way from him vnto glory, and advancement in his kingdome, as it is ſaid, <hi>it behoued Chriſt to ſuffer, &amp; ſo to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 24.</note> 
               <hi>enter into his glorie.</hi> For, to drinke in the Scripture is taken thus, to be afflicted, for thus ſaith the Lord, behold, they whoſe iudgement was not to drinke of <note place="margin">Ier. 24. 12.</note> the cup, haue aſſuredly drunken; and art thou hee that ſhall eſcape free? thou ſhalt not go free, but thou ſhalt ſurely drinke of it: which is as much to ſay, I haue not ſpared my owne people, and how ſhould I pitty thee? <hi>Can yee drinke of the cup which I ſhall drinke of?</hi> But there is ſomewhat more contained in this phraſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith, <hi>He ſhall drinke of the brooke,</hi> then if hee had ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſaid, <hi>He ſhall drinke of the cup:</hi> for to drink of the cup ſiguifieth the ſuffering and enduring but of a part or portion of ſome certaine miſerie allotted vnto any one: but to drinke of the brooke in this place, ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the taſting of al kind of miſeries, and the vndergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the greateſt burdens of all miſeries, and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, even in the higheſt degrees. For <hi>Torrens</hi> a brooke, importeth both the greatneſſe and fierceneſſe of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and calamities, ſtreaming &amp; flowing of all ſides. For Chriſt felt the anger of God to bee powred vpon him, yea and the ſinnes of all mankind <hi>Inſtar Torrentis,</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:15803:36"/>
like a river brooke to runne &amp; flow round about him on every ſide; therefore is hee ſaid to drinke of the brooke in the way: &amp; by this his paſſion, ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſhall he enter into the kingdome, <hi>&amp; exalt abit ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put,</hi> and ſhall lift vp his head, that is, he ſhall riſe againe from death vnto life, and ſhall rule in power, and this is to be held as a ſentence moſt ſignificant and plaine, ſhewing the kingdome of Chriſt to bee farre more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, then that which the Iews fondly dreame of.</p>
            <p>For Chriſt through miſeries, afflictions, &amp; through death, which he ſuffered is aſcended vp into the glory, that hath gotten him a name, that is, dignitie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne.</p>
            <p>Now then, ſeeing that it behoueth vs to be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 9.</note> and made like vnto the image of the ſon of God, let vs not thinke, or looke to haue the Church glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before ſhe be mortified, that is, toſſed, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med through many afflictions and calamities. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt dranke deepely of the water brooke, for he was made weake, he hungreth, hee thirſteth, hee is bitten with the cold of winter, and dryed vp with the outragious heat of ſommer, he weepeth, he watcheth, he is troubled, he is deſpiſed, and dayly beholdeth, and thinketh vpon the Tyrannie of Satan, working againſt mankind, and the extreame miſeries of all men, as alſo the horrible anger and wrath of God, powred vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſonne himſelfe, with ſharpneſſe of puniſhment, and with all the great ingratitude of the greateſt part of the whole world, yea the careleſneſſe, and impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie even of Chriſtians themſelues.

            <p>The principall efficient cauſe <hi>is the will of God,</hi> &amp; his owne perſon, being ready to performe the obedience vnto his eternall father, whoſe wrathfull anger could not by any other hoſt or ſacrifice bee appeaſed.

            </p>
            <p>The booke is the old Teſtament, the Roule is the ſumme, the argument of the old Teſtament, are the fore mentions of Chriſt, the will of God is the exina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and debaſing of his ſonne, his obedience, his humbleneſſe &amp; offering vp his body vpon the croſſe. <hi>He commeth forth as a bridegroome out of his chamber, &amp; reioyceth like a mightie man to runne his race.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The obiect moving the ſonne of God, is ſinne, and damnation of mankind, which hee would not that it ſhould vtterly periſh. Therefore, ſaith hee, in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 43. thou haſt made me to ſerue him with thine iniquities; I am he which take away tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake, and I will not remember thy ſinnes: and alſo the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:15803:37"/>
tyrannie of the divell vpon mankinde.</p>
            <p>The impulſiue cauſe, is the great &amp; exceeding loue of God the Father, and of the ſonne vnto mankinde, of whom it is written, <hi>God ſo loued the world, that hee</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 103, 13.</note>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Subiect</hi> or matter of the paſſion, is the very ſon of God made man, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>I was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious,</hi> neither turned I my backe vnto the ſmiters, &amp; <note place="margin">Eſa 50. 5.</note> my cheekes vnto the nippers, I hid not my face from ſhame and ſpitting. 1. <hi>Cor. 2. they haue crucified the Lord of glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The formall cauſe is the obedience of the perſon it ſelfe. The finall cauſes are foure, firſt that God ſhould be worſhipped, &amp; praiſed for his loue, Iuſtice, &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Secondly, that the ſcripture might bee fulfilled for the ſatisfying of the will and fore promiſe of God. Thirdly, that mankind might thereby be reconciled vn to God, and be ſaved. Fourthly, that the workes of the Divell might be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of the difference betweene the paſſion of Christ, and the paſſion of other Saints of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All Saints and holy men are ſinners, conceiued and borne in ſin, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> is both <hi>everlaſting God &amp; man,</hi> free, from ſin, and vnſpotted, and being righteous and <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.</note> iuſt, died for the vnrighteous, and vniuſt. <hi>Moreover,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:15803:38"/>
there is a difference of the cauſes of the Paſſions,</hi> for all we do ſuffer for our ſins: and if we had no ſin, there ſhould no puniſhment be laid vpon vs, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffered for vs, and laid downe his life for our ſins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is alſo a difference of the paſſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching both the matter, and forme thereof, we that beleeue, although wee ſuffer the death, yet through a ſtedfaſt faith and hope which we lay holde vpon Chriſt Ieſus our Savior &amp; redeemer, our death wil be vnto vs, but a ſure and ioyful paſſage vnto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. But <hi>Christ</hi> bearing the ſinnes of all the whole world, vpon himſelfe, which the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> cauſed to be committed, yet he as a ſecond happy and bleſſed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi> nay more, a mighty Saviour, felt for our ſakes, al the heavy wrath and anger of God, which was pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out vpon him, and would not deny it, but conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly ſuffered it, yea to be laid and done vpon his own body, and ſo thereby he ſet vs free from the wrath of God, and eternall death.</p>
            <p>Againe, although we ſuffer, we do not thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue either vnto our ſelues, or vnto any other, life &amp; ſalvation, and therefore Chriſts <hi>Paſſion</hi> differeth from all other paſſion of Saints, firſt in the ſpecial property of his owne <hi>Paſſion,</hi> which is only a ſacrifice for our ſins, ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly in the perſons, thirdly in cauſes: &amp; fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the matter it ſelfe, as is already ſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The exemplariall meditation of the Paſsion of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>exemplariall meditation</hi> beholdeth <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a teacher, and obſerveth him as a guide and leader vnto eternall life, and ſtudieth to follow his humility, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:15803:38"/>
meekenes, patience, as himſelfe ſaith, learne of me, for I am meeke, and humble heart; he that taketh not vp his Croſſe; &amp; followeth me, is not worthy of me, be ye followers of Chriſt as deare children, and 1. <hi>Pet. 2. Chriſt</hi> ſuffered, leaving vnto vs an example, that yee ſhould follow his ſteps: &amp; 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. he that ſaith he abideth in Chriſt, ought ſo to walke, even as hee wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. And <hi>Paule 2. Phil.</hi> Be yee like minded, every man eſteeme better of an other, then of his own ſelfe; look not every man of his own things only, but every man on the things of other men. Let the ſame minde be in you that was in Chriſt, for <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. It behoueth vs to ſuffer with Chriſt, that with him we may be glorified. Now it is wel known that our Saviour went through many afflictions; as whips, thornes, buffets, and the moſt ſhamefull death of the Croſſe. And through all theſe muſt hee bee contented to follow Chriſt Ieſus, that wilbe a Chriſtian if matter ſo require.</p>
            <p>Therefore our Saviour Chriſt in his laſt Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t did commend vnto his Father, his ſpirit, to the Iewes his body, to the good theefe Paradice, to the vnrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſinner hell, to the Apoſtles his Goſpell, and to the faithfull affliction for their tryall. Furthermore let vs learne, that as there were two croſſes prepared for Chriſt Ieſus, the one of paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (as that wooden croſſe whereon his body ſuffered; the other of compaſſion, wherby his ſoul ſuffered) ſo there is prepared a double croſſe for every good Chriſtian, the one of the ſoule, the other of the body. The croſſe of <hi>Iobs</hi> body was that power that Satan receaued of the Lord, to afflict his

Church the glory of God ſhined over the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, that they might finde Chriſt in the Scriptures, as the ſhepheards ſaw him ſwadled in his cloaths. As in the firſt yeare after Chriſt, was borne, <hi>Herod</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voreth crueltie, &amp; exerciſeth it vpon infants, that there by he might deſtroy Chriſt: So in the firſt yeare of the Iubile, of the new Teſtament, tyrants exerciſed cruelty vpon all the Apoſtles. As Chriſt fled into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and there continued vntill the death of <hi>Herod.</hi> So the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Chriſt long ſuffered perſecution, &amp; corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and lurked in the aſſemblies, and companies of the godly, vntill the death of Tyrants &amp; Hereticks, <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Diocleſian, Iulian, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Mary loſt Chriſt in the 12 yeare of his age, and in vaine ſought him among his kinsfolkes, and at laſt found him in the Temple amongſt the Doctors, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and asking them queſtions. So the Virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, even the Church in the 12 yeare of Iubile, being troubled with many hereſies, had vtterly loſt Chriſt, had ſhe not found him in the Temple, that is in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, Propheticall and Apoſticall.</p>
            <p>After the 30 yeare of Chriſt, as Iohn Baptiſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the wildernes, repentance and faith in Chriſt, who is baptiſed, and as it were with the figure poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, and ſhewed forth vnto the people. So in the 30 yeare of our Iubile, the true &amp; ſincere doctrine of the Church, both of the law and the Goſpell, began by little &amp; little to be reſtored in the deſert, not in the Hals of the high prieſts, and Palaces of the <hi>Caeſars</hi> and kngs of the world, but in a few certaine ſchooles and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:15803:40"/>
cities. As neither Iohn Baptiſt, nor Chriſt himſelfe did openly teach in the Temple at Ieruſalem (whenas the high Prieſts did poſſeſſe the ſame) but in the wildernes, or in <hi>Galile.</hi> So the doctrine of the Goſpell hath no place in the kingdome of the Pope, but either privatly as it were in a deſert, or elſe vnder certaine Princes, &amp; limits of ſome kingdomes, is it heard and favoured. As in the time of Chriſt Satan ſtirred and raiſed vp di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers tumults, and vproares, through blaſphemous <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> of <hi>Galile, Simon Magus,</hi> &amp; ſuch like. So perturbers and hereticks doe alwaies hurt the Church by their bringing in, and giving of ſcandalous offences &amp; ſtum bling blocks. As Chriſt after three yeares and almoſt halfe preached, afterward ſuffereth, is crucified, dieth, is buried, riſeth againe, aſcendeth vp into heaven, and raigneth in eternall glory. So after three yeares and a halfe, after the yeare of Iubile, from the renewing of true doctrine, after many ſufferings of the godly, which are every where common, the Church ſhalbee freed, &amp; glorified forever, but the whole time ſhal not fully be expired, for the daies ſhall be ſhortned.</p>
