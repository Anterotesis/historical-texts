         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Istory (which by expounding actions past
teacheth to regulate the future, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
us with wisdom at the cost of other
mens experience) is not unlike Painting:
their scope is the same; and as in the latter
it argues want of skill to look upon the whole draught with
an indifferent eye, but to select and insist upon some chiefe
particular is proper to an Artist; so he who rests satisfied
with the generall relation of affairs, (not fixing upon some
eminent Actour in that story) loseth it greatest benefit; since
what is most particular, by its nearer affinity with us, hath
greatest influence upon us.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that there are two kinds of History; One re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
generall affairs of State; The other gives account
ef particular persons, whose lives have rendred them emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.
<hi>Homer</hi> hath given an essay of each; of the first in his
<hi>Iliads,</hi> a relation of a war betwixt different Nations; of the
second in his <hi>Odysses,</hi> confined to the person of <hi>Ulysses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the life of man being either <hi>practick,</hi> busied in
civill affairs of peace and war, or <hi>Contemplative,</hi> retir'd
from publick businesse to speculation and study of wisdome,
divine or humane, it followes that this personall history bee
twofold likewise, describing either the actions of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
as are wholly interested in affairs of state (properly
compar'd to the persons of a drammaticall designe, whose
single Characters and parts serve one onely to make
up one joint plot. Such are most of those whose lives are
related by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> &amp; the twelve <hi>Caesars</hi> of <hi>Sueronius</hi>) Or
the lives of such as have been excellent in some kind of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb facs="tcp:51150:5"/>
Thus <hi>Antipho</hi> writ of Poets; <hi>Eudemus</hi> of Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
<hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> of Oratours, <hi>Suetonius</hi> of
Grammarians. They who writ of Philosophers exceeded the
rest far in number, of whom to give a particular accompt
will be unnecessary, because their workes are not extant, and
therefore we shall onely name them, <hi>Aetius, Ana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Of almost all these (which is much to be deplored)
there remaine not any footsteps; the onely Author in this
kind for the more antient Philosophers is <hi>Diogenes La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertius,</hi>
for the later <hi>Eunapius</hi> And to make the misfortune
the great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what he might have done, that there is much more to be found
of the same persons dispersed amongst other authors, which
I have here collected and digested, with what diligence I
could.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it unseasonable at this time to examine the tenents
of old Philosophers, when so great variety of opinions
daily spring up; some of which are but raked out of the
ruines of antiquity, which ought to be restored to their
first owners; others being of late invention will receive
addition, when advanced to such height wee look down to
the bottom from which Philosophy took her first rise, and
see how great a progresse she hath made, whose beginnings
are almost inscrutable.</p>
                  <p>Although some Grecians have challenged to their Nation
the Originall of Philosophy, yet the more learned of them
have acknowledged it derived from the East. To omit the
dark traditions of the Athenians concerning <hi>Musa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Orpheus,</hi> it is manifest that the original of the Greek Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
is to be deriv'd from <hi>Thales,</hi> who travelling into the East,
first brought Naturall learning, Geometry, and Astrology,
thence into <hi>Greece,</hi> for which reason the attribute of <hi>wise</hi>
was conferred upon him, and at the same time upon six others
for their eminence in morality &amp; politicks Thus learning in the
antientest times was by the Greeks called <hi>Sophia (wisdom)</hi>

of <hi>wise, Damon</hi> the Cyrenaean undervalues them all,
especially the seven. <hi>Anaximenes</hi> saith, they were all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to Poetry; <hi>Dicaearchus,</hi> that they were neither wise
men, nor Philosophers, but upright men and Law givers:
<hi>Archetimus</hi> the Syracusian wrote concerning their meeting
with <hi>Cypselus</hi> (Father to <hi>Periander</hi>) whereat he saith
himself was present. <hi>Ephorus</hi> affirms they all met with
<hi>Croesus, Thales</hi> onely excepted. Some say they met also at
the Panionian feast, and at <hi>Corinth</hi> with <hi>Periander</hi> at
<hi>Delphi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is some controversy concerning their sentences, of

                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> because naturall Seed, the Principle of all living creatures, is

                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> because Fire, even the Sun it self and the stars are nourish'd
and maintain'd by vapours proceeding from Water, and consequently the

                           <hi>as Aristotle saith</hi>) of this opinion, <hi>he assign'd water

<hi>Wheras (saith he) there is great difference; Elements are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pounded, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples

For otherwise, if they were not the first, they would not be Principles, but
that rather should be so termed whereof they were made. Now certaine
things there are precedent whereof Earth and water are compounded,</hi> viz.
<hi>The first informe matter, and the forme it selfe and privation.</hi> Thales
<hi>therefore erres, affirming Water to be both Element and principle of all

as to the name, not to reason of the name; for the distinction of
principle and element being not used in that time, <hi>Thales</hi> by

conceived so, because he saw that the nutriment of all things is humid,
that heat it selfe consists thereof, and that every creature lives thereby; He
held that of which things are made to be the principls of all things, for
these reasons he was of this opinion, as also because the seeds of all things
are of a humid nature, and water is the principle of things humid.</hi>

place, nothing in place but what hath quantity, which because
the soul wants, none of the foure kinds of motion (<hi>viz.</hi> Lation,
Alteration, diminution, accretion) are competible (<hi>perse</hi>) to her.
Secondly, that selfe motion is not essentiall to the Soul, because
she is moved accidentally, by externall objects. The first, if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of Circumscription, not only denies the motion of all
things, that are definitively in place, as spirits, but of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
sphear, if compared with <hi>Aristotles</hi> definition of place; yet
that some of these species of motion, though in a different ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
manner, are competent to the soul, and not acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally,
may be argued 1. From the further diffusion of the
soul, according to the augmentation of the body. 2. From intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
which is acknowledg'd a perfection, and consequently
a kind of alteration, which that <hi>Thales</hi> understood to be one of

distinguishing it into twelve months; this they gathered from the starres,
and more iudiciously (in my opinion) then the Grecians, for as much as the
Grecians every third year, intercalate a month to make up the time; but the
Aegyptians to the number of 360 daies, which twelve months make, adde
yearly five daies, whereby the accompt of the circle of time returning into

                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> mentions upon this occasion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amasis</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> entring into contestation with the King
of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> concerning wisedome, propounded these questions
to be resolved by him; <hi>what is oldest of all things, what fairest, what
greatest, what wisest, what most common, what most profitable, what
most hurtfull, what most powerfull, what most easie?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The answers of the</hi> Aethiopian <hi>were these, the oldest of things
is time, the wisest Truth, the fairest Light, the most common
Death, the most profitable God, the most hurtfull the Devill,
the most powerfull Fortune, the most easie that which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.</hi>
Thales <hi>demanded of</hi> Niloxenus, <hi>whether</hi> Amasis <hi>approved
these solutions?</hi> Niloxenus, <hi>who was sent by</hi> Amasis <hi>into Greece
with these other questions to be resolved by the Sages, answered
that with some he was satisfied, with others not;</hi> and yet, <hi>replyes</hi>
Thales, there is not one but is erroneus and betrayes ignorance. As for the
first, how can it be defended that Time is the oldest of things, when one part
of it is past, the other present, the third yet to come, for that which is to
come must in reason be esteemed younger then all men or things? Next to
to affirme the truth is wisedome, is as much as if we should say, that the
Light and seeing are all one. Againe, if he esteeme Light faire, why doth
he forget the Sunne? His answers concerning God and the Devill are bold
and dangerous, but that of Fortune most improbable, for if she be so
powerfull, how comes it that she is so easily changed. Nor is Death the most
common, for it is not common to the Living. The most ancient of things
is God, for he never had beginning or birth, the greatest place of the world
containeth all other things, place containes the world; the fairest the
world, for whatsoever is order dispos'd, is part thereof. The wisest is time,
for it hath found out all things already devis'd, and will find out all that
shall be; the most common hope, for that remaines with such as have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else; the most profitable, vertue, for it muketh all things usefull &amp;

fearing the greatnesse of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and encourag'd thereunto, as he
conceiv'd, by the Oracle, sent Ambassadours and presents to

<hi>be of a contrary opinion, who gives this account of both.</hi> When
<hi>Croesus</hi> was come to the River <hi>Halys,</hi> then, I beleeve, by bridges that
were there, he passed over his Army; but the common report of the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
is, that <hi>Thales</hi> the Milesian was he who conveigh'd it over: For
<hi>Croesus</hi> being doubtfull over what part of the River his Army should
passe, there being in those daies no Bridges, <hi>Thales,</hi> who was in the sield
with him, is said to have caused the River that did run on the left hand
of the Army, to run also on the right, which he brought to pass thus. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
above the trench, he digged a deep trench, and brought it in the
fashion of a halfe Moon, that the River being turned into the trench from
the former channell at the back of the Army, and passing by the camp,
came into the old channell again, so that assoon as the River was thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,

thus:</hi> As for taking one for the other, <hi>(viz. a Monarch for a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant)</hi>
I am of the same mind with the young man, who throwing a stone
at a Dog, hit his step-Mother; it is no matter, said he, for even so, it
lights not amisse, Truly I alwaies esteemed <hi>Solon</hi> very wise, for refusing
to be King of his own Country: and <hi>Pittacus,</hi> if he had not taken upon
him a Monarchy, would never have said, how hard it is to be a good man:
and <hi>Periander</hi> being seiz'd (as it were an hereditary disease derived
from his father) by the same Tyranny, did very well to endeavour as much
as he could to disengage himselfe from it, by frequenting the conversation
of the best men, inviting Sages, and Philosophers, and being invited by
them, not approving the dangerous counsell of <hi>Thrasibulus,</hi> my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who perswaded him to take off the heads of the chiefest. For a Tyrant,
who chooseth rather to command slaves then free-men, is like a husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who preferreth the gathering of locusts, and catching of foul, before
reaping of good corn. These soveraign authorities have only this good,
in recompense of many evills, a kind of honour and glory, if men be so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
that in ruling good men, they themselves prove betterj as for such, who
in their office aim at nothing but security, without respect of honour or
honesty, they are fitter to be set over beasts then men.</p>

about the government of the commonwealth, whereby
they were divided into as many factions, as the Province con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
distinctions of people; the Citizens were Democraticall,
the countrymen affected Olygarchy, the maritimes stood for a
mixt kind of government, and hindred both the other parties
from having the rule; at the same time the City was in a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
condition, by reason of a dissension betwixt the rich and
the poor, arising from their inequality, the businesse seemed
impossible to be composed, but by a Monarchy; the commons
were generally oppressed by the mony which they had borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the rich, and either had tilled their land, paying to them
the sixth part of the crop, whence they were called <hi>Hectemoru,</hi>
and <hi>Thetes,</hi> or ingaged their bodies to their creditors, whereof
some served at home, others were sold abroad, many also (there
being no law to the contrary) were necessitated to sell their
children, and leave the City, through the cruelty of these usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51150:26"/>
the greatest part (such as had most courage amongst
them) assembling together, mutually exhorted one another not
to indure these things any longer, but choosing some trusty man
to be their leader, to discharge those that paid not their mony
at the set day, to share the land, and quite invert the State of
the comwon-wealth. The discreetest amongst the Athenians
looking upon <hi>Solon</hi> as a person free from any crime, (neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged

and to compose the differences of the people. <hi>Phanias</hi>
the Lesbian affirmeth, that for preservation of the State, he
deceived both parties, promising under-hand to the poor, a
division of the land; the rich, to make good their contracts;
but that he first made scruples of undertaking the businesse, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred

at once a peace-maker, and a law-giver, acceptable to the rich,
as rich, and to the poor, as good; the people had often in their
mouths this saying of his, <hi>equality breeds no strife,</hi> which pleased
alike both parties, one side understanding it of number and
measure, the other of worth and vertue; upon which hope,
the most powerfull of both factions courted him much, and
desired him to take upon him the tyranny of that common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
which he had now in his power, offering themselves
to his assistance: Many also of the moderate part seeing how
laborious and difficult it would be to reform the state by reason
and law, were not unwilling to have a Prince created, such an
one as were most prudent and just: some affirme he received
this Oracle from <hi>Apollo,</hi>
                        <q>

                     </p>
                     <p>But he was most of all reproved by his familiar friends, for
being deterred by the name of a Tyrannie, as if the virtue of a
King were not diffus'd through the Kingdome, instancing in

a Tyranny was a faire possession, but it had no passage out: to

side he should interest himselfe in the common danger,
and assist, rather then out of all hazard, expect which side
should get the better. When we did read (saith <hi>Agellius</hi>) this law
of <hi>Solon,</hi> a person indued with singular wisdome, at first were
mained in great suspence and admiration, enquiring for what
reason he judged those worthie of punishment, who withdrew
themselves from sedition and civill war; then one whose sight
pierced more deeply into the use and meaning of the law, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
the intent thereof was not to encrease, but appease se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
and so indeed it is, for if all good persons, who in the
beginning are too few to restrain a sedition, should not deterre
the distracted raging people, but dividing themselves, adhere
to either side, it would follow, that they being separated as
partakers of both factions, the parties might be temper'd and
govern'd by them, as being persons of greatest authority; by
which means they might restore them to peace, and reconcile

<q>It is a Law generally received in all Citties, that he who

of the Judges, whether that Law seemed to them just and
commendable, whereunto they assenting, he added, that he
conceived mony to be used amongst Citizens, in respect of
private contracts; but that lawes were the mony of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth:
therefore Judges ought to punish those, who
embased the mony of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth much more severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then those who embase that of private persons: and that
they might better understand it to be a farre greater offence

any prejudice to themselves; but whosoever should use lawes
so adulterated, could not escape ruine and death.</q>

                        <hi>SOlon</hi> at his departure from <hi>Athens</hi> received invitations from

by <hi>Epimenides,</hi> to <hi>Creet,</hi> by <hi>Cleobulus</hi> to <hi>Lindus,</hi> as is evident from

descended from <hi>Codrus:</hi> that which the Athenians having
sworn to give to <hi>Codrus</hi> and his heirs, took away, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered;
no otherwise do I offend either God or man; I take
care that the common-wealth be governed according to the
lawes you ordained for the Athenians, and that better then
by a Democratie: I suffer none to do wrong, neither do I
enjoy any priviledges of a Tyrant, more then honour and
dignity, such rewards only as were conferr'd upon the antient
Kings; every man paies the tenth of his estate, not to me, but
to the maintenance of publick sacrifices, or other charges of
the common-wealth, or against time of war. You I blame not
for discovering my intents, you did it more in love to the
state, then in hate to me; besides, you knew not what go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
I meant to establish, which if you had, perhaps you
would have brooked my rule, and not banisht your selfe;
returne therefore home, and believe me without an oath:
<hi>Solon</hi> shall never receive any displeasure from <hi>Pisistratus,</hi> you
know my very enemies have not, and if you will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to be of my friends, you shall be of the first, for I never
saw anything in you deceitfull or false; if otherwise, you
will live with the Athenians, use your freedome, only deprive
not your selfe of your country for my sake.</q>

the Officers at <hi>Croesus</hi> appointment lead him into the treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to shew him all their greatnesse and riches; when he had
beheld all, <hi>Croesus</hi> spoke thus unto him. <q>Athenian guest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we have heard much fame of your wisdome and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
having out of love to Philosophy travelled into many
Countries, I have a desire to enquire of you if ever you saw
any man whom you could call most happy.</q> This he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
hoping himselfe to be esteemed such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Solon</hi> nothing flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him, answered according to the truth, saying, <q>O King,
<hi>Tellus</hi> the Athenian.</q> At which speech <hi>Croesus</hi> wondering.
Why do you judge <hi>Tellus</hi> the most happy? Because (replied
<hi>Solon</hi>) in a well ordered state, he had children honest and
good, and saw every one of those have children all living;
thus having passed his life as well as is possible for man, he
ended it gloriously: a fight happening between the Athenians
and their neighbours in <hi>Eleusis,</hi> he came in to their succour, and
and putting the enemy to flight, died nobly; the Athenians
buried him in the place where he fell, with much honour.
Whilst <hi>Solon</hi> recounted the happinesse of <hi>Tellus, Croesus</hi> being
mov'd, demanded to whom he assign'd the next place,
making no question but himselfe should be named a second.
<q>
                           <hi>Cleobis</hi> (saith he) and <hi>Bito,</hi> they were Argives by birth,
they had sufficient wherewithall to maintain themselves;
and withall, so great strength of body, that both were
alike victors in the publick games, of whom it is thus
reported; the Argives celebrating the feastivall of <hi>Iuno,</hi> it
was necessary their Mother should be drawn to the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
by a pair of Oxen, there being no Oxen in the field
ready, these young men, streitned in time, under went
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51150:38"/>
the yoke, and drew the chariot of their Mother fortie five
stadia, till they came to the Temple; when they had so done,
in the sight of all the people, they obtain'd the happiest end
of their daies, whereby the God declared it better for a man
to die then to live; the Argive, pressing about them, the men
applauding the piety of the Sons, the Women the happinesse
of the Mother, the Mother her selfe infinitely joyed with the
action, and the glory thereof, standing before the image, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Goddesse to give her sons, <hi>Cleobis</hi> and <hi>Bito</hi> the best thing
that could happen to man; after this prayer, having sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
and feasted, they lay down to sleep in the Temple, and
never waked more, but so ended their daies: their Images (as
of most excellent persons) were made by the Argives, and set
up at <hi>Delphi.</hi> These <hi>Solon</hi> ranked in the second degree. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
<hi>Croesus</hi> growing angry; stranger (said he) doth our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
seem so despicable, that you will not rank us equall
with private persons? He answered, do you enquire <hi>Croesus</hi>
concerning human affairs of me, who know, that divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is severe and full of alteration? In processe of time we
see many things we would not, we suffer many things we
would not; let us propose seventy yeers, as the term of mans
life, which yeares consist of twenty five thousand and two
hundred daies, besides the additionall month, if we make one
year longer then another by that Month, to make the time
accord the additionall months, belonging to those seventy
years, will be thirty five, the daies of those months a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
and fiftie, whereof one is not in all things like another:
so that every man, O <hi>Croesus,</hi> is miserable! you appear to me
very rich, and are King over many, but the question you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
I cannot resolve, untill I hear you have ended
your daies happily; he who hath much wealth is not happier,
then he who gets his living from day to day, unlesse fortune
continuing all those good things to him, grant that he die
well. There are many men very rich, yet unfortunate, many
of moderate estates, fortunate, of whom, he who abounds in
wealth, and is not happy, exceeds the fortunate only in two
things, the other him in many; the rich is more able to satisfie
his desires, and to overcome great injuries; yet the fortunate
excells him, he cannot indeed inflict hurt on others, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
his own desires, his good fortune debarres him of these:
but he is free from ills, healthfull, happy in his children,
and beautifull, if to this a man dies well, that is he whom you
seek, who deserves to be called happy; before death he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be stil'd happy, but fortunate; yet for one man to obtain
all this is impossible, as one country cannot furnish it selfe
with all things, some it hath, others it wants, that which
hath most is best; so in men, no one is perfect, what one hath,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51150:38"/>
the other wants; he who hath constantly most, and at last
quietly departs this life, in opinion, O King, deserves to bear
that name. In every thing we must have regard to the end,
whether it tends for many, to whom God dispenceth all good
fortunes, he at last utterly subverts. This story is related by
<hi>Plutarch,</hi> also mentioned by <hi>Laertius,</hi> who addes, that <hi>Croesus</hi>
being magnificently adorned and seated on his Throne, asked
him, <hi>whether he had ever seen any thing more glorious?</hi> who answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

                        <hi>Solon</hi> after this discourse with <hi>Croesus,</hi> not soothing
him, or making any esteem of him, was dismissed, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted

the future.<note n="*" place="margin">Plut.</note> 
                        <hi>Aesope,</hi> the writter of fables was at that time at

favour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was grieved to see <hi>Solon</hi> so unthankfully dismist, and
said to him, <hi>Solon,</hi> we must either tell Kings nothing at all, or
what may please them. No, saith <hi>Solon,</hi> either nothing at all, or
what is best for them. Thus was <hi>Solon</hi> much despised by <hi>Croesus.</hi>

                        <q>Afterwards <hi>Croesus</hi> being taken prisoner by <hi>Cyrus</hi> was at
his command fettered and set upon a great pile of wood to be
burned: as he was in this posture, it came into his minde what
<hi>Solon</hi> had divinely said to him, that no living man is happy; as
soone as he remembred those words, he fell into a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Spirit, and sighing deeply, named <hi>Solon</hi> thrice, which
<hi>Cyrus</hi> hearing, commanded the interpreters to aske upon
whom he called, they went to him and asked, he was silent,
at last pressing him further he answered, <hi>upon him who I desire
above all wealth, might have spoken with all tyrants;</hi> not understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
after much pressure and importunity, he told them, <hi>Solon

it at nothing moreover that all which he told him had come to passe, nor
did it more belong to him then to all mankind, especially to those who think
themselves happy.</hi> Whilst <hi>Croesus</hi> said this, the fire began to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
and the outward parts thereof to be seized by the flame.
<hi>Cyrus</hi> being informed by an interpreter of all that <hi>Croesus</hi> said,
began to relent, knowing himselfe to be but a man, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
another man, nothing inferiour to him in wealth, to
be burned alive, fearing to be punished for that act, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering

one thing only, which whether it were done amisse or not, I
am uncertain: I sat with two others as Judge upon the life of
my friend; the law was such, as the person must of necessity
be condemned; so that either my friend must lose his life, or
some deceit be used towards the Law: revolving many things
in my mind for relief of a condition so despeate, I conceived
that which I put in practise to be of all other the most easie
to be born: Silently I condemned him, and perswaded those
others who judged to absolve him: Thus preserved (in so
great a businesse) the dutie both of a judge and friend; but
from that act I receive this trouble, that I fear it is not free
from perfidiousnesse and guilt, in the same businesse, at the

the Islanders, saith he, have bought a world of horses, intending an
expedition against <hi>Sardis;</hi> and <hi>Croesus</hi> thinking he had spoken truth,
answered, I wish the Gods would put it in their minds to come against the
Lydians on horse-back; he replyed, it is not without reason, great King,
that you wish and hope to catch the Islanders on horse-back in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent;

your preparation to set out a Navie against them) that they may catch the
Lydians upon the Sea, and revenge the cause of those inland Grecians
whom you have reduc'd to servitude. <hi>Croesus</hi> much delighted with this
speech, and disswaded (for it seemed to him he spoke very ingeniously)
from building a Navy, gave it over, and contracted amity with the Ionian
Islands.</p>

He is unfortunate, who cannot bear misfortune. It is a
disease of the mind to desire such things as cannot be obtained, and to be
unmindfull of the miseries of others. To one that asked what is hard, he
answered, to bear couragiously a change to the worse. Being at sea in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with wicked, who, a storm arising, called upon the Gods; hold your
peace, saith he, lest they know you are here. To a wicked man enquiring
what was piety, he was silent, the other asking the reason of his silence:
I answer not, saith he, because you enquire after that which nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
you. Being demanded what is sweet to mankind, he answered, Hope.
It is better to decide a difference betwixt our enemies then friends, for
one of the friends will certainly become an enemie, one of the enemies, a
friend. Being asked what a man did with delight, he answered, gain by
labour. We should so live, as though our life would be both long and short:
So love, as if hereafter we might hate, conversing in friendship with cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
remembring that it may possibly convert to enmity.</p>

Virgins in years, Matrons in discretion: implying, that the Virgins also
should be instructed, <hi>which the Greeks used not, the Romans
brought them up in the liberall sciences.</hi> Do good to your friend that
he may be more your friend, your enemy that he may become your friend:
for we should beware of the calumny of friends, of the treachery of nemies:
When any man goeth forth, let him consider what he is to do, when he

                     <p>The <hi>Bacchiadae</hi> who could not comprehend the meaning of
this Oracle, when they heard that to <hi>Eetion,</hi> understood their
owne by the affinity it had with the other, and thereupon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
design'd amongst themselves to kill <hi>Eetions</hi> child. His
wife being delivered, they sent ten men of their owne to the
tribe wherein <hi>Eetion</hi> dwelt, that they should murder the Infant;
when thy came to <hi>Petra</hi> to <hi>Eetions</hi> house, they demanded the
child. <hi>Labda</hi> (not knowing their intent, but thinking they came
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51150:58"/>
to congratulate with the Father,) brings her sonne, and gives
him into the hands of one of them: they had agreed (upon the
way) that he into whose hands the child were delivered should
dash out its braines against the ground, but by divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
the child smiling upon him to whom <hi>Labda</hi> had given it,
he was moved therewith to such compassion, that he could not
finde in his heart to kill it, but delivered it to another, he to a
third, untill at last it past through the hands of all the ten; None
of them having power to kill it, they restored it to the mother.
Then going forth and standing before the doore, they began to
finde fault with one another, but chiefly with him who tooke
the child first, for not performing the agreement; after some
debate, they agreed to goe in all and bee equall sharers in the
murther; but it was decreed that <hi>Eetions</hi> child should bee the
oppressour of <hi>Corinth,</hi> for <hi>Labda</hi> standing at the doore heard all
their discourse, and fearing lest their mindes changing, they
should murther it, carried away the child, and hid it in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of corne (called <hi>Cypsela</hi>) a place which she conceived they
could never search if they returned, and so it fell out: They
came back and sought all about; when they could not finde
him, they agreed amongst themselves to tell those who sent
them, they had done what they required, and returning home,
did so. <hi>Eetions</hi> son growing up was called <hi>Cypselus</hi> from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
he had escaped in the corne-measure; when he came to mans
estate, he consulted with the Delphian Oracle, and received a
doubtfull answer, in confidence whereof he attempted <hi>Corinth</hi>
and tooke it, the Oracle was this,
<q>

grew very rigid upon this occasion. His mother, whilst he was
very young, kept him much in her company, when he grew
more in years, fell in love with him; with time, her passion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
to such extremity, that she could no longer suppresse it;
assuming confidence, she told her son, there was a beautifull
Lady fallen in love with him, and advised him not to slight her
affection. He answer'd, he would not transgresse law and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
by touching a married woman. His mother pressed him
with intreaties; at last he consented; she appointed a night, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising
him not to have any light in his chamber, nor to constrain
the Lady to speak, but to excuse her for modestie's sake. <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
engaged himself to do all she directed. She, attired as rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as she could, went to his chamber, and departed again before
day-break: on the morrow she enquired if he were pleased, and
if the Lady should come again to him. <hi>Periander</hi> said, it was
his chiefest desire, and that he affected her excessively. From
that time she visited her son often: he, at last, was moved with
a great curiosity to know who she was, and solicited his mother
very importunately that he might have some discourse and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with her, seeing he was so much taken with love
of her, affirming it was unreasonable, he should be denyed the
sight of one, with whom he had so often a neerer acquaintance.
His mother affirm'd it could not be done, in respect to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
of the Lady. Hereupon he gave one of his servants order
to hide a light in his chamber: she came as she used, and when
she was asleep, <hi>Periander</hi> rose, took the light, and seeing it was
his mother, was about to have killed her, but with-held by
some genius or apparition, forebore: From that time forward
he was troubled in mind, grew cruell, and killed many of his
subjects. His mother, much accusing her unhappy genius, slew
her selfe. <hi>Laertius</hi> saith, they were both conscious hereof,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51150:59"/>

word to the messenger, and so sent him home; where being

which he understanding, offered to give them all so they would
save his life; they refusing, bad him lay violent hands upon
himselfe, if he would be buried in his own Country, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to leap immediately into the sea. <hi>Arion</hi> reduced to this
extremity, intreated them to give him leave to put on his
richest ornaments, and so standing upon the poop of the ship,
to play a tune, promising, assoon as he had done, to deliver
himselfe into their hands. The men moved with a great desire
to hear the most excellent Lutinist in the world, retired from
the poop to the middle of the ship: he puts on his best orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and standing upon the poop, began that tune which
they call the morning hymne, assoon as he had ended it, he
threw himselfe into the Sea, with his ornaments and Lute;
the ship sailed on to <hi>Corinth.</hi> It is reported a Dolphin took
him upon his back, and caryed him to <hi>Taenarus,</hi> where he lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

he leaped out of the ship, whereat they were so confounded,
they could not say any thing in their own defence. This is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested

moderated the mournings of the Citizens, he added some sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices

(which was of greatest concernment) by propitiations, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,

staied the Pestilence in this manner: He took sheep, black and
white, and brought them into the Areopagus; there he let them
loose, to go whither they would, giving order to those who
followed them, that whensoever any of them lay down, they
should sacrifice in that place to the proper Deitie, whereby the
Plague ceased. Hence it is, that at this day, (saith <hi>Laertius</hi>) are
to be seen in many Athenian Villages, namelesse Altars, monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

grounds these: First, because, according to the common rule
of naturall Philosophers, of nothing proceeds nothing, it is not
possible any thing can be made of that which is not; or that
which hath a being can be resolved into that which hath none,
Secondly, because contraries are made mutually of each other,
therefore they were in each other before; for if it be necessary,
that whatsoever is made, be made of that which is, or is not,
but that it should be made of that which is not impossible,
wherein all agree, that ever discoursed upon nature, it followes
necessarily, that they be made of things that are, and are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> adds, that it was in his time not onely shewen, but

this stone upon the fourth yeare of the 78. Olympiad, which is
two yeares after <hi>Pliny</hi> accompts of the prediction. <hi>Silenus</hi> cited
by <hi>Laertius,</hi> saith, it fell when <hi>Dimylus</hi> was Archon, which if it be
to be red <hi>Dyphilus</hi> (for the other name is not to be found neere
these times) will be the first yeare of the 84 Olympiad. But the
marble at <hi>Arundell House</hi> (graven about the 129. Olympiad to be
preferred before any other chronologicall accompt) expressly
names the fall upon the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> yeare upon the 77. Olympiad, when
<hi>Theagenides</hi> was Archon, two yeares before. <hi>Pliny</hi> saith it was
foretold. It was beleeved to have portended (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies)
the great defeat given to the <hi>Athenians</hi> by <hi>Lysander</hi> at the

<q>It was a stone snatched up by the wind, and fell in the

by<note n="*" place="margin">Vit. Lysand.</note> 
                        <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who hath this large discourse upon it: <q>It is
said that <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> did prognosticate that one of the bodies
included the Heavens it should be loosed by shaking, &amp; fall to
the ground, the Stars are not in place where they were first cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
they are heavie bodies, of the nature of stone, shining by
reflection of the aether, being drawn up by force, &amp; kept there
by the violence of that circular motion, as at the beginning in
the first separation of things, cold &amp; heavie they were restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
There is another opinion more probable which saith,
those which we call falling starres are not fluxions of the ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
extinguisht in the aire almost as soon as lighted, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations
or combustions of any part of the aire, which by
it spreadeth upwards, but they are coelestiall bodies failing
of their retention by the ordinary course of heaven throwne
downe, not upon the habitable earth, but into the Sea, which
is the cause we doe not see them; yet the assertion of <hi>Anax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agoras</hi>
                           <pb n="15" facs="tcp:51150:79"/>
is confirmed by <hi>Damachus,</hi> who writeth in his book of
Religion, that 75. daies together before this stone fell, they
saw a great body of fire in the Air like a cloud enflamed,
which tarried not in one place, but went and came uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
removing, from the driving whereof issued flashes of
fire that fell in many places like falling starrs; when this great
body of fire fell in that part of the Earth, the Inhabitants em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned,
came to the place to see what it was, and found no
appearance of fire but a great stone on the ground, nothing, in
comparison of that body of fire. Herein <hi>Damachus</hi> had need
of favourable hearers: But if what he saith be true, he confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
those Arguments who maintain it was a piece of a Rock
by the force of a boistrous wind torn from the top of a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and carried in the air so long as this whirlwind continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but so soon as that was laid, the stone fell immediately;
unlesse this lightning body which appeared so many daies
was fire indeed, which coming to dissolve, and to be put out
did beget this violent storm of force to tear off the stone, and
cast it down.</q>

                        <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who thereupon
observes it as the effect rather of Providence, then of chance,
that their birth-daies should be so near, and that of the Master
precede the Scholer's.</p>
                     <p>To accommodate this time with our accompt, is neither ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
nor certain, yet in respect it may give some satisfaction by
way of conjecture, we shall found it upon these hypotheses, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that order of months which <hi>Petavius</hi> gives.</p>
                     <p>1. That after the Olympiads the beginning of the Grecian
year was alwaies on the first of <hi>Hecatombaeon,</hi> and Olympick
games on the 15th.</p>
                     <p>2. That the Neomenia of <hi>Hecatombaeon,</hi> did (at least in the
times wherein we enquire) never precede the solstice, being
then about the Calends, or <hi>pridie Calendarum Iulij,</hi> they supposing
them in <hi>octavis signorum,</hi> it did not precede the ninth of <hi>Iuly.</hi>
This <hi>postulatum,</hi> though it be doubly question'd by <hi>Petavius,</hi>
yet none of his Argumen ts pretend beyond <hi>Meton's</hi> time.</p>
                     <p>3. That upon that supposition, if <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath rightly order'd
the Neomenia in his Olympick period (against which <hi>Petavius</hi>
brings no one sufficient Argument) and consequently the rest,
the Olympick period doth certainly exhibi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t the Neomenia of
<hi>Hecatombaeon.</hi> It is true that <hi>Petavius</hi> disputes the period of 76
years, as having never been used till <hi>Calippus</hi> his time, but we
take it here onely proleptically, as the Julian year, to which
we would accomodate it.</p>
                     <p>4. That this being after <hi>Solon's</hi> time, the Civill year was Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
(and consisted of months, which were alternately of 29. and
30. daies,) at <hi>Athens,</hi> though diverse places of <hi>Greece,</hi> especially
the more remote from thence, did not for a long time after part
with their tricenary months.</p>
                     <p>These things supposed the sixt of <hi>Thargelion,</hi> (will according
to the Julian accompt taken proleptically) fall upon Tuesday
the twentieth of <hi>May:</hi> according to the Gregorian, upon
Tuesday the thirtieth of <hi>May,</hi> in the year of the Julian period,
4247. before the Incarnation 467. years, the fourth year of the
77. Olympiad, at what time <hi>Socrates</hi> was born.</p>

what he disliked, nor diverting him from that whereto he was
enclined; to give thanks for him by Sacrifice to <hi>Iupiter Agoraeus</hi>

guide of his life within him, better then five hundred masters.</p>

him to his own trade of carving Statues, contrary to his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

inconveniences and imperfections:<note n="*" place="margin">Xen. mem. 1. pag. 710.</note> First, That it was impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to leave those affaires which concern mankind, to enquire
into things without us. Secondly, That these things are above
the reach of man, whence are occasioned all disputes and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
some acknowledging no God, others worshipping
stocks and stones; some asserting one simple being, others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite;
some that all things are moved, others, that all things
are immovable. And Thirdly, that these things, if attained,
could not be practised, for he who contemplating divine myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
enquires by what necessity things were made, cannot
himselfe make any thing, or upon occasion produce winds, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
seasons, or the like.</p>
                     <p>Thus esteeming speculative knowledge as far only as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
to practice, he cut off in all sciences what he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

he allowed that part which teacheth measuring, as no lesse

which he had none from him, but by being neer him, seeing

                     <p>And not only to particular persons, but to generall affairs
did these predictions extend: He foretold some friends the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat

and mentioned by himself in <hi>Plato,</hi> where he gives another fair

speaking of a businesse, whereof the event was at that time

men; of which Victory the Ephesians erected two trophies.
this was in the twentie one year of the Peloponnesian war.</p>
                     <p>We have alledg'd the universall consent of Authors, that
<hi>Socrates</hi> had such a spirituall attendant; yet is there some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
concerning the name, more concerning the nature of
it.</p>
                     <p>It is commonly named his <hi>Daemon,</hi> by which title, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
owned it: <hi>Plato</hi> sometimes calls it his <hi>Guardian, Apuleius</hi>
his God, <hi>because</hi> (saith Saint<note n="*" place="margin">De civ. dei. 8. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Augustine) the name of</hi> Daemon <hi>at
last grew odious.</hi> But we must observe, that he did not account it
a God, but sent from God, and in that sence affirmed the
signes to come from God, to wit, by mediation of this spirit.
This, besides other places we may argue from his first Epistle,
where he speaks of the sign it selfe; he useth the word <hi>Daemon,</hi>
when of the advise, whereof that sign was the instrument, he
names God. Thus are we to understand these, and all other
places of the same nature in <hi>Plato,</hi> where <hi>Socrates</hi> speaking of
the <hi>Daemon</hi> saith, <hi>if it please God, you shall learn much, and the sign
from God did not offer to stay me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the signe or manner of the prediction,<note n="*" place="margin">Plutarch. de gen. Socr.</note> some affirme
it was <hi>by sneezing, either of himselfe or others; if any chanced to sneeze
standing before him, behind him, or on his right hand, he went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
about that which he intended; if on the left hand, he refrained or
desisted: if he sneezed himselfe before the enterprise, it was applausive,
if in the action, disswasive.</hi> There needs not much argument to
prove this opinion. If this sternutation proceeded either from
chance, or his naturall constitution, it could not have that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
supernaturall effect; if it proceeded from some more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51150:95"/>
outward cause, we recurre to the Genius.</p>
                     <p>Others confine this prescience within the soule of <hi>Socrates</hi>
himself, that he said, <hi>his Genius advised him,</hi> they interpret it, as
we usually say, <hi>his mind gave him, or so inclined him:</hi> In this sense
indeed <hi>Daemon</hi> is not seldome taken; but this is inconsistent
with the description which <hi>Socrates</hi> gives of a voice and signes,

                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> having exploded the opinion of <hi>Terpsion</hi> concerning

from the Sea by his Gallyes, and on the land side by a wall:

                              </gap>enians</hi> would entertain a charge against his life;
for to have accused him upon the very first, he conceived
unsafe, as well for the reason already mentioned, as lest
the friends and followers of <hi>Socrates</hi> should divert the anger
of the Judges upon himselfe, for falsely accusing a person so
far from being guilty of any wrong to the State, that he
was the only ornament thereof. To this end he subbornes
<hi>Aristophanes,</hi> a Comick Poet, whose only businesse was to
raise mirth, to bring <hi>Socrates</hi> upon the Stage, taxing him with
crimes which most men knew him free from, impertinent
discourse, making an ill cause by argument seem good, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
new and strange deities, whilst himselfe believed
and reverenced none; hereby to insinuate an ill opinion of
him, even into those who most frequented him. <hi>Aristophanes</hi>
taking this Theme, interweaves it with much abusive mirth;
the best of the Grecians was his subject, not <hi>Cleon</hi> the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonians,</hi>
the <hi>Thebans,</hi> or <hi>Pericles</hi> himselfe, but a person dear
to all the Gods, especially <hi>Apollo.</hi> At first (by reason of the
novelty of the thing, the unusuall personating of <hi>Socrates</hi>
                           <pb n="32" facs="tcp:51150:100"/>
upon the Stage) the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who expected nothing lesse,
were struck with wonder: Then, (being naturally envious
apt to detract from the best persons, not only of such as
bore office in the common-wealth, but any that were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
for learning or vertue) they begun to be taken with the
<hi>Clouds,</hi> (so was the play named) and cried up the actour that
personated <hi>Socrates</hi> with more applause, then ever any before,
giving him with many shouts the victory, and sending word
to the Judges that they should set down no name but that of
<hi>Aristophanes. Socrates</hi> came seldome to the Theater, unlesse
when <hi>Euripides</hi> contested with any new Tragaedian, there,
or in the <hi>Pyraeum,</hi> then he went, for he affected the wisdome,
goodnesse, and sweetnesse of his verse; sometimes <hi>Alcibiades</hi>
and <hi>Critias</hi> would invite him to a Comedy, and in a manner
compell him; for he was so far from esteeming Comedians,
that he contemned them, as lying, abusive, and unprofitable;
whereat they were much displeased: These (with other
things suggested by <hi>Anytus</hi> and <hi>Melitus</hi>) were the ground of
<hi>Aristophanes</hi> his Comaedy, who, it is likely, got a great summe
of money by it, they being eager in prosecution of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
and he prepared by want, and malice to receive their
impression: In fine, the play got extraordinary credit, that
of <hi>Cratinus</hi> being verified,</q>

the Stage and often named, (nor was it much the Players

their stone-jugs) the strangers that were present (not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

(for he came not thither by chance, but because he
knew himselfe should be abused in the play, had chosen the

by <hi>Hermogenes</hi> son of <hi>Hipponicus,</hi> 
                        <q>I provide apology enough
(saith he) in considering &amp; pursuing the constant course of my
life; <hi>Hermogenes</hi> demanding how that could be? because
(saith he) I never did any unjust act, which I conceive the best
apologie: but we often see Judges (saith <hi>Hermogenes</hi>) over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swai'd
by Rhetorick, to condemne the innocent and acquit
the guilty: the truth is, (replyed <hi>Socrates</hi>) going about to
make my apology, I was twice withheld by the Daemon,
whereat <hi>Hermogenes</hi> wondring, is it strange (continues hee)
that God should think it fit for me to dy at this time? hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
no man hath lived more uprightly, which as it is now my
greatest comfort, so it was the greatest delight to my selfe

and friends; if I live longer, I know I mustundergoe what
is proper to old age, defects of hearing and sight, slownesse
to apprehend, aptness to forget, how can I then be pleased to
live longer and grow worse: It is likely God in his love to mee
hath ordained that I should die in the most convenient age,
and by the gentlest meanes, for if I die by sentence, I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the benefit of the most easie kind of death; I shall give
my friends the least trouble, I shall doe nothing unseemely
before those that are present, and shall depart sound in body
and soule; is not this very desirable? God with much reason
forbids me to make any defence; If I could effect it, I should
onely stay longer to be taken away by the torment of diseases
and imperfections of age, which truly <hi>Hermogenes</hi> I desire not;
If when I give an accompt of my actions towards God and
men, the Judges think fit to condemne me, I will rather chufe
to die then to beg <hi>of them a life worse then death.</hi>

this knowledge, that (as he saith) I do not worship those
Gods the City worships? Others have seen me (and to might
<hi>Melitus</hi> if he had pleas'd) sacrifice at common festivalls on
the publick Altars; How do I introduce new deities when I
professe to be directed in all my actions by the voice of God?
they who observe the notes of birds, or answers of men, are
guided by the voice: none doubts of thunder whether it bee
loud or oraculous; Doth not the Priestesse on the Tripod con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
to us by voice what the God delivers to her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that
he foreknowes events, communicating them to whom plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
him, all men (as well as I) believe and professe: others
call those that foretell events, Augurs, Soothsayers and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
I the Daemon, and (I conceive) more religiously then
they who ascribe a Divine power to birds: That I am no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor,
herein many can attest, who have asked my advice,
and never found it fail.</q>(Here there arose a murmur in the

he should surpasse them in such a particular favour of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity;)
<q>Let such as are incredulous hear this also to confirm
their opinion that I am not favour'd of the Gods; when <hi>Chae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rephon</hi>
in the presence of many witnesses question'd the Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phian
Oracle concerning me, <hi>Apollo</hi> answered, that no man
was more free, more just, or more wise;</q> (here another mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
arose amongst the Judges: he proceeded) <q>Yet the same
God faid more of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the Lacedaemonian Lawgiver, that
he knew not whether to call him a God or a man; me he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
not with the Gods, though he gave me the priority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men. But trust not the God herein, consider me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
your selves; whom know you lesse a servant to corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall
pleasures? whom more free? I accept not either rewards
or gifts? who more just then he who so conformes himself to
the present time, as he needs not help of any other? who
will say he deserves not the title of wife, who since he was
able, never desisted to learn by enquiry all good possible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
that I took not this pains in vain, is evident in that, many
Citizens and strangers studious of virtue, prefer my conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
above all others: what is the reason that though all
men know I have no wealth to require them, so many desire
to oblige me by gifts? that I require no return from any, yet
engage so many? that when the City being besieged, every
one lamented his condition, I was no more mov'd then when
It was most flourishing? That whilst others lay out money on
outward things to please themselves, I furnish my self from
within, my self with things that please me better? If none can
disprove what I have said, deserve I not the commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
both of Gods and men? and yet you <hi>Melitus</hi> pretend that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51150:102"/>
with these instructions I corrupt youth; Every one
knowes what it is to corrupt youth; Can you name but
one that I of religious have made impious, of modest impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
of frugal, prodigall, of sober, debauch'd, of hardy effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate,

whom you have perswaded to be more obedient to you then
to their own Parents. That as far as concernes instruction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
Socrates, I confesse; this they know to be my proper

in Law-suits Counsellors before their kindred; do you
not in war prefer the most experienced souldiers to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
before your own allies? yes answers <hi>Melitus,</hi> 'tis fit we
should; and do you think it reason then, replies <hi>Socrates,</hi> if
others are preferr'd for such things as they are excellent in,
that, because in in the opinion of some, I have an advantage

                     <p>This and more (saith <hi>Xenophon)</hi> was said both by himselfe

It was the custom of <hi>Athens,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> observes, when any one
was cast, if the fault were not capitall, to impose a pecuniary
muict; when the Judges had voted in that manner, the guilty
person was asked the highest rate whereat he aestimated his
offence; The Judges willing to favour <hi>Socrates,</hi> propounded
that demand to him, Hee answered 25. (or as <hi>Eubulides</hi> saith,

and telling the Judges that (for what he stood accused) hee
deserved the highest honours and rewards, and daily suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
at the publick charge out of the Prytanaeum, which was
the greatest honour that was amongst the Graecians; with this
answer, the Iudges were so exasperated, that they condemned
him to death by 80. votes more.</p>

are, doubtlesse conscious to themselves of great impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety

now then before I was condemned, being nothing the more
guilty: They could not prove I named any new Gods for <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tr,

young men by inuring them to sufferance and frugality? of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall
offences, as Sacriledge, Theft, and Treason, my very
adversaries acquit me; which makes me wonder how I come
to be condemned to dye; yet that I dey unjustly will not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
me, it is not a reproach to me, but to those who condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
me; I am much satisfied with the example of <hi>Palamedes,</hi>
who suffered death in the like manner; he is much more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended

himselfe to the lawes of his Country, by living under their
government, and to violate them at last, were great
in justice: that by breaking Prison, he should not only draw
his friends into many inconveniences, but himselfe also into
many dangers, only to live and dye in exile; that it such a

his children well, but dying honestly, his friends would take

friends of his to visit him; we met in the Court where he
was tried, it being near the prison; where we entertain'd our
selves with discourse till the prison was open'd, then went in
unto him and spent many times the whole day with him: But
that day we met sooner then ordinary, for the evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as we came out of the Prison, we heard the ship was
come from <hi>Delos,</hi> and thereupon we appointed to meet early
the next morning at the usuall place, where being come, the
Porter came out to us, and told us that that we must stay a
while before we could be admitted, for the eleven Officers
were there taking off his fetters, having brought him word
that he must die to day: not long after he came out again, and
told us we might go in, where when we came, we found <hi>Socrates</hi>
his fetters newly taken off, and <hi>Xantippe</hi> sitting by him
with a child in her armes: She as soon as she saw us burst
forth into tears, and cried out ah, <hi>Socrates,</hi> this is the last time

(which you never did before) you have writ Poems, a

have question'd me about it, particularly <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

repeat this demand, what answer shall I give him? Tell him
(answers <hi>Socrates</hi> that truly I did it not to to contend with
him and his verses, but to comply with a dream (which I
have had more then once) enjoyning me to practise Musick;
in obedience whereunto I first made verses in honour of the
God whose feast this was; Then, conceiving it essential to a
Poet to write sictions, which of my self, I use not,
I made use of some of <hi>Aesops</hi> which I had in memory, as
they first came into my fancy; Tell <hi>Euenus</hi> this, and bid him
from me farewell, and if he be wise, follow me, for it seems
I must go hence to day, the Athenians have so order'd it.
What is that said <hi>Stmmtas</hi> which you bid <hi>Euemus</hi> do, I have
often conversed with him, but as far as I understand him, hee
will not be at all ready to be rul'd by you; what, saith he, is he

(replyed <hi>Socrates</hi>) and so will all who deserve that name;
but perhaps he will not lay violent hands upon himself, that
is not lawfull: and as he was speaking thus, he set down his
leg again to the ground, and sitting so, continued all the rest
of the dispute. Then <hi>Ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it should be prohibited to ones self, yet that a Philosopher
ought to desire to follow a dying person? he answered, men
are the possessions of God, would you not be angry if your

your power punish him? we must expect a suinmons from
God, an inevitable necessity (such as I have at this time) to

you then I did before the Judges: Truly did I not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
I should go to just Gods, and to men better then any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
I were inexcusable for contemning death; but I am sure
to go to the Gods, very good Masters, and hope to meet with
good men, and am of good courage, hoping that something of
man subsists after death, and that it is then much better with
the good then with the bad. Here <hi>Crito</hi> interrupting him, told
him that he who was to administer the poison, advis'd him to
speak little, &amp; not heat himself with dispute; for it agreed not
with that kind of poison, which some neglecting, had bin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to take it two or three times: mind him not said <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>
let him provide as much as may serve twice or thrice
if need be;</q> Then he proceeded in a large discourse to declare
that the chief office of a Philosopher is to meditate on death;
therefore he ought not to fear the approach of it; That as death
is the solution of the Soul from the Body, so is it the office of a
Philosopher to free the soul from corporeall affections; That if
we understand the better, the more the soul is disengaged from
sense, we shall understand most perfectly when she is wholly
freed from the body by death, which perfection of knowledge
is the sole end of Philosophy.</p>
                     <p>This part of the discourse ended, <hi>Cebes</hi> occasions the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it by the desiring him to prove the immortality of the
soule, which he doth first from the necessary succession of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
&amp; corruption as contraries, the ground of the <hi>Pythagorean</hi>
transmigration; next from the Soules manner of reasoning,
which being only by reminiscence argues it had a being before
the body (when it had perfect knowledge of those Ideas which
upon occasion of sensible objects it recovers) and consequently
shall subsist after it; much more is spoken by <hi>Plato</hi> under his
name, whereof almost all is manisestly <hi>Plato</hi> owne, nor is it
possible to select that which is not from the rest; the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

can doe nothing acceptable to us though you promise never

therefore he takes this care for my enterment; it seems
that what even no I told him that as soon as I have
taken the poyson I shall go to the joyes of the blessed, hath
been to little purpose; He was my bail, bound to the Iudges

The verses are much to this purpose. Other Poets have

advice, succeeds well, but what without God, is unprofitable
to the undertakers. The wisest Cities of <hi>Greec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Daemon, for I have met with not a few alike incredulous;
most of those that were in the Delian fight did not believe me;
I was then in armes, and fallied forth the City with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to skirmish, many of us were dispersed in flight, and as we
came to a certain way, the accustomed sign came upon me; I
stopt, and said, in my opinion, friends, we should not go this
way, for I heard the Daemons voice: the greater part were
angry, as if I had trifled at a time so serious; some few were
perswaded to go along with me another way, and got safe
home; one that came from the others brought word they were
all slain, some horsemen returning from the pursuit, had
fallen upon them, whom they at first resisted, but being at
last enclosed by them, who were more in number, they gave
back, and were in the end oppressed and killed; he that
brought this newes was dangerously wounded, and escaped
only by help of his shield. I have also by instructions from
God, foretold many events to particular persons.</p>
                     <p>You offer part of your Kingdome, and invite me to it, not
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51150:114"/>
as to a changed government, but to rule both your subjects
and your selfe: but I confesse, I have not learned to command,
and would no more undertake to rule, not knowing how then
to play at dice, having never been taught: And doubtlesse
if other men were of the same mind, there would be fewer
troubles in life; whereas now the confidence of such as are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
undertaking things they do not understand, occasions
these many disturbances: Hence is it, they make fortune greater
then she is, and by their own folly, increase her power. Besides,
I am not ignorant, that a King ought to be more honoured
and admired then a private person, and as I would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake

but had much rather be a footman, though the charge be lesse
honourable: the same is my opinion as touching Kings and
private persons, nor puffed up by ambition will I desire more
glorious afflictions: they who invented the fable of <hi>Bellerophon</hi>
seemed to imply something to this purpose, for he was opprest
with misfortunes, not because he sought to rise higher in place,
but for aiming at things above him, and being thrown down

such as are sollicitous for it, perhaps it is not unreasonable.
First, because whilst others study to be rich, I choose to live
meanly. Then though I might receive many gifts and legacies
from living and dead friends; yet I freely disclaim them, and
for a man thus enclined to be by others judged mad, is nothing

my habit the same in winter as in summer: I never wear shoes,

who lose their naturall complexion have recourse to paint.
So these losing the true glory of virtue which every one ought

courting vulgar applause with Largesses and feasts.

them a murmure that these things were not done without <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates;</hi>
within few daies they cited me to the Court, where
some complaints were preferr'd against me, and when I defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
my self, they commanded me to go to the Pyraeum to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<hi>Leon,</hi> their intention was to put him to death, that
they might enjoy his estate, and make me partner in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice;
when I refused, and said something to this effect that
I would never willingly subscribe to an unjust act; <hi>Charicles</hi>
was present, and inwardly vext, <hi>Socrates</hi> saith he, dost thou
think to talk thus peremptorily, and not suffer ten thousand

                     <p>As for you, some that were then present, reported that your
affairs succeed to your wish, that the Thebans in your exile
received you kindly, and will assist your return to their utmost.
Some were troubled at this news, and the more because it
lessen'd their hopes of supply from <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> for they who
came along with the Ambassadours, affirmed, that the Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians
were engaged in a great war, and the Ephori hearing

who had the Command, being withall instigated therunto
by the Corinthians and Thebans, and that the City might be
better govern'd under an Oligarchy then a Democracy. If all
this be true, and your affairs succeed as they report, there is
great likely hood that upon you, coming in with the Thebans,
the Lacedaemonians not aiding these, all things here may be
easily composed. Besides, many of the Natives who now are
quiet through fear, if they perceived never so little that you
were firme, will readily forsake this party, because in this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the City, nothing is left them entire, but through
many and continuall enormities all is in confusion; the greater
part is revolted as well as you, the rest if they had the least
encouragement from abroad would suffer the same that you
have. So that if no other, yet this example would manifest that

the greatest unhappinesse of Cities is the wickednesse of their

not desist, though they see all things go to ruine, but with what
they first troubled, think to settle affairs, continuing banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
sequestrations, and unjust deaths; not considering he is

of the <hi>Delphian</hi> Oracle. <hi>Xenophon</hi> went thither, and demanded
of <hi>Apollo</hi> to which of the Gods he should address his vowes and
sacrifice for the good successe of his intended journey. Hee was
answer'd, that he should sacrifice to those Gods to whom it
was due: Returning to <hi>Athens,</hi> he imparted this Oracle to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>
who blam'd him, because he had not demanded whether
it was best to stay or no, but (as already determined to goe)
how he might best perform his journey; Neverthelesse (saith
he) since you have so proposed your demand, you must do as
the Gods command: <hi>Xenophon</hi> having sacrificed according to

                     <p>MEeting with <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> amongst other things I asked
him what Philosophy you followed, he answered, the
same as <hi>Socrates.</hi> For this inclination I admired you, when you
lived at <hi>Athens,</hi> and now continue the same admiration for
your constancy above other students of wisdom; The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
argument to me of your virtue is, your being taken with
that man, if we may call the life of <hi>Socrates</hi> mortall. That there
are divine beings over us all know: wee worship them as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
us in power; what they are is neither easie to find, nor
lawfull to enquire. It concerns not servants to examine the
Nature and actions of their Masters, their duty is onely to
obey them; and which is most considerable, the more admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they deserve who busie themselves in those things which
belong to man; the more trouble this brings them, who affect
glory in vain unseasonable objects: For when (<hi>Aeschines</hi>) did
any man hear <hi>Socrates</hi> discourse of the Heavens, or advise his
Schollers to Mathematicall Demonstrations? we know he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
Musick no further then the Ear: But was alwaies dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
to his friends of some thing excellent; what is forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and justice and other virtues. These he called the proper
good of mankind; other things he said men could not arrive at;
or they were of kin to fables, such ridiculous things as are
taught by the supercilious professours of wisdom. Nor did hee
onely teach this; his practice was answerable; of which I have
written at large elsewhere, what I hope will not be unpleasing
to you, (though you know it already) to peruse. Let<note n="*" place="margin">Meaning Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, who added much of his own to the discour ses of Socrates and went to Aegypt, Italy, and Sicily.</note> those

                        <hi>Socrates</hi> often told us,<note place="margin">Stob. serm. 201.</note> that they who provide mcuh wealth for
their Children, but neglect to improve them by vertue, do
like those who feed their horses high, and never train them to
the manage: by this means their horses are the better in case,
but the worse for service, whereas the commendations of a
horse consists not in his being fat, but serviceable in war. In the
same kind erre they who purchase Lands for their Children,
but neglect their persons; Their possessions will be of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
themsleves of none, whereas the owner ought to be more
honourable then his estate. Whosoevever therefore breeds his
Son well, though he leave him little, gives him much: It is the
mind which makes him great or small: whatsoever they have
to the good seems sufficient, to the rude too little. You leave
your Children no more then necessitie requires, which they
being well educated will esteem plentifull. The ignorant
though free from present trouble, have nothing the lesse fear
for the future.</p>

                     <p>IT is commonly said, nothing is richer then a poor man, this I
find true in my self, who have not so much, but whilest you my
friends take care of me, seem to possesse much: and it is well
done of you to supply me as often as I write: As concerning my
Commentaries, there is none of them but I fear should be seen
by any in my absence, as I profest in your hearing at the house
where <hi>Euclid</hi> lay. I know dear friends a writing once communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to many is irrecoverable. <hi>Plato,</hi> though absent, is much
admired throughout <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> for his treatises; but wee
cannot be perswaded they deserve any study; I am not onely
carefull of losing the honour due to learning, but tender also
of <hi>Socrates,</hi> lest his virtue should incur any prejudice by my ill
relation of it. I conceive it the same thing to calumniate, or
not praise to the full those of whom we write; This is my fear
(<hi>Cebes</hi> and <hi>Simmias)</hi> at present, untill my judgement shall be
otherwise inform'd. Fare ye well.</p>

are the Judges and the only things that may comprehend,
&amp; not fallacious; but of those things which cause passions, there is
nothing which is comprehensible, or that may not deceive us. For,
that we are made white or affected with sweet, may be said ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
and firmly, but that the thing which causeth this affection
is white or sweet, cannot in like manner be asserted. For it is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssible
that we be affected with whiten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>sse from a thing that is not
white, and with sweetnesse from a thing that is not sweet; as to
him who is dimsighted or hath the yellow jaundies, all things
seem yellow to one, duskish to the other, and he who pincheth
his eye, thinketh he sees things double, he who is mad fancies two
<hi>Thebes's,</hi> two Suns; in all these, they that are so affected, to wit,
with yellownesse or duskishnesse, or duplicity, is true, but that
the thing which moveth them is yellow or duskish, or double, is
conceived to be false: So it is most consonant to reason, that wee
comprehend nothing more then our own passions. For we must
hold that the things seen are either the passions themselves, or the
causes of those passions; if we say our passions are the things seen,
we must likewise affirm all things seen, to be true and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive;
if we say the things seen are the causes of those passions,
we must confesse all things seen to be false and incomprehensible.
For that passion which happeneth to us, showeth us its self and
nothing more, so that to speak truly, the passion or affection it
self is the only thing that is apparent to us, and for that reason,
in their proper affections none erre, but in the externall object,
all. The first are comprehensive, the second incomprehensive, the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51150:148"/>
soul being weak in the discernment thereof, by reason of places,
intervalls, motions, mutations, and many other causes.</p>
                        <p>Hence they assert, that there is not in man any one common
thing which judgeth, but they impose common names on the
judgments; all commonly name white and sweet, but somthing
common that is white and sweet they have not, for evey man
apprehends his own affection. Now whether the same affection
happeneth to any one, and to him that is next him from white,
neither is he able to say, as not receiving the affection of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
neither can the other that is next him say, as not receiving
his affection. There being therefore no common affection in us,
it were a rash thing to assert, that whatsoever seemeth such to
me, seemeth also such to him that is next me; for perhaps my
constitution is such as to be whitened from that which externally
incurreth, another hath his sense so ordered, as that he is affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
otherwise. That therefore which is seen and appeareth is
not common.</p>
                        <p>That by reason of the differing constitutions of the sense we are
not moved alike nor in the same manner, is manifest from those
who have the <hi>Iaundies,</hi> and those that are <hi>purblinde,</hi> and those
that are <hi>affected according to Nature.</hi> For as from the same
object, some are so affected as to be <hi>black,</hi> others <hi>red,</hi> others <hi>white;</hi>
so is it likewise consonant to reason, that they who are affected
according to nature, by reason of the different constitution of
senses, are not moved alike by the same things, but one way the
white, another way the black, another way he whose eyes are
blew, another way he whose eyes are black, whence we impose
common names on things, having our selves proper and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
affections.</p>

                        <p>TO these assertions (continueth <hi>Sextus Empericus</hi>) concerning
the Judicatories, agreeth what they assert concerning Ends.
Of Affections, some are <hi>pleasant,</hi> some <hi>harsh</hi> and troublesome,
some <hi>mean;</hi> the harsh and troublesome are <hi>ill,</hi> whose end is <hi>griefe;</hi>
the <hi>pleasant, good,</hi> whose end, which cannot be deceived, is <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;</hi>
The mean are neither good nor ill, whose end is neither
good nor ill, which is an affection between pleasure and griefe.
Affections therefore are the judges and ends of all things, and
we live say they, observing evidence and liking, evidence in the
rest of the affections, liking, in pleasure.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Laertius</hi> saith, they assert two passions or affections, <hi>Griefe</hi> and
<hi>Pleasure;</hi> pleasure, a soft smooth motion; griefe, a harsh motion.
One pleasure differeth not from another pleasure, nor is one
pleasure sweeter then another pleasure; this pleasure is coveted
by all living creatures, the other shunned.</p>

                           <pb facs="tcp:51150:149"/>
They assert corporeall pleasure to be our ultimate end, as
<hi>Panaetius</hi> saith in his book <hi>of Sects,</hi> not catastematick permanent
pleasure, which consisteth in privation of griefe, and a quiet void
of all disturbance, which <hi>Epicure held.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>End</hi> differeth from <hi>Beatitude;</hi> for the End is some <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>

                        <p>That pleasure is our chiefe end is manifest, in that from our
first infancy, without any instruction of others, we naturally
aime thereat, and having obtain'd it, seek nothing else. Moreover,
we avoide not any thing so much as its contrary, griefe.</p>
                        <p>Pleasure is good, though proceeding from the most sordid dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest
thing, as <hi>Hippobotus</hi> in his Book of <hi>Sects;</hi> for, although the

want of pleasure, griefe, for both these consist in motion; but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence
and want of pleasure consists not in motion, for Indolence
is like the state of a sleeping man.</p>
                        <p>They hold, that some men may not desire pleasure, through

                        <p>All spirituall pleasures and pains arise not from corporeall
pleasures and pains; for from the simple prosperity of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

                        <p>But neither the remembrance of past goods, nor expectation
of future compleat pleasure, as <hi>Epicure</hi> thought; for by time and

the present; for the remembrance of past pleasures, or expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the future, is vain and frivolous, and nothing appertaineth
to beatitude; but that only is good which is present. With those
pleasures which he received heretofore, or shall receive hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>Aristippus</hi> said, he was nothing at all moved, the first being
gone, the other not yet come, and what it will prove when it is
come, is uncertain. Hence<note n="k" place="margin">Ael. var. Hist. lib. 14. 6.</note> he argued, that men ought not to be
folicitous either about things past or future, and that not to be
troubled at such things is a signe of a constant clear spirit. He also
advised to take care only for the present day, and in that day,
only of the present part thereof, wherein something was done or
thought; for he said, the present only is in our power, not the past
or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>uture, the one being gone, the other uncertain whether ever
it will come.</p>
                        <p>Neither do pleasures consist meerly in simple sight or hearing,
for we hear with delight those who counterfeit lamentation, and
those who lament truely, we hear with displeasure. This priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of pleasure and griefe they called <hi>mean states.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="5" facs="tcp:51150:149"/>
The pleasures of the body are much better then those of the
soule, and the pains or griefs thereof much worse; for which
reason those who offend actually, are most grievously punished.</p>
                        <p>To grieve, is more unnaturall to us, to delight, more naturall;
for which reason, much more care is requisite for the ordering
of one then of the other; yet, many times we reject things which
effect pleasure, as being grievous; so that the concurrence of
pleasures which effecteth beatitude, is very difficult.</p>
                        <p>Moreover they hold, that every wise man doth not live plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly,
nor every wicked man unpleasantly, but so for the most
part; for it is enough that a man be affected and reduced by inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of one single pleasure.</p>
                        <p>They held, that<note n="l" place="margin">Cic. Tusc. quaest. 4.</note> Griefe is the greatest ill; that griefe is not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by every ill, but by the unexpected and unforeseen; that

                        <p>They assert, that Riches are efficient causes of pleasure; yet,

Being reproved for not endeavouring to Catch a young
man; new Cheese saith he, will not stick to the hook.</p>
                     <p>Being demanded what man is most perplexed, he saith, he who
aimes at the highest Content.</p>

(for this some ascribe to <hi>Bion,</hi> which <hi>Agellius</hi> to <hi>Bias,</hi> the mistake

if you take a fowl Wife, she will be a Torment; if a fair,
Common.</p>

                     <p>He used to say, it is better to yeeld our own youth and Beauty
to others, then to attempt anothers; for he that doth so, injures
both his body and Soul.</p>
                     <p>He vilified <hi>Socrates,</hi> saying, if he could enjoy <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> and
did not, he was a fool, if he could not, he did no great matter.</p>

they have no more use of their own then of anothers.</p>

Wisdom. Wisdom excells other Vertues as the Sight the other

                        <hi>MEnedemus</hi> was one of those Philosophers that continued
the School of <hi>Phaedo,</hi> which hitherto was called <hi>Eleack,</hi>
but from <hi>Menedemus</hi> was termed <hi>Eretriack:</hi> he was an Eretrian,
Son of <hi>Clisthenes; Clisthenes</hi> was of the Family of the <hi>Theopropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae;</hi>
yet though noble by descent, Mechanick by profession and
indigent; some affirm he was a maker of Tents (<hi>Hesychius Illustris</hi>
terms him an Architect) adding that he taught both Arts to his son
<hi>Menedemus,</hi> so that when <hi>Menedemus</hi> wrote a decree, <hi>an Alexinian</hi>
Philosopher reproved him, saying, <hi>it becomes not a wise man to
frame both Tents and decrees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Menedemus</hi> being sent by the Eretrians with a command of
Souldiers, to <hi>Megara,</hi> went from thence to <hi>Athens</hi> to hear <hi>Plato</hi> at
the Academy, with whom he was so taken, that he gave over his
Military employment.</p>
                     <p>By <hi>Asclepiades a Phlyasian,</hi> his intimate friend, he was carried
to <hi>Stilpo</hi> at <hi>Megara,</hi> whom they both heard; Thence taking a

                     </p>
                     <p>In his School there was no order of place, no seats round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it; but, as every man chanced to be sitting, or standing, or
walking, in the same postures they heard him.</p>
                     <p>He held, that <hi>there was but one vertue and good,</hi> reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
those who asserted more; whence of one who held there
were many Gods, he demanded ironically <hi>how many?</hi> and <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he thought there were more then a hundred?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was of a versatile wit, and in composure of his speech a
difficult adversary; he turned himselfe every way, and found
something to say for every thing: He was very litigious, as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisthenes</hi>
in his successions affirmes, and used this question, <hi>What
is not the same, is different from that with which it is not the
same?</hi> Yes, <hi>To benefit is not the same with good, therefore good
doth not benefit.</hi> He took away <hi>negative propositions,</hi> leaving
only the <hi>affirmative;</hi> and of these he admitted the simple only;
but rejected those which were <hi>not simple,</hi> calling them <hi>conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
and <hi>complexe.</hi>

                        <hi>Heraclides</hi> saith, he was a <hi>Platonick,</hi> and derided <hi>Dialectick.
Hexinus</hi> asking, whether he had given over beating his Father?
<hi>I neither did beat him,</hi> saith he, <hi>nor have given over.</hi> The other
replyed, <hi>Either say yes or no, to dissolve the ambiguity. It is ridiculous,</hi>
saith he, <hi>to follow your Lawes, when a man may withstand them in the
very entrance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He writ not, or composed any thing, because (saith <hi>Antigonus

vehement, that he many times went away with black and blew

(<note n="c" place="margin">See life Solon.</note> according to <hi>Solon's</hi> Law) by what means (spending the whole
day amongst Philosophers without any labour, and having no

that one of the Masters of the common Prison might be
sent for; who, when he came, attested, that they went down
every night into the Prison, where the common malefactours
grownde, and did there grinde, and in pay of their labour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
two drachmes: at which the Areopagites much wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
bestowed as an honourable reward upon them two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
drachmes.</p>
                     <p>They had other Patrons that bestowed gifts upon them; <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chepolides</hi>
gave them three thousand pieces of silver; they both
contended which should receive last, and in conclusion, neither
accepted it. The chief persons that received them were <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi>
a Macedonian, and <hi>Aegetor</hi> a Lamiean: <hi>Aegetor</hi> gave each
of them thirty Minae. <hi>Hipponicus</hi> gave <hi>Menedemus</hi> two thousand
drachmes towards the marriage of his Daughters, which, as
<hi>Heraclides</hi> saith, were three, by his Wife <hi>Oropia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For <hi>Asclepiades</hi> and <hi>Menedemus</hi> took each of them a Wife;
<hi>Asclepiades</hi> married the daughter, <hi>Menedemus</hi> the Mother:
<hi>Asclepiades,</hi> his Wife dying, took the Wife of <hi>Menedemus; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedemus</hi>
being made a chiefe Magistrate, married a rich Wife;
notwithstanding, he allowed his first Wife an equall interest in
the government of the House. <hi>Asclepiades</hi> having lived with <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedemus</hi>
in great plenty; yet, with great temperance, died old at
<hi>Eretria.</hi> At that time, one, whom <hi>Asclepiades</hi> much loved, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
late at night, intending to have feasted with him, the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
shut him out of dores: but, <hi>Menedemus</hi> bad them let him
in, saying, <hi>Asclepiades</hi> would admit him even under ground.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Menedemus</hi> was much given to entertainments, and, because
the Country was unwholesome, made many Feasts: what order
he observed therein is thus delivered by <hi>Antigonus Carystius,</hi> and
out of him (though not cited) by <hi>Laertius.</hi> He dined but with one
or two companions at the most; if any came to him, they were
admitted after dinner was ended; if they came sooner then the
set time, they walked short turnes before the doore, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of the servants what course was carried in; if they told them
fish-broth (with which they begun their dinner) they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
if any flesh, they went into a room prepared for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
In Summer time, <hi>Menedemus</hi> had the Couches or Beds of
his Dining-room covered with flags and rushes, in Winter
with sheep-skinns. Every guest brought a Cushion; the Cup they
had was no bigger then a large spoon: instead of sweet-meats
they had Lupines and Beanes: sometimes such fruit as the season
afforded; in Summer, Pomgranats, in Springe, Pulse, in Winter,
Figs. This <hi>Lycophron</hi> the Chalcidian confirmes in his satyricall
Comedy upon <hi>Menedemus,</hi> where <hi>Silenus</hi> speaks thus to the
Satires.</p>

him send them word, that he was a Kings son.</p>
                     <p>One who intruded himselfe upon him, and discoursed very

                     <p>Not able to limit the prodigality of one who invited him to

                     <p>This freedome brought him into danger when he was in <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi>
with <hi>Nicocreon,</hi> together with his friend <hi>Asclepiades;</hi> for, the
King having invited him with the rest of the Philosophers to a
Monthly feast, <hi>Menedemus</hi> said, this convention if it be good,
ought to be every day; if otherwise, this day is too much: The
Tyrant answered, that he had set apart that day to converse
with Philosophers. <hi>Menedemus</hi> persisting in his assertion, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
from what he had said of the sacrifice, that Philosophers
ought to be heard at all times. Whereupon if one of the Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
had not helped them to escape, they had been put to death,
whence the Ship being endangered by a storm, <hi>Asclepiades</hi> said,
that the humanity of the Musician preserved them, the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of <hi>Menedemus</hi> had undone them.</p>

He was negligent, and (as we said) carelesse in every thing
that concerned the order of his School; likewise high-minded,
and covetous of glory: insomuch that when he and <hi>Asclepiades</hi>
first exercised the trade of building, <hi>Asclepiades</hi> was seen upon
the house top carrying clay; but <hi>Menedemus,</hi> if he espied
any man passing by, hid himselfe.</p>

sick of the meat, but of phancy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In all other respects he was a person of a great and free soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in strength even in his old age equall to those who wrastled in
exercise, strong made, swarthy of complexion, sat and corpulent;
but of indifferent stature, as appears (saith <hi>Laertius</hi>) by his sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in <hi>Eretria,</hi> in the old Stadium, so exactly carved, that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
the naked proportion of his limbs.</p>
                     <p>He loved <hi>Aratus</hi> and <hi>Lycophron</hi> the Tragick Poet, and <hi>Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>
the Rhodian, but above all he was studious of <hi>Homer;</hi> next of
the Lyricks; then of <hi>Sophocles:</hi> In <hi>Satyres</hi> he assigned the second
place to <hi>Achaeus;</hi> the first to <hi>Aeschylus,</hi> whence to those in the state
who defended the contrary part, he said thus,
<q>

                           <l>A Tortoise thus an Eagle may outgo.</l>

                     <p>These are verses of <hi>Achaeus;</hi> they therefore are mistaken, who
say he read nothing but the <hi>Medea</hi> of <hi>Euripides,</hi> which is put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Poems of <hi>Neophron</hi> the Sicyonian.</p>
                     <p>Of <hi>Bion,</hi> who spoke with much diligence against Prophets, he
said, <hi>he murthered the dead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To one who said, the greatest good is to enjoy those things
which we desire; <hi>it is a much greater</hi> saith he, <hi>to desire those things
which are fitting.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was violent (as we said) in controversie, but most affable
in conversation and action: <hi>Alexinus,</hi> whom in dispute he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
circumvented and bitterly derided, hee gratified in deed;
taking care for the safe conduct of his Wife from <hi>Delphi</hi> to <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi>
the way being much infested with Theeves.</p>
                     <p>He was an excellent friend, as is manifest from his affection to
<hi>Asclepiades,</hi> of which we have already spoken, only to <hi>Persaeus,</hi>
he was constantly a profest enemy, for it was known that
when <hi>Antigonus</hi> for <hi>Menedemus</hi> his sake would have restored the
Eretrians to their first liberty, <hi>Persaeus</hi> withstood it, whereupon
at a Feast <hi>Menedemus</hi> openly enveigh'd against him, using amongst
many others this expression; <hi>he is indeed a Philosopher, but of all men
that are, were, or ever shall be the most wicked.</hi>

by his own Countrymen, as if he meant to betray the

some golden Cups chancing to be stoln, he was by a publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree

where he died of grief.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Heraclides</hi> on the contrary affirmeth, that whilst he was
praefect of <hi>Eretrians,</hi> he often defended his Country against those
who would have made <hi>Demetrius</hi> Tyrant thereof; Neither would
he therefore have betray'd it to <hi>Antigonus;</hi> but that was falsly
laid to his charge; he afterwards went to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> petitioning
that he would restore his Country to their liberties; which <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi>
denying he out of grief fasted seven daies, and so died;
The same relation is delivered by <hi>Antigonus Carystius. Heraclides</hi>

                        <hi>Alcimus</hi> in his four Books to <hi>Amintas,</hi> affirmes, that <hi>Plato</hi>
borrow'd much from the writings of <hi>Epicharmus,</hi> the Comick
Poet, in the first Book he hath these words: <hi>In Sensibles</hi> (saith
<hi>Plato) neither magnitude nor quality is permanent, but in continuall
fluxion and mutation; as if we should substract number from them,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51150:178"/>
which are neither equall, nor certain, nor quantitative, nor qualita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
these are they where generation is alwaies, their essence never.
To Insensibles nothing can be added, nothing taken away. This is the
nature of Eternall Beings, the like and same ever.</hi> Thus <hi>Plato</hi> cited
by <hi>Alcimus.</hi> Indeed, he teacheth this in many places, particularly
in <hi>Timaeo,</hi> where he at large explaineth what is that which never
is, and never had beginning, and that which hath beginning, but
no being. He concludes the first comprehensible, by the Intellect
with Reason, the other by sence and opinion. But the citation of
<hi>Alcimus</hi> seems to refer to <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Theaetetus,</hi> the subject of which
Dialogue is <hi>Science:</hi> there he examines some Definitions of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
by the Antients, amongst the rest, the assertion of <hi>Protago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi>
that <hi>Science is Sence;</hi> against which he disputes largely, the
summe this. That the Soul apprehends some things by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the Body, others without; of the first kind are things
<hi>warm, light, dry, sweet,</hi> &amp;c. of the other, <hi>Essence and not being,
similitude and dissimilitude, identitie and diversity, uni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Hence it followes, that Sence apprehends not Essences, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
not Truths, for Essence and Truth are convertible.

<hi>saith, that they who desire to know the principles of the Universe, must
first distinguish the Ideas in themselves,</hi> as similitude, unity, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
magnitude, restauration. <hi>Secondly, add in it selfe,</hi> honest,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51150:179"/>
good, just, and the like; <hi>thirdly, examines what Idaea's cohaere mutually
with one another, as Science, Magnitude, Power: and withall, to think
that those who are amongst us, because they participate of them, should be
called by the same name, as for instance, just things are those which
participate of Iust, Honest, which of honest: one of every Species is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
perceptible by the mind, and consequently free from perturbation.
Wherefore, he asserts Idaea's in nature as Exemplars, after whose likenesse
other things are made.</hi> Thus <hi>Alcimus;</hi> the first part whereof seems
to be taken out of <hi>Plato's Theaetetus,</hi> the latter out of his <hi>Parmeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi>
The words of <hi>Epicharmus</hi> concerning Gods and Idea's, to
which <hi>Alcimus</hi> referrs this of <hi>Plato,</hi> are these:

                           <l>The Art and Artist have a different name.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Laert.</note> Again, <hi>Alcimus: Plato in his opinion of Idea's saith thus; if there
is memory, there must be also Idea's, for memory is of a quiet permanent
thing, but nothing is permanent except Idea's, for how, saith he, could
living creatures be preserved unlesse by their Idea and receiving a
naturall mind; Now they remember Similitude and their nourishment:
showing that all Creatures have an innate understanding of their own
similitude, and therefore perceive things belonging to their kind.</hi> Thus
<hi>Alcimus:</hi> What place of <hi>Plato</hi> he means I know not,<note n="q" place="margin">In Arist. de animal.</note>

of Idea's were <hi>Plato's;</hi> but I rather think <hi>Alcimus</hi> meant not
the title of any Book, having named none in the rest of his citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but what himself abstracts out of <hi>Plato's</hi> opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Idea's. <hi>Plato in Philedo,</hi> teacheth this concerning memory, that
sence is a motion common to the Soul and Body; this suffering
from externall Senses, the other acting and dijudicating; that
memory is a conservatory or repository of the Senses. For the
Soul, as oft as she in her self, or by assistance of the Body, calls
to mind what she hath suffer'd, she is said to remember. To <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to's</hi>
assertion, <hi>Alcimus</hi> applyeth this of <hi>Epicharmus:</hi>
                        <q>
                           <l>Eumaeus Wisdome's not to one consin'd;</l>

kind of wisdom formed partly by continuall exercise, partly by reason, in
which consisted Philosophy it self, wherein that is begun and not perfected,
is called progression to vertue, what is perfected, Virtue; perfection of
Nature of all things in the mind, the most excellent. Thus of Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Of Nature (for that was next) they so treated as to divide it into two
things: One the efficient, the other giving it self to this, that, thereof
might be made somthing. In that they conceived to be a power, in this a
certain matter to be effected: in both, matter could not cohere, unlesse
contained by some power, nor the power without some matter, for there is
nothing which is not enforced to be some where: that which consists of both,
they called Body and Qualitie: Of Qualities, some are primary, others
arising from these: the primary are uniform and simple; hose which arise
from these are various, and as it were multiform. Air, Fire, Water,
and Earth are Primary, of these arise formes of living Creatures, and of
those, things which are made of the Earth. These principles are called
Elements, of which, Air and Fire have a faculty to move and effect; the
other parts, Water and Earth to suffer. To all these there is subjected a
certain matter without form, destitute of quality, out of which all things
are expressed and formed; It is capable of admitting all; and of changing
all manner of waies, in the whole, and in every part: This resolves nothing
to nothing, but into its own parts, which are divisible into infinite, there
being in na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ure no least which cannot be divided. Those which are moved,
are all moved by intervalls, which intervalls likewise may be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely,
and that power which we call quality, being moved and agitated
every way, they conceive the whole matter to be throughly changed, and by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51150:181"/>
that means those things, which they call qualitative, to be produced, of
which, in all coherent nature continued with all its parts, was effected the
World, beyond which there is not any part of matter or body: The parts
of the World are all things therein, kept together by a Sensitive nature,
wherein is likewise perfect reason; It is also sempiternall, for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more strong whereby it may be dissolved: This power they call the
Soul of the World, God, a certain providence over all things sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Of the third part of Philosophy, consisting in reason and dissertation,
they treated thus. Though Iudgment arise from the Sense, yet the Iudgment
of truth is not in the Senses. The mind they affirmed to be Iudge of things,
conceiving her only sit to be credited, because she alone seeth that which is
simple, and uniform, and certain; This they called Idea. All sense they
conceived to be obtuse and slow, and no way able to perceive those things
which seem subject to sense, which are so little, as that they cannot fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
sense, so moveable and various, that nothing is one, constant, nor the
same, because all things are in continuall alteration and fluxion. All this
part of things they called Opimative; Science they affirmed to be no
where but in the Reasons and Notions of mind, whence they approved
definitions of things, and applyed them to all whereon they discoursed.
They approved likewise explications of words by Etymologies: They used
Arguments and marks for things, to prove and conclude what they
meant to explain; In this consisted all the discipline of Dialectick, that
is, of Speech concluded by Reason.</p>

of <hi>Syracuse,</hi> brought him acquainted with <hi>Dion</hi> then very young,
who entertained him as his<note n="e" place="margin">Plat. Epist. 3. &amp; 7.</note> guest: He much disliked the luxury
of that place, feasting, nocturnal lucubrations and the like; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
frequently with <hi>Dion,</hi> discoursed with him of those things
which were best in man, and with his best arguments exhorted

                        <hi>Dion</hi> though
young, was the most ingenious of all <hi>Plato's</hi> followers, and most
eager in pursuit of Virtue, as appears as well by the testimony
of <hi>Plato,</hi> as his own actions. Though he had been brought up by
the King in an effeminate luxurious kind of life; yet as soon as he
tasted of Philosophy the guide to Virtue, his soul was enflamed
with love thereof, and from his own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>andour and ingenuity was
perswaded that <hi>Dionysius</hi> would be no lesse affected therewith:
And therefore desired him when hee was at leasure to admit and
hear <hi>Plato:</hi> Hereupon the Tyrant sent for him; at that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all their discourse was concerning fortitude; <hi>Plato</hi> affirmed
none was further from that Virtue then a Tyrant, and, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to speak of Justice, asserted the life of the Just to be happy, of
the unjust miserable. <hi>Dionysius</hi> was displeased at this discourse (as
reflecting upon himself) and with the standers by for approving
it, at last much exasperated, he asked <hi>Plato why he came into</hi> Sicily?
<hi>Plato</hi> answered, <hi>to seek a good man: it seems,</hi> replyed <hi>Dyonisius, you
have not yet found him. Laertius</hi> saith, <hi>Plato</hi> disputed with him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Tyranny, affirming, that is not best which benefits our
selves, unlesse it be excellent also in Virtue; whereat <hi>Dyonisius</hi>
incensed, said to him, your discourse favours of old age; and
yours, answered <hi>Plato,</hi> of Tyranny. <hi>Dionysius,</hi> enraged, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him to be put to death; I will have, saith he, your head

wrought with him to revoke that sentence. <hi>Dion</hi> thinking his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
would have proceeded no further, sent <hi>Plato</hi> away at his own
request in a Ship which carried <hi>Pollis</hi> (whom <hi>Laertius</hi> calls <hi>Polis,</hi>
Aelian <hi>Pôlis,</hi>) a Lacedaemonian Captain (who at that time had
been sent Embassadour to <hi>Dionysius</hi>) back to <hi>Greece: Dionsiyus</hi>

secretly desired <hi>Pollis</hi> to kill him whilst he was on Shipboard; or
if not, by all means to sell him, alledging, it would be no injury

                        <hi>Aristogiton</hi> and <hi>Harmodius</hi>
were made. Others, that it was because he was over-mastered in
learning. But <hi>Tzetzes</hi> rejecting these, as idle fictions of Philosophers,
&amp; falsifiers, affirms the true reason to have been, that he perceived,
he advised <hi>Dion</hi> to possesse himselfe of the Kingdome: <hi>Pollis</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported
him to <hi>Aegina;</hi> there <hi>Charmander,</hi> son of <hi>Charmandrites,</hi>
accused him, as meriting death by a Law they had made, that
the first Athenian that should come to that Island, should, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being suffered to speak for himselfe, be put to death: Which
Law, as <hi>Phavorinus</hi> affirms, he himselfe made. One that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
saying in sport, he is a Philosopher, they set him at liberty:
Some say, they brought him to the publick assembly, to plead for
himselfe, where he would not speak a word, but underwent all
with a great courage. Then they altered their intent of putting
him to death, and agreed to sell him for a slave. <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith,
that upon a decree of the <hi>Aeginetae,</hi> that all Athenians taken in
that Island, should be sold for Slaves; <hi>Pollis</hi> sold him there:
<hi>Anniceris,</hi> a Cyrenaick Philosopher, being accidentally present,
redeemed him for twenty, or as others thirty Minae, and sent him
to <hi>Athens</hi> to his friends; they immediately returned the mony to
<hi>Anniceris,</hi> but he refused it, saying, they were not the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
concerned in <hi>Plato</hi>'s welfare: Some say, <hi>Dion</hi> sent the mony,
which he would not accept, but bought therewith a little Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
in the Academy. <hi>Pollis</hi> was defeated by <hi>Chabrias,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
drowned in <hi>Elice.</hi> The report goes, that an apparition told
him, he suffered those things for the Philosophers sake. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius</hi>
understanding what had happened, writ to <hi>Plato,</hi> to desire
him not to speak ill of him; <hi>Plato</hi> returned answer, that he had
not so much time vacant from Philosophy, as to remember <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius.</hi>
To some detractours who upbraided him, saying, <hi>Dionysius</hi>
hath cast off <hi>Plato;</hi> no, saith he, but <hi>Plato Dionysius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dion</hi> continued to live, not according to the ordinary luxury
of the Sicilians and Italians, but in vertue, untill <hi>Dionysius</hi> died,
for which maligned by those who lived after Tyrannicall insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.
Then considering, that these documents were not practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by himselfe alone, but by some others, though few, he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a hope, that <hi>Dionysius</hi> the younger, who succeeded his
Father in the Government, might become one of those, to the
extraordinary happinesse of himselfe, and the rest of the Sicili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
To this end, he used many exhortations to invite him to
vertue, intermixed with some sentences of <hi>Plato,</hi> with whom
<hi>Dionysius,</hi> upon this occasion, became extreamly desirous to be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51150:186"/>
acquainted: To that effect, many Letters were sent to <hi>Athens</hi> to
him, some from <hi>Dionysius,</hi> others from Pythagoreans in <hi>Italy,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
<hi>Plato</hi> to go to <hi>Syracuse,</hi> who, by prudent Counsell, might
govern the young man, transported by his own power to luxury.
<hi>Plato,</hi> as himselfe affirmeth, fearing to be thought a Person only
of words, and not willing to engage in action, and withall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
by purging one principall part, to cure the disease of all
<hi>Sicily,</hi> yielded; <hi>Laertius</hi> saith, upon a promise made to him by
<hi>Dionysius,</hi> of a Place and People that should live according to the
rules of his Common-wealth; which he made not good. Hence
<hi>Athenaeus</hi> accuseth <hi>Plato</hi> of Ambition. In the mean time, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of <hi>Dion,</hi> fearing a change in <hi>Dionysius,</hi> perswaded him to
call home from banishment <hi>Phil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

educated in Tyrannicall principles) as an Antidote against <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s
Philosophy; but <hi>Dion</hi> hoped, the comming of <hi>Plato</hi> would
regulate the licentious Tyranny of <hi>Dionysius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plato</hi> at his arrivall in <hi>Sicily</hi> (placed by <hi>Agellius,</hi> betwixt the
beginning of <hi>Philips</hi> raigne, foure hundred years from the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Chaeronean fight) was received by <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius</hi>
with much respect: One of the Kings magnificent Chariots
stood ready to receive him assoon as he landed, and carried him
to the Court. The King offered Sacrifice to the Gods for his
comming, as a great blessing upon his government. The tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of their Feasts, alteration of the Court, meeknesse of the
King, gave the Siracusians great hopes of reformation: The Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
addicted themselves to Philosophy so much, that the Palace
was full of Sand (wherein they drew Geometricall figures.) Not
long after <hi>Plato</hi>'s comming, at a Sacrifice in the Castle, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld,
according to the usuall manner, made a solemn Prayer,
that the Gods would long preserve the Kingly Government:
<hi>Dion</hi> standing by, said, <hi>Will you never give over praying against me?</hi>
This troubled <hi>Philistus</hi> and his friends, who feared <hi>Plato</hi> would
insinuate into the favour of <hi>Dionysius</hi> so much, as that they should
not be able to oppose him, since in so short time, he had effected so
great an alteration in him: Hereupon they all joyntly accused
<hi>Dion,</hi> that he wrought upon <hi>Dionysius,</hi> by the eloquence of <hi>Plato,</hi>
to resigne his Government, that it might be transferred to the
Children of his Sister, to quit his command for the Academy,
where he should be made happy by Geometry, resigning his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
happinesse to <hi>Dion</hi> and his Nephews. With these and the
like instigations, <hi>Dionysius</hi> was so incensed, that he caused <hi>Dion</hi>
to be unexpectedly carried on Ship-board in a little bark, giving
the marriners order to land him in <hi>Italy.</hi> This happened four
months after <hi>Plato</hi>'s comming.<note n="h" place="margin">Plat. Epist.</note> 
                        <hi>Plato,</hi> and the rest of <hi>Dion</hi>'s
friends, feared to be put to some punishment, as partakers of his
offence. A report was raised, that <hi>Plato</hi> was put to death by <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius,</hi>
as author of all that happened: but, on the contrary, <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius,</hi>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:51150:187"/>
doubting, lest something worse might happen from their
fear, treated them all kindly, comforted <hi>Plato,</hi> bid him be of
good cheer, and intreated him to stay with him:<note n="i" place="margin">Plutarch.</note> He caused him
to be lodged in his Castle,<note n="k" place="margin">Plat. Epist. 7.</note> in the Orchards adjoyning to his
Palace, where not the Porter himselfe could go out without
<hi>Dionysius</hi> his leave; thus cunningly, under pretence of kindnesse,
he watched him, that he might not return into <hi>Greece,</hi> to give
<hi>Dion</hi> notice of the wrong done to him. <hi>Dionysius</hi> by frequent
conversation with <hi>Plato</hi> (as wild Beasts are tamed by use) fell
into so great liking of his discourse, that he became in love with
him; but, it was a Tyrannicall affection, for, he would not that
<hi>Plato</hi> should love any but him, offering to put the power of the
Kingdome into his hands, if he would value him above <hi>Dion.</hi>
With this passion, troublesome to <hi>Plato, Dionysius</hi> was sometimes
so farre transported, as men jealous of their Mistresses, that he
would upon the suddain fall out with him, and as suddainly be
reconciled, and ask him pardon. He had indeed a great desire of
<hi>Plato</hi>'s Philosophy, but a great respect likewise on the other
side for those who disswaded him from it, telling him, that it
would ruine him to be too far ingaged therein.<note n="l" place="margin">Plat. Epist.</note> In the mean
time, there happening a War, he sent <hi>Plato</hi> home, promising,
that the next spring (as soon as there was peace) he would send
back for him and <hi>Dion</hi> to <hi>Syracuse:</hi> but he kept not his promise,
for which he desired <hi>Plato</hi> to excuse him, protesting the War
to be the occasion thereof, and that assoon as it were ended, he
would send for <hi>Dion,</hi> whom he desired in the mean time to rest
satisfied, and not attempt any thing against him, not to speak ill
of him to the Grecians. This <hi>Plato</hi> endeavoured to effect; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
<hi>Dion</hi> in Philosophy, in the Academy: <hi>Dion</hi> lay in the
City at the house of <hi>Calippus,</hi> with whom he had been long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted.
He purchased a Country house for pleasure, whither

<hi>Sicily,</hi> upon <hi>Speusi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>pus,</hi> with whom he conversed most intimately,
as being so advised by <hi>Plato,</hi> who knew the cheerfull humour
of <hi>Speusippus</hi> to be a fit divertisement for the reserved disposition
of <hi>Dion. Plato</hi> had undertaken the expence of some Playes and
Dances by some youths; <hi>Dion</hi> took the pains to teach them, and
paid the whole charge: By this liberality which <hi>Plato</hi> suffered
him to confer upon the Athenians, he gained more love then
<hi>Plato</hi> honour.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Dionysius,</hi> to acquit himselfe of the disesteem
he had gained amongst Philosophers in <hi>Plato's</hi> cause, invited ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
learned men, and in a vain ostentation of Wisdome, applyed
improperly the sentences he had learned of <hi>Plato:</hi> Hereupon he
began to wish for <hi>Plato</hi> again, and to blame himselfe, for not
knowing how to use him well when he had him, and that he had
not learned so much of him as he might: and being like a Tyrant
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51150:187"/>
transported with uncertain passions and changes, a suddain ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
desire came upon him of seeing <hi>Plato</hi> again.<note n="m" place="margin">Plat Epist. 3.</note> The peace
being now concluded, he sent to <hi>Plato</hi> to come to him (but not (as
he had promised) to <hi>Dion</hi>) writing to him, that he would have
him to come immediately, and that afterwards he would send
for <hi>Dion.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Plato</hi> refused to go, notwithstanding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties
of <hi>Dion;</hi> alledging for excuse his old age, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was done according to their agreement. In the mean time,
<hi>Archytas,</hi> whom, with others of <hi>Tarentum, Plato,</hi> before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
had brought into the acquaintance of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> came to
<hi>Dionysius;</hi> there were also others there, Auditors of <hi>Dion. Dionysius</hi>

                     <p>AS <hi>Plato</hi>'s eminent learning gained on one side many Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and admirers, so on the other side, it procured him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
emulators, especially amongst his fellow Disciples, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of <hi>Socrates;</hi> amongst these,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Xenophon</hi> was exceedingly disaffected towards him; they emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
each other, and writ both upon one subject; a Symposium,
<hi>Socrates</hi> his Apologie, morall commentaries: One writ of a
Commonwealth, the other, the Institution of <hi>Cyrus:</hi> which book
<note n="*" place="margin">In Logib.</note> 
                        <hi>Plato</hi> notes as commentitious, affirming <hi>Cyrus</hi> not to have been
such a person as is there exprest. Though both writ much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Socrates,</hi> yet neither makes mention of the other, except
<hi>Xenophon</hi> once of <hi>Plato,</hi> in the third of his Commentaries.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Antisthenes</hi> being about to recite something that he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51150:194"/>
desired <hi>Plato</hi> to be present; <hi>Plato</hi> demanding what he meant
to recite, he answered, that to contradict is not lawfull. How
come your, saith <hi>Plato,</hi> to write upon that subject? And thereupon
demonstrating that he contradicted himselfe, <hi>Antisthenes</hi> writ a
Dialogue against him, intituled <hi>Satho.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aristippus</hi> was at difference with him, for which reason (in
<hi>Phaedone</hi>) he covertly reproves <hi>Aristippus,</hi> that being near at <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina</hi>
when <hi>Socrates</hi> died, he came not to him. He writ a book of
the luxury of the antients; some ascribe the amatory Epigrams
to his invention, his designe in that treatise being to detract from
eminent persons, amongst the rest from <hi>Socrates</hi> his Master, and
<hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Xenophon</hi> his fellow Disciples.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aeschines</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> also disagreed: some affirme, that when
<hi>Plato</hi> was in favour with <hi>Dionysius, Aeschines</hi> came thither very
poor, and was despised by <hi>Plato,</hi> but kindly entertained by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stippus:</hi>
But the Epistle of <hi>Aeschines</hi> put forth by <hi>Allatius,</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the contrary. The discourse which <hi>Plato</hi> relates, betwixt
<hi>Crito</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> in Prison, <hi>Idomeneus</hi> saith, was betwixt <hi>Socrates</hi>
and <hi>Aeschines;</hi> by <hi>Plato,</hi> out of ill will to <hi>Aeschines,</hi> attributed to
<hi>Crito.</hi> But of <hi>Aeschines</hi> he makes not any mention in all his works,
except twice slightly; once in <hi>Phaedone,</hi> where he names him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the persons present at <hi>Socrates</hi> his death; and again in his
Apology speaking of <hi>Lysanias</hi> his Father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Phaedo,</hi> if we credit the detractions of <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> was so much
maligned by <hi>Plato,</hi> as that he was about to frame an indictment
against him, to reduce him to that condition of servitude, out of
which, by the procurement of <hi>Socrates,</hi> he had been redeemed;
but his designe being discovered, he gave it over. Besides his
condisciples.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Cynick derided his Laws, and assertion of Ideas;
concerning the first, he asked if he were writing Lawes? <hi>Plato</hi>
assented. Have you not written already a Commonwealth, saith
<hi>Diogenes?</hi> Yes, answered <hi>Plato.</hi> Had that Commonwealth Lawes,
saith <hi>Diogenes? Plato</hi> affirmed it had. Then, replyed <hi>Diogenes,</hi>
what need you write new?<note n="a" place="margin">Laert. vit. Diog.</note> Another time, <hi>Diogenes</hi> saying, he
could see the things of the world, but not Ideas: <hi>Plato</hi> answered,
that is no wonder, for you have, and use those eyes, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
such things: but the minde, which only can see the other,
you use not.</p>

                     <p>From these private differences, arose many scandalous impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,

                     <p>In Argument he often used induction of both Sorts. Induction
is a discourse, which from certain truths Collects, and inferreth
a truth like to those: Of Induction there are two kinds, one from
Contraries, another from Consequents: From Contraries, as
when he who is questioned, answereth in all things contrary to
himself, as thus; My Father is either the same with yours, or
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51150:196"/>
not the same, if therefore thy Father be not the same with mine,
he is not my Father: and again, if a man be not a living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he is stone, wood, or the like, but he is neither stone nor
wood, for he hath a soul, and moveth himselfe, therefore he is a
living creature; if a living creature, a dog and an Ox. This kind
of induction by contraries, serves not for assertion, but confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Induction by consequents is two-fold; one, when a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
being sought, is concluded from a singular, the first proper
to Oratours, the second to Logicians; as in the first, the question
is, Whether such an one were a murtherer, it is proved from
his being bloody at the same time. This induction is Rhetoricall,
for Rhetorick is conversant in Singulars, not in universalls; it
inquireth not after justice, but after the severall parts thereof:
the other is Dialectick, whereby Universalls are concluded from
Singulars, as in this question; Whether the Soule be immortall,
and whether the living are of the dead, which is demonstrated
in his Book of the Soul, by a generall Maxime, that contraries
proceed from contraries, this being generall, is proved by sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars,
as, waking succeeds sleeping, the greater the lesser, and
so on the contrary. Thus he useth to confirm what he asserts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thrasylus</hi> saith, he published his Dialogues according to the
tragick Tetralogie: His genuine Dialogues are fiftie six, his
Common-wealth divided into ten, they make nine Tetralogies,
reckoning his Commonwealth one Book, his Lawes another.
The first Tetralogie hath a common subject, declaring what is the
proper life of a Philosopher: every Book hath a two-fold title;
one from the principall person, the other from the subject.</p>

good men, as Tradition speaks them. Those Commentaries of mine,
concerning which you write, are not yet polished; however as they are, I

I had not any of those things to send to <hi>Syracuse</hi> which <hi>Archytas</hi>
desired to receive by you; as soon as possible I will send to you. Philosophy
hath wrought in me I know not whether good or bad, a hatred of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
with many persons, justly, I think, since they erre in all kind of
folly as well in private as publick affairs; but if unjustly, yet know I
can hardly live and breath otherwise. For this reason I have fled out of
the City, as out of a Den of wild Beasts, living not far from the Ephestia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
and the places thereabouts. I now see, that <hi>Timon</hi> hated not men, he
could not affect Beasts, therefore lived <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> alone by himself, perhaps not
without danger. Take this as you please; my resolution is to live far from
the City, now and for ever hereafter, as long as God shall grant me
life.</p>

the Athenians) but gave it over by reason of his old age, and the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

ground fallen to him by hereditary right; He manured it, refined
it, enclosed it with large Walls, Porches and Galleries, such as never any
Fable, or Poem had before; but because he undertook it late, he was
prevented by Death. The more things written delight, the more their

qualified.</head>
                     <p>Such a Summary as this may be given of the Doctrine of <hi>Plato.
Philosophy</hi> is the desire of Wisdom, or solution of the soul from
the body, and a conversion to those things, which are true and
perceptible by Intellect. <hi>Wisdom,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, is the Science of things
Divine and Humane. A <hi>Philosopher</hi> is he who takes denomination
from Philosophy, as a Musician from Musick. He who is to be a
Philosopher, must be thus qualified; First, he must have a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
capacity of all such Learning as is able to fit and bring him
to the knowledge of that essence which is perceptible by Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
not of that which is in continual fluxion or mutation. Then he
must have a naturall affection to Truth, and an aversion from
receiving falshood, and besides this, temperate in a manner by
Nature; for those parts which use to be transported with passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he must have reduced to obedience by Nature. For whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
hath once embraced those disciplines which are conversant
in consideration of such things as truly exist, and hath addicted
all his study thereunto, little valueth corporeall pleasure. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
a Philosopher must have a liberall mind, for the estimation
of mean things is contrary to a man who intended to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
the truth of things. Likewise he must naturally love Justice,
for he must be studious of Truth, Temperance and Liberality.
He must also have an acute apprehension, and a good memory,
for these inform a Philosopher, those gifts of Nature, if improved
by Discipline and Education, make a man perfect in Vertue, but
neglected are the cause of the worst ills. These <hi>Plato</hi> useth to call
by the same names with the Vertues, <hi>Temperance, Fortitude and
Iustice.</hi>

                     <head type="sub">That Contemplation is to be preferred before Action.</head>
                     <p>WHereas <hi>Life</hi> is twofold, <hi>Contemplative</hi> and <hi>Active,</hi> the chief
Office of the Contemplative consisteth in the knowledge
of truth, as of the Active, in the practice of those things which
are dictated by Reason. Hence the Contemplative life is first, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which as necessary followeth the Active. That it is so, may
easily be proved thus. Contemplation is an Office of the intellect
in the understanding of Intelligibles: Action is an operation of
the rationall Soul, performed by meditation and service of the
body. For the Soul, when it contemplateth the Divinity and the
notions thereof, is said to be best affected. This affection is called
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Wisdom,</hi> which is nothing else but an assimilation to the
Deity. This therefore ought to be esteemed the first and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall,
as being most expetible and proper to man; for there are no
impediments that can hinder it from being within our power,
and it is cause of our proposed end. But Active life, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
thereof, chiefly making use of the mediation of the body,
are many times obstructed; Wherefore those things which the
Contemplative life considers in order to the reformation of the
manners of men, a Philosopher, as often as necessity requireth,
shall transferr to Action. Then shall a good man apply himselfe
to the administration of Civill Affairs, when he seeth them ill
managed by others. He must look upon the leading of an Army,
administration of Justice and Embassies, as things necessary. The
institution of Laws, ordering the Common-wealth, the compres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Seditions, education of youth in Discipline, are the
chiefest, and, among those things which relate to Action, of
greatest consequence. Hence is it manifest, that a Philosopher
must not onely be perseverant in Contemplation, but also cherish
and increase it, sometimes giving himself to Action as an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
upon Contemplation.</p>

called an imperfect ratiocination; and lastly into <hi>Sophismes.</hi> This
the Philosopher must look upon, not as the chiefest but a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

                     <p>Of <hi>Practick</hi> Philosophy, one part is conversant about <hi>Manners,</hi>

                     <p>WHereas there is somthing that judgeth, somthing which is
judged, it is necessary also that there be somthing which
is made of both these, properly called <hi>Iudgement.</hi> This Judgement
may not unfitly be termed Judiciary, but more commonly that
which judgeth. This is twofold; one, <hi>from which;</hi> another <hi>by which</hi>
judgement is made. That is intellect; this the naturall Organ ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
for judgement; primarily of <hi>true</hi> things; seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
of <hi>false;</hi> neither is it any thing but naturall reason. To explain
this more fully, of things which are, a Philosopher who judgeth
the things themselves, may be called a <hi>Iudge;</hi> reason likewise is a
<hi>Iudge,</hi> by which truth is judged, which even now we called an
Organ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason</hi> is twofold, one <hi>incomprehensible</hi> and true; the other is
<hi>never deceived</hi> in the knowledge of those things which are.
The first is in the power of God, not of man, the second in
that of man also. This likewise is twofold, the first <hi>Science,</hi>
and scientifick reason; the second <hi>Opinion.</hi> The first hath <hi>certitude,</hi>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:51150:201"/>
and <hi>stability,</hi> as being conversant in things certain and stable.
The second, <hi>similitude of truth</hi> and <hi>opinion,</hi> as being conversant in
things subject to mutation. Of science in Intelligibles, and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in sensibles, the principles are <hi>Intellection</hi> and <hi>Sense.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sense</hi> is a passion of the soul by the mediation of the body, first,
declaring a passive faculty; When through the Organs of sense,
the species of things are impress'd in the soul, so, as they are not
defac'd by time, but remain firm and lasting, the conservation
thereof is called <hi>Memory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Opinion</hi> is the conjunction of memory and sense; for, when
some object occurreth, which can first move the sense, thereby
sense is effected in us, and by sense memory. Then again is the
same thing objected to our sense, we joyne the precedent with
the consequent sense, and now say within our selves, <hi>Socrates,</hi> a
Horse, Fire, and the like: This is termed opinion, when we joyne
the precedent memory with the late sense; when these agree
within themselves, it is a <hi>true opinion,</hi> if they disagree, a <hi>false;</hi> for,
if a man, having the species of <hi>Socrates</hi> in his memory, meet with
<hi>Plato,</hi> and think, by reason of some likenesse betwixt them, he
hath met <hi>Socrates</hi> again, and afterwards joyne the sense of <hi>Plato,</hi>
which he took, as it were, from <hi>Socrates,</hi> with the memory which
he preserved of <hi>Socrates,</hi> there will arise a false opinion.</p>
                     <p>That wherein sense and memory are formed, <hi>Plato</hi> compareth
to a <hi>tablet of wax,</hi> but when the soul by cogitation reforming these
things, which are conceived in opinion by memory and sense, soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
upon these as things from which the other are derived:
<hi>Plato</hi> sometimes calleth this <hi>a picture and phantasie. Cogitation</hi> he
calleth the soules discourse within her selfe: <hi>Speech,</hi> that which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>loweth from the Cogitation through the mouth by voice. <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection</hi>
is an operation of the Intellect, contemplating first Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibles.
It is two-fold, one of the soul, beholding Intelligibles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she cometh into the body; the other of the same, after she is
immers'd in the body: The first is properly called <hi>Intellection;</hi> the
other, whilst she is in the body, is termed <hi>naturall knowledge,</hi> which
is nothing but an intellection of the soul consined to the body.
When we say, Intellection is the principle of Science, we mean
not this latter, but the other, which is competible to the soul in
her separate state, and, as we said, is then called Intellection,
now naturall Knowledge. The same <hi>Plato</hi> termeth <hi>simple Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
the wing of the soul;</hi> sometimes <hi>Reminiscence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of these simple Sciences consisteth <hi>Reason,</hi> which is born with
us, the efficient of naturall Science; and as reason is two-fold,
Scientifick, and opinionative, so Intellection and Sense. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
necessary that they have their objects, which are <hi>Intelligibles</hi>
and <hi>Sensibles:</hi> And for asmuch as of <hi>Intelligibles,</hi> some are <hi>Primary,</hi>
as Idaeas, others <hi>Secondary,</hi> as the Species, that are in matter, and
cannot be separated from it. <hi>Intellection</hi> likewise, must be two-fold,

one <hi>of Primaries,</hi> the other <hi>of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>condaries.</hi> Again, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as in <hi>Sensibles,</hi> some are <hi>Primary,</hi> as qualities, colour, whitenesse,
others by <hi>accident,</hi> as white coloured, and that which is concrete,
as fire: in the same manner is <hi>Sense,</hi> first, <hi>of Primaries,</hi> second, <hi>of
Secondaries.</hi> Intellection judgeth primary Intelligibles, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Scientifick knowledge, by a certain comprehension without
discourse. Secondaries the same scientifick reason judgeth, but
not without Intellection. Sensibles, as well Primary as Seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sense, judgeth, but not without opinionative reason. That
which is concrete, the same reason judgeth, but not without
sense. And since the Intelligible world is the Primary Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the sensible something concrete, the first Intellection judgeth
with reason, that is, not without reason: The other opinionative
reason not without sense, whereas there is both contemplation
and action; right reason discerneth not in the same manner those
which are subject to contemplation, and those which are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to action: In contemplation it considereth what is true, what
false; in things that belong to action, what is proper, what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper,
what that is which is done. For, having an innate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of that which is good and honest, by using reason, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
it to those naturall notions, as to certain rules, we judge
whether every thing be good or bad.</p>

                     <p>OF Dialectick, the first and chiefest Element according to
<hi>Plato,</hi> is, first, to consider the <hi>essence</hi> of every thing; next,
the <hi>accidents</hi> thereof. <hi>What a thing</hi> is, it considers, either from its
superiors, by <hi>division</hi> and <hi>definition,</hi> or contrariwise by <hi>Analysis.
Accidents</hi> which adhere to substances, are considered, either from
those things which are contained by <hi>induction,</hi> or from those
which do contain by <hi>Syllogisme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence the parts of <hi>Dialectick</hi> are these, <hi>Division, Definition, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysis,
Induction, Syllogisme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of <hi>Divisions, one</hi> is a distribution of the Genus into Species,
and of the whole into parts; as when we divide the Soule into
the rationall part, and the irrationall; and the latter, into the
concupiscible and the irascible. <hi>Another</hi> is of a world into divers
significations, when the same may be taken severall waies. <hi>A third</hi>
of accidents, according to their subjects; as when we say of good,
some belong to the soul, some to the body, some are externall.
The <hi>fourth</hi> of subjects, according to their accidents; as of men,
some are good, some ill, some indifferent. Division of the Genus
into its Species, is first to be used, when we examine the essence
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51150:202"/>
of a thing, this cannot be done but by definitions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Definition</hi> is made by Division in this manner, we must take
the Genus of the thing to be defined, as that of man, living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
that we must divide by the next differences, descending to
its species, as rationall, and irrationall, mortall, and immortall.
Thus by adding the first difference to the Genus, is made the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of man.</p>
                     <p>Of <hi>Analysis</hi> there are three kinds, <hi>one</hi> by which we ascend from
Sensibles to primary Intelligibles, <hi>another</hi> whereby we ascend
by demonstrates and subdemonstrates, to indemonstrable imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
propositions. The <hi>last,</hi> which from supposition proceedeth
to those principles which are taken without supposition.</p>
                     <p>The first kind is thus, as if from that Beauty which is in the
body, we should proceed to that of the minde, from that to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
conversant in the offices of life, thence to that of Lawes, and
so at last to the vast ocean of Beauty, that by these steps, as it
were, we may arrive at the sight of the supream Beauty.</p>
                     <p>The second kind of Analysis is thus; We must suppose that
which we seek, and consider those which are precedent, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating
them by progression, from inferiours to superiours, untill
we arrive at that which is first and generally granted: From
which, beginning anew, we return synthetically to that which
was sought. As for example, I enquire whether the Soul be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,
and supposing it to be so, I enquire whether it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
moved. This being demonstrated, I again enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that which is alwaies moved, is moved by its selfe, which
being again demonstrated, we examine, whether that which is
moved by its selfe, be the principall of motion. Lastly, whether
a principall is ingenerate; this, as most certain, is admitted by
all. That which is ingenerate, is also incorruptible; whence, as
from a thing most certain, we collect this demonstration. If a
Principle be ingenerate and incorruptible, that which is moved
by its selfe is the principle of motion; but the soul is moved by
its selfe, therefore the soul is incorruptible, ingenerate, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall.</p>
                     <p>The third kind of Analysis upon supposition is this; He who
enquireth after a thing, first, supposeth that thing, then observes
what will follow upon that supposition. If a reason for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
be required, assuming another supposition, he enquireth,
whether that which was first supposed, follow again upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
supposition: This he alwaies observeth; untill he come at
last to that principle, which is not taken upon supposition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Induction</hi> is every method by reason, which proceedeth either
from like to like, or from Singulars to Universalls: It is of great
efficacy to excite naturall notions.</p>

                     <p>OF that speech which we call a <hi>Proposition,</hi> there are two kinds,
<hi>Affirmation</hi> and <hi>Negation; Affirmation,</hi> as <hi>Socrates</hi> walketh;
<hi>Negation,</hi> as <hi>Socrates</hi> walketh not.</p>
                     <p>Of Affirmative and Negative Propositions, some are <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall,</hi>
others <hi>Particular:</hi> A <hi>particular affirmative</hi> is thus, Some plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is good; a <hi>particular negative</hi> is, some pleasure is not good.
An <hi>universall affirmative,</hi> all dishonest things are ill; an <hi>universall
negative,</hi> no dishonest thing is good.</p>
                     <p>Of Propositions, some are <hi>Categoricall,</hi> some <hi>Hypotheticall:</hi> the
Categoricall are simple, as every just thing is good: Hypotheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
import consequence or repugnance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Syllogismes</hi> are used by <hi>Plato,</hi> either to <hi>consute</hi> or <hi>demonstrate;</hi>
to consute, what is false by interrogation, to demonstrate, what
is true by declaration. <hi>Syllogism</hi> is a speech, wherein somethings
being laid down, another thing besides those which are laid
down, is necessarily inferred from them.</p>
                     <p>Of Syllogismes some are <hi>Categoricall,</hi> some <hi>Hypotheticall,</hi> some
<hi>Mixt: Categoricall</hi> are those whose sumptions and conclusions are
simple propositions. <hi>Hypotheticall</hi> are those which consist of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheticall

                     <p>
                        <hi>Plato</hi> useth <hi>demonstrative</hi> arguments in those Dialogues, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

                     </p>
                     <p>Of Categoricall Syllogismes there are three <hi>figures;</hi> the <hi>first</hi>
is, that wherein the common extream is first the praedicate, then
the subject. The <hi>second,</hi> when the common extream is praedicate
in both: the <hi>third,</hi> wherein the common extream is subject in
both. <hi>Extreams</hi> are the parts of a Proposition, as in this, <hi>A man is
a living creature, man</hi> and <hi>living creature</hi> are the extreams. <hi>Plato</hi>
often argueth in the first, second, and third figures; in the first,
as <hi>in Alcibiade;</hi>
                        <q>
                           <l>Iust things are honest,</l>
                           <l>Honest things are good,</l>
                           <l>Therefore just things are good.</l>
                        </q>
In the second, as <hi>in Parmenide;</hi> as,
<q>
                           <l>That which hath no parts is neither straight nor crooked,</l>
                           <l>But whatsoever hath figure is either straight or crooked,</l>
                           <l>Therefore, whatsoever hath not parts, hath not figure.</l>

                        <hi>In</hi> the <hi>third</hi> thus, in the same book,
<q>
                           <l>Whatsoever hath figure is qualitative,</l>
                           <l>Whatsoever hath figure is finite,</l>
                           <l>Therefore whatsoever is qualitative is finite.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Likewise by <hi>Hypotheticall</hi> Syllogisme <hi>Plato</hi> often disputeth,
chiefly <hi>in Parmenide</hi> thus,
<q>
                           <l>If one hath not parts, it hath neither beginning, end, nor middle,</l>
                           <l>But if it have neither beginning, end, nor middle, it hath no bound,
and if no bound, no figure,</l>
                           <l>Therefore if one hath no parts, it hath no figure.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Second</hi> Hypotheticall figure, ordinarily called the third,
wherein the common extream is subject in both, he argueth thus,
<q>
                           <l>If one hath not parts, it is neither straight nor crooked,</l>
                           <l>If it hath a figure, it is either straight or crooked,</l>
                           <l>Therefore if it hath no parts, it hath no figure.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Third</hi> figure by some called the second, wherein the
common extream twice precedes the other two, he thus argues,
in <hi>Phaedone,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If having the Knowledge of Equality we forget it not, we know, but

                     <p>
                        <hi>Mixt</hi> Syllogismes which conclude by consequence, he useth
thus;</p>
                     <p>If one is whole and finite, that is, having beginning, middle and
end; it hath figure also;
<q>
                           <l>But the Antecedent is true,</l>
                           <l>Therefore the Consequent.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of those also which overthrow by consequence, the differences
may be gathered out of <hi>Plato.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus when a man hath diligently understood the faculties of
the mind, the various differences of men, the severall kinds of
reasoning which may be accommodated to this or that, and to
what persons such and such reasons are to be used, he, meeting
with an opportunity suiting with his purpose, will become a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Orator.</p>
                     <p>The reasons of <hi>Sophismes</hi> and captious arguments are, if we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
narrowly, expressed by <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Euthydemo,</hi> for there is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
which are in words, which in things, and how they are to
be solved.</p>
                     <p>The ten <hi>Praedicaments</hi> are touched by <hi>Plato in Parmenide,</hi> and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51150:204"/>
in his other Dialogues; the place of Etymologies is fully set down
<hi>in Cratylo.</hi> To conclude, hee was singularly admirable for divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and definition, wherein the greatest force of Dialectick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth.</p>
                     <p>The Summe of that which he faith <hi>in Cratylo,</hi> is this; Hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
whether <hi>Names</hi> are by the power and reason of <hi>Nature,</hi>
or by <hi>imposition.</hi> He concludeth that the rectitude of names is by a
certain imposition, not temerarious or casuall, but seeming to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the nature of the things themselves; for rectitude of names is
nothing but an imposition consonant to the nature of the thing:
Hence every imposition of names is not sufficient for rectitude,
neither the nature nor first found of the voice, but that which is
composed of both; so as every name is conveniently and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
applyed to the thing. For any name applyed to
any thing will not signifie rightly, as if wee should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the name of horse upon man. To speak is a kind of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Not he that speaketh any way speaketh rightly, but he who
speaketh so as the nature of the thing requireth. And for as much
as expression of names is a part of speaking, as Noun is a part of
Speech, to name rightly, or not rightly, cannot be done by any
imposition of names, but by a naturall affinity of the name with
the thing it self. So that he is a right imposer of names, who can
expresse the Nature of the things in their names; for a name is
an Instrument of the thing, not every inconsiderate name, but
that which agreeth with its nature. By this benefit we communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
things to one another, whence it followeth, that it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but an instrument accommodated to the teaching and
discerning of a thing, as a weavers shuttle to his Webbe. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
therefore to a Dialectick to use names aright; for as a
Weaver useth a shuttle rightly, knowing the proper use thereof
after it hath been made by the Carpenter; so the Dialectick
rightly useth that name which another hath made. And as to
make a Helm, is the effice of a Shipwright, but to use it rightly
of a Pilot; so he who frameth names, shall impose them rightly,
if he do it as if a Dialectick were present, who understandeth
the nature of those things which are signified by the names. Thus
much for Dialectick.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of THEORETICK Philosophy.</head>
                     <p>WE come next to <hi>Theoretick</hi> Philosophy, whereof one part
is <hi>Theologick,</hi> another <hi>Physick,</hi> a third <hi>Metaphysick.</hi> The <hi>end</hi>
of <hi>Theologie</hi> is the knowledge of primary Causes: Of <hi>Physick,</hi> to
understand the nature of the Universe, what kinde of creature
man is, what place he holdeth in the world, whether there be a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51150:204"/>
divine Providence over all things, to which there are other Gods
subordinate, how men are in respect of them. The end of <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick</hi>
is, to know the nature of a superficies and a solid, and to
consider the motion and revolution of celestiall bodies, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
whereof must first be proposed in briefe. Thus <hi>Plato</hi>
useth to confirm the acutenesse of the minde, for it sharpeneth
the understanding, and rendreth it more ready towards the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of divine things. That which considereth <hi>Numbers,</hi>
being likewise a part of Mathematicks, conferreth not a little to
the understanding of things that are; It frees us from the
errour and ignorance which attend sensible things, and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
to the right knowledge of the essence of things: It likewise
renders a man expert in military affairs, especially towards the
ordering of an Army by the science of <hi>Tacticks. Geometry</hi> also
conferteth much towards the understanding of good it selfe, if a
man pursue it not only for mechanicall dimension, but that he
may by the helps thereof ascend to things which are not, busying
himselfe about those which are in continuall generation and
motion. <hi>Stereometry</hi> likewise is exceeding usefull, for after the
second accretion followeth this contemplation, which holdeth
the third room. <hi>Astronomy</hi> also is usefull as a fourth discipline,
whereby we consider the motions of Heaven and the Starres,
and the author of night and day, months and years. Thus by a
familiar kinde of way, finding out him who made all these, and
by these disciplines, as from certain rudiments or elements pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
to things more sublime. Likewise <hi>Musick</hi> is to be learnt,
which relateth to hearing; for, as the eyes are created for Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
so are the ears for Harmony: and as when we apply our
selves to Astronomy, we are led from visible things, to the divine
invisible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ffence; so when we receive the Harmony of voice in at
our ears, from audible things, we ascend by degrees to those
which are perceived by Intellect, unlesse we pursue Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
disciplines to this end, the contemplation thereof will be
imperfect, unprofitable, and of no value. We must therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
proceed from those things which are perceived by the
eyes and ears, to those which reason only discerneth; for, Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
is only a preface to divine things. They who addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to Arithmetick and Geometry, desire to arrive at the
knowledge of that which is, which knowledge they obtain no
otherwise then as by a dream, but really they cannot attain it,
because they know not the principles themselves, nor those
things which are compounded of the principles: neverthelesse,
they conduce to those things which we mentioned; wherefore
<hi>Plato</hi> will not have such disciplines to be called Sciences. Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectick
method proceeds in such manner, that by Geometricall
Hypotheses, it ascendeth to first principles, which are not taken
upon Hypotheses. For this reason he calleth Dialectick a Science;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51150:205"/>
but, Mathematick, neither opinion, because it is more perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
then sensible things; nor a Science, because it is more obscure
then first Intelligibles: But, the opinion of Bodies, the science of
Primaries, the contemplation of Mathematicks.</p>
                     <p>He likewise asserteth <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Imagination: Faith,</hi> of things
subject to sense; <hi>Imagination</hi> of Images and Species.</p>
                     <p>Because Dialectick is more efficacious then Mathematick, as
being conversant about divine eternall things, therefore it is put
before all Mathematicks, as a wall and fortification of the rest.</p>

thereof is to undergo the generation of all things, and to

                        </gap>: These things
are imprinted and formed in her as in a Table, and she admitteth
their figures, not having of her selfe any figure or qualitie. For,
she could not be fit to receive the impressions of severall forms,
unlesse she were wholly void of all quality, and of those formes
which she is about to receive. They who make sweet Unguents
of Oyle, make choice of that oyle which hath the least sent; they
who would imprint any figures in wax, first smooth and polish
the matter, defacing all former figures. It is requisite that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
capable of all things, if it must receive all formes, must not
have the nature of any one of them, but must be subjected to all
formes, without any qualitie or figure; and being such, it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a body nor incorporeall, but a body potentially, as Brasse
is potentially a Statue, because then it becomes a Statue, when it
puts on the form thereof.</p>

                     <p>WHereas matter is a Principle, <hi>Plato</hi> likewise introduceth
other principles besides matter. One as an <hi>exemplar,</hi> Idaeas;
another <hi>Paternall,</hi> God, the Father and Author of all things.
Idaea, as to God, is the <hi>notion</hi> of God, as to us, the <hi>primary Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,</hi>
as to matter, a <hi>manner,</hi> as to this sensible world an <hi>Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar,</hi>
as to it selfe, <hi>Essence.</hi> For whatsoever is made with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
must necessarily be referred to something, as if some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be made from another, as my picture from me, the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar
thereof must be presupposed, and if there be nothing eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
every Artist conceiveth it first within himselfe, then trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
the formes thereof into matter.</p>
                     <p>They define <hi>Idaea</hi> an eternall exemplar of things which are
according to Nature; for, the greater part of Platonists will not
allow an Idaea to be of things that are made by Art, as of a Shield,
or Lute, nor of things which are praeternaturall, as of a Feavour,
or unnaturall Choler; nor of singulars, as of <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Plato;</hi>
nor of vile abject things, as of silth or strawes; nor of relatives, as
of greater and longer: For Idaeas are the eternall notions of God,
perfect in themselves.</p>
                     <p>That there are Idaeas, they prove thus: Whether God be Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
or something Intelligent, he must have his Intelligibles, and
those eternall and immovable; if so, there are Idaeas. For, if mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it selfe be in it selfe void of measure, it is necessary that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
measure from some superiour, that is wholly remote from
matter: But the Antecedent is true, therefore the consequent;
and if so, there are Idaeas, certain measures void of matter. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
if the world were not made by chance, it must only be
made of something, but by something, and not only so, but after
the likenesse of something; but, that after whose likenesse it was
made, what is it but an Idaea? whence it followeth, that there are
Ideas. Again, if intellect differ from true opinion, that which
is intelligible differeth from that which is opinionable; and if so,
there are intelligibles distinct from opinionables, wherefore
there are first Intelligibles, as well as first Sensibles, whence we
conclude there are Idaeas.</p>

                     <p>VVE come next to speak of the third principle, which <hi>Plato,</hi>
though he think it almost ineffable, conceiveth may bee
express'd in this manner. If there are intelligibles, and those nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sensibles, nor coherent with sensibles; but adherent to first
Intelligibles, then are there first simple Intelligibles, as there are
first sensibles; the Antecedent is true, therefore the consequent.
But men subject to perturbation of sence, when they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
somthing intelligible, presently fall upon the thought
of somthing sensible, whereby at the same time they imagine
magnitude, or figure, or colour, and therefore cannot understand
this sincerely: But the Gods being void of corporeall mixtion
understand purely and sincerely. Now because the Intellect is
better then the Soul, and that Intellect which is alwaies in act,
and at once understandeth all things, is better then that Intellect
which is in power, and of these, that is most excellent which is
the cause ef the other, and superiour to all; This can be nothing
else but God, whom we call the first, as being the Cause that the
Intellect of the Word alwaies acteth. He, being himself immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
acteth upon the Intellect of the World, as the Sun upon the
Eye, when it turn eth towards him. And as that which is desired
moveth the Appetite it self remaining immoveable; so doth this
Intellect move the Intellect of all Heaven. Now this first Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
being most fair, must have the most fair Intelligible; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is fairer then it self, therefore it alwaies understandeth it
self, and its own notions, which Act is called Operation.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, <hi>God</hi> is <hi>first, eternall ineffable, perfect in himself;</hi> that is,
needing none, <hi>and ever perfect,</hi> that is, absolute in all times, and <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way perfect,</hi> that is, absolute in every part, <hi>Divinity, Essence, Truth,
Harmony, good.</hi> Neither do we so name these, to distinguish one from
the other, but rather by them all to understand one. He is said to be
<hi>Good,</hi> because he bestoweth his benefits upon all according to their
severall capacities, and so is the cause of all goods. <hi>Fair,</hi> because
he is in his essence both more and equall. <hi>Truth</hi> because, he is the
principle of all truth, as the Sun of all light. And <hi>Father,</hi> as being
cause of all things, and adorning the mind of Heaven and Soule
of the World after his own exemplar and notions. For accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his own will hee filled all things with himself, exciting
the Soul of the World, and converting it to himself, for hee is
cause of that Intellect, which being adorned by the Father, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorneth
also the Nature of all this World. He is likewise <hi>ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
and as we said, can only be perceived by the mind, for he is
neither genus nor species, nor difference, neither can any acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51150:206"/>
be applyed to him. He is <hi>not ill,</hi> for that it were impiety
to affirm; <hi>nor good,</hi> for so he should be termed if he were meanly
or highly participant of goodnesse. Nor <hi>difference,</hi> for that cannot
be made according to the notion of him, nor qualited, for he is
not made that which he is by quality, nor perfected thereby. Nor
<hi>void of quality,</hi> for he is not deprived of any quality that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
to him. <hi>Nor part</hi> of any thing, <hi>nor as a whole</hi> constituted of
parts; <hi>nor as the same or divers,</hi> for nothing can happen to him
whereby he may be distinguished from others; Neither doth he
<hi>move,</hi> or is he <hi>moved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence the first apprehension of him is by <hi>abstraction</hi> from these
things, as wee understand a point by abstraction from sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
considering first a superficies: then a line, then a point. The
second is by <hi>Analogie</hi> in this manner. As the Sun is to sight and
visible things, himself not being sight, yet affording the one to see
the other to be seen, so is the first Intellect to that Intellect,
which is in our Soule, and to those things which it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth.
For, it self is not the Intellect, yet it perfecteth
in these the Act of Intellection; to those it affordeth that they
are understood, enlightning that truth which is in them. The
third way to understand him is thus: when a man behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that Beauty which is in Bodies, hee proceedeth to that
which is in the Soul, then to that which is in Offices and Lawes:
Lastly, to the vast Ocean of Beauty, after which, he considereth
that which is good it self, amiable it self, expetible it self, which
shineth like a light, and meeteth the Soul, that which ascends un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it by these degrees. By this he comprehendeth God himself
through reason of that excellence, which consisteth in adoration
of him. He considereth God void of parts, for nothing was before
him a part, and that of which something consisteth is precedent to
that whereof it is a part, for a superficies is before a body, and
a line before a superficies. Moreover God not having many parts,
can neither be locally moved, nor altered by qualities. For if hee
be altered, it must be done by himself, or some other; if by some
other, that other must be of greater power then he; if by himself,
it must be either to better or to worse, both which are absurd.</p>
                     <p>From all these it followeth that <hi>God is incorporeal,</hi> which may
likewise be proved thus. If God were a body, he should consist
of matter and form; for every body consisteth of matter, and its
form joynes to that matter, which is made like unto the Idaea's,
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d in an ineffable manner participant of them; But that should
consist of matter and form is absurd; for then he could not bee
either simple or a Principle; therefore he is incorporeall. Again,
if he be a body, he consisteth of matter, and consequently is either
fire or air, or earth, or water, or somthing made out of these;
but none of these is principle by it selfe; besides, he must then bee
later then matter, as consisting of it, which being absurd, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51150:207"/>
that God be incorporeall. Moreover, if he were a body, it
would follow that he must be generable, corruptible, mutable,
which to affirm of God were intollerable.</p>

                     <p>THat <hi>Qualities</hi> are <hi>incorporeall,</hi> may be proved thus: every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

quality is not a body. Again, no body is in a subject; every
quality is in a Subject, therefore quality is not a body. Again,
quality is contrary to quality, but no body as no body is contrary
to a body; therefore qualities are not bodies. To omit, that it is
most agreeable to reason, that as matter is void of quality, so
quality should be void of matter, aud if quality be void of matter,
it must likewise be void of corporeity, for if qualities were bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
two or three bodies might be together in the same place,
which is absurd.</p>
                     <p>Qualities being incorporeal, the maker of them must be incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall
also; moreover there can be no efficients, but in corporeals,
for bodies naturally suffer and are in mutation, not continuing

that this Universe, the fairest Fabrick of Gods making,
be so made by God, that in the making thereof, he look'd upon an
Idaea as its exemplar, whilst by a wonderfull providence and most
excellent design God applyed himselfe to the building of this
frame, because he was good.</p>
                     <p>God therefore made it of all matter, which being before the
generation of Heaven, disorderly scattered; he from a deformed
confusion reduced to beautifull order, and adorned every way
the parts thereof with sit numbers and figures, untill at last he so
distinguish'd them as now they are, Fire and Earth to Air and
Water, of which there were then only the footsteps, and a certain
aptitude to admit the power of Elements, and so without any
reason or order, they justled matter, and were justled again by
matter.</p>
                     <p>Thus God framed the World of four entire Elements, of
whole Fire and Earth, Water and Air, omitting no power or
part of any of them. For he saith, it must be corporeall and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated,
and subject to touch and sight; but without Fire and
Earth nothing can be touched or seen; Wherefore justly he fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
it of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> and because it was requisite, there
should be some chain to unite these, there is a Divine chain,
which according to the proportion of reason maketh one of it self,
and those things which are united to it, and the World could
not be plain (for then one medium would have served) but sphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall,
therefore there was need of two mediums to the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
thereof. Betwixt Fire and Earth by the prescription of this
reason is interposed <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> that as Fire is to Air, so is
Air to Water, and as Air is to Water, so is Water to Earth; and
again, as Earth is to Water, so is Water to Air, and as Water
is to Air, so is Air to Fire.</p>
                     <p>There being nothing remaining beyond the World, God made
the World <hi>one,</hi> conformable to this Idaea, which is one. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
made it such, as that is <hi>uncapable of sicknesse or age.</hi> For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that nothing can befall it whereby it may be corrupted, it is
so sufficient to it self, that it hath not need of any exteriour thing.
He bestowed upon it a <hi>Sphaericall</hi> figure, as being the fairest, the
most capacious and aptest to motion, and because it needeth not
hearing or sight, or the rest of the senses, he gave it not any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans

it, except the circular, which is proper to the mind and to Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>

this visible and corruptible, that neither subject to sight
nor touch: The power and constitution of each is different, the

the maker of the Universe (there being untill then nothing more

as far as it put on the figure of a <hi>Pyramid,</hi> became <hi>Fire,</hi> and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

as consisting of fewest triangles, and therefore is the rarest of all
figures. As far as it is an <hi>Octaedron,</hi> it took the qualitie of <hi>Aire:</hi>
VVhere it took that of an <hi>Icosaedron,</hi> it became <hi>Water;</hi> The figure
of a <hi>Cube Earth,</hi> as being the most solid and staple of all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The figure of a <hi>Dodecaedron,</hi> he used in the fabrick of the
<hi>Universe. Superficies</hi> come nigher the nature of Principles then all
these, for they are before solids. Of its nature, the two Parents
(as it were) are two <hi>Triangles,</hi> most fair and rectangular; one a
<hi>Scalenum,</hi> the other an <hi>Isosceles;</hi> a <hi>Scalenum</hi> is a triangle having
one right angle, the other of two thirds, the last of one third.
A <hi>Scalenum</hi> therefore is the element of a <hi>Pyramid,</hi> and an <hi>Octae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,</hi>
and an <hi>Icosaedron.</hi> A <hi>Pyramid</hi> consisteth of foure triangles,
having all sides equall to one another, each whereof is divided

eight like sides, whereof each is divided into six <hi>Scalenums.</hi> The
<hi>Icosaeders</hi> of twenty in the same manner; but the element of a
<hi>Cube</hi> is an Isosceles triangle, for foure such triangles concurring
make a square, and six squares a Cube. God made use of a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decaedron</hi>
in the construction of the Universe, whence there are
twelve figures of living creatures in the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> whereof each
is divided into thirty parts. Likewise in a <hi>Dodecaedron,</hi> which
consisteth of twelve <hi>Pentagones,</hi> if each be divided into five tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles,
there are in every one six triangles, so that in the whole

                     <p>FRom Bodies hee alloweth that we collect the powers of the
<hi>Soul,</hi> for seeing that we discern all things by the Soul, hee
justly placed the principles of all things therein, that whatsoever
should occur, we might contemplate it by that which is of kin and
neighbour unto it, and attribute an essence thereunto consonant
to the functions. Then therefore he called one substance intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
and indivisible; he placed another divisible amongst bodies,
to signifie that the knowledge as well of the one as of the other
may be had by Intellect. And knowing that in things intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and sensible, there is identity and diversity, he fitly composed
the Soul out of all these. For, either the like is known by the like,
as the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> hold, or, as <hi>Heraclitus the Naturalist,</hi> unlike al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
by unlike.</p>
                     <p>That he would that the World should be <hi>generate,</hi> we must
not so understand, as if there shall be any time wherein the world
is not, but in as much as it alwaies perisheth in generation, and
declareth, that there is some more excellent and principall cause
of its essence.</p>
                     <p>The soul of the world which was from all eternity, was not made
by God, but only adorned by him, in which respect he is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
said to have made it, for that he exciteth it, and converteth
the mind thereof, as out of a profound sleep unto himself, that
beholding his intelligibles and affecting his notions, it should from
thence receive Species and form; whence it is manifest, that the
World was endued by God, both with a Soul and mind. For, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
it to be the best, he must have made it animate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent,
since an animate thing is more excellent then an inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
and an intelligent then an unintelligent; perhaps the mind
also could not subsist without a Soul.</p>

is extended throughout the Universe, and in that manner
joyneth and conserveth the whole. The externall preside over
the internall, for they are not divided, but these are divided into
seven Circles; from the first distributed according to duple and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51150:209"/>
triple Intervalls. That which is comprehended by the indivisible
sphear, is correspondent to it, that which is divided to the other.
For the motion of Heaven which comprehendeth all things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not uncertain, is one and ordinate, but that of the things
within it, is changeable, varied by rising and setting, whence

hand from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>West,</hi> the innermost contrariwise, to the left
hand from <hi>West</hi> to <hi>East,</hi> meeting the World.</p>
                     <p>God framed also the Stars and constellations; some <hi>fixed</hi> for
the Ornament of Heaven and might, very many in number. The
<hi>Erratick</hi> are seaven, serving for number and time, and the illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of all things; for time is an intervall of the motion of the
World as an image of eternity, which is the measure of the state
of the eternall World. The Planets are not of equall power, the
<hi>Sun</hi> is the leader of all, who illuminateth and sheweth all things
to the eye. Next the <hi>Moon,</hi> which in respect of her power hath
the second place. The rest of the Planets, each according to their
severall proportions. The Moon maketh the measure of a <hi>Month,</hi>
in that space compleating its circle, and overtaking the Sun. The
Sun measureth the <hi>Year,</hi> for running through the circle of the
Zodiack, he compleateth the seasons of the year. Of the other
starrs each hath its proper revolution, with which all men are not
acquainted but only the Learned. By all those revolutions <hi>the
absolute number of time</hi> is compleated, when coming all to the

                     <p>There being seven Orbes in the Planetary sphear, the maker

part of the soul that was sent down from Heaven, they placed
in the <hi>Head,</hi> for which as a manured Field they prepared the
<hi>Brain.</hi> About the face they disposed Organs proper for sense;
<hi>Marrow</hi> they made of smooth straight triangles, of which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements
were formed, that it should be the Origine of prolifick
seed. <hi>Benes</hi> they formed of Marrow and Earth, the Earth moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and often dipt in Water and Fire. <hi>Flesh</hi> is compounded of
salt and sharpe, as of a kind of ferment. Marrow they enclosed
with <hi>bones,</hi> bones with <hi>sinewes</hi> instead of chaines, that by these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions
the knitting of the joints might be plyant. Over these as
a cover is extended the <hi>Skin,</hi> partly white, partly black, for
beauty and use. Of these likewise consist the internall <hi>bowells,</hi>
and the belly, and the intestines, every where rolled about it. And
from the mouth above the <hi>aspera arteria,</hi> and the <hi>oesophagus,</hi> of
which one commeth down to the stomack, the other to the
Lungs. Meat is digested in the belly by spirit and heat, and thence
distributed to the whole body according to their severall consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.
The two veines passing along the spine of the Back, meet
and crosse at the head, where they spread into many parts.</p>
                     <p>Thus when the Gods had made man, and given him a soul as
the Mistresse of his body, they placed the principall part of that
soul to which Reason appertaineth, in the head. Whence is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
marrow and sinewes, and by the different affection of this,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51150:210"/>
the minde likewise is altered. Moreover they gave him
senses, as the attendants of Reason, and the power of judging and
contemplating with Reason. Those parts of the soul, which are
moved by meaner affections, they seated in lower places; the ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scible
part in the heart, the concupiscible about the belly, and
the parts next to the Navell, of which hereafter.</p>

                     <p>AFter that the Gods had placed the eyes (conduits of light)
in the face, they included in them a fiery light, which being
smooth and in some manner thick, they conceived of kin to diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

through the Eye-balls, as being there most pure and clear.
This agreeing with the externall light, as like with like affordeth
the sense of sight, whence in the night, when the light vanisheth
and is obscured, this ray of ours no longer mingleth with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
air; but, on the contrary, withdrawing it self inwards,
smooths and diffuses the motions that are in us, and so bringeth
on sleep, whereby the eyelids are shut. If it bring much rest, the
sleep is little disturb'd with dreams, but if there remain any moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
behind, we are troubled with many illusions. In this manner
phantasies, whether true or false, arise. Of the same Nature are
images, which we see in glasses, or other smooth pellucid bodies,
which exist only by reflection. For, as the glasse is concave or
convex, or oblong, the object is differently represented to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder.
The light being reflected to other parts, those which
are dispersed in convex meet in the concave, for in some, the
right and left sides seem quite inverted, in others alike; in others,
those which are upwards seem downwards, and on the contrary,
those which are downwards, upwards.</p>

                     <p>Next followeth the sense proper to the Nostrills, perceptible
of odour. Odour is an affection which passeth from the veines of
the Nostrills to the parts of the Navell. The Species thereof
have no name, except the two that are most common, pleasant,
and unpleasant, commonly called sweet and stinking. All Odour
is more thick then Air, more thin then Water; for Odour is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

                     <p>The sense of touching was formed by the Gods to discern hot

to iudge the differences of each of these; <hi>Yielding</hi> bodies, we call
those which yield to the touch, <hi>resisting</hi> those which yield not;
this proceedeth from the bases of bodies, those which have large
bases are firm and solid, these which have narrow bases are
yielding, soft, and easily changed. Rough is that which is uneven
and hard, smooth that which is plain and thick: As warm and
cold qualities are most opposite, so they proceed from the most
different causes. That which cutteth by the acutenesse and rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

thick, in penetration, a cold, whilst the more rare are expelled, and
the more dense compelled to penetrate into their room. Thence
ariseth a concussion and trepidation, and (an affection which is

likewise for the clearing of divinations which are given by
dreams: for as much as in it by reason of its smoothnesse,

                     <p>THat the Soul and parts thereof according to their proper
faculties are threefold; every part appointed by reason
their severall places, is manifest from hence. Those things which
are separated by Nature, are divers; passionate and reasonable
are separate by nature; this being conversant in Intelligibles, that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51150:212"/>
in things sad or joyful, to omit the passive part which is common
likewise to bruit Beasts. Now these two being distinct by Nature,
must likewise be distinguished by place, because for the most
part they disagree, and are repugnant to one another; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be repugnant to it self, neither can those things which
are contrary to one another consist together in the same. In Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea
anger seemeth to contest thus with reason;

                     <head type="sub">Of the Immortality of the Soul.</head>
                     <p>THat the Soul is immortall <hi>Plato</hi> proveth by these Arguments.
The Soul to every thing, wherein it is, conferreth life, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
naturally innate in her self, but that which conferreth life to
others never admitteth death, but what is such is immortall.</p>
                     <p>The Soul being immortall, is likewise incorruptible, for it is
an incorporeall essence which cannot be changed substantially,
and is only perceptible by the Intellect, not by the eyes, and is
uniform. Hence it must be simple, neither can be at any time
dissolved or corrupted. The body is contrary, for it is subject to
sight and other senses, and as it is compounded, so shall it again
be dissolved, and it is multiform. When the Soul adhereth to
those things which are preceptible by Intellect, it acquieseeth;
Now to that by whose presence she is disturbed, she cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be like, wherefore she is more like to those things which are
perceptible by Intellect; but what is such is by nature incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
and perishable.</p>
                     <p>Again, the Soul naturally doth preside over the body, not the
body over the Soul, but that which by nature ruleth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
is of kin to Divinity, wherefore the Soul being next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, must be immortall, not subject to corruption.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:51150:213"/>
Again, Contraries which have no <hi>medium,</hi> not by themselves,
but by some accident are so ordered by Nature, that they may
be mutually made of one another. But that which men call life
is contrary to that which they call death; as therefore Death
is a separation of the Soul from the body; so islife a conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Soul with the body, praeexistent to the Body. But if
she be praeexistent, and shall subsist after the body, it followeth that
she be sempiternall, for there cannot any thing be imagined
whereby she may be corrupted.</p>
                     <p>Again, if learning be Reminiscence, the Soul must be immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
but that it is reminiscence we prove thus: Learning cannot
otherwise consist then by remembrance of those things we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
know. For, if from <hi>Singulars</hi> we understand <hi>Universalls,</hi>
how could we discourse by singulars which are infinite? or how
from a few perceive Universalls? we should therefore necessarily
be deceived, as if we judged that only to be a living Creature
which breatheth; or how could the notions themselves have the
reason of principles. By reminiscence therefore, from some few
which we have conceived in our mind, we understand the rest,
and from some occurrent particulars we remember those which
we knew long before, but were then given over to oblivion, when
the Soul first descended into the Body.</p>
                     <p>Again, if the Soul be not corrupted by its own proper ill, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can it be destroy'd by that or any other, nor simply by any
ill, and being such, shall remain uncorrupted.</p>
                     <p>Again, that which is moved in it self, as being the principle of
motion in those things which are moved, is alwaies moved; that
which is such is immortall; but the Soul is moved of it self, that
which is moved of it self is the principle of all motion and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
and a principle is expert of generation and corruption,
wherefore the Soules of men and of the Universe it self are such,
for both partake of the same mistion. He affirmeth the Soul to be
moveable in her self, because it hath an innate life, alwaies ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
by its power.</p>
                     <p>That rationall Soules are immortall, may clearly be asserted
out of <hi>Plato;</hi> but whether the irrationall be such seemeth doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
yet is it probable that being guided only by Phantasie,
not endued with reason or judgement, neither do they contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
any thing, or discern, or collect from it, nor can they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
ills, but generally understand nothing, nor are of the same
nature with those Soules which have Intellect and Reason, but
are capable of dying and being corrupted. For as much as they
are immortall, it followeth that they are put into bodies, being
planted into the formed Nature of Embrio's, and transmigrate
into severall bodies as well humane as others, either according to
some certain numbers which they expect, or by the wil of the
Gods, or for intemperance of life, or for love of the Body. For
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51150:213"/>
the Body and Soul have a kind of affinity, as Fire and Brimstone.</p>
                     <p>Moreover the Souls of the Gods have a dijudicative faculty,
called Gnostick, and impulsive to some action, called Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rastatick,
which faculties being likewise in humane Soules, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
changed as soon as they come into the bodie, the assistent
into the concupiscible, the impulsive into the Irascible.</p>

into infinite, there being an infinite generation of men, and
infinite accidents happening daily to them; besides that, this
would take away our free-will, our praise or dispraise, and
whatsoever is of that kind) but rather thus; Whatsoever Soul
chooseth such a life, and doth such things, these shall follow,
the Soul therefore is free, and it is left within its power to do or
not to do, without any compulsion or necessity. But that which
followeth the action is performed by Fate. As from <hi>Paris's</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing

                     </p>
                     <p>That which may be done is of a middle kind betwixt true and
false, and being so indefinite by Nature: that which is in our
power, is carried on as it were unto it. That which is done by our
election, is presently either true or false; that which is in power,
is different from that which is said to be in habit and act. That
which is in power declareth an aptitude in that thing, wherein
the habit is not yet perfect. So a boy may be said to be a Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
a Musician, a Carpenter in power. He is in habit of one or
more of these when he hath acquired that habit. He is said to be
in act, when he operateth according to that acquired habit. That
which we call possible to be done is none of these. Indeterminate

                     <p>WE must next give a short account of <hi>Plato's Ethicks.</hi> That
which is worthy of all honour, and is the Supreame
good, he conceived not easie to be found, and if found, not safe
to be declared. For this reason, he communicated the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the chief good to very few, and those of his most intimate
acquaintance, of whom his judgement made choice for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
But our good, if we examine his books dillgently, we shall
find he placed in the knowledge of the first good, which may
rightly be called God, and the first mind. For all things which
men call good, he conceiveth to be called good in this respect, for
as much as they derive somthing from that good, as all sweet and
hot things are termed such from some participation of the first
sweet, and first hot. Of those things which are in us, only the
mind and reason have a similitude of the first good. Wherefore
he calleth our good, Fair, Venerable, Amiable, Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate,
and lastly Beatitude. Of those which are commonly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
good, as health, beauty, strength, there is none good, unlesse it
be employed towards the practise of Vertue. For being separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from Vertue, they are like matter only, and to those who
make ill use of them only ill. Yet these <hi>Plato</hi> sometimes calleth
mortal goods. Beatitude he reckoneth not amongst humane goods,
but amongst the divine and immortall. Whence he asserteth that
the souls of true Philosophers are replenish'd with vast admirable
goods, and after the dissolution of their mortall body, are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

endeavours of their Soules to know it, and esteemed it the most
precious of all things, by the benefit whereof they illustrated and
excited their mind as a lost or blinded sight, preferring the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
thereof before many corporeall eyes. Foolish men are
like those who lead all their life in some Cave under ground,
where they never saw the light of the Sun, but only some empty
thin shadows of such bodies as are with us upon the Earth, which
seeing, they think they see true bodies. As these, if ever they
should be brought out of darknesse into the clear light, would
questionlesse despise all things which they saw before, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
much more, as having been absolutely deceived; So they
who rise up out of the darknesse of this life to those things which
are divine and fair, in all likelyhood will contemn what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they most esteemed, and love more vehemently this contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.

Thus it appeareth, that only what is good is honest, and

is manifest, in as much as he affirmeth that only to be good which
is honest, which he demonstrateth in many Dialogues, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in those of the Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>Hence he conceiveth that man to be most happy and blessed,
who hath attained the Science we mentioned; yet not in respect
of the honours which attend such a person, nor of any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
for though he be unknown to all men, and such things, as
are commonly accounted Ills, as, dishonour, banishment and
death happen unto him; he is notwithstanding happy. On the
contrary, a man who wants this knowledge, though he possesse
all things commonly esteemed good, riches, power, health,
strength, and Beauty, he is nothing the more happy.</p>
                     <p>He asserteth an ultimate end, conformable to all these which
is to be made like unto God, as far as Humanity is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such. This he expounds variously, somtimes as <hi>in Theaeteto</hi>)
he affirms our resemblance to God to consist in being prudent,
just, and holy; wherefore we must endeavour to fly with all
possible celerity from hence to those. This flight is the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
to God, as much as is possible: The similitude consisteth
in Prudence, Justice, and Sanctity; somtimes in Justice only, as
in his last Book of the Common-wealth. For a man is never deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by God, whilst he endeavoureth to be just, and by the very
act of Vertue, as much as man is capable of, he is rendred like
unto God. <hi>In Phaedone</hi> he asserteth, that this resemblance to God
is acquired by Temperance and Justice, thus. <hi>Are not they blessed
and happy, and from hence shall go into the best place, who have practised
the popular civill Vertue which they call Temperance and Iustice?</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
somtimes he affirmed, that the end of life is to be like
unto God, somtimes to follow God, as when hee saith,
God indeed according to the old saying, <hi>containing the beginning,
midale and end of all things,</hi> &amp;c. Somtimes he joyneth both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as when he saith, <hi>The Soul following God, and being rendred like
unto him,</hi> &amp;c. The principle of Utility is good it self; but this is
said of God, therefore the end conformable to the principle, is to
become like unto God, to the Celestiall, or rather supercelestiall
God, who hath not Vertue, but is more excellent then all Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
Wherefore it is rightly said, that <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Of the Vertues, some are placed in the rationall part, some in
the irrationall. For whereas the Nature of the rationall part is
one, that of the irascible another, that of the concupiscible ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the perfection of these must likewise be different. That of
the rationall is <hi>Prudence,</hi> of the irascible, <hi>Fortitude,</hi> of the concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible,
<hi>Temperance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prudence</hi> is the Science of things, Good, Bad, and betwixt
both.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Temperance</hi> is an apt moderation of desires and appetites; when
when we call Temperance a moderation and obedience, we mean
only this, that it is a faculty causing all appetites to be subjected
unto it, in decent order, and submisse obedience to be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by nature. This is the rationall part.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fortitude</hi> is a lawfull observation of a command difficult, or not
difficult, that is, it is a faculty which keepeth a lawfull precept.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iustices</hi> is an agreement amongst all these, which causeth that
the three parts of the Soul agree with one another, and that each
be worthily conversant in those things which are proper, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
unto it.</p>
                     <p>Thus it is a common intire perfection of these three Vertues,
<hi>Prudence, Fortitude</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> in such manner that reason
commandeth, and the rest of the parts, each according to its se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51150:215"/>
property, are restrained by Reason, and obey it.</p>
                     <p>Hence it followeth, that the Vertues are mutally consequent
to one another; Fortitude being the conservation of a lawfull
precept, is likewise conservative of right reason. Right reason
proceedeth from Prudence; Prudence cohereth with Fortitude,
for it is the knowledge of good things, but no man can discern
that which is good, if he be distracted by fear, or involved in the
like troubles. In like manner, neither can any man be wise, and
intemperate, for then he is overcome by affections. If a man do
somthing contrary to reason, <hi>Plato</hi> affirmeth he doth through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and imprudence, so that can be prudent that is intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
or fearfull. Whence it followeth, that the perfect Vertues
cohere to one another, and are inseparable.</p>

                     <p>THe gifts of Nature and progress in them are called Vertues
also, by reason of their similitude with the perfect Vertues,
assuming the same name. In this sence we call all souldiers stout,
and sometimes call imprudent and rash persons stout, when we
speak not of the perfect Vertues, for the perfect neither increase
nor decrease; but Vices are intended and remitted. One man is
more imprudent and more unjust then another, neither do all
the vices follow one another, for they are certain contraries
which are not competible to the same. Such is fury to Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
and prodigality to covetousnesse, nor can there be any man
at once possessed of all Vices, no more then a body tormented by
all diseases.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, there is a mean affection which inclineth not plainly
either to Vice or Vertue; for it is not necessary that all men must
be good or bad; they are such, who have arrived at the height
of these; for it is not easie to passe suddenly from Vertue to Vice,
because betwixt extreames there is a great intervall and
distance.</p>
                     <p>Of Vertues some are principall, others concomitant; princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
are those which are in the rationall part of the Soul, and by
which the other Vertues are perfected. Concomitant are
those which are in the other part which are subject to
Affections. These act honest things according to Reason, not
that which is in them, for they have none, but that which they
receive from Prudence, which is confirmed in them by custom and
exercise.</p>
                     <p>Now for as much as neither science nor art consisteth in any
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51150:216"/>
part of the soul, but in the rationall, those vertues which are in
the other part, that is subject to affections, cannot be taught, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are neither Arts nor Sciences, neither have they a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Doctrine. Prudence is a Science, which prescribeth unto
every one what is proper to him, as a Pilot, or Master of a Ship,
to inferiour ignorant Sailors. The like in a common Souldier
and a Generall.</p>
                     <p>For as much as Ills are intended and remitted, offences cannot
be equall, but some must be greater, others lesser, for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
they, who make Lawes, punish some more gently, other more
severely. And though Vertues are certain Heights, as being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and like unto that which is right, yet in another respect they
are called mediocrities, because all or the most of them are placed
betwixt two Vices, whereof one sinneth in excesse, the other in
defect; as on the one side of <hi>Liberality</hi> is <hi>Covetousnesse,</hi> on the other
<hi>Prodigality.</hi> For in affections we recede from the mean, when
we relinquish that which is placed in Vertue, either by excesse or
defect. But neither he, who beholding his Parents wronged is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
moved thereat, nor he who is incens'd at the smallest mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
void of passion or moderate, but the quite contrary. He who
at the death of his Parents grieveth not, is void of passion; He
who destroyeth himself with grieving, is overpassionate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate;
he who grieveth moderately, is moderately passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.
In like manner, he, who feareth upon all occasions, and
more then needs, is timerous; he who feareth nothing is rash; He
only is stout that can keep a mean betwixt fear and rashnesse; the
like in all the rest. And for as much as that which is mean in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
is likewise best, and mediocrity is nothing but a mean
betwixt excesse and defect, there are these Vertues termed Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrities,
because in humane perturbations and passions they affect
us a middle kind of way.</p>

                     <p>VErtue being chiefly of those things which are in our power,
not compulsive (for it could not deserve praise, if it came
either by nature or divine decree) it followeth, that Vertue is
voluntary, begotten by a servent, generous, and firm impulsion.</p>
                     <p>From this, that Vertue is voluntary, it followeth that Vice is
involuntary. For, who, in the most excellent part of himselfe,
would ever voluntarily choose that which is the greatest of all
Ills? When a man is carried on to Vice, he first inclineth to it,
not as if it were ill, but good, and if he fall into ill, doubtlesse, he
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51150:216"/>
is deceived with thinking, that this way by a lesser ill, he may
arrive at a greater good, and goeth in this manner unwillingly
to it. For, it is not possible, a man should pursue ill as it is ill,
without any hope of good, or, fear of a greater ill. All ill things
therefore, which an ill man doth, are involuntary; for, injustice
being involuntary, to act unjustly is so much more involuntary,
as the action of Vice is beyond the idle habit thereof. Yet, though
wicked actions are involuntary, the wicked neverthelesse ought
to be punished, and that not after one manner; but, according to
the variety of hurt which they do to those they wrong. That
which is involuntary consisteth in ignorance of perturbations,
all which may be diverted, either by reason, or civill custome, or
diligence.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>FRiendship,</hi> properly so termed, is made by a mutuall recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
benevolence. This is, when either is as much concerned
for the happinesse of the ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er, as of his own, which equality is
preserved only by similitude of manners: For, the like is friend
to its like, if they be both moderate; but, the intemperate cannot
agree, either with themselves, or the moderate.</p>
                     <p>There are other things which are thought friendships, but are
are not such, in which there appeareth some shew of vertue. Of
these, is the naturall goodwill of Parents to their Children, and
of Kindred one to another, as also that which is called civill and
sociable: These are not alwaies accompanyed with mutual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence.
Likewise, the amatory art is a kind of friendship. That
which is honest is proper to a generous soul, dishonest, to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse;
mean, to one meanly affected. For, as the habit of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
soul is three-fold, right, dishonest, and mean; so many
different kinds are there of love, which appeareth most clearly
in the difference of the ends they propose unto themselves. The
dishonest aimes only at corporeall pleasure, and therefore is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
bruitish. The honest considereth the minde only, as far
as vertue appeareth in it. The mean desireth both the beauty of
the soul and of the body; of which love, he who is worthy, is
mean likewise; that is, neither absolutely honest nor dishonest.
Hence that love which aimeth only at the body, ought to be
tearmed a Demon (rather then a Deity, which never descendeth to
an human bodie) transmitting divine things to men, and human
to God.</p>
                     <p>Of the three kinds of love, that which is proper to a good man,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51150:217"/>
being remote from vicious affections, is artificiall, whence it is
placed in the rationall part of the soul. The contemplations
thereof are these, to discern who is worthy of love, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
friendship with him, and enjoy it: This discernment is made
from his aimes or desires, whether they are generous, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to a good end, or violent and servent. The contraction, or
acquisition of friendship, is made, not by wanton excessive praise,
but rather by reprehension, shewing him, that it is not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
he should live in that manner he doth; when he enjoyeth the
love of him whom he affects, he must alwaies exhort him to those
things, by exercise whereof, he may arrive at perfect habit.
Their end is that of lover and beloved, they may at last become
friends.</p>

                     <p>IN justice is so great an ill, that it is better to suffer wrong then
to do wrong; for one belongeth to a wicked man, the other to
a weak man: both are dishonest, but to do wrong is worse, by
how much it is more dishonest. It is as expedient that a wicked
man be punished, as that a sick man should be cured by a Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;
for all chastisement is a kind of medicine for an offending
Soul.</p>
                     <p>Since the greater part of Vertues are conversant about passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it is necessary that we define passion. Passion is an irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
motion of the Soul, arising out of some good or ill; it is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an irrationall motion, because neither judgments nor opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are passions; but motions of the irrationall parts of the Soul.
For in the irrationall part of the Soul, there are motions, which
though they are done by us, are yet nothing the more in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
They are often done therefore contrary to our inclination and
will; for somtimes it falleth out, that though we know things
to be neither pleasing nor unpleasing, expetible nor avoidable,
yet we are drawn by them, which could never be if such passions
were the same with Judgement. For we reject judgement when
we disapprove it whether it ought to be so or otherwise. In the
definition is added, arising from some good or some ill, because
of that which is mean or indifferent betwixt these, no passion is
ever excited in us. All passions arise from that which seemeth
good or ill. If we see good present, we rejoice, if future, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.
On the conrrary, if ill be present, we grieve, if imminent, we
fear.</p>
                     <p>The simple affections, and, as it were, elements of the rest are
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51150:217"/>
two; <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Grief;</hi> the rest consist of these. Neither are fear
and desire to be numbred among the principall passions, for
he who feareth, is not wholly deprived of pleasure, nor can a
man live the least moment, who despaireth to be freed or eased
of some ill. But it is more conversant in grief and sorrow, and
therefore he, who feareth, sorroweth. But he who desireth, like
all those who desire or expect somthing, is delighted; insomuch
as he is not absolutely confident; and hath not a firm hope he is
grieved. And if desire and fear are not principall passions, it will
doubtlesse follow, that none of the other affections are simple; as
anger, love, emulation and the like; for in these, Pleasure and
Grief are manifest, as consisting of them.</p>
                     <p>Moreover of Passions, some are rough, others mild, the mild
are those, which are naturally in men, and if kept within their
bounds, are necessary and proper to man, if they exceed, vitious.
Such are Pleasure, Grief, Anger, Pitty, Modesty; for it is proper
to man to <hi>delight</hi> in those things which are according to Nature,
and to be grieved at their contraries. <hi>Anger</hi> is necessary to repell
and punish an injury. <hi>Mercy</hi> agreeth with Humanity. <hi>Modesty</hi>
teacheth us to decline sordid things. Other passions are rough, and
praeternaturall, arising from some depraved or perverse custom.
Such are excessive laughter, joy in the misfortunes of others, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of Mankind. These, whether intense or remisse, after what
manner soever they are, are alwaies erroneous, and admit not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
laudable mediocrity.</p>
                     <p>As concerning Pleasure and Grief, <hi>Plato</hi> writeth thus. These
passions are excited in us by Nature. Grief and sorrow happen to
those who are moved contrary to Nature; Pleasure to those who
are restored to the proper constitution of their Nature. For he
conceiveth the naturall state of man to consist in a mean betwixt
Pleasure and Grief, not moved by either, in which state we live
longest. He asserteth severall kinds of Pleasure, whereof some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to the <hi>Body,</hi> others to the <hi>Soul.</hi> Again, of Pleasures some are
<hi>mix'd</hi> with grief, some are <hi>pure.</hi> Again, some proceed from the
<hi>remembrance</hi> of things past, others from <hi>hope</hi> of things to come. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
some are <hi>dishonest,</hi> as being intemperate and unjust; others
<hi>moderate,</hi> and joyned with good, as joy for good things, and the
Pleasure that followeth Vertue. Now because most Pleasures
are naturally dishonest, he thinks it not to be disputed whether
Pleasure can be simply and absolutely a good, that being to be
accounted poor and of no value, which is raised out of another,
and hath not a principall primary essence. For Pleasure cohereth
even with its contrary Grief, and is joyned with it, which could
not be, if one were simply good, the other simply ill.</p>

others, in his Epistles, which he useth for those Cities that in his
Books of Laws he saith are sick. These have a distinct place, and
select men out of every age, as according to the diversity of their
nature and place, they require different institution, education and
armes. The Maritime people are to study Navigation and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight;
the Iland fighting on foot; those in mountanous Countries
to use light armour, those on the shore heavy. Some of these to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
fighting on horseback. In this City he alloweth not a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of women. Thus is Politick a Verue conversant both in
Action and Contemplation; the end wherof is to constitute a
City, good, happy, and convenient to it self. It considers a great
many things, amongst the rest, whether War be to be waged or
not.</p>

                     <p>HItherto we have spoken of a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> from whom a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phist</hi>
differeth; In <hi>Manners,</hi> because he teacheth young men for

Philosopher is conversant in those things which alwaies are, and
continually remain in the same manner; but a Sophist in that
which is not, for which reason he seeketh darknesse, that he may
not be known to be what he is. To things that are, that which is
not, is not opposed as contrary, for it neither existeth, nor is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipant
of any essence, nor can be understood. So that if any man
endeavour to expresse it in words, or comprehend it by thought;
he is deceived, because he putteth together things contrary and
repugnant. Yet that which is not, as far as it is spoken, is not a
pure negation of that which is, but implyeth a relation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which in some manner is joined to <hi>Ens.</hi> So that unlesse we
assume somthing from that which is to that which is not, it cannot
be distinguished from other things, but thus, as many kinds as
they are of <hi>Ens,</hi> so many are there of <hi>Non-Ens,</hi> because that which

                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a principle of the Platonists, That every
created thing hath a threefold being; Causal,
Formal, Participated. In the Sun there is no
heat, that being but an elementary quality,
not of Celestiall nature: yet is the Sun the
cause and Fountain of all hear. Fire is hot by
nature, and its proper form: Wood is not hot
of its self, yet is capable of receiving that quality by Fire. Thus
hath heat its Causall being in the Sun, its Formall in the Fire, its
Participated in the Fuel. The most noble and perfect of these is
the Causal: and therefore Platonists assert, That all excellencies
are in God after this manner of being; That in God is nothing,
but from him all things; That Intellect is not in him, but that he
is the original spring of every Intellect. Such is <hi>Plotinus</hi>'s meaning,
when he affirms,<note n="*" place="margin">Ennead. 6. lib. 7. 37.</note> 
                           <hi>God neither understands nor knows;</hi> that is to say,
after a formall way, As <hi>Dionysius Areopagita, God is neither an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall
nor Intelligent nature, but unspeakably exalted above all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect
and Knowledge.</hi>

                        <p>PLatonists distinguish Creatures into three degrees. The first
comprehends the corporeall and visible; as Heaven, Elements,
and all compounded of them: The last the invisible, incorporeal,
absolutely free from bodies, which properly are called Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
(by Divines, Angelicall) Natures. Betwixt these is a
middle nature, which though incorporeall, invisible, immortall,
yet moveth bodies, as being obliged to that Office; called, the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51150:219"/>
rationall Soul; inferiour to Angells, superiour to Bodies; subject
to those, regent of these: Above which is God himselfe, author
and principle of every Creature, in whom Divinity hath a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
being; from whom, proceeding to Angells, it hath a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
being, and thence is derived into the rationall Soul by
participation of their lustre: below which, no nature can assume
the Title of Divine.</p>

                        <p>THat the first of these three Natures cannot be multiplyed,
who is but one, the principle and cause of all other Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
is evidently proved by Platonists, Peripateticks, and our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.
About the second (<hi>viz.</hi>) The Angelick and Intellectuall,
Platonists disagree. Some (as <hi>Proclus, Hermias, Syrianus,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others) betwixt God and the rationall Soul place a great
number of creatures; part of these they call <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
part intellectuall; which termes, <hi>Plato</hi> sometimes confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
as in his <hi>Phaedo. Plotinus, Porphyrius,</hi> and generally the most
refined Platonists, betwixt God and the Soul of the World, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
only one Creature, which they call the Son of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
immediately produced by him. The first opinion complies
most with <hi>Dionysius Areopagita,</hi> and Christian Divines, who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
the number of Angells to be in a manner infinite. The second
is the more Philosophick, best suiting with <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi>
whose sense we only purpose to expresse; and therefore will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
the first path (though that only be the right) to pursue the
latter.</p>

                        <head>Sect. IV.</head>
                        <p>VVE therefore, according to the opinion of <hi>Plotinus,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
not only by the best Platonists, but, even by
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> and all the Arabians, especially <hi>Avicenna,</hi> affirm, That
God from eternity produced a creature of incorporeall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall
nature, as perfect as is possible for a created being,
beyond which, he produced nothing; for, of the most perfect
cause, the effect must be most perfect, and the most perfect can
be but one; for, of two or more, it is not possible but one should
be more or lesse perfect than the rest, otherwise they would not
be two, but the same. This reason for our opinion I rather
choose, then that which <hi>Avicen</hi> alledges, founded upon this
principle, That from one cause, as one, can proceed but one ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
We conclude therefore, that no creature but this first
minde proceeds immediately from God: for, of all other effects
issuing from this minde, and all other second causes, God is only
the mediate efficient. This by <hi>Plato, Hermes,</hi> and <hi>Zoroaster,</hi> is called
the <hi>Daughter of God,</hi> the <hi>Minde, Wisdome, Divine Reason,</hi> by some
interpreted <hi>the Word;</hi> not meaning (with our Divines) the Son of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51150:220"/>
God, he not being a creature, but one essence coequall with the
Creator.</p>

Materiall and Sensible: So that when a Man builds a house,
they affirm there are two, one Intellectuall in the Workmans

                        <p>AFter the pattern of that Mind they affirm this sensible
World was made, and the exemplar being the most perfect
of all created things, it must follow that this Image thereof be as
perfect as its nature will bear. And since animate things are more
perfect then the inanimate; and of those the rational then the
irrationall, we must grant, this World hath a Soul perfect above
all others. This is the first rationall Soul, which, though incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall,
and immateriall, is destin'd to the function of governing
and moving corporeall Nature: not free from the body as that
mind whence from Eternity it was deriv'd, as was the mind
from God. Hence Platonists argue the World is eternall; its
soul being such, and not capable of being without a body, that
also must be from eternity; as likewise the motion of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
because the Soul cannot be without moving.</p>

grounds: In God we understand first his Excellence,
which as Cause, he hath above all his effects; for this he is called
<hi>Coelus.</hi> Secondly, the production of those effects, which denotes
conversion towards inferiours; in this respect he is sometimes
called <hi>Iupiter,</hi> but with an addition, <hi>Optimus, Maximus.</hi> The first
Angelick nature hath more names, as more diversity. Every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
consists of Power and Act: the first, <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Philebo,</hi> calls In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite:
the second, Finite: all imperfections in the Mind are by
reason of the first; all perfections, from the latter. Her operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are threefold. About Superiours, the contemplation of God;
about the knowledge of herself; about inferiours, the production
and care of this sensible World: these three proceed from Act.
By Power she descends to make inferiour things; but in either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
is firm within her self. In the two first, because contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
she is called <hi>Saturn:</hi> in the third, <hi>Iupiter,</hi> a name principally
applyed to her power, as that part from whence is derived the
act of Production of things. For the same reason is the soul of the
World, as she contemplates her self or superiours, termed <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;</hi>
as she is imployed in ordering worldly things, <hi>Iupiter:</hi> and
since the government of the World belongs properly to her; the
contemplation to the Mind; therefore is the one absolutely called

this corporeall World; which as long as it remains under <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi>
that is, in its Ideal Intellectual being, is one and undivided;
and so more firm and potent: but falling into the hands of his
Sons, that is, chang'd to this material Being, and by them divided
into three parts, according to the triple existence of bodies, is
more infirm and lesse potent, degenerating from a spiritual to a
corporeal estate. The first part, the heavenly, they attribute to

because in this principality is all generation and corruption, the
Theologians express it by the Ocean, ebbing or flowing continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
by <hi>Neptune</hi> understanding the Power or deity that presides over
Generation. Yet we must not imagine these to be different souls,

so of desire. Love is a species of desire, Beauty of good. Desire
is Naturall or Knowing. All creatures have a particular perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
by participation of the divine goodnesse. This is their end,
including that degree of felicity whereof they are capable, to
which center they tend. This desire we call Naturall; a great te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of Divine Providence, by which they are unwittingly
(as an Arrow by the Archer) directed to their mark. With this,
all Creatures desire. God, as being the Originall good imprinted
and participated in every particular. This is in every Nature, as
more or lesse capable; addressed to ends more or lesse noble; yet,
is the ultimate end of all the same, to enjoy God, as far as they
may: Thus as the Psalmist, <hi>Every thing worships and praiseth God;</hi>

desires, possesseth in part the thing he desires, in part not: for,
if he were wholly deprived of its Possession, he would never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
it: this is verified two waies. First, nothing is desired unlesse it
be known; and to know a thing is in some part to possesse it. So

some convenience and resemblance betwixt the desirer and
desired: Every thing delights and preserves it selfe by that,
which by naturall affinity is most conformable to it; by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

Repugnance of two opposite natures is naturall hate. Hate is
a repugnance with knowledge. Hence it followeth, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the desired, is in some manner in the desirer; otherwise,
there would be no similitude betwixt them: yet imperfectly;
else it were vain for it to seek what it entirely possesseth.</p>

                        <p>AS desire generally followes knowledge, so severall knowing

the knowing into three degrees; Sence, Reason, Intellect; atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by three desiderative Vertues, Appetite, Election, Will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Appetite is in Bruits, Election in Men, Will in Angels. The
sense knowes only corporeall things, the Appetite only desires
such; the Angelick Intellect is wholly intent on Contemplation
of spirituall Conceptions, not inclining to Materiall Things, but
when divested of matter, and spiritualiz'd, their Will is only
fed with intemporall spirituall Good. Rationall Nature is the
Mean betwixt these Extreams; sometimes descending to Sense,
sometimes elevated to Intellect; by its own Election complying
with the desires of which she pleaseth. Thus it appears, that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall
Objects are desired, either by Sensuall Appetite, or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Reason inclining to Sense: Incorporeall by Angelick
Will, or, the Election of Reason, elevated to Intellectuall
Height.</p>

temperament, and mixture of various Natures, agreeing in the
composition of one, every Creature is Fair; and in this sence no
simple being is Beautifull, not God himselfe; this Beauty begins

it being the union of contraries, a friendly enmity, a

adding, that in God only there is no Discord, He not being
the Union of severall Natures; but, a pure uncompounded Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
In these compositions the Union necessarily predominates
over the contrariety, otherwise the Fabrick would be dissolved.
Thus in the fictions of Poets, <hi>Venus</hi> loves <hi>Mars:</hi> this Beauty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

They, as all other things, have a two-fold Being, Ideal and
Naturall. The first God in his Naturall Being was Love, who
dispenc'd theirs to all the rest, the last in his Ideal. Love was
born in the Descent of the Ideas into the Angelick Minde,
which could not be perfect till they, its Essence, were made so,
by loves conversion to God. The Angelick Minde owing its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
being to Love, the other Gods who succeeded this Minde,
necessarily are younger then He in their naturall Being, though
they precede him in their Ideal, as not born till these Ideas,
though imperfectly, were joyn'd to the inform'd Nature.</p>

of causes and effects in this sensible World, called Fate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on the order of the Intelligible World, Providence. Hence
Platonists place Providence (the ordering of Ideas) in the first
Minde, depending upon God, its ultimate end, to which it leads
all other things. Thus <hi>Venus,</hi> being the order of those Ideas,
whereon Fate, the Worlds order, depends, commands it.</p>
                        <p>Fate is divided into three parts, <hi>Clotho, Lachesis,</hi> and <hi>Atropos:</hi>
That which is one in Providence, indivisible in Eternity, when
it comes into Time and Fate is divisible, into Past, Present,
and Future. Others apply <hi>Atropos</hi> to the fixed Sphear, <hi>Clotho</hi> to
the seven Planets, <hi>Lachesis</hi> to sublunary things.</p>
                        <p>Temporall corporeall things only are subjected to Fate; the
Rationall Soul being incorporeall, predominates over it; but, is
subjected to Providence, to serve which is true liberty. By whom
the Will (obeying its Lawes) is led to the Acquisition of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
end. And as often as she endeavours to loose her selfe from
this Servitude, of Free she becomes a Servant and Slave to Fate,
of whom before she was the Mistresse. To deviate from the Laws
of Providence, is, to forsake Reason, to follow Sense and Irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
Appetite, which being corporeall, are under Fate; he that
serves these, is much more a servant then those he serves.</p>

                        <p>VUlgar Love is the Appetite of sensible Beauty, through
corporeall sight. The cause of this Beauty is the visible
Heaven by its moving power. As our motive faculty consists in
Muscles and Nerves (the Instruments of its Operation,) so the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51150:225"/>
motive faculty of Heaven is fitted with a Body proper for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
sempiternall motion: Through which Body the Soul (as a
Painter with his Pencill changeth this inferiour matter into <unclear>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</unclear> Forms. Thus vulgar <hi>Venus</hi> (the beauty of materiall forms) hath her casuall being from the moving power of the Heavens, her formall from colour, enlightned by the visible Sun as Ideas by the invisible; her participate in the Figure and just order of
parts communicated to sight by mediation of light and colour,
by whose Interest only it procures love.</p>

                        <p>AS when the Ideas descend into the Minde, there ariseth a
desire of enjoying that, from whence this Ideall Beauty
comes; so when the species of sensible Beauty flow into the Eye,
there springs a two-fold Appetite of Union with that, whence
this Beauty is derived; one Sensuall, the other Rationall; the
principles of Bestiall and Human Love. If We follow Sense, We
Judge the Body wherein We behold this Beauty, to be its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
whence proceedes a desire of Coition, the most intimate
union with it: This is the Love of irrationall Creatures. But
Reason knowes, that the Body is so far from being its Originall,
that it is destructive to it, and the more it is sever'd from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
the more it enjoyes its own Nature and Dignity: We must
not fix with the species of Sense in the Body, but refine that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
from all reliques of corporeall infection.</p>
                        <p>And because Man may be understood by the Rationall Soul,
either considered apart, or, in its union to the Body; in the first
sence, human Love is the Image of the Celestiall; in the second,
Desire of sensible Beauty; this being by the Soul abstracted from
matter, and (as much as its nature will allow) made Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
The greater part of men reach no higher than this; others
more perfect, remembring that more perfect Beauty which the
Soul (before immers'd in the Body) beheld, are inflam'd with an
incredible desire of reviewing it, in pursuit whereof, they sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
themselves as much as possible from the Body, of which the
Soul (returning to its first dignity) becomes absolute Mistresse.
This is the Image of Celestiall Love, by which man ariseth
from one perfection to another, till his Soul (wholly united to
the Intellect) is made an Angell. Purged from materiall drosse,
and transformed into spirituall flame by this Divine Power, he
mounts up to the Intelligible Heaven, and happily rests in his
Fathers bosome.</p>

                        <p>VUlgar Love is only in Souls immerst in Matter, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by it, or at least hindred by perturbations and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Angelick Love is in the Intellect, eternall as it. Yet but
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51150:226"/>
inferr'd, the greater part turning from the Intellect to sensible
things, and corporeall cares. But so perfect are these Celestiall
Souls, that they can discharge both Functions, rule the Body;
yet not be taken off from Contemplation of Superiours: These
the Poets signifie by <hi>Ianus</hi> with two faces, one looking forward
upon Sensible things, the other on intelligible: lesse perfect Souls
have but one face, and when they turn that to the Body, cannot
see the Intellect, being depriv'd of their contemplation; when to
the Intellect, cannot see the Body, neglecting the Care thereof.
Hence those Souls that must forsake the Intellect, to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to Corporeall Government, are by Divine Providence
confin'd to caduque, corruptible Bodies, loosed from which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they may in a short time, if they fail not themselves, return to
their Intellectuall felicity. Other Soules not hindred from Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
are tyed to eternall incorruptible Bodies.</p>
                        <p>Celestial Souls then (design'd by <hi>Ianus,</hi> as the Principles of
Time, motion intervening) behold the Ideal Beauty in the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
to love it perpetually; and inferiour sensible things, not to
desire their Beauty; but, to communicate this other to them.
Our Souls before united to the Body, are in like manner double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd;
but, are then as it were, cleft asunder, retaining but one;
which as they turn to either object, Sensuall or Intellectuall, is
deprived of the other.</p>
                        <p>Thus is vulgar love inconsistent with the Celestiall; and many
ravish'd at the sight of Intellectuall Beauty, become blinde to
sensible; imply'd by <hi>Callimachus, Hymn.</hi> 5. in the Fable of <hi>Tyresias,</hi>
who viewing <hi>Pallas</hi> naked, lost his sight; yet by her was made
a Prophet, closing the eyes of his Body, she open'd those of his
Minde, by which he beheld both the Present and Future. The
Ghost of <hi>Achilles</hi> which inspir'd <hi>Homer</hi> with all Intellectuall
Contemplations in Poetry, deprived him of corporeal sight.</p>
                        <p>Though Celestiall Love liveth eternally in the Intellect of
every Soul; yet, only those few make use of it, who declining the
Care of the Body, can with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> say, <hi>Whether in the Body, or
out of the Body they know not.</hi> To which state a Man sometimes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives;
but, continues there but a while, as we see in Extasies.</p>

if through too much affection to its own liberty, and desire to
prefer the licentious life before the profitable, it rebell from the

Sensible light is the act and efficacy of Corporeall, spirituall
light of Intelligible Beauty. Ideas in their descent into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
Angelick Minde, were as colours and figures in the Night:
As he who by Moon-light seeth some fair object, desires to view
and enjoy it more fully in the day; so the Minde, weakly behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in her selfe the Ideal Beauty dim and opacous (whch our
Author calls <hi>the skreen of a dark shade</hi>) by reason of the Night of
her imperfection, turns like the Moon) to the eternall Sun, to
perfect her Beauty by him; to whom addressing her selfe, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
Intelligible light; clearing the Beauty of Celestiall <hi>Venus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi>
and rendring it visible to the eye of the first Minde.</p>
                        <p>In sensible Beauty we consider first the object in it selfe, the
same at Midnight as at Moon: Secondly, the light, in a manner
the Soul thereof: the Author supposeth, that as the first part of
sensible Beauty (corporeall forms) proceeds from the first part of
Intellectual Beauty (Ideal forms) so sensible light flowes from the
intelligible, descending upon Ideas.</p>

                        <p>Corporeall Beauty implies, first, the materiall disposition of
the Body, consisting of quantity in the proportion and distance

not allowes her handsome, as wanting this Grace. This then
must by consequence be ascribed to the Soul, which when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and lucid, transfuseth even into the Body some Beams of its
Splendour. When <hi>Moses</hi> came from the divine Vision in the

From materiall beauty wee ascend to the first Fountain by six
Degrees: the Soule through the sight represents to her self the
Beauty of some particular person, inclines to it, is pleased with
it, and while she rests here, is in the first, the most imperfect mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
degree. 2. She reforms by her imagination the Image she hath
received, making it more perfect as more spirituall; and separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it from Matter, brings it a little nearer Ideal Beauty. 3. By
the light of the agent Intellect abstracting this Form from all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity,
she considers the universall Nature of Corporeal Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by it self: This is the highest degree the Soul can reach whilst
she goes no further then Sense. 4. Reflecting upon her own Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
the knowledge of universall Beauty, and considering that
every thing founded in matter is particular, shee concludes this
universality proceeds not from the outward Object, but her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal
Power: and reasons thus: If in the dimme Glasse of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
Phantasmes this Beauty is represented by vertue of my
Light, it follows, that beholding it in the clear Mirrour of my sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
divested of those Clouds, it will appear more perspicuous:
thus turning into her self, shee findes the Image of Ideal Beauty
communicated to her by the Intellect, the Object of Celestiall
Love. 5. Shee ascends from this Idea in her self, to the
place where Celestiall <hi>Venus</hi> is, in her proper form; Who in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of her beauty not being comprehensible, by any particular
Intellect, she, as much as in her lies, endeavours to be united to
the first Mind, the chiefest of Creatures, and general Habitation of
Ideal Beauty, obtaining this, she terminates, and sixeth her jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:
this is the sixt and last degree: They are all imply'd in the 6, 7,
and 8 <hi>Stanza's.</hi>

                        <p>Platonists affirm some Souls are of the nature of <hi>Saturn,</hi> others
of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> or some other Planet; meaning, one Soul hath more
Conformity in its Nature with the Soul of the Heaven of <hi>Saturn,</hi>
then with that of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and so on the contrary; of which there
can be no internal Cause assigned; the External is God, who (as

                        <p>Many imagine the Rational Soul descending from her Star, in
her <hi>Vehiculum Coeleste,</hi> of her self forms the Body, to which by that
Medium she is united: Our Author upon these grounds suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
that into the <hi>Vehiculum</hi> of the Soul, by her endued with Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to form the Body, is infused from her Star a particular forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
vertue, distinct according to that Star; thus the aspect of one
is Saturnine, of another Joviall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their looks wee read the
nature of their Souls.</p>
                        <p>But because inferiour matter is not ever obedient to the Stamp,
the vertue of the Soul is not alwaies equally exprest in the visible
Effigies: hence it happens that two of the same Nature are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51150:231"/>
like; the matter whereof the one consists, being lesse dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to receive that Figure then the other; what in that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
is in this imperfect; our Author infers, that the figures of two
Bodies being formed by vertue of the same Star, this Conformity
begets Love.</p>

he is not sick, but <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath molested him, &amp; driven him
out of the School, so that now he teacheth Philosophy in his own

and dissolute; he frequently took a sum of

his extravagances upon occasion. Even in the Academy
were found three <hi>oboli,</hi> which he had hid under a Pillar, upon

speak of modesty and temperance, with the gravity of whose dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
<hi>Polemo</hi> being reduced to repentance, first took his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
off from his head, and flung it on the ground; soon after he
withdrew his arme within his Cloake; Next hee laid
aside the cheerfulnesse of that look which he had formerly,
when he affected feasting; lastly, he wholly devested himselfe of
Luxury, and being thus cured by the wholsom Medicine of one
discourse, he, from an infamous Prodigall became a most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

happening thereupon in the City, he asked without any distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
what was the matter? In the Theatres also, he was nothing
moved. When <hi>Nicostratus</hi> the Poet, sirnamed <hi>Clytemnestra,</hi> recited
somthing to him and <hi>Crates, Crates</hi> was much taken therwith,

become admired for subtlety in discourse, but contradict our

vertue; but, on the contrary, he placed all things that are
reckon'd among the good, in vertue only: and this he called
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51150:241"/>
                        <hi>honest,</hi> as being simple, sole, one good: Of the rest, though neither

<hi>contrary to Nature,</hi> others <hi>Mediate:</hi> Those which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Nature, he held to be <hi>worthy estimation,</hi> the contrary
<hi>contrary;</hi> the neuter he left <hi>betwixt both,</hi> in which he placed no

some of lesse; those which were of more he called <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serred,</hi>

mediate, holding that Rectitudes consisted only in good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
sins in evill; but, offices either performed or omitted, he
conceived mediate things. And whereas the Philosophers of
the <hi>old Academy</hi> did not hold all Vertue to consist in Reason,

                        <hi>Zeno</hi> on

may be separated, <hi>Zeno</hi> maintained that could not be, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verring,
that not only the use of vertue (as the <hi>Academicks</hi> held)
but the habit thereof was excellent in it selfe, neither had any
one vertue, who did not alwaies make use of it. And whereas
the <hi>Academicks</hi> took not away passion from man, affirming that
we are subject to compassion, desire, fear, and joy by nature;
but, only contracted them, and reduced them within narrower
limits; <hi>Zeno</hi> affirmed, that from all these, as from so many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
a wise man must be free. And whereas <hi>they</hi> held, that all
passions were naturall and irrationall, and placed in one part of
the Soule Concupiscence, in the other Reason: Neither did <hi>Zeno</hi>
herein agree with them, for he asserted, that passions are vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,

tell him what they thought, which when they had done,
he disputed against it; but, his Auditors were to maintain their
own opinion as much as they could possibly. This course took
<hi>Arcesilaus,</hi> contrary to all other Philosophers, amongst whom,

                     <p>This School constituted by <hi>Arcesilaus,</hi> was called <hi>the second

He was very liberall and free from covetousnesse, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by his Utensills of silver, and vying with <hi>Archecrates</hi> and
<hi>Callicrates.</hi> He had many vessells of gold, which he lent unto
many upon occasion of feasting. These silver vessells a certain
man borrowed to entertain his friends withall; <hi>Arcesilaus</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to be poor, would never send for them back: Others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
he lent them to him on purpose, and when he brought them
back, because he was poor, he freely bestowed them on him.</p>
                     <p>He had a fair estate at <hi>Pitane,</hi> from which <hi>Pylades</hi> his brother
continually supplyed him. <hi>Eumenes</hi> also, son of <hi>Phileterus</hi> gave
him many large presents, whence to him only of all Kings he
applyed himselfe.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Antigonus</hi> was much followed, and many persons
thronged to his house, he forbore, declining his acquaintance.
He was intimate with <hi>Hierocles,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Munichia</hi> and
<hi>Pireum,</hi> and constantly, on holidaies, went thither to visit him:
<hi>Hierocles</hi> often entreated him to visit <hi>Antigonus,</hi> but he refused,
and went along with him as far as the dore, and there parted
with him. After <hi>Antigonus</hi>'s fight at Sea, many writing consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Epistles to him, <hi>Arcesilaus</hi> was silent. Being sent by his
Country on an Embassy to <hi>Antigonus</hi> at <hi>Demetrias,</hi> he returned
frustrate of his designe.</p>
                     <p>He lived the greatest part of his time in the Academy, avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to meddle with publick businesse; but sometimes went to
the <hi>Pireum,</hi> as we said, out of love to <hi>Hierocles;</hi> for which some
reproved him.</p>
                     <p>He was very magnificent (indeed a second <hi>Aristippus</hi>) in the
entertainment of his friends. He openly professed love to <hi>Theodote</hi>
and <hi>Phileta,</hi> Curtezans of <hi>Elis,</hi> for which being reprehended, he
rehearsed the <hi>Chria's</hi> of <hi>Aristippus.</hi> He was very amarous, and
much affected the company of young men, whence <hi>Aristo</hi> of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os,</hi>
a Stoick, called him a corrupter of youth, temerarious, and
impudent. Of those whom he affected are mentioned <hi>Demetrius</hi>
and <hi>Leochares; Demochares</hi> son of <hi>Laches,</hi> and <hi>Pythocles</hi> son of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerus,</hi>
much affected him.</p>
                     <p>For these things he was much inveighed against at the house
of <hi>Hieronimus</hi> the Peripatetick, who had invited his friends to
celebrate the birth day of <hi>Alcyoneus,</hi> son of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> for the
keeping of which Feast, <hi>Antigonus</hi> sent yearly much mony. At
this Feast <hi>Arcesilaus</hi> would not dispute amidst the cups; and when
<hi>Aridelus</hi> propounded a question to him, requiring that he would
say something to it, he answer'd, it is the best property of a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
to know the seasons of all things.</p>
                     <p>But, he was so free from pride, that he counselled his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
to go and hear other Masters; and when a certain <hi>Chian</hi>
youth of his School declared, that he was not pleased with what
he said so much as with the discourses of <hi>Hieronimus,</hi> he took
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51150:244"/>
him by the hand and led him to the Philosopher, desiring him
to cherish him according to his quality.</p>

                     <p>HE succeeded <hi>Egesinus</hi> in the School, and is by <hi>Cicero</hi> reckon'd
the fourth from <hi>Arcesilaus,</hi> (who constituted the <hi>middle Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy,</hi>
introducing a suspension of Assent, grounded upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of things:) <hi>Carneades,</hi> constituted the <hi>new Academy,</hi>
maintaining the same kind of suspension, with no lesse eagerness;
yet upon more moderate grounds:<note n="*" place="margin">Numen. apud. Euseb.</note> for he held that the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibility
of things, proceeded not from the nature of the things
themselves, as <hi>Arcesilaus</hi> maintained; for as much as every thing
really existeth in it self, and if any thing be affirmed or denied of
another, it is true or false, as to the thing it self; but the things
themselves remaining firm, we derive from them a Phantasia and
similitude, which for the most part like false messengers lie and
deceive us. To all true things there some false adjoined, and
those so like, that, there is no certain note of Judication and assent,
wherefore we cannot perceive any thing to be true.</p>
                     <p>But he was nothing lesse rigid as to the Academicall suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
for<note n="*" place="margin">Cic. Acad. quaest. 4.</note> he denied that any thing could be perceived, not so
much as that very maxime; <hi>Nothing can be perceived,</hi> arguing
thus. All Phantasmes are of two kinds; the first included the
perceptible, and imperceptible; the second kind, the probable;
and the improbable. Those which are contrary to sense and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51150:247"/>
pertain to the former division; against the latter we ought
not to say any thing. Wherefore there is no Phantasie fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by perception, but by approbation many; for it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to nature that nothing should be probable.</p>
                     <p>More fully<note n="*" place="margin">Adv. Mathem.</note> 
                        <hi>Sextus Empericus. Carneades,</hi> saith he, did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oppose the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> but all that went before him, as to <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
His first and common argument against all, is, that, by
which he showeth absolutely, that there is nothing from which
truth can be judged; not <hi>reason,</hi> not <hi>sense,</hi> not <hi>phantasy,</hi> nor any
things, for all these in a word deceive us. His second argument
is that whereby he shewes, that although there be something
that doth judge, yet it cannot exist without an affection from
evidence. For an animall differeth from inanimate things by the
sensitive faculty, it apprehendeth thereby both it selfe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
things; but sense remaining immovable, impassible, and
immutable, is not sense, nor apprehendeth any thing, but being
changed, and after some manner affected by incursion of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
then it declareth things. In that affection therefore of the
soul which ariseth from evidence, we are to seek that which
judgeth. This affection is declared when that appeareth from
which it proceedeth, which affection is nothing else but phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasy.
<hi>Phantasy</hi> therefore is a certain affection in an animall,
which sheweth both it selfe and some others, as when we see
any thing, our sight is affected in some manner, so, as it was not
before that act of seeing. By this alteration we apprehend two
things: First, the alteration it selfe, that is the phantasy. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that from which this alteration proceeds, the things visible.
The like in the rest of the senses. As therefore light manifesteth
it selfe and all things in it, so phantasy being the chiefe guide
of knowledge in an animall, must like unto Light, manifest both
it selfe, and that evident object which effecteth it. But because
it doth not alwaies shew that which is true, but often erreth and
differeth from the thing whence it proceedeth, like ill messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
it necessarily followeth that all phantasies cannot leave a
judgment of truth, but only if it be true. Again, because there
is no phantasie so true, but it may be false; and of all phantasies
that seem true there are some false, which differ little from
them, that which judgeth must consist in common phantasy of
true and false. But the common phantasy of these comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not, and if it comprehendeth not, neither is there any thing
that judgeth. And if phantasy have not a judicative power,
neither can reason judge, for that is derived from phantasy, and
justly: For, that whereof it judgeth, ought first to appear unto
it; but nothing can appear but through sense void of reason;
therefore neither sense void of reason; nor reason it selfe is that
which judgeth.</p>

                        <pb n="148" facs="tcp:51150:248"/>
Thus disputed <hi>Carneades</hi> against all other Philosophers, to
shew there is not any thing that judgeth. But, being demanded
what judgeth, as to the leading of life and acquisition of beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
he hath recourse to <hi>probable</hi> phantasy; and together with
probable, <hi>undistracted</hi> and <hi>circumcurrent,</hi> their differences these.
Phantasy is the phantasy of somthing, <hi>viz.</hi> of that <hi>of</hi> which it is
made, and of that <hi>in</hi> which it is made: That of which it is made
is the externall sensible <hi>object;</hi> that in which, the <hi>Man.</hi> It hath
two relations, one to the object phancyed, the other to the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasm
derived from that object. From the relation to the object
it is either true or false; true, when it agreeth with the object;
false, when it disagreeth: From its relation to the phantasme,
there is one which seemeth true, another false. That which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
true is by the <hi>Academicks</hi> called <hi>Emphasis,</hi> and <hi>probability,</hi>
and <hi>probable phantasie;</hi> that which seemeth not true is called
<hi>Apemphasis, improbability,</hi> and <hi>not-p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>obable</hi> phantasy. For, neither
that which seemeth false, and is such; nor that which is true,
and seemeth not such, have any thing in their nature perswasive.
But, of these phantasies, that which is manifestly false, and
seemeth not true, limiteth the judicatory, but is not that which
judgeth, as likewise produceth from that which is, but differs
from it, such as was that of the fury proceeding from <hi>Electra</hi> to
<hi>Orestes.</hi> Of that which seemeth true, one kinde is <hi>tenuious,</hi> as
that which is in a thing so little, as that it is not visible, either
because it takes not up room enough, or by reason of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of sight, which receiveth things confusedly, and not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly.
The other is that which hath this common property
with the true, that it seemeth to be very true. Now of these, the
tenuious, loose, remisse phantasy cannot be that which judgeth;
for that which cannot clearly manifest it selfe, nor the thing that
effected it, cannot attract us, nor invite assent; but that which
seemeth true and is manifest enough, that, according to <hi>Carneades,</hi>
is the judge of truth.</p>
                     <p>This being that which judgeth, it hath a great latitude, and
being extended into another species, hath a more probable and
vehemently effective phantasy. Probable is taken three waies;
first, for that which is true, and seemeth true; secondly, for
that which is false, and seemeth true; thirdly, for that which is
true, common to both. Whence that which judgeth must be that
phantasy which seemeth true, which the Academicks call pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.
Sometimes the false incurreth; so that it is necessary to
use the common phantasy of true and false; yet, not because that
more seldome incurreth, I mean that which imitateth the truth,
we are not to give credit to that which is for the greater part
true, whereby it happeneth our judgment and actions are for the
most part directed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:51150:248"/>
That which first and commonly judgeth, <hi>Carneades</hi> held to be
this. But forasmuch as phantasy sometimes is not of one kinde,
but like a chain, one dependeth on another, there must therefore
be a second judge, which is <hi>probable</hi> and <hi>undistracted</hi> phantasy. As
he who receiveth the phantasy of a man, necessarily receiveth
the phantasy of such things as are about him, and without him;
of the things about him, as colour, magnitude, figure, motion,
speech, cloathing, shooes; of things without him, as aire, light,
day, heaven, earth, companions, and the like. When therefore
none of these phantasies seems false, but all agree in seeming
true, we credit it the more. That such a one is <hi>Socrates</hi> we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
because he hath all those things which <hi>Socrates</hi> useth to
have, as colour, magnitude, figure, gesture, cloak, in none of
these disagreeing with it self. And as some Physitians argue a
man to be in a feaver, not from one symptome, as from a high
pulse, or great heat, but from the concurrence of that heat with
the pulse, as also from ulcerous touch, rednesse, thirst, and the
like, all agreeing together. So the <hi>Academick</hi> maketh a judgment
of truth, from a concurrence of phantasies, and when none of
all the phantasies that joyne in the concurrence retract him as
false, he saith, that which incurreth is true.</p>
                     <p>That there is a credible <hi>undistracted</hi> concurrence, is manifest
from <hi>Menelaus:</hi> Having left in his ship an image of <hi>Helene</hi> which
he had brought from <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>roy,</hi> as if it had been <hi>Helene</hi> her selfe, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
at the Island <hi>Pharos,</hi> he there met with the true <hi>Helene,</hi> and
from her attracted a true phantasy, but would not believe that
phantasy, being distracted by the other, which told him, that he
had left <hi>Helene</hi> in the Ship. Such is undistracted phantasy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
which likewise seemeth erroneous, for as much as there
are some more undistracted then others. Of <hi>undistracted</hi> phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
that is most credible and perfect which maketh a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, there is a <hi>circumcurrent</hi> phantasy, the form where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is next to be declared. In the <hi>undistracted</hi> we only enquire
whether none of those phantasies which joyne in concurrence,
attract us as false, but that they all seem true, and not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.
But in that which is made by concurse, which useth <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcurrence,</hi>
strictly examines every phantasy which is in that
concurrence, as in Assemblies, when the people take account
of every particular person that stands for the Magistracy, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they deserve that power and right of judging. In the place
of Judgment, there is that which judgeth, and that by which
the judgment is made, the distance and intervall, figure, time,
manner, affection, and operation, each of which we examine
strictly. That which judgeth, whether the sight be dimme,
for if it be, it is too weak for judgment; that which is judged,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51150:249"/>
whether it be not too little; that through which, whether the
air be obscure; the distance, whether it too great; the medium,
whether confused; the place, whether too wide and vast; the
time, whether too suddain; the affection, whether not phrene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick;
the operation, whether not unfit to be admitted. For if all
these be in one, that which judgeth is <hi>probable</hi> phantasy, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<hi>probable, undistracted,</hi> and <hi>circumcurrent.</hi> Wherefore as
when in life we enquire concerning some little thing, we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
one witnesse; when we enquire into somthing of greater
consequence, we examine more; but when of a thing most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
we examine each of the witnesses by the joynt testimony
of all. So saith <hi>Carneades,</hi> in light, inconsiderable matters, we
make use of <hi>probable</hi> phantasy, only for judgment; in things of
some moment, of <hi>undistracted</hi> phantasy; in things that concern
well and happy living, <hi>circumcurrent</hi> phantasy.</p>
                     <p>And as in things of great moment they take diverse phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
so in different circumstances they never follow the same;
for they say, they attend only probable phantasy in such things
wherein the circumstance of time alloweth not a strict exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
As for instance. The enemy pursues a man; he comming
to a Cave, takes a phantasy, that there are some enemies there
lying in wait: transported by this phantasy as probable, he
shunneth and flyeth from the Cave, following the probability of
that phantasy, before he accuratly and diligently examine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there really be any enemies in ambush in that Cave or no.
<hi>Probable</hi> phantasy is followed by <hi>circumcurrent,</hi> in those things
in which time allowes a curious examination of each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
to use judgment upon the incurrent thing. As a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into a dark room, and seeing a rope rolled up, thinking it to
be a serpent, he flies away; but afterwards returning, he exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
the truth, and perceiving it not to stir, begins to think
it is not a serpent; but withall considering, that serpents are
somtimes frozen or nummed with the cold, he strikes it with
his staffe: and having thus by <hi>circumcurrence</hi> examined the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasy
which incurred to him, he assenteth, that the phantasy he
had taken of that body as a serpent is false. And again, as I said,
when we manifestly behold, we assent that this is true, having
first over-run in our thoughts that our senses are all entire, and
that we behold this waking, not in a dream; that the air is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous,
and a convenient distance from the object. Hereby we
receive a creditable phantasy, when we have time enough to
examine the particulars concerning the thing seen. It is the
same in <hi>undistracted</hi> phantasy, which they admit, when there is
nothing that can retract us, as we said of <hi>Menelaus.</hi> Hitherto

<hi>Oropus</hi> a City of <hi>Baeotia,</hi> sent three Philosophers on an Embassie
to the Romane Senate, to procure a mitigation of this fine, which
had been imposed upon them without hearing their defence;
<hi>Carneades</hi> the <hi>Academick, Diogenes</hi> the <hi>Stoick,</hi> and <hi>Critolaus</hi> the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatetick.</hi>
About the time of this Embassy there is much disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
amongst Authors. <hi>Agellius</hi> saith, they came after the second
<hi>Punick</hi> War, and maketh <hi>Ennius</hi> later then their coming; which
<hi>Petavius</hi> justly conceiveth to be false, for as much as <hi>Enni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
died in the 585<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year from the building of the City. But <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
affirmeth this Embassy to have been when <hi>P. Scipio</hi> and <hi>M.
Marcellus</hi> were Consuls, which was the 599<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year. <hi>Pausanias</hi>
reckoneth it upon the 603<hi rend="sup">d</hi> year of the City, which <hi>Casaubone</hi>
approveth.</p>
                     <p>Each of these Philosophers, to shew his learning, made choice
of severall eminent parts of the City, where they discoursed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
great multitudes of people to the admiration of all. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence
of <hi>Carneades</hi> was violent and rapid; that of <hi>Critolaus,</hi>
neat and smooth, that of <hi>Diogenes</hi> modest and sober. <hi>Carneades</hi> one
day disputed copiously concerning justice before <hi>Galba</hi> and <hi>Cato,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lactant. de Inst. lib. 51<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note>
the greatest Orators of that time. The next day he subverted all
he had said before by contrary Arguments, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d took away that
Justice which he had so much commended. This he did the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51150:250"/>
to confute those, that asserted any thing. That dispute where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he overthrew Justice is recorded in <hi>Cicero</hi> by <hi>L. Furius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To these three Philosophers resorted all the studious young
men,<note place="margin">Plut.</note> and frequently heard and praised them. chiefly the
sweetnesse of <hi>Carneades,</hi> which was of greatest power and no lesse
fame then power, attracting eminent and benigne hearers, filled
the City with noise like a great wind; and it was reported that a
<hi>Grecian</hi> person qualified to admiration, attracting all, had infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a serious affection into the young men, whereby forgetting
other divertisements and pleasures, they were carried on as it
were with a kind of madnesse to Philosophy. This pleased all
the <hi>Romans,</hi> who gladly beheld their Sonns instructed in Greek
learning by such excellent men. Onely <hi>Cato</hi> at the first noise of
Admiration of the Greek Learning, was troubled, fearing the
young men should apply themselves that way, and so preferre
the glory of eloquence before Action and Military discipline.
The fame of Philosophers encreasing in the City, and <hi>C. Acilius,</hi>
(whom <hi>Agellius</hi> and <hi>Macrobius</hi> call <hi>Caecilius</hi>) an eminent person,
having at his own request been the Interpreter of their first Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Senate; <hi>Cato</hi> (who was then very old) under a fair
pretence, moved, that these Philosophers might be sent out of
the City, and coming into the Senate-house, blamed the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
that they had so long suffered such Ambassadors to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
amongst them without any answer, who were able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them to any thing: wherefore he first desired that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
might be determined concerning their Embassie, that they
might be sent back again to their own Schools, and instruct the
Sons of <hi>Graecians,</hi> and that the <hi>Romane</hi> youth might, as they did
before, apply themselves to the observance of their own Laws
and Magistrates. This he did not out of anger to <hi>Carneades,</hi> as some
thought, but out of an ambitious aemulation of the <hi>Greek</hi> huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Literature.</p>

probability, and according as he finds it or not, answers yes or
no. He who withholdeth his assent from all things, is yet moved,

his excellent discourse, and loved him for the sweetnesse of

acknowledgeth himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Amongst other excellent things (saith<note n="f" place="margin">Eclog. Ethic.</note> 
                     <hi>Stobaeus</hi>) he gave this
Division of <hi>Philosophy.</hi> He compared <hi>Philosophy</hi> to a <hi>Physician:</hi>
As the office of a Physician is first to perswade the sick person
to permit himselfe to be cured; next to confute the reasons of
his adversary: So is it of a Philosopher, both which consist in
exhortation. Exhortation is a discourse inciting to vertue;
whereof one part explaineth its great use, the other refelleth
adversaries, or such as any way calumniate Philosophy. The
comparison holds in a second manner, thus: As the part of a
Physitian, after he hath perswaded the Patient to admit of cure,
is, to apply the means thereof, as well to remove the causes of
the disease, as to induce and settle health; so is it in this Science.
After exhortation, he endeavoureth to apply the cure, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
false opinions wherewith the soul is infected, and by
substituting true. In the second place therefore it treats of good
and evill, for the sake of which the exhortation was made.
Thirdly, the comparison holds thus: As all Medicines refer to
one end, health; so all Philosophy to Beatitude. That part
which treats of ends is joyned with another which treats of
life. For as in Medicine, it is not sufficient to restore health,
unlesse it likewise deliver rules by which it may be preserved;
so in life, some precepts are required for conservation of the
end: And this part also is twofold; private, or common: One
considers the affairs of particular persons, as, whether a wise
man should mannage a Common-wealth, whether he may
live with Princes, whether he may marry: The other considers
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51150:253"/>
the businesse of all in generall; as, what Commonwealth is
best, how Magistrates are to be chosen. This common part is
called <hi>Politick,</hi> and is treated of distinctly by it selfe, as being
of greatest latitude. Now is fall were wise men, there would
be no need of more places, for the more subtle divisions would
emerge from the precedent. But because there must likewise
be a care of the middle sort of men, who cannot apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to long disputations, either through want of time, or
diversion of businesse, there must not be omitted a treating of
precepts, which delivereth short rules concerning the use of
each.</p>

                     <hi>comprehensive phantasy,</hi> he held all
things to be incomprehensible; as to the nature of the things
themselves, comprehensible. Thus he took away the <hi>comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive

                  </p>
                  <p>He held that to be a good connex;<note place="margin">Sex. Emp. Pyrrh. Hyp. 2. 11.</note> which beginneth from
true and endeth in false, as (if it be day, and I dispute) this,
<hi>If it is day, I dispute:</hi> According to which tenet there may be true
axioms three waies, a false only one way: For, when it begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
from true, and endeth in true, it is true; as, <hi>If it is day, it is
light:</hi> And when it beginneth from false, and endeth in false, it
is true; as, <hi>If the earth flies, the earth hath wings.</hi> Likewise if it
beginneth from false and endeth in true, it is true; as, <hi>If the
earth flies, it is earth.</hi> That which is false, is that which beginneth
from true, and endeth in false; as, <hi>If it is day, it is night;</hi> for, the
antecedent, <hi>it is day,</hi> is true; but the consequent, <hi>it is night,</hi> is

the Athenians to <hi>Ceres</hi> at <hi>Eleusis.</hi> This <hi>Laertius</hi> relates as done

recommends severall persons to him.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is manifest, that the Author of his life is mistaken,
when he affirmes, that in <hi>Alexanders Asiatick expedition,</hi> Aristotle
accompanyed <hi>him to the Brachmanes, where he writ that noble piece

so are there some other errours, which no lesse manifestly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

that the youths had confessed, the plot proceeded only from
themselves, not by the instigation of any other.<note n="o" place="margin">Plut. vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </note> Yet afterwards,
in an Epistle to <hi>Antipater,</hi> he imputes the same crime to <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes,</hi>
not without this sharp reflection upon <hi>Aristotle: The
youths,</hi> saith he, <hi>were stoned to death by the Macedonians; but, as for
the Sophist, I will punish him my selfe, and those who sent him, and
those who entertain in their Cities such as are Traitors to me.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they interpret the bounty of <hi>Alexander</hi> to <hi>Xenocrates,</hi> and
favour to <hi>Anaximenes,</hi> as not proceeding from the magnificence
of his disposition,<note n="p" place="margin">Laert.</note> but from the displeasure he had conceived
against <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whom he endeavoured to vex, by obliging his

                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:51150:264"/>
Upon this supposed displeasure was grounded another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
that<note n="q" place="margin">Plut. Alex:</note> 
                        <hi>Aristotle</hi> conspiring with <hi>Cassander</hi> against <hi>Alexander,</hi>
sent him, by <hi>Antipater,</hi> some of the water of <hi>Styx,</hi> wherewith he
poisoned <hi>Alexander.</hi> But the Relators hereof differ not a little
amongst themselves: <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> and <hi>Suidas</hi> affirme, that
<hi>Alexander</hi> was poisoned by <hi>Cassander</hi> son of <hi>Antipater; Arianus</hi>
by <hi>Iolla</hi> his younger son: <hi>Porphyrius</hi> saith, that nothing but the
horn of an Asse, such as the Asses of <hi>Scythia</hi> had, would contain
the poyson: <hi>Iustine</hi> and <hi>Pausanias,</hi> the hoofe of a Horse; <hi>Pliny</hi>
and <hi>Arrian</hi> of a Mule; <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Zonaras,</hi> of an Asse. They
differ no lesse about the place whence the water was fetch'd.
Neither indeed can it be expected there should be a better har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

he was bred up an Orphan, by <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> afterwards died young
in the Warrs, which relation agrees not with <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Will, nor

of <hi>Erastratus.</hi> By him she had a son named, after her Father,
<hi>Aristotle.</hi> Of this <hi>Aristotle</hi> there is mention in the Will of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastus,</hi>
where he is called the Son of <hi>Midias,</hi> not <hi>Metrodorus.

                     <p>As for the accusation of <hi>Demochares</hi> against Philosophers, it is
not worth the mention; for he asperseth not only <hi>Aristotle,</hi> but
all the rest; and whosoever looks upon his calumnies, will say
they are triviall; for he affirmes, that some Letters of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s,
against the Citty of <hi>Athens</hi> were intercepted and discovered;
that he betrayed his own <hi>Country Stagira</hi> to the Macedonians;
that when <hi>Olynthus</hi> was taken, he informed <hi>Philip</hi> upon the sale

that using to bath himselfe in warme oyle, he afterwards sold
it; and that when he went to <hi>Chalcis,</hi> those who bought his
goods, found in one bark 75 brasse pots. Indeed neer so many
were the first calumniators of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> from whom sprung up
others, some in the same age, others little after, all Sophists,
Litigious persons, and Orators; of whose names and bookes no
more remains then of their bodies.</p>
                     <p>As for those who flourished after these, some repeat only
what these had said before, and therefore we need not take any
notice of them; much lesse of those, who not lighting upon those
books, have fram'd some inventions of their own, such as they,
who affirm, he had 300 pots, for there was not any Author of
that time who made mention thereof, but <hi>Lyco,</hi> and he saith,
there were found only 75 pots.</p>
                     <p>And not only from computation of time, and from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who assert these calumnies, may any man perceive all
they say to be but false, but also from this, that not any two of
them lay the same thing to his charge, but every one hath a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
calumny different from the rest. But, if any one of these
had been true, <hi>Aristotle</hi> should have heard of it, not only once
from them, but a thousand times.</p>
                     <p>It is manifest therefore, the same thing befell <hi>Aristotle</hi> which
happened to many others, that as well for the respect and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
he had with Princes, as for the excellency of his Disserta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the envy of the Sophists of that age persecuted him. But

                     <p>MOst Philosophers assert beneficence to be somthing equall
to God. To speak the truth, the whole life of Mankind
is comprised in conferring and returning Benefits, So as, some
bestow, others receive, others return. Hence is it just to commise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
all that are in adversity, for pitty is the signe of a mild Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
sternness of a rude, it being dishonest &amp; impious to neglect vertue
in misfortunes. For this I commend our disciple <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> who
saith, we never repent of doing good, it brings forth good fruit
the prayers and praises of the obliged. Wise men therefore must
study to oblige many, thinking that, beside the praise, there may
some advantage accrew from hence in the change of Affaires,
and if not all, at least some one of those to whom he hath done
good, may be in a capacity to requite him. For this reason, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to be ready in doing good, but give not way to your
passions, for that is kingly and civill, this barbarous and odious.
As you see occasion, practise and neglect not this usefull advise.</p>

try'd in bad fortune then in good. The sight of benevolent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
is like to that of Land to men in a storme. All Fortune apt
to desert us, is the true scope which they propose to themselves
who war, on do unjustly, or comply dishonestly, only the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Vertuous persons is not unacquainted with the instability
of Fortune, but, by reason, sustaining all accidents, and being,
as <hi>Plato</hi> saith, above them, they are never disordered. Take heed
therefore of the rapid motion of things; look upon them as a
Circle which reverts into it self; cast up the accounts of life, for
chance imposeth many things upon life, and maketh our inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
follow it. Pardon those that offend ignorantly; be ready to
acquite those that do good. This if you perform not once, but
continually, your Court will be secure from all danger. This, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the greatnesse of the things, I have said is but little, but,
considering the person to whom I write, All.</p>

demonstration. <hi>Induction</hi> is made of singulars perceived by sense.
<hi>Demonstration</hi> is of universals, which are declared by induction;
wherefore the beginning of Science is from singulars, which are
sensibles. Hence it is impossible for a man born blinde to have the
Science of colours. Yet no science is next and immediately from
sense, for sense is of singulars, which are here and now; but sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and demonstration is of universals, which are every where
and ever, not subject to sense. Yet, sense conduceth to science
and demonstration, for as much as an universall is collected from
particulars, known by sense.</p>

                        </gap>, which signifies sometimes necessarily

                        <hi>Sophisms out of the word</hi> are seven. 1. <hi>From accident,</hi> when that
which is demanded is equally competent to the thing, and to the
accident; for whereas many things are competent to the same,
it is not necessary that they be all in the subject and praedicate,
as, <hi>if Coriscus differs from a man, he differs from himself, for he is a
man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. <hi>From that which is simply,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, when that which is said in

which is not, is.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. <hi>From ignorance of the Elench,</hi> when not understanding the true
Nature of a contradiction, they think that to be an absolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
which is none, omitting either the same respect in the
thing, or the same respect of the same thing; or the simplicity, or
the time. To this all Sophismes may bee reduced.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Of the consequent;</hi> when we allow those to be true reciprocall
consequences which are not such, as, <hi>it is yellow, therefore it is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and the contrary, it is not yellow, therefore it is not honey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Of petition of the principle,</hi> neither by requiring that to bee
granted, which was to be proved, or proving the same by the
same, the termes only changed; as <hi>the Soul is immortall because it is
not subject to death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. <hi>Of a not-cause as a Cause,</hi> as when that is taken to be the
cause of the thing or conclusion, which is cause of neither; as <hi>Arms
disturb peace, therefore they are to be taken away.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. <hi>Of Plurality of Interrogations as one,</hi> when many things are
asked in one; as <hi>Iustice and Impiety, are they Vertues or not?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hitherto of Elenchs; the four other Ends whereto a Sophist
endeavours to reduce his adversary, are, <hi>Falsitie, Paradox, Soloecism,</hi>
and <hi>Tautologie.</hi>
                     </p>

alteration, quality, lation, place, augmentation and
diminution, quantity. Again, in the manner, that which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated,
or corrupted, or altered, not necessarily changeth place,
but that which augments or diminisheth, in some manner chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
place, for it is bigger or lesser.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Augmentation</hi> is an addition to praeexistent quantity; <hi>diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
a detraction. Whatsoever is augmented or decreased, is
augmented or decreased according to every part thereof, by
reception of something throughout all parts; decretion on the
contrary. The animate body encreaseth, but not the aliment,
for the living creature remaineth, the aliment is converted into
the substance of the living creature. Hereupon that which is
augmented is like unto that which is altered, for both of these
remain. All parts of a living creature are augmented; the similar
first, as bones and flesh; then the dissimilar, as consisting of the
others.</p>
                     <p>Augmentation is made by accession of something according to
form, not according to matter; for by it the whole is augmented,
and made more such. Accession of parts, according to matter, is
not augmentation, for by materialls only (destitute of that form,
which the parts to be augmented have) the whole living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
cannot encrease. Aliment therefore, whereby the living
creature is augmented, must be the same potentially which the
things augmented is in act. At first, it is contrary, and dissimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
being in power the part of a living creature, in act some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else: at last it becommeth assimilate to the living creature,
taking the form of a part (by aggeneration) through the dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stive
power of the animate body, which changeth the aliment
into its own substance.</p>
                     <p>For this reason augmentation presupposeth nutrition. <hi>Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is, when the aliment as substance is converted into the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the living creature. Augmentation, when the same ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as quantitative, is added to the quantity of the living
creature. Hence a living creature as long as it is sound is alwaies
nourished, but not alwaies augmented. As that which is added
is potentially quantitative flesh, so it can augment flesh; as it is
potentially flesh only, so it nourisheth; which when it can only
do (as when so much wine is poured into water that it turnes all
into water) then there is a diminution of the quantity, but the
form remaineth.</p>

sensible bodies, as such, are constituted and differ. Of tactile qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
there are seven orders, hot, cold, moist, dry, heavy, light,
hard, soft, viscous, arid, rugged, smooth, thick, thin. From the
two first orders, are derived the differences of Elements, for by
heat and cold, humidity and siccity they act and suffer, and are
mutually changed by alterative passions. Of these first qualities
two are active, heat and cold, two passive, humidity and siccity.
Heat is that which congregates homogeneous things; cold that
which congregates heterogeneous things; humid that which is
not easily contained in its own bounds, dry the contrary.</p>

of the primary qualities, from each of which the Elements are
severally collected. The first conjunction is of hot and dry,
whence proceedeth fire; the second of hot and moist, whence
Air; the third of moist and cold, whence Water; the fourth of
cold and dry, whence Earth. In each of these one quality is prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant;
Earth is more dry then cold, water more cold then

It is done principally by heat, accidentally by cold. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mectation
(its contrary) is the concretion of a vapour into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or liquefaction of a solid body, as Metall. <hi>Concretion</hi> is, when
the humidity being removed, the dry is reduced together and
condensed, either by cold, as in generation of stones, or by heat,
as in segregation of salt from water. To concretion is opposite,
resolution, which is effected by its contraries. Those things
which are condensed by heat only, are resolved by cold only, and
so on the contrary.</p>

Nutrition is the operation of the Nutritive faculty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
to the substance it self of the animate being. Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is the operation of the Nutritive faculty, whereby the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate
body encreaseth to perfect Magnitude. In nutrition are
considered, the Soul nourishing, the body nourished, and the
food by which the nourishment is made; hereto is required a
Naturall heat, which is in all living creatures. The aliment is
both contrary, or unlike, and like, to the body nourished: as it is
undigested, we say nourishment is by the contrary; as altered by
digestion, like is nourished by its like.</p>

primarily in Animals. Sense is a mutation in the Organ
caused by some sensible Object. It is not sensible of it self, nor
of its Organ, not of any interiour thing. To reduce it to act, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
some externall sensible object, for sense cannot move it
self being a passive power, as that which is combustible cannot
burn it self.</p>

                        <note n="b" place="margin">Cap. 6.</note> Of sensible Objects there are three kinds; <hi>proper,</hi> which is
perceived by one sense, without errour, as colour in respect of
sight. <hi>Common;</hi> which is not proper to any one, but percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by all. <hi>Accidentall;</hi> which, as such, doth not affect the
sense.</p>
                     <p>Sense is either <hi>Externall</hi> or <hi>Internall,</hi> the externall are five,
<hi>Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Touching, Tasting.</hi>

                        <note n="c" place="margin">Cap. 7.</note> The object of <hi>Seeing</hi> is Colour, and some thing without a
name that glisters in the dark, as the scales of fish, glow-worms
and the like. Colour is the motive of that which is actually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous;
nothing therefore is visible, without light. Perspicuous
is that which is visible, not by it self, but by some other colour
or light, as Air, Water, Glasse. Light is the act of a perspicuous
thing, as it is perspicuous. It is not fire, not a body,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51150:291"/>
for then two bodies would be in the same place.</p>
                     <p>To sight and all other senses is requisite a <hi>medium</hi> and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
distance. The object first affects the <hi>medium,</hi> then the organ.</p>

                        <note n="d" place="margin">Cap. 8.</note> The object of <hi>hearing</hi> is sound. Sound is made by collision of
two bodies, hard, smooth, and hollow, in a <hi>medium,</hi> as air or
water, swiftly and vehemently before the medium be dissipated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Echo</hi> is a reflex sound, when the air, gathered together and
forced into a vessell, or some place which hindereth its diffusion
and progresse, reverts as a base against a wall. Sound is alwaies
reflected, though not alwaies perceptibly, as light also, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
all places would be dark, which were not directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the Sun, or some lucid body.</p>
                     <p>Sound is made by that which moveth the air; and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
stirreth it, till it arive at the organ, wherein there is an insite,
connaturall, animate, immovable air, which being moved by
the externall air, yeeldeth the sense of hearing. Hence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that we can hear under water, for the water cannot get
into this air, because of the winding narrow passages of the ear:
If it do get in, or the membrance which containeth this air be
otherwise broken, it causeth deafnesse.</p>
                     <p>Voice is the impulsion of air attracted by respiration, and
forced against the vocall artery by the soul, which is in the
lungs, with some intent of signification. Voice therefore is not
proper to all animals, but to such only as have blood and breath.
Fishes therefore have not voice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Cap. 9.</note> The object of <hi>smelling</hi> is Odor. This sense is not so perfect in
men as in other creatures, whence men perceive not odors, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
with delight or dislike, when they are so strong, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
one of these. This defect proceedeth from the organ of smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
which in us is more obtuse. The <hi>medium</hi> of smelling is air
and water, for fishes smell. Hence all living creatures smell not
after the same manner; they which breath smell by drawing in
the air, the rest not so, because of the different accommodation
of the Organ. Those therefore which smell by drawing in the
air, cannot smell under water. <hi>Odor</hi> consists chiefly in dry, as
<hi>sapor</hi> in humid. The organ of smelling is dry potentially, as the
object is actually.</p>

                        <note n="f" place="margin">Cap. 10.</note> The object of <hi>Tast</hi> is sapor. Whatsoever is gustable is tacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and humid, either actually, or at least potentially. Dry
things are subject to tast as they are potentially humid, and melt
as salt. The tast perceiveth that which is gustable, and that
which is ingustable, as the sight darknesse, the hearing silence;
for every sence perceiveth the presence and absence of its object.
That which is potable is perceived by the touch, as humid by
the tast, as having sapor. The tongue tasts not that which is dry,
because the organ of tast must be such potentially, as the object
is actually; but, without humidity nothing is gustable. The
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51150:292"/>
kinds of sapors are sweet and bitter; to sweet are referred
unctious, to bitter salt. The mean are sharp, piccant, acid,
acute; gustable is that which moveth the tast, and reduceth it to
act.</p>

object, as sight judgeth of black and white; but the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of divers objects cannot be perceived by the same sense;
there is therefore a <hi>common sense,</hi> which judgeth the actions of
externall sense, and the differences of all sensible objects. The
judgment being of a sensible object, must be done by sense, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51150:292"/>
by one sense only; for, if there were more, one would object
one object apart, the other another, and consequently could not
judge between them. For, that which judgeth must have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

can afford, as being consined to its proper object.</p>

                     <p>The act of <hi>Phantasy</hi> differs from <hi>Cogitation,</hi> for we phansy
things false and at our own pleasure; but, we think only what is
true, and like unto truth, and that not as we please our selves,
but as the thing seemeth. Moreover, when we think that things
are ill or good, we are moved with fear, joy, hope; but when
we phansy only without application of judgment, we are not
moved no more then we are frighted at a picture.</p>
                     <p>Phantasy is not properly <hi>Sense,</hi> phantasy acteth in him that
sleepeth, sense doth not. Sense was with us from our birth,
phantasy not. Sense is in all animals, phantasy is not. Sense is

only which have sense of time, remember, as horses and dogs; yet
memory is not without phantasm, even not that memory which
is of Intelligible things, for he that remembreth, is sensible that
he first saw, heard, or learn'd what he remembreth. Memory
therefore is reducible <hi>per se</hi> to phantasie, as being of Phantasmes,
to intellect only by accident. Hence in the same part of the Soul,
wherein Phantasie exists, resideth likewise memory; for if it were
placed only in the intellectual faculty, it would not be competent
to Beasts, which we see it is.</p>
                     <p>Memory is made by impression of some image by the sense upon
the Soul. Hence they who retain not the image and figure of sense,

which first maketh the head heavy by consistence there, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
and repells the heat, whereby is induced sleep. That sleep
is made in this manner, is evident from all soporiferous things,
as poppy, which causeth heaviness in the head by sending up
vapours. Labour produceth sleep, by dispersing the humours,
whence produceth vapour. Drunken men &amp; Children are subject
to sleep much, melancholy persons little, for they are so cold
within, that the vapour exhaleth not, especially they being of a

proceeds from imagination and apprehension, which plants have
not, neither have they organs fit for motion, which nature
would have given them if they had this power. That it is not the

Intellect</hi> (under which is comprehended phantasy) and <hi>appetite.</hi>
These two direct and impell the motive faculty to action; intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
and phantasy by directing what is to be shunned, what to
be embraced, appetite by shunning or embracing it. Appetite is
the chief principle thereof, for that may move without intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
as in beasts, and many times in men, who desert their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to follow their pleasure: But intellect never moveth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
appetite, that is, will; for appetite is the principle of all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
honest and dishonest, intellect only of honest motion.</p>
                     <p>In man, appetite is two-fold; <hi>Will,</hi> which followeth the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of reason; and <hi>sensuall appetite,</hi> irascible or concupiscible,
which followeth sense and phantasy.</p>
                     <p>In the motion of animals, three things are considered: First,
that which moveth, and that is two-fold; the <hi>appetible</hi> object,
which moveth the appetite as a finall cause, not as an efficient;
and the appetite it selfe, which being moved by the appetible
object, moveth the animall. Secondly, by what it moves, which
is the heart of the animal, by which instrument the appetible
object moveth it. Thirdly, that which is moved, the animall it
selfe, perfect.</p>

                        <hi>Insects</hi> are moved locally, as <hi>perfect</hi> animals are, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
by the same principles, appetite and phantasy; but this
phantasy is imperfect, diffused through the whole body, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by their uncertain motion, only towards present oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current
objects. That they have appetite is manifest, in as much
as they are sensible of pain and pleasure.</p>
                     <p>Beasts have <hi>sensitive</hi> phantasie only; rationall creatures, <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berative,</hi>
which compareth many things conducing to some fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
end, and chooseth the most expedient. Yet somtimes
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51150:295"/>
the sensitive appetite in man overswayeth the rationall, but by
the order of nature, the will, which is the rationall, ought, as
being the superiour to it, to oversway the sensitive. Thus there
are three motions, one of the will commanding, another of the
sensitive appetite resisting, and a third of the body obeying. But
when the sensitive overruleth, there are only two motions, for
the will resists not, but is deceived.</p>

within it self, and as soon as that faileth, dieth. The principle of
this heat is in the heart. If it be extinguish'd in any other part, the
Animal may live, but if in the heart, it cannot.</p>
                     <p>This heat is extinguish'd two waies; first by <hi>consumption,</hi> when
it faileth of it self; secondly, by <hi>extinction,</hi> from some contrary, as

the humidity, which being gone, it self must of necessity go

                     <p>Refrigeration therefore is necessary to the conservation of the
naturall heat. Plants are refrigerated by the ambient air, and by
aliment: their naturall heat is extinguish'd by excessive cold, and

are to be perfected by Custom and right institution. Hence E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thick

man, for the rest acquire Custom, not by Reason, but Necessity,

                     <p>Of the <hi>Soul,</hi> one part is <hi>Rationall,</hi> the other <hi>Irrationall;</hi> the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall

that which is <hi>Theoretick,</hi> conversant in divine things, is called
<hi>Science;</hi> that which is <hi>Practick,</hi> conversant in humane Actions, is
called <hi>Counsell.</hi> Of the latter, one part is <hi>concupiscible,</hi> another
<hi>irascible.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In like manner <hi>Vertue</hi> is twofold, rationall and irrationall, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in Theory and practise. Ethick Vertue consisteth not in
Science, but in election of Goods.</p>
                     <p>Vertue is perfected by three things; <hi>Nature, Custom</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
For man differing from other Creatures both in body and
mind, as being a species placed between divine essences and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationall
Creatures, hath some affinity to both; in what is ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
and agrees with the Soul, he is ally'd to the Divinity; in
what is irrationall, proper to the body, he agrees with the irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall.
Both these desire perfection by Reason; and first, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth
to be, for this is naturally insite in him. Hence he affecteth
things that are according to his Nature, and is averse from things
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51150:296"/>
contrary to his nature. He endeavoureth to preserve <hi>health, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
life,</hi> these being according to nature, expetible in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and good. On the contrary, he shunneth <hi>sicknesse, pain,</hi>
and <hi>death,</hi> as being repugnant to nature, and therefore ill, and to
be avoided. We love our own bodies, we love our own soules,
their parts, their faculties, their acts: the principle of appetite,
office, and vertue is a providentiall care of these. If errour did
not happen concerning things expetible and avoidable, but that
we lived continually participant of good, and vold of ill, we
should not enquire in these for a true election. But being in
things expetible and avoidable, through ignorance often decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
sometimes rejecting the good, sometimes admitting the ill
for good, we necessarily have recourse to <hi>constancy of Iudgment,</hi>
which having obtain'd convenient to nature, we call it, from the
excellency of its function, <hi>Vertue,</hi> admiring and honouring it
above all things. For actions, and those which are called Offices,
proceed from election of things according to nature, and reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> repugnant to nature. Herein consist <hi>right actions</hi>
and <hi>sinnes;</hi> even on these dependeth almost the whole reason of
<hi>Election;</hi> as we shall briefly demonstrate.</p>
                     <p>That Children are <hi>expetible</hi> to parents, not only <hi>for use</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
but also <hi>in themselues,</hi> is most evident. There is no man so
cruell and savage, who doth not rather desire his children after
his death should live happily and well, then otherwise: By this
affection dying persons make Wills, providing even for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
choosing Tutors and Guardians to assist them. And as <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
are loved for themselves, so likewise we love <hi>Parents, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
Wife, Kindred, Acquaintance, Country-men,</hi> for themselves,
as having some interest in them by nature. For, man is a sociable
communicative creature; and though of Friendships, some are
more remote then others, it is nothing to the purpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e, for all
friendship is for its own sake, and not for use only. And if friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with Country-men be expetible in it selfe, it will likewise
be expetible in it selfe with all men; for all those who benefit
others, are so affected towards them, that they do most actions
for the office sake. Who will not free any man from a wilde
beast, if he be in his power? Who will not direct a man that is
out of his way? Who will not relieve a man that is ready to
starve, or direct a man in a desart to a spring? Who desires not
to be well spoken of after death? Who abhorrs not these spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
as unnaturall?</p>

                        <l>When I am dead, let earth be mix'd with fire,</l>

                     </q>
                     <p>It is manifest therefore, that we have a naturall goodwill
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51150:297"/>
and friendship towards all mankinde, as being a thing expetible
in it selfe, and consonant to reason.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>The race of Gods and Men is one,</l>
                        <l>From Nature both alike begun.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>Love of all mankinde being thus common to us, much more
evidently it is expetible in it selfe towards those, whom conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
hath made our friends. A Friend, Friendship, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
are expetible in themselves.</p>
                     <p>In like manner <hi>praise</hi> is expetible <hi>in it selfe;</hi> for we contract so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
with those who praise us: And if praise, <hi>glory</hi> likewise,
which is nothing but the praise of many persons.</p>
                     <p>Now seeing that <hi>externall</hi> Goods are expetible in themselves,
much more are the goods of the soul and body expetible in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
For, if man be expetible in himselfe, the parts of man
must likewise be expetible in himselves. The parts of man in
generall are <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body;</hi> the body therefore is expetible in it
selfe. Why should the body of another person be dear to us,
and not our own? Or, why should our body be dear to us, and
not the parts and functions thereof? <hi>Health</hi> therefore, <hi>strength,
beauty, swiftnesse, sound sense,</hi> and the rest, are expetible in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
for none of ordinary capacity would choose to be <hi>defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
or maimed, though no inconvenience would happen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon;
so that deformity, even without any inconvenience, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
justly avoidable. And if deformity be avoidable in it selfe,
beauty is expetible, not <hi>for use</hi> only, but in <hi>it selfe.</hi> For, that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
pleaseth, is manifest, in as much as all have a naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
(besides that of conversation) to such as are beautifull,
and endeavour to confer benefits on them, so as it seemeth to
procure benevolence. In this respect therefore, beauty is judged
expetible in it selfe, deformity avoidable in it selfe. It is the same
in <hi>health</hi> and <hi>sicknesse, strength</hi> and <hi>weaknesse, activity</hi> and <hi>heavinesse,
sense</hi> and <hi>privation</hi> of sense.</p>
                     <p>And if <hi>Corporeall</hi> goods are expetible in themselves, and their
contrary evills avoidable, the parts and vertues of the soul must
necessarily be expetible also. For, vertue, beginning, as we said,
from the body, and externall goods, and reflecting upon it selfe,
and considering how much more neer relation it hath to the
soul, contracteth a neerer affinity with it. So that the vertues of
the soul are much to be preferred before those of the body,
which is easily collected from what hath been said. For, if cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall
health be expetible in it selfe, much more is <hi>Temperance,</hi>
which freeth us from the fury of the passions. And if corporeall
<hi>strength</hi> ought to be numbered amongst goods, much more
ought <hi>magnanimity,</hi> by which the soul is strengthened. And if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
corporeall <hi>Beauty</hi> be expetible in it selfe, much more is that of
the soul, <hi>Iustice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:51150:297"/>
In like manner is it with the vertues. For, there are three
kinds of <hi>Goods,</hi> which though different, have some kinde of ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie.
That which in the body is called <hi>Health,</hi> in the soul is
called <hi>Temperance,</hi> and in externals, <hi>Riches.</hi> What in the body
is <hi>Strength,</hi> in the soul is <hi>Magnanimity,</hi> in externals, <hi>Power.</hi> What
in the body is <hi>Vigour</hi> of <hi>Sense,</hi> in the soul is <hi>Prudence,</hi> in externals,
<hi>Felicity.</hi> What in the body is <hi>Beauty,</hi> in the soul is <hi>Iustice,</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals,
<hi>Friendship.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are <hi>three</hi> kinds of Goods expetible in themselves, those
concerning the <hi>soule,</hi> those concerning the <hi>body,</hi> and the <hi>externall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
but, especially those of the soul, for the soul is more excellent
then the body.</p>
                     <p>Yet though corporeall and externall vertues be inferiour to
those of the soul, they are not to be neglected, partly, as being
expetible in themselves; partly, as conducing to civill, sociable,
and contemplative life, for life is defined by civill, sociable, and
contemplative actions; <hi>Vertue</hi> (according to this <hi>Sect</hi>) not being a
lover of it selfe, but communicative and civill. For when we
say, vertue is neerest ally'd to it selfe, the desire of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of truth necessarily followeth it, so as wise men may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
part with their life, and fools rightly preserve theirs; since
that to those who are perfect, it is an equall thing to depart this
life or not.</p>
                     <p>The excellency of vertue is much encreased by corporeall
and externall goods; yet, the end cannot any way be compleated
by them. The function therefore of vertue is <hi>Beatitude,</hi> by suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessefull
actions. Corporeall and externall goods are said to be
efficient of beatitude, for as much as they confer something
thereto, not that they compleat it, for Beatitude is life. Life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
of actions, but those can neither be reckoned amongst actions
nor functions.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon comes in <hi>Beneficence, grace, humanity, love of Children</hi>
and <hi>Brethren,</hi> of our <hi>Country, Parents, Benevolence,</hi> of <hi>Kinsfolk,
Friendship, Equality,</hi> and the whole company of Vertues; which
who neglect, manifestly sin, as to expetible goods, and avoidable
evills; and also in the acquisition and use of Goods, they sin in
election, by judgment; in acquisition, by the manners in use, by
ignorance. In election they sin, as desiring that which is not
good, or preferring the lesser good, as most prefer <hi>Pleasant</hi> before
<hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ofitable,</hi> profitable before <hi>Honest. In acquisition,</hi> as not conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
whence, nor in what manner, nor how far it ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired:
<hi>In use,</hi> for as much as all use being referred either to it
selfe or some other, in the former they observe no <hi>moderation,</hi> in
the latter no <hi>decency.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In these things, though the wicked sin, yet do the just behave
themselves uprightly, following vertue as their leader.</p>
                     <p>In all vertues, there is <hi>Iudgment, Election,</hi> and <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>tion;</hi> there is
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51150:298"/>
no Vertue without these; Prudence hath the first place, the rest
follow.</p>
                     <p>Vertue is called the <hi>best affection,</hi> which may be collected from
Induction. The Vertue of a shoemaker is that by which he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
how to make shoes, and of an Archit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ct, that by which he
knoweth how to build a handsom house. Vertue therefore is
the best of Affections.</p>
                     <p>Of Vertue there are two principles as it were, <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
which somtimes agree, somtimes disagree; for Pleasure or
grief, when Reason gets the Mastery, it is called <hi>Temperance;</hi>
when passion, <hi>Intemperance;</hi> The <hi>Harmony</hi> and Concord of both
is <hi>Vertue,</hi> one rightly commanding, the other obeying.</p>
                     <p>Expetible is that which attracteth the <hi>appetite</hi> to it self, avoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
that which repelleth it, reason consenting thereto. Expe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and good were by the Ancients esteemed the same, for they
affirmed Good to be that which all desire.</p>
                     <p>Of Goods, they say some are expetible <hi>for themselves,</hi> some, <hi>for
others;</hi> the first are either <hi>honest</hi> or <hi>necessary.</hi> Honest are the <hi>Vertues</hi>
and their functions; necessary <hi>Life,</hi> and those things which
pertain unto it, as the body with its parts and uses, and those
which are called externall goods, as <hi>riches, peace, glory, Liberty,
friendship,</hi> for each of these conferreth to the use of Vertue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Beatitude</hi> consisteth of Good and successful actions; wherefore
it is wholly good, as playing upon pipes is wholly Artificial; for
the use of the matter doth not take away the goodnesse from
Beatitude; as the use of Instruments taketh not away from the
Art of Medicine. Such things as are made use of towards this
perfection, are not to be reckoned as parts; for they; without
which the action cannot be, are not rightly parts thereof; for parts
conduce to the whole, the rest conduce to the end.</p>
                     <p>Good is divided into <hi>honest, profitable</hi> and <hi>pleasant;</hi> these are the
scopes of all actions. Beatitude consists of all these. It is <hi>the use of
perfect Vertue, in perfect life, with prosperous successe;</hi> and the <hi>function
of perfect life according to Vertue; and the use of Vertue according to
nature without any impediment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though some assert, that the <hi>End,</hi> is to be happy, and Beatitude
the <hi>scope,</hi> as, Riches are Good, and to be rich that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovefull;
yet is it better to follow the Antients, who assert the
End to be that for whose sake all things are, it self not being for
the sake of any other; or the ultimate of things expetible; or Life
according to Vertue, in corporeall and externall goods, either in
all or the most principall.</p>
                     <p>This being the greatest Good, useth the Ministry of the rest;
for as those things which conferr hereunto are to be esteemed
Goods, so those things which resist it are Indifferents, for every
good action doth not effect Beatitude.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:51150:298"/>
They assert <hi>Beatitude</hi> to be the <hi>use of perfect Vertue,</hi> as holding
some Vertues to be <hi>perfect,</hi> others <hi>imperfect.</hi> The perfect are <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi>
and <hi>Integrity;</hi> the imperfect are <hi>Ingenuity</hi> and <hi>Progression.</hi>
The perfect agreeth with the perfect, so as the end thereof is the
function of that Vertue, whereof no part is wanting.</p>
                     <p>They added <hi>perfect life,</hi> to shew that Beatitude is in men of
full age, for a young man is imperfect, and so is his life. Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
therefore is in perfect time, the longest that is appointed
for us by the Gods. As one Verse makes not a Poem; nor one
step a dance, nor one swallow a Summer; so neither doth a short
time conferre Beatitude, for Beatitude is perfect, and requireth
a perfect Man and Time.</p>
                     <p>They added <hi>successefull Function of Vertue,</hi> because the Goods of
Nature are necessarily requisite to Beatitude; for a good man
may exercise Vertue in misery, but cannot be happy. For as <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
is the only efficient of <hi>honest</hi> actions, so is <hi>Beatitude</hi> of <hi>honest,
good, and excellent.</hi> Neither doth it abide amongst ill or unhappy
things, but enjoyeth the Good, nor is deprived of the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of good, or the conveniences of life.</p>
                     <p>Beatitude being the most pleasant &amp; fairest of things, increaseth
like an Art by the multitude of its Instruments. It is not the same
in God and Man, neither is it equall amongst good men, for it
may somtimes be taken away by oppression of miseries. Hence it
is to be doubted whether a man may be termed happy as long as
he is alive, considering the uncertainty of Fortune, whence <hi>Solon</hi>
said, <hi>Consider the end of a long life, whether it be happy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Those who sleep are not participant of Beatitude, but after
some manner, as the function of the Soule is capable of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waking.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, they added, <hi>Nature,</hi> because every waking of good
men is not the use of perfect Vertue, but only that which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Nature, that is free from madnesse, for madnesse as
well as sleep depriveth men of use, and of this Reason, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
them like Brutes.</p>
                     <p>As Beatitude is said to be the use of Vertue, so is misery of
Vice, yet not so, that as this sufficeth to misery, so that doth to
Beatitude.</p>
                     <p>Life is made four and unpleasant to the Good by excessive ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
to the ill even in prosperity, because they sin more, nor
can rightly be termed happy.</p>
                     <p>Having asserted Beatitude to be the chief Good, it followeth
that we expound how many waies it is taken.</p>
                     <p>Good is understood <hi>three</hi> waies. First, for that which is the cause
of preservation to all beings; next for that which is predicated of
every good thing; Lastly, for that which is expetible in it self. The
first is <hi>God;</hi> the second the <hi>Genus</hi> of Goods; the third, the <hi>end,</hi> to
which all are referred, Beatitude.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:51150:299"/>
That which is expetible in it selfe, is said <hi>three</hi> waies, either
that for which something is done; or, for which all things are
done; or, some part of these.</p>
                     <p>Again, of these, some are <hi>finall,</hi> some <hi>efficient:</hi> finall, are the
actions proceeding, according to vertue; efficient, the materials
of expetible things.</p>
                     <p>Of goods, some are <hi>honourable,</hi> some <hi>laudable,</hi> some <hi>faculties,</hi>
some <hi>profitable.</hi> Honourable, as <hi>God,</hi> our <hi>Prince, Parent:</hi> Laudable,
as <hi>Riches, Empire, Liberty:</hi> Profitable, the efficient, as <hi>Health.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, of things good and expetible, some are expetible <hi>in
themselves,</hi> some for others; in themselves, as the <hi>honourable, lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,</hi>
and faculties; for others, as the <hi>Profitable,</hi> which effect and
conserve other things.</p>
                     <p>Again, of things good in themselves, some are <hi>ends,</hi> others,
<hi>not ends:</hi> Ends, as <hi>Iustice, Vertue, Health,</hi> and whatsoever consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
of these; Not ends, as <hi>Ingenuity, Memory, Learning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, of Goods, some are <hi>wholly</hi> perfect, others <hi>not;</hi> of the
first are <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> which benefit all; of the latter,
<hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> which require to be used by a good man. The
same things whereof a good man maketh right use, a wicked
man abuseth, as the same which a good Musician useth well,
he who is ignorant of Musick useth amisse. Whosoever maketh
ill use of any thing is hurt thereby; as, a good horse, which is a
help to him that knoweth how to ride, hurts the unskilfull
rider.</p>
                     <p>Again, of Goods, some are in the <hi>soul,</hi> some in the <hi>body,</hi> some
<hi>externall:</hi> In the soul are <hi>ingenuity, art, vertue, wisdome, prudence,
pleasure;</hi> in the body, <hi>health, soundnesse of sense, beauty, strength,
soundnesse of limbs,</hi> and all <hi>parts,</hi> with their <hi>faculties</hi> and <hi>functions.</hi>
Externall are <hi>riches, glory, nobility, power, friend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The goods of the soul are either conferred by <hi>na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Memory;</hi> or acquired by <hi>diligence,</hi> as the <hi>Liberall Sciences;</hi> or
fall into perfection, as <hi>Prudence, Iustice,</hi> and lastly, <hi>Wisdome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, of Goods, some may be both <hi>obtained</hi> and <hi>lost,</hi> as <hi>Riches;</hi>
some obtained, but not lost, as <hi>Felicity</hi> and <hi>Immortality;</hi> some lost,
but not obtained, as <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Life;</hi> some neither obtained nor
lost, as <hi>Nobility.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, of Goods, some are <hi>only</hi> expetible in themselves, as
Pleasure and Indolence; some efficient <hi>only,</hi> as Riches; some <hi>both</hi>
efficient and expetible in themselves, as Vertue, Friends,
Health.</p>
                     <p>Goods are divided more waies then these, as not belonging all
to one <hi>Genus,</hi> but to all the ten Categories.</p>
                     <p>These things laid down, we come next to speak more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
concerning Vertue, which they place in both parts of the
soul: In the <hi>rationall</hi> part, <hi>Integrity, Prudence, Wisdome, Memory,</hi>
and the like: In the <hi>irrationall</hi> part, <hi>Temperance, Iustice, Fortitude,</hi>
                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:51150:299"/>
and other vertues. These (say they) may be extinguished by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
which they prove by testimony of the senses, as things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
by manifest. For, as by excesse or defect of exercise, <hi>health</hi>
is corrupted, but by moderate exercise is preserved: In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is it in <hi>Temperance, Fortitude,</hi> and other vertues. For, as we
do call him who feareth the Thunder, mad, not valiant; so on
the contrary, he who feareth shadowes is a coward; but, he is
valiant, who neither feareth all things, nor nothing. These
things encrease or extinguish vertue; being moderate, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
courage; being too great, or too little, they extinguish it.
In like manner are all other vertues extinguished by <hi>excesse</hi> or
<hi>defect,</hi> increased by <hi>mediocrity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither is vertue only limited by these, but by <hi>pleasure</hi> and
<hi>griefe</hi> likewise, in as much as for pleasure we commit wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and for griefe shun good. To explain this more fully, they
un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>old the nature of the soul, wherein are seen three things,
<hi>passions, faculties, habits: Passions,</hi> as, <hi>anger, fear, hate, love, emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
pitty,</hi> and the like; to which is subsequent <hi>pleasure,</hi> or <hi>griefe.
Faculties,</hi> by which we make use of passions, and are angry, do
emulate, and the like. <hi>Habits</hi> are those from which the functions
of these proceedeth rightly, or otherwise. If any man be so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
that he is angry upon any occasion, he hath the habit of
<hi>anger;</hi> if so, as to be angry upon no occasion, he hath the habit of
<hi>stupidity,</hi> both which are blamable. The laudable habit is that of
<hi>meeknesse,</hi> by which we are angry in due time and place. Vertues
therefore are habits, by which the functions of passions become
laudable.</p>
                     <p>All vertue consisteth in action; all action is continuous.
Whatsoever things are continuous, like magnitude, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
defect, and mediocrity, either in relation to one another,
or to us. The mean, relating to us, is in all the best, (this is not
quantitative, but qualitative, and therefore is perfect; whereas
the extreams, excesse and defect, being contrary, are repugnant
to one another, and to the mean. But, the mean is to both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams
as equality is to inequality, greater then the least, lesse
then the greatest.) Vertue therefore is a deliberative habite,
consisting in mediocrity, relating to our selves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theophrastus</hi> having laid down some qualities, (following his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster)
endeavoureth to conclude from each of them: The examples
he alledgeth are these; Temperance, Intemperance, Stupidity,
Meekness, Wrath, Indolence, Fortitude, Boldnesse, Timidity, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e,
Liberality, Prodigality, Avarice, Magnanimity, Pusillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
Arrogance, Magnificence, Ostentation. For of these ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,
some are ill, through excesse or defect, others good through
mediocrity. He is not temperate who desireth nothing, nor he
who desireth all things; one like a stone, desireth not even natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
expetibles; the other, through excessive desire, becommeth
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51150:300"/>
intemperate. He only is temperate, who desireth honest things
with reason, in due time and measure. He is not meek who is
angry upon all occasions, nor he who is angry upon none; but,
he who is endued with the mean habit. He is not <hi>valiant</hi> who
feareth nothing, not God himselfe; nor he who feareth all things,
even his own shadow. Nor <hi>just,</hi> who either assumeth or deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
too much from himselfe, but who observeth equality. He
is not <hi>liberall</hi> who giveth away all, nor he who giveth nothing;
nor magnanimous, who esteemeth himselfe worthy all great
things, nor he who esteemeth himselfe worthy none; but he who
observeth a decorum. He is not magnificent who is splendid eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where, nor he who no where; but who observes due time and
place.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Genus of vertues is placed in <hi>Mediocrity,</hi> and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
consequent in it selfe; yet, not alike in all, for prudence is
consequent to the rest in its own proper nature; the rest are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
to it by accession, for he who is just, must necessarily be
wise, but not on the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Of passions and appetites, some are <hi>good,</hi> some <hi>bad,</hi> some <hi>mean;</hi>
the good are <hi>friendship, benevolenee, indignation, shame, confidence,
compassion;</hi> the bad, <hi>envy, malevolence, contumely;</hi> the mean, <hi>griefe,
fear, anger, pleasure, desire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Every passion is conversant in pleasure and griefe, for which
reason, the vertues depend upon them; but, <hi>love of mony, love of
pleasure, love-melancholy,</hi> and the like, are habits distinct from
vices.</p>
                     <p>Of <hi>Love,</hi> one kinde is of <hi>Friendship,</hi> another of <hi>Conjunction,</hi> the
third of <hi>both.</hi> The first is good, the second bad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the third mean.</p>
                     <p>Of Friendship there are <hi>foure</hi> kinds: <hi>Sodality, Affinity, Hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
Erotick:</hi> whether that of <hi>Beneficence,</hi> and that of <hi>Admiration</hi>
be to be added to these, is doubtfull. The first is derived from
<hi>conversation;</hi> the second from <hi>nature;</hi> the third from <hi>cohabitation;</hi>
the fourth from <hi>affection;</hi> the fift from <hi>good-will;</hi> the last from
some <hi>facultie.</hi> Of all these, there are in generall three ends, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
profitable, and pleasant: All persons that are studious of
friendship aim at one or more of these ends. The first friendship
is that, which every man hath to himselfe; the next, to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
the rest, to his friends and neighbours. Whence excesse in

some other part of the Common-wealth. If he be not busied
in any of these, he must addict himself to a popular life, either
by contemplation, or action, or (which is between both) Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
For though he ought to follow the action and contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of excellent things; yet if the time will not allow him to
use both, he may make choice of one, and preferre the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative
life, yet not neglecting the Common-wealth. He shall
therefore marry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the end he may have issue, and addict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to chast love, and as occasion requireth, drink wine freely, and
finally mantain his life by due observance of Vertue, and bee
ready to resign it, if there be a necessity, taking care to be buried
in his own Country, according to the rites thereof.</p>
                     <p>Thus there are three kinds of life, the <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
and that which consists of <hi>both.</hi> As the voluptuous is esteemed
beneath the dignity of a man, so is the contemplative preferred
before the rest. A good man shall addict himself to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Common-wealth, by choice, not chance; for the
active life is conversant in civill affairs. That life is best which
is led according to Vertue and Nature; the next is that which
is a mean condition, as to both; these are both expetible. But the
life which is conjoined with Vice is to be avoided. A <hi>happy</hi> life
differs from a <hi>Good</hi> in this. The happy is alwaies consonant to
Nature, the good somtimes repugnant to Nature. To
the first, Vertue onely is not requis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is requisite. A <hi>mean</hi> life is that which is placed in mediocrity,
not destitute of offices. <hi>Rectitudes</hi> in life are according to Vertue,
<hi>sins</hi> according to Vice; <hi>Offices</hi> in the mean kind of life.</p>
                     <p>To these things thus declared we must adde, that Vertue is a
habit desiring mean pleasures and griefs, pursuing that which is
honest, as it is honest; Vice is the opposite hereto.</p>

is the first <hi>Ens, by Reason</hi> or <hi>definition,</hi> because accidents are defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

Again, Animals have sense, even when they are not in act.
Thirdly, it were impossible any thing could be which were not

or may follow from some power; if it never followeth, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

to act, when the Agent and Patient are at a due distance, and
there is nothing betwixt to hinder them. The rationall powers
are not so, for they are free to act or not to act as they please.</p>

in the act of motion. For <hi>Plato</hi> and the rest, who concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
God to have done nothing for a great while, erre, because
that power were frustraneous which were not reduced to act.
Besides, motion would not have been eternall, unlesse the moving
substance were not only eternall, and in perpetuall actuall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but such likewise, that it could not but it must move all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
as being a pure act void of power.</p>
                     <p>Hence the substances which cause eternall motion are void of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51150:305"/>
matter, for they move from an eternall act, and are void of all
power.</p>
                     <p>In things that somtimes are, somtimes are not, power is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
to act; but simply and absolutely act is precedent to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
For, neither things naturall nor artificiall are reduced from
power to act, but by somthing that actually exists. Now if the
same thing alwaies return by a circular motion, it necessarily
followeth, that there is somthing eternall which remaineth ever
the same, and operateth in the same manner. Such an eternall
first moving substance is the first Heaven. The vicissitude of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
and <hi>corruption</hi> is not caused by the first Heaven, for that
moveth alwaies in the same manner, but by the inferiour Orbes,
especially the Sun, which by his accession bringeth life, by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
death to all things mortall.</p>
                     <p>Thus is the first Heaven <hi>eternall,</hi> for it is moved with eternall
motion; besides which there is somthing which alwaies moveth,
and is never moved it self, and is <hi>eternall,</hi> and <hi>substance,</hi> and
<hi>act.</hi>

an application of the powers of the inferiour movers to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

                     <p>BE all well; but if any thing happen otherwise, thus we
give order. All those goods which belong to the House,
I bequeath to <hi>Melantes</hi> and <hi>Pancreon</hi> Sonnes of
<hi>Leo;</hi> Those which are set apart for <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> I will be
thus disposed. First, that the study and Ornaments belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereunto be perfected, and if any thing may be added
more to beautifie them, that it be done. Next, that the statue
of <hi>Aristotle</hi> be set up in the Temple, and the other Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
which were before in the Temple. Moreover that the
little walk which is near the School be built new, not worse
then it was before, and that the Maps of the World be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the lower Walk. That an Altar likewise be built,
wanting nothing of perfection and splendor. I will that the
statue of <hi>Nicomachus</hi> as big as the life be finished; it is in
<hi>Praxitele</hi>'s hands; let him go on with it. Let it be placed
wheresoever they shall think good, who have the disposall
of the rest, and are named in my Will. Thus much for the
Temple and Donaries. My Land at <hi>Stagira</hi> I bequeath to
<hi>Callinus,</hi> all my Books to <hi>Neleus.</hi> The Garden and Walk,
and all the houses belonging to the Garden I bequeath to my
Friends hereafter named, that they may exercise themselves
and study Philosophy therein, for men cannot alwaies be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.
But with condition, that they do not alienate it, nor
pretend any propriety thereto, but esteem it a thing sacred in
common possession, making use of all things therein as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
just and loving Friends. The persons to whom I wil
that this be in common, are, <hi>Hipparchus, Neleus, Strato,
Callinus, Demotimus, Demaratus, Callisthenes, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantes,
Pancreon,</hi> and <hi>Nicippus.</hi> Let also <hi>Aristotle,</hi> sonne
of <hi>Midias</hi> and <hi>Pythias,</hi> if he desire to study Philosophy,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51150:308"/>
partake likewise of the same priviledge, and let the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
of the Overseers take great care of him, that he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
as well as is possible in Philosophy. Let us be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that part of the Garden, which they shall think most
convenient, not erecting a Monument, or any thing that is
sumptuous over our Graves. Thus let all things be ordered
according as is said; the Temple, Monument, Garden, and
walk repaired; let <hi>Pompylus,</hi> who dwelleth in them, take
charge of them, and of other things as he did heretofore,
for whose pains therein, let the Possessors thereof consider
him. As for <hi>Pompylus</hi> and <hi>Threpta,</hi> who have been
long since manumitted, and done us good service, if there be
any thing which we have bestowed upon them, or they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
have required, as also the 2000 Drachmes which I
appointed to be given to them and <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> let them
firmly possess it all, as I have often expressed to <hi>Melantes,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Pancreon,</hi> who assented thereunto. Moreover I bestow on
them <hi>Somatales</hi> and the Girle. Of my servants, I manumit
<hi>Molon,</hi> and <hi>Cimon,</hi> and <hi>Parmenon;</hi> as for <hi>Manes</hi> and
<hi>Callias,</hi> when they shall have lived four years in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
discharging their Office unblamably, I will they be set
at liberty. Of the Domestick Vtensills, let the Oversee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
bestow on <hi>Pompylus</hi> as many as they think fit, and sell the
rest. To <hi>Demotimus</hi> I give <hi>Cario,</hi> to <hi>Neleus, Donax;</hi> let
<hi>Eubius</hi> be sold. Let <hi>Hipparchus</hi> give to <hi>Callinus</hi> 3000
drachms. And for <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

upon <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> as having heretofore been very beneficial
to us, and now quite shipwrack'd in his Fortunes, wee
should have appointed him a joint-estate with <hi>Melantes</hi>
and <hi>Pancreon.</hi> But because I conceive it were not easie for
them to be joined in the ordering of one Family with him, and
that it would be more to their advantage to receive somthing
certain from <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> for these reasons, let <hi>Hippar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
give to each of them, <hi>Melantes</hi> and <hi>

Let him likewise duly furnish the Overseers with all
charges necessary for the performance of the forementioned
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51150:308"/>
works; which done, let <hi>Hipparchus</hi> be free and discharged
from all debts and Covenants to me. If any benefit come to
<hi>Hipparchus</hi> from <hi>Chalcis</hi> on my behalf, let him wholly enjoy
it as his own. Be these the Overseers of those things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

wasted, as <hi>Suidas</hi> affirmes, with continuall writing; and, upon

                        <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, <hi>He blamed Nature
for giving Harts and Crowes so long life that could do no good thereby,
and to Man, who could do most good, so short; whereas if man had been
allowed longer time, his life might have been adorned with the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of arts and learning.</hi> Thus he complained, that assoon as he
came within the view of these, he was taken away.</p>
                     <p>His Disciples came to him,<note place="margin">Laert.</note> and asked him if he had any
thing to say to them; <hi>Nothing;</hi> saith he, <hi>but that the life of man
loseth many pleasures only for glory. When we begin to live, then we die;
nothing is more unprofitable then the desire of glory. But be happy, and
either give over study, for it is very laborious, or go perseverantly
through it, for it is of great glory. The vanity of life is much greater
then the benefit thereof. But, I have not time to advise you what to do;
do you consider at leisure what is best for you:</hi> In saying which words
he expired. The whole people of <hi>Athens</hi> followed his body on

                     <p>In stile he was very different from himself.</p>
                     <p>Upon those who were sorry they had not learned when time
was, and wished it might be recalled, he jested thus. He said,
that they who endeavoured to make amends by a late penitence
for their past negligence, were conscious of the impossibility of
their wishes; and of those that sought to bring it to passe, he said,
they had lost all reason, in applying the nature of a straight line
to a crooked ruler, or beholding their face in troubled water, or
a confused mirrour.</p>
                     <p>He said, that to the wreath of publick games in the <hi>Forum,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

He was very expert in all exercises, active and well made for
a Wrestler, being thin-ear'd and well set, as <hi>Antigonus Caryslius</hi>
affirmeth: Whence in his own Country he practised the <hi>Elean</hi>
Games, and played at Ball.</p>
                     <p>He was intimate with <hi>Eumenus</hi> and <hi>Attalus</hi> beyond all men,
who supply'd him with many things. <hi>Antiochus</hi> also would have
had him lived with him, but could not get him.</p>
                     <p>He was so great an enemy to <hi>Hieronymus</hi> the <hi>Peripatetick,</hi> that
upon a solemn day (of which already in the life of <hi>Arcesilaus</hi>)
he only forbore to come to him.</p>
                     <p>He compared <hi>Orators</hi> to Frogs; these, saith he, croak in the
water, those by the water of an houre-glasse.</p>
                     <p>He was Master of the School forty years, succeeding <hi>Strato</hi> in

be paid whatsoever I owe at <hi>Athens</hi> to any man, as also the
charges of my Funerall and Exequies. What is in the City
and <hi>Aegina,</hi> I bestow upon <hi>Lyco,</hi> because he is of our
name, and hath lived long with us, to our great content, as
one that deserved the place of a Son. <hi>The Peripatum</hi> I leave
to those friends that will make use of it, as <hi>Bulo, Callinus,

that place who they conceive will persevere in it, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
it best, which let the rest of my friends confirm for my
sake and the places. My Funerall and the burning of my Body
be so ordered by <hi>Bulo</hi> and <hi>Callinus,</hi> that it be not prodigall
nor niggardly. Out of my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and choose a fit place for the setting up of it, wherein let <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantus</hi>
and <hi>Heraclides,</hi> son of <hi>Demetrius</hi> assist them.

<hi>Callinus</hi> and the expenses of my funerall be discharged.
Let that houshold stuffe be taken away which I have left as
common betwixt them. Let likewise the Physicians <hi>Pasithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi>
and <hi>Midas</hi> be honoured and rewarded for their care of
me, and for their skill. To the son of <hi>Callinus</hi> I leave a couple
of <hi>Thericlean</hi> Pots, and to his Wife, a couple of Goblets,
and a fine Carpet, and a shaggy Carpet, and a Coverlet, and
two Couch beds, the best that are left, that we may not seem
unmindfull of their due respect towards us. As for those
that served me, I order thus: <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who hath been
long a Free man, I forgive the price of his redemption; and
bestow upon him five Minae, and a Cloak and a Coat; and,
as having undergone many labours with me, let him be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
supplyed with necessaries. <hi>Crito,</hi> the Chalcidonian,
I forgive the price of his redemption, and bestow further on
him foure Minae <hi>Micrus</hi> also I manumit, whom let <hi>Lyco</hi>
bring up, and six years hence let him instruct him. In like
manner I manumit <hi>Chares,</hi> whom let <hi>Lyco</hi> also bring up;
I give him two Minae, and my bookes, that have been
published: The rest that have not been published, let them be
given to <hi>Callinus,</hi> and let him take diligent care for the
publishing of them. To Syrus the Free-man I give foure
Minae, and <hi>Menodora,</hi> and if he owe me any thing, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give

Vertue may be acquired by Learning, and that it cannot be lost;
that a wise man deserves to be loved, and never sinneth, and is a
friend to such as are like him, and trusteth nothing to Fortune.</p>

                     <p>Some affirm, saith <hi>Laertius,</hi> he first wore a double Cloak, upon
which he used to lie [at night:] He likewise carried a wallet,
wherein was his meat. He made use of all places for all things,
dining, sleeping and discoursing in any place, insomuch that
pointing to <hi>Iupiter's</hi> walke, and the <hi>Pompaeum,</hi> two publick places
at <hi>Athens,</hi> he said, the Athenians built them for his dwelling.
Falling once sick, he walked with a staffe, which afterwards he
continually used, as likewise a wallet, not in the City, but when
he travelled. He wrote to one to build him a little house, which
the other not doing so soon as he required, he made use of a <hi>Tub</hi>

                     <p>He did not suffer the young men that were under his charge, to
exercise themselves as Wrastlers, but only till they were warm,
and for their health sake. He taught them many sayings of Poets
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51150:325"/>
by heart, and some of his own, and that they might more easily
remember the full sum of Learning, he made a brief Collection
thereof. He taught them at home to minister, using thin diet, and
drinking water, to go negligently in habit, shaven, without coats,
without shooes, and silent, looking upon themselves as they went.
He brought them up likewise to Hunting. On the other side, they
took great care of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> and recommended him to their

                        <note n="a" place="margin">Laert.</note> ANd concerning <hi>Opinions,</hi> he said, there is a twofold <hi>Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
one <hi>spirituall,</hi> the other <hi>corporeall;</hi> If in the first of
these we employ our selves constantly, frequent phantasies wil
occurre, which facilitate the performance of Vertue; the one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be without the other, a good habit and strengh being necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
both in respect of the soul and the body.</p>
                     <p>That Vertue is easily acquired by exercitation he argued, in as
much as in the Mechanick Arts and others, that Artists by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
quickly arrive at an extraordinary readinesse therein, and
Wrastlers and Musicians excell one another according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
pames they take therein one more then another, and
if they should have taken the same pains about their souls, it
would not have been unprofitably and imperfectly employ'd.</p>
                     <p>He said nothing in life can be rightly done without exercitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that exercitation could master any thing, for whereas
men should choose Naturall Labours, whereby they might live
happily; they on the contrary make choice of the unprofitable,
and through their own folly, are in continuall misery. For even
the contempt of Pleasure, if we accustome our selves thereto will
be most pleasant; and as they, who inure themselves to a volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51150:325"/>
life cannot be taken off it without much trouble and grief;
so they who exercise themselves in a contrary manner with as
great ease contemn even the pleasures themselves.</p>
                     <p>He ascribed not so much to Law as to Nature; Hee affirmed
that he followed the same course of life with <hi>Hercules,</hi> preferring
nothing before Liberty.</p>
                     <p>He asserted that all things belong to the wise, arguing thus; <hi>all
things belong to the Gods, the Gods are friends to wise persons; all things
are common amongst friends;</hi> therefore <hi>all things belong to the wise.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As concerning Law, he held that without it a Commonwealth
could not be ordered, for, saith he, <hi>without a City there cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
profit of Civill things; a City is a Civill thing; of Law without a
City there is no profit, therefore Law is Civil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He derided <hi>Nobility, glory,</hi> and the like, saying, they were the
Ornaments, or veiles of wickednesse, and that only a right Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
ought to be honour'd.</p>
                     <p>He held that there ought to be a Community of women, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
marriage to be nothing, and that every man and woman
might enjoy one another as they pleased themselves, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that all Children should be in common.</p>
                     <p>Hee held that it was not unlawfull to take any thing out of a
Temple, or to feed upon living Creatures, neither was it impious
to eat mans flesh, as appeared by the practise of other Nations,
adding that all things are in all and by all; in bread there is flesh,
in flesh bread; the remainders of flesh and bread being insinuated
by occult passages into other bodies, and evaporating in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
This <hi>Laertius</hi> cites out of a Tragedy of his named <hi>Thyestes,</hi> if
saith he, that Tragedy belong to him, and not rather to <hi>Philiscus,</hi>
or <hi>Pasiphon.</hi>

                     <p>

                     <p>He said, when he look'd upon <hi>Pilots, Physicians</hi> and <hi>Philosophers,</hi>
Man was the wisest of all Creatures; but when he looked upon
<hi>Interpreters</hi> of Dreams, <hi>Prophets</hi> or persons puff'd up with wealth

At a great Feast, seeing <hi>Plato</hi> eat Olives; Why, saith he, you
being a wise man, and going to <hi>Sicily</hi> for such entertainments,
did you not enjoy them: He answer'd, by the Gods <hi>Diogenes,</hi> I
fed upon Olives there likewise as well as upon other things. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogenes</hi>
replyed, why then needed you to have gone to <hi>Syracuse,</hi>

being demanded how much 2. and 2. are, answer 20. so you
neither grant what I request, nor answer what I demand; thus
censuring his verbosity.</p>
                     <p>Being demanded in what part of <hi>Greece</hi> he had seen good men;

                     <p>He wondred at <hi>Grammarians,</hi> who enquiring after the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes

lastly at <hi>covetous</hi> persons, for dispraising mony, which they loved
above all things.</p>
                     <p>He reprehended those, who though they commended just men
for thinking themselves to be above mony, yet esteemed the rich
happy.</p>
                     <p>He was angry at those, who when they sacrificed to the Gods
for their health, feasted at the same time contrary to their health.</p>
                     <p>He wondered at Servants, who seeing their Masters eat exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively,
did not take away their meat.</p>
                     <p>He praised those, who being about to marry, would not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
who being about to go sea, would not go to sea; who being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to undertake some publick office, would not undertake it;
and who being about to bring up children, forbore to bring them

yet never went to them.</p>

                     <head type="sub">His Death.</head>
                     <p>HE died, as <hi>Demetrius</hi> saith, at <hi>Corinth</hi> about 90. years old, the
same day that <hi>Alexander</hi> died at <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Laert.</note> which according
to <hi>Aelian</hi> was the seventh of <hi>Thargelion</hi> in the first year of 114<hi rend="sup">t•</hi>
Olympiad.</p>
                     <p>The manner of his death is variously related. <hi>Eubulus</hi> saith, he
lived to his end with <hi>Xeniades,</hi> and was buried by his Sons. As
he lay sick, <hi>Xeniades</hi> asked him how he would be buried, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
with his face downwards; <hi>Xeniades</hi> demanding the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<hi>because,</hi> saith he, <hi>all things will be turned upside-down,</hi> alluding,
saith <hi>Laertius,</hi> to the greatnesse of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who not long
before were a poor inconsiderable people. Some report that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
near death, he gave order that his body should be left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried,
that the wild Beasts might partake of him, or be thrown
into a ditch, and a little dust be cast over it, or thrown upon a
dung-hill, that he might benefit his Brethren.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aelian</hi>
                        <note place="margin">ar. hist. 8. 14.</note> saith, that being sick to death, he threw himself down
from a bridge which was near the Gymnasium, and ordered the
Keeper of the <hi>Palaestra</hi> to take his body and throw it into the
River <hi>Ilissus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Others affirm he died of a surfet of raw flesh, others that he
stopp'd his own breath, others, that cutting a Cuttle-fish, in
pieces to throw it to dogs, it bit asunder a Nerve in his foot,
whereof he died.</p>
                     <p>Others affirm he died as he was going to the Olympick Games:
being taken with a Feaver, he lay down by the way, and would
not suffer his friends to carry him, but sitting under the shade of
the next tree, spoke thus to them; <hi>This night I shall be a Victor or
vanquished, if I overcome the Feaver, I will come to the Games, if not,
I must go to the other World, and drive it away by death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Antisthenes</hi> saith, his Friends were of opinion he stopp'd his own
breath, for coming as they constantly used to visit him in the
<hi>Cranaeum</hi> where he lived, they found him covered; they did not
imagine it was sleep, by reason of his great wakefulnesse; but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
putting back his Cloak perceived he was dead. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
there arose a contention amongst them who should bury
him; they fell from words to blows, but the Magistrates and great
ones of the City came themselves and buried him, by the gate
which leads to <hi>Isthmus.</hi> Over the Sepulchre they placed a Column,
and upon it a <hi>Dog</hi> cut out of <hi>Parian</hi> stone. Afterwards his own
Countrymen honoured him with many brazen <hi>Statues,</hi> bearing
this Inscription;

of the person, that he counterfeited himself mad, and threw
all the mony from off the Table, whereupon his Master turning
him away, he betook himself to <hi>Diogenes.</hi> He followed likewise
<hi>Crates</hi> the Cynick, and others of that Sect, which confirm'd his
Master in the opinion that he was mad. He was a person eloquent
and learned, mention'd by <hi>Menander</hi> in his <hi>Hippocomus,</hi> of so great
constancy, that he contemned all glory for vertues sake. He wrote
some things, which at first appearance seemed <hi>Ludicrous,</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

to <hi>Athens,</hi> who hearing <hi>Diogenes</hi> would not depart

there likewise for the same reason. Lastly, the Father himselfe
went, and was so much taken with <hi>Diogenes,</hi> that he became a

(for he was very rich, having gotten together above two hundred

a Professor of this Philosophy, that <hi>Philemon,</hi> the Comick

and to throw all the mony he had left into the Sea: and that the
house of <hi>Crates</hi> was from <hi>Alexander,</hi> that of <hi>Hipparchia</hi> his Wife,
from <hi>Philip.</hi> Some of his neer friends that came to him to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him from this course of life, he beat away, for he was of a

                  <p>
                     <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Magnesian</hi> saith, he deposited some mony in the

themselves to any Civill employment, it should be repaid
again; but, if to Philosophy, it should be distributed amongst the

                     <hi>Eratosthenes</hi> relates, that having a son named <hi>Pasicles,</hi> by his
Wife <hi>Hipparchia,</hi> assoon as he arrived at mans estate, he brought
him to the house of a young maid that was his slave, saying,
This is a hereditary matrimony to you: but those who commit
adultery, are, according to the Tragedians punished with banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or death; Those who keep Concubines were, according to
the Comedians, by luxury and drunkennesse, transported to
madnesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pasicles,</hi> the Disciple to <hi>Euclid,</hi> was his brother.</p>
                  <p>He said, 'tis not possible to finde a man without a fault, for,
in every Pomgranat there is at least one grain corrupt.</p>
                  <p>Having displeased <hi>Nicodromus</hi> a Lutinist, he beat him black
and blew; whereupon he pasted a piece of paper on his forehead,
wherein was written, Nicodromus <hi>did this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was exceedingly invective against common women.</p>
                  <p>He reproved <hi>Demetreus Phalerius</hi> for sending bread and wine
to him, saying, <hi>I wish the fountains also produc'd bread;</hi> intimating
that he lived with water.</p>
                  <p>The Athenian Magistrates blamed him for wearing a long
robe; <hi>I will shew you</hi> Theophrastus, saith he, <hi>in the same attire;</hi>
which they not believing, he brought them to a Barbers shop,
where he was sitting to be trimm'd.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Thebes,</hi> being beaten by the Master of the <hi>Gymnasium;</hi> or, as
others, at <hi>Corinth</hi> by <hi>Euthicrates,</hi> he laughed, saying,

                     <hi>Zeno</hi> in his <hi>Chrias</hi> saith, he sowed a sheep-skinn upon his cloak,
to appear the more deformed. He was of a very unhandsome
look, and whilst he discoursed, laughed.</p>
                  <p>He used to lift up his hands and say, <hi>Be of good courage, Grecians,
both for the eyes and all other parts, for you shall soon see these deriders
surprised by sicknesse, and proclaiming you happy, blame their owne
slothfulnesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He said, we ought so long to study Philosophy, untill the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

                  <p>He said, they who lived with flatterers were forsaken persons,
living like sheep amidst wolves, not with those who wish'd them
well.</p>
                  <p>Perceiving he drew nigh to death, he looked upon himselfe,
saying,

having first been a Scholer of <hi>Crates,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
a hearer of other Philosophers, at
last instituted this new Sect.<note n="a" place="margin">Laert.</note> Hee was born
at <hi>Cittium,</hi> a Greek Sea-Town in the Isle of
<hi>Cyprus,</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Strab. lib.</note> with a lock'd Haven, inhabited by

whereof he was so far from being ashamed, that<note n="e" place="margin">P lut. de rep. Stoic.</note> he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be made a Citizen of <hi>Athens,</hi> as conceiving it an undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his own Country; in so much as<note n="f" place="margin">Laert.</note> when he contributed to a
Bath in <hi>Athens,</hi> and his name was inscribed upon a Pillar with

                        <hi>Zeno</hi> (as <hi>Hecaton</hi> and <hi>Apollonius Tyrius</hi> relate,) enquiring of
the Oracle what course he should take to lead the best kind of
life, was answer'd, that he should converse with the dead, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he addicted himself to the reading of antient Authors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Laert.</note> Herein he was not a little furthered by his Father, who, as
<hi>Demetrius</hi> saith, trading frequently to <hi>Athens,</hi> brought him as yet
but very young, many Socraticall Books, which excited in him a
great affection to learning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Laert.</note> Being now 17. (or as <hi>Persaeus</hi> 22) years old, hee took a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
to <hi>Athens,</hi> carried thither as well by his particular inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Philosophy, as by his businesse, which was to fell some
Purple that he had brought out of <hi>Phoenicia.</hi> He took along with
him a hundred Talents, and having sold his Merchandise, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself to Philosophy, yet continued to lend his money out
to Merchants upon interest, so to improve his stock.</p>
                     <p>Some affirm his Ship was cast away in the Piraeum, which news
being brought him to <hi>Athens,</hi> he seemed nothing at all moved,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51150:340"/>

went up to the City of <hi>Athens,</hi> and sitting in a Booksellers shop,
read a piece of <hi>Xenophon's</hi> Commentaries, where with being much
pleas'd, he asked the Bookseller where, such men lived, <hi>Crates</hi>

a pot full of pottage to carry through the Ceramick, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
him to hide it, as ashamed, with his Coat, he struck the
pot with his stick and broke it. <hi>Zeno</hi> running away, all wet, what,

made a litle hollow cover of a pot, in which he carried the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

went to buy meat. Thus hee lived a while with <hi>Crates,</hi> during

jeasting, said, it was written under the Dog's tail.</p>
                     <p>At last deserting, <hi>Crates</hi> he apply'd himself to<note n="b" place="margin">Laert.</note>

by which the Philosophers are to be taken hold of, are their ears; Lead
me by those your way, or else though you constrain my body to be with you,
my mind will be with Stilpo.</hi> With <hi>Stilpo</hi> he remained ten years.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Stilpo</hi> he went to <hi>Xenocrates,</hi> being so well satisfied with

but all the Macedonians. For, he who teacheth the King of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
and guideth him to Vertue, it is evident, that he doth likewise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
all his Subjects in Vertue. For such as is the Prince, such for the

                           <p>I Much esteem your earnest desire of Learning, in that you aime at
Philosophy, not popular, which perverteth manners, but that true dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
which conferreth profit, avoiding that generally commended
pleasure which effeminates the soules of some young men. It is manifest,
that you are enclined to Generosity, not only by nature, but by choice.
A generous nature, with indifferent exercise, assisted by a Master, may
easily attain to perfect Vertue. But, I am very infirm of body by reason of
my age, for I am fourescore years old, and therefore not able to come to
you. Yet, I will send you some of my con-Disciples, who, in those things
that concern the Soul, are nothing inferiour to me; in those of the Body
are much superiour to me, of whom, if you make use, you will want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
conducing to perfect Beatitude.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>He said,</hi> that nothing is more unseemly then pride, especially in

use of it in our minds.</p>

said, it was his destiny to steal, <hi>and to be beaten,</hi> said he.</p>
                     <p>He said, that <hi>Beauty is the sweetnesse of the voice;</hi> or, according to
some, he called it, <hi>the flower of Beauty.</hi>

                     <p>Being demanded how he behaved himself when reviled, hee
said, <hi>as an Ambassador dismiss'd without answer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He changed the Verses of <hi>Hesiod,</hi> thus;</p>
                     <q>

either a part or particle of Philosophy; but, a particle it is not,

That which is a particle of any thing, ought to have the same
matter and scope, with that whereof it is a part: Logick hath
neither of these common with Active Philosophy; the matter
whereof is humane things, and moderation of Appetite, the

things that judge; but sight, and hearing, and the other common

said to be things judging, but the logicall only, and those which

the sense: the third is the application of phantasie or sight. For
as in the Staticks, there are three things which judge, the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
the ballance, and position of the ballance: The weigher is the
judge from which, the ballance the judge by which, the position
of the ballance, as it were a habitude. And again, as to discern
right or oblique things is required, an Artificer, a Ruler, and the
application thereof; in like manner in Philosophy are required
those three things mentioned to the discernment of true and
false: the man from whom the judgment is made, is like the
weigher or artificer; to the ballance and ruler answer sense and
cogitation, by which the judgment is made; to the habitude of
the forenamed instruments, the application of phantasy, by
which a man commeth to judge.</p>

                        <hi>Phantasy</hi> is an impression in the Soul: <hi>Cleanthes</hi> addes, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
by depression and eminence, as that impression, which is

                     <p>
                        <hi>Chrysippus</hi> conceives this to be absurd; for 1. saith he, When
the soule first apprehends a triangle and a square, it will follow,
that the same body, at the same time, must have in it selfe seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
figures, which is absurd. Again, whereas many phantasies
are together consistent in us, the Soul must have divers figures,
which is worse then the former: He therefore conceived, that
<hi>Zeno</hi> used the word Impression, for Alteration, meaning thus:
Fantasy is an alteration of the Soul, whereby it is no longer ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
that the same body (many severall phantasies being at the
same time consistent in us) should receive severall alterations.
For, as the aire receiving at once innumerable different percus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
hath presently many alterations; so the supream part of
the soule, receiving various phantasies, doth something which
hath proportion and conformity thereto.</p>
                     <p>Some object that this exposition is not right; because, though
every phantasy is an impression and alteration in the Soul; yet,
every impression or alteration of the Soul is not phantasy: as
when the finger smarts or itches, and the hand is rubbed, there
is then an impression and alteration in the soul; but it is not
phantasy, because it is not in the supream part of the soul.</p>
                     <p>They answer, That in saying, an impression in the Soul, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
as in the Soul as fully, as if we should say, phantasy is an
impression in the Soul as in the Soul; as when we say, the white
in the eye, we imply, as in the eye; that is, the white is in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
part of the eye, which all men have so by nature. So when
we say, Phantasy is an impression in the Soul, we imply the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
to be made in the supream part thereof.</p>
                     <p>Others more elegantly answer, that the word Soul is taken
two waies, either for the whole, or for the principall part: when
we say, man consists of soul and body; or, that death is a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the soul from the body, we mean properly the supream
part, wherein properly consists the motion and goods of the
Soul. When <hi>Ze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>o</hi> therefore calleth Phantasy an impression in
the Soul, he is not to be understood of the whole Soul, but, of
part thereof; as if he should say, Phantasy is an alteration of
the supream part of the Soul.</p>
                     <p>To this interpretation, some object thus: Appetition, Assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Comprehension are alterations in the supream part
of the soul; but, these differ from phantasy, that being a certain
kinde of perswasion and affection, whereas this is more operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then appetition, therefore the definition is not good, being
competible to many other things.</p>

to that which is; for some phantasies are from that which is,
but represents the similitude of that which is not: as <hi>Orestes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
a phantasie from that which was, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Electra,</hi> but
not according to that which was; for he thought her to be one
of the furies. Comprehensive phantasie must be conformable to
that which is, and so impressed and signed, as that it may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
artificially all the properties of the thing phancied, as
Gravers touch all the parts of those things which they imitate,
and the impression made by a Seal on Wax exactly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
beareth all its characters. Lastly, that it be without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment;
for sometimes comprehensive phantasie is not credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
by reason of outward circumstances; as when <hi>Hercules</hi>
brought <hi>Alcestis</hi> taken out of the Earth, to <hi>Admetus, Admetus</hi>
drew from <hi>Alcestis</hi> a comprehensive phantasie, but did not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
it; for, he consider'd, that she was dead, and therefore could
not rise again, but, that sometimes Spirits appear in the shape of
the deceased.</p>

                        <hi>Phantasy, Phantaston, Phantasticon,</hi> and <hi>Phantasme,</hi> according
to <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> differ thus: <hi>Phantasy</hi> is a passion made in the Soul,
which sheweth it selfe, and that which made it; as, when with
our eyes we see white, it is a passion engendred by sight in the
Soul, and we may call this a passion, because the object thereof
is a white thing which moveth us: the like of smelling and
touching.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Phantaston</hi> is that which maketh phantasie; as the white and

                     <p>
                        <hi>Phantasticon</hi> is a frustaneous attraction, a passion in the Soul
proceeding from nothing; as in those who sight with shadowes,
or extend their hands in vain: for, to phantasy is objected phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taston,
but phantasticon hath no object.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Phantasme</hi> is that, to which we are attracted by that frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
attraction, which happens in melancholy, or mad persons;
as <hi>Orestes</hi> in the Tragedy, when he saith,</p>
                     <q>

                        </gap>, and therefore incorporeall. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
Truth is a body, as being the enunciative Science of all
true things. All Science is in some measure the supream part of
the Soul, which supream part is a body: therefore truth in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
is corporeall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>By Constitution;</hi> True is conceived to be something uniforme
and simple by nature; as, It is day, I discourse. Truth, as being
a Science, consisteth of many things, by a kinde of conservation.
Wherefore as a People is one thing, a Citizen another; a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
is a multitude consisting of many Citizens; but, a Citizen is
no more then one. In the same manner differeth truth from true.
Truth resembleth a People, true a Cittizen; for, truth consisteth
of many things collected, true is simple.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>By Power;</hi> for true doth not absolutely adhere to truth: A fool,
a child, a mad-man, may speak something true, but, cannot have
the Science of that which is true. Truth considers things with
Science, insomuch that he who hath it is wise; for, he hath the
Science of true things, and is never deceived, nor lyeth, although
he speak false, because it proceedeth not from an ill, but, good
affection.</p>

the power that was in the senses, we likewise declared, that
many things were comprehended and perceived by the senses,
which cannot be done without Assent. Moreover, seeing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
an inanimate and an animate being, the greatest difference
is, that the inanimate doth nothing, the animate doth something,
we must either take away sense from it, or allow it assent, which
is within our power. When we will not have a thing either to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51150:352"/>
perceive or assent, we in a manner take away the soule from it;
for as it is necessary, that the scale of ballance which is laden
should tend downwards; so is it that the soule should yeeld to
things that are perspicuous.</p>

hath not (according to <hi>Chrysippus</hi>) this principall reason, not that
it can be made without any extrinsecall excitation (for it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary

Cylinder and Cone, which move not by impulsion, then of
their owne nature, the Cylinder seemes to rowle, and the Cone
to turne round. As therefore he who thrust the Cylinder
gave it the beginning of motion, but did not give it volubility;
so the objected phantasy imprinteth, and as it were sealeth in the
soule its species, yet the assent is in our power, and that (as we

                        </gap>, they
conceived, that names were given by nature: the first pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ch reason, they derive
Etymologies, conceiving that there is not any word, for which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51150:354"/>
there cannot be given a certain reason. They therefore studious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enquired whence words are deduced, much pains was taken,
first, by <hi>Zeno,</hi> then by <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> afterwards by <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> to give
a reason of commentitious fables, and to explain the causes of
words, why they are called so and so.</p>
                     <p>This beginning is to be sought, untill we arrive so far, as that
the thing agree in some similitude with the sound of the word,
as when we say, tinkling of brasse, the <hi>neighing</hi> of horses, the
<hi>bleating</hi> of sheep, the <hi>gingling</hi> of chains: These words by their
sound, expresse the things which are signified by them.</p>
                     <p>But, for as much as there are things which found not, in these
the similitude of touching hath the same power: As, they touch
the sense smoothly or harshly, the smoothnesse or harshnesse of
letters in like manner touch the hearing, and thereby occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
their names. As when we say <hi>smooth,</hi> it sounds smoothly:
so, who will not judge <hi>harshnesse</hi> to be harsh by the very word?
It is smooth to the ear when we say <hi>pleasure;</hi> harsh, when we
say <hi>crux, a crosse:</hi> the things themselves make good the sound of
the words. <hi>Honey,</hi> as sweetly as the thing it selfe affects our tast,
so sweetly doth the name touch our hearing: <hi>Soure,</hi> as harsh in
both. <hi>Wool</hi> and <hi>Bryars,</hi> as the words are to the hearing, the things
are to the touch. These are conceived to be the infancy, as it
were, of words, when the sense of the thing concords with the
sense of the sound.</p>
                     <p>From hence proceeded the licence of naming, according to
the similitude of the things among themselves: as when, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<hi>crux, a crosse,</hi> is therefore so called, because the harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the word concords with the harshnesse of the pain
which the crosse affecteth. But, <hi>Crura,</hi> thighes, are so called, not
from harshnesse of pain; but, because in length and hardnesse,
they are, in respect of the other limbs, like unto the wood of a
crosse. Hence it comes to abuse, that the name usurped, not of
a like thing, but, as it were neer: for what likenesse is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the signification of little and minute, when as that may
be little, which not only is nothing minute, but is somewhat
grown; yet, by reason of a certain neernesse, we say minute for
little. But, this abuse of the word is in the power of the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker;
for, he may use the word little, and not minute. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
belongs to that which we will shew, when we call that
a <hi>fish-pond</hi> which hath no fish in it, nor any thing like a fish: It is
denominated from fishes, by reason of the water, wherein fishes
live. So the word is used by translation, not from similitude, but
a certain kinde of vicinity. And if any one should say, that men
in swimming resemble fishes, and that from thence a fish-pond
is so named, it were foolish to refuse it, since that neither is
repugnant to the nature of the thing, and both are occult. But,
this is to the purpose, which we cannot dilucidate by one
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51150:354"/>
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, how much the origine of the word, which is taken from
vicinity, differs from that which is derived from similitude.</p>
                     <p>From hence there is a progression to the contrary. <hi>Lucus</hi> is
thought to be so named, <hi>quod minime luceat;</hi> and <hi>bellum, quòd res
bella non sit;</hi> and <hi>soedus, quòd res foeda non sit.</hi> But, if we derive
<hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that which is made, is named from that by which it is made.</p>
                     <p>For this vicinity is very large, and divided into many parts,
either by efficience, as this word <hi>procus à foeditate;</hi> from which
likewise <hi>foedus:</hi> or by effect, as <hi>puteus,</hi> so named, because the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
thereof is <hi>potatio:</hi> or by that it containeth, as <hi>urbs ab orbe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in a place which they liked, they first made a track about
it with a plough, as <hi>Virgil</hi> saith of <hi>Aeneas,</hi>
                        <q>—Urbem designat Aratro.</q>
Or by that which is contained, as if <hi>horreum</hi> were derived from
<hi>hordeum;</hi> or by abuse, as <hi>hordeum</hi> for wheat, or the whole from a
part, as <hi>mucro,</hi> which is the point for the whole sword; or a part
from the whole; as <hi>capillus quasi capitis pilus.</hi> What need we go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
further? whatsoever else can be reckoned, we may see the
origin of the word contained, either in the similitude betwixt
things and sounds, or in the similitude betwixt things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or in vicinity, or contrariety, which origine we cannot
pursue beyond similitude.</p>
                     <p>But this we cannot do alwaies, for there are innumerable
words, the reasons of which ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hid. To the infancy, or rather
stock and seed of such words, beyond which, no origine is to
be sought, neither if a man do enquire can he finde any, they
proceed in this manner: The syllables, in which <hi>v</hi> hath the place
of consonant, as in these words, <hi>venter, vafer, velum, vinum, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,
vulnus,</hi> have a thick, and as it were, a strong sound, which
the very custome of speaking confirmeth, when from some words
we take them away, lest they should burden the eare; for
which reason we say <hi>amâsti,</hi> rather then <hi>amavisti,</hi> and <hi>abiit,</hi> not
<hi>abi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>it,</hi> and innumerable of the same kinde. Therefore when we
say <hi>Vis,</hi> the sound of the word having, as we said, a kinde of
force, suiteth with the thing which it signifieth. Now from this
vicinity, by that which they affect, that is, because they are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent,
<hi>vincula</hi> seem to be named, and <hi>vimen, quo aliquid vincia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>
Thence <hi>vites,</hi> because they claspe about those things by which
they grow. Hence also by similitude, <hi>Terence</hi> calls a crooked old
man <hi>vietum.</hi> Hence the Earth, worn into winding paths by the
feet of passengers, is called <hi>via;</hi> but if <hi>via</hi> be so named, <hi>quasi vi
pedum trita,</hi> the origine returnes to the vicinity: But let us sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it derived from the similitude it hath with <hi>vitis,</hi> or <hi>vimen,</hi>
that is, from its winding, one asketh me why it is called <hi>via?</hi>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:51150:355"/>
I answer, from the windings and crookednesse thereof, which
the antients called <hi>vietum;</hi> thence the rounds of a wheel <hi>vietos.</hi>
He demands, how <hi>vietum</hi> comes to signifie winding? I answer,
from the similitude of <hi>vitis,</hi> a Vine: He requires whence <hi>vitis</hi> is
so named? I say, because it doth <hi>vincere</hi> those things which it
comprehends. He questions whence <hi>vincere</hi> is derived? We say,
<hi>à vi:</hi> He asks, whence <hi>vis?</hi> We give this reason, because the
word in its robust and forcible sound agreeth to the thing which
it signifieth. He hath nothing more to demand.</p>

that any thing to the purpose which <hi>Hortensius</hi> calumniates in

them clearly. The same persons hold, that every word is
ambiguous; how then can they explain the ambiguous by the
ambiguous, that were to bring a candle not lighted into the
dark. This is ingeniously and subtlely said, but like that of
<hi>Scaevola</hi> to <hi>Antonius,</hi> you seem to the wise to speak acutely, to
fooles truly: for what else doth <hi>Hortensius</hi> in that place, but by
his ingenuity and facetiousnesse, as an intoxicating cup, bring
darknesse upon the unlearned. For, when they say, every word
is ambiguous, it is understood of single words. Ambiguities are
explain'd by disputation; no man disputeth by single words, none
therefore explaineth ambiguous words by ambiguous words.
And yet seeing that every word is ambiguous, no man can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the ambiguity of words, except by words, but those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned

hath two feet, it doth not follow, that a whole Regiment of

the division of things that are. For those which are good and
bad are different to us, those who are intermediate betwixt good
and bad are indifferent to us. The division therefore ought not to
be so, but rather thus: <hi>Of things that are, some are indifferent, others
different, of the different, some are good, some are ill;</hi> For this division
is like unto that which saith, of men, some are Grecians, others
Barbarians; of Barbarians, some are Aegyptians, some Persians,

some Aegyptians, some Persians, some Indians.</p>
                     <p>Hence it followeth, that<note n="h" place="margin">Sext. Empir. adv. Moral. 10.</note> perfect division hath an universall
power; for he who divideth thus; Of men, some are Grecians,

they are either Grecians or Barbarians, for if there be any man,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51150:357"/>
who is neither Greek nor Barbarian, the division must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
be ill, the universall false. Wherefore when we say, of
things that are, some are good, some ill, some intermediate, it is
as much (according to <hi>Chrysippus</hi>) as this universall: if there be
any things that are, they are either good, or ill, or indifferent.
But this universall is false, if any thing false be subjected to it:
For, if two things be subjected, one good, the other ill; or, one
good, the other indifferent, in this expression of those things
which are, one kinde is good, that is true, but this, these are
good, is false, for they are not good, for one is good, the other
ill. And again, these are ill, is false, for they are not ill, but only
one of them. The like in indifferents; for, it is false that these are
indifferents, as that these are good or ill.</p>

                        <hi>Quality</hi> is the habit of that which is qualitative. <hi>Qualitative</hi>
is taken three waies: First, for whatsoever hath difference, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be motion or habit, and whether hardly or easily separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
In this sence, not only he who is wise, but he who stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out his hand are qualitative. The second signification in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
not motions but habits only, which they define qualita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
that is, which hath a difference endued with habit, as a
wise man, or an armed man. Of these, some are adaequate, to the
measure of their pronunciation and consideration; others not
adaequate. These they omit, those which are adaequate, equall,
and permanent, they call qualitative; as, a Grammarian, and a
wise man; neither of these exceeds, or falls short of his quality.
Likewise a lover of meat, and a lover of wine, being in act such,
as a glutton, and a drunkard, because they make use of those
parts which serve to this end, are so called: so that if any man be
a glutton, he is consequently a lover of meat; but, if he be a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of meat, he is not therefore immediately a glutton; for, being
destitute of those parts which he useth in eating, he wanteth
the act, but not the habit. Quality is adaequated to qualitative
in this last sence.</p>

Thus <hi>habitude</hi> is taken in the latitude of the species, <hi>disposition</hi>
in the chief perfection of the species, and in that which is the

a wand) or not.</p>

The <hi>Relatives</hi> are opposed and distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
from those which are by themselves, and absolute. The
<hi>quodammodotative-relatives</hi> are opposed to those which have a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
as for example, Sweet and Sowre, and whatsoever is of
the like kinde, are relatives; but quodammodotative-relatives, are
as the right side, father, and the like; for, they have a difference,
in that they are characteriz'd by differences, according to some
species. As therefore there is one notion of those which are by
themselves, and absolute, another of those which are conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with difference: so some things are relatives; others quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammodotative-relatives.
The consequence of conjunctions in
these is contrary; for, with those which are by themselves, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exist
those which have a difference; for, those which are by
themselves have some differences, as white and black. But, those
which are by themselves, coexist not with those which have a
difference. Sweet and bitter have differences, whereby they are
characterized; yet, they are not absolute, but relatives. But,
those which are quodammodotative-relatives, being contrary to
those which have differences, are likewise relatives. For, the
right side, and a Father, besides that they are quodammodota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
are likewise relatives: but, sweet and bitter being rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
have a difference, whereby they are contrary, being quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammodotative
relatives. Those which are quodammodotative
relatives, it is impossible should be by themselves, and absolute,
or by difference; for they depend solely upon relative habit.
Relatives therefore are not by themselves, for they are not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute;
yet, are they according to difference, because they are
distinguished by some character. To expresse this more clearly,
Relatives are those, which by their proper character respect an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
quodammodotative-relatives are those which use to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to another, but not without mutation and alteration of
those things which are about them; yet, with respect of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
externall. If therefore any thing with difference respect
another, it is only relative, as, habit, science, and sence: but, if
it respect another, not out of inherent difference, but in pure ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
it is quodammodotative-relative. For, a Father, and right
side, to their consistence, require some externall things, for as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51150:362"/>
much as there being no mutation made in them, he is no longer
a Father, his Son being dead, and the right side is no longer so,
after he is risen, in respect of whom it was said to be such; but,
sweet and bitter will not alter, unlesse their power be likewise
changed. If therefore quodammodotative are changed in habit
to another, although they receive no passion in themselves, it is
manifest they have their being in the habit alone, not in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>

                        <note n="i" place="margin">Laert.</note> A <hi>conjunct</hi> axiom is that, which is knit together by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions

thereof are these: That is a <hi>right</hi> conjunction wherein all things
are true; as <hi>it is day, and it is light.</hi> That is <hi>false,</hi> which hath
something false. An axiom which hath neither conjunction nor
disjunction, is to be taken in the sense of the speaker; for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
is sometimes taken for disjunction; as, to me, and my

                     <p>A <hi>disjunct</hi> axiom is that which is disjoyned,<note place="margin">Laert.</note> by a disjunctive

                     <p>All things that are disjoyned,<note place="margin">Agell. 16. 8.</note> are repugnant to one another,

are disjoyned, one must be true, the rest false, otherwise nothing
at all is true, or all, or more then one are true, either those
which are disjunct, will not be repugnant, or those which are

which the opposites are not contrary; either thou runnest, or
walkest, or standest, for they are repugnant to one another, but
their opposites are not repugnant, because not to walk, and not
to stand, and not to run, are not contrary in themselves; for,
those things are said to be contrary, which cannot be true to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
But you may at the same time neither walk, nor run,

because, as because it is day, 'tis light; for the first is, as it
were cause of the second. The rules thereof are these: A causall
conjunction is <hi>true,</hi> when beginning from true, it endeth in the
consequent, and cannot have the antecedent for its consequent;
as because it is day, 'tis light: but this axiom, it is light, doth not
follow from the other, it is day.</p>

A <hi>false</hi> causall is that which either beginneth from false, or

                     <p>An Axiom <hi>declarative of the morel,</hi> is that which is construed

to Vertue will be not Vertue, and to Vice not Vice, and under
not Vertue will be included many other things beside vice, even,
a stone, a horse, and whatsover is beside Vertue; under not vice,
will be found Vertue and all other things. Thus all things would
be adverse to one, and the same the adverse to Vertue and Vice.
Moreover if Vertue were not adverse to Vice, but to not-vice,
the intermediate will be adverse both to good and bad, which is
absurd.</p>
                     <p>The rules of contraries are these. 1.<note n="*" place="margin">Simplic.</note> Contrariety is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
in acts, habits, and the like. 2. Categorems and qualitatives
are called as it were contrary. Prudently and imprudently in
some manner lead to things contrary, but contraries absolutely
are in things: and prudence is so immediately contrary to impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
not this to that:</p>
                     <p>Contraries are either <hi>distunctive</hi> or <hi>sul disjunctive, disjunctive</hi> as
when wee say, <hi>it is either day or night. Sul disjunctive</hi> are of two
kinds, either <hi>in whole,</hi> betwixt universalls, as <hi>every living creature

<hi>in part,</hi> betwixt particulars; <hi>as he either sitteth or walketh; he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

The rules of contraries are these; of Disjunctives one being
asserted, the other is necessarily taken away; one being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
the other is necessarily asserted.</p>
                     <p>Of subdisjunctives in whole, both cannot be true, both may be

                     <p>Of subdisjunctives in part, both may be true, because they are

time be true that he shall be dead; but this Axiom, <hi>he is dead,</hi> is
impossible: for <hi>Dion</hi> being dead, the Axiom likewise is abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that <hi>he is dead,</hi> seeing he is no longer that man, capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        <note n="a" place="margin">Laert. Sext. Empir.</note> OF <hi>Reasons</hi> there are two kinds, <hi>conclusive,</hi> and <hi>not-conclusive.
Conclusive</hi> reasons are those, in which the <hi>Sumptions</hi> being
granted, from the concession thereof, the <hi>Inference</hi> seemeth to
follow.</p>
                     <p>Conclusive reasons, in respect of their matter, are of two
kinds, <hi>true</hi> and <hi>false. True</hi> are those, which from true sumptions
collect a true inference. <hi>Not-true</hi> the contrary.</p>
                     <p>The Lawes and rules of true and false reasons, are these:
1. Truth is consequent to truth: as, If it is day, it is light.
2. False is consequent to false: as, If it be false that it is night,
it is likewise false that it is dark. 3. False is consequent to true:
as, Earth, if it flies is earth. 4. False is not consequent to true:
for, because it is earth, it is not therefore consequent that it flies.</p>
                     <p>Again, of true reasons, some are <hi>demonstrati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>e,</hi> others <hi>not-demonstrative.</hi>
A <hi>demonstrative</hi> reason is that, which by things that
are certain, or perspicuous, collecteth that which is uncertain
and lesse perspicuous: as, <hi>If sweat issue through the skin, we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
pores; but sweat issues through the skin, therefore we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
pores.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Not-demonstrative</hi> are contrary: as, <hi>If it is day, it is light; but it is
day, therefore it is light.</hi> Herein the inference, <hi>it is light,</hi> is certain.</p>

which either cannot be more concluded, or whereof one or

                     <p>Syllogismes (by which the Stoicks understand only the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall,

pertains to the first and second moods. In the first it is called
from Position of the antecedent, to Position of the consequent; in
the second, from negation of the antecedent, to negation of the
consequent. The Lawes concerning the truth, or falshood of
these Syllogismes are the same with those of connex axioms.</p>

<hi>Chrysippus</hi> conceives to be so great, that even dogs have knowledge
thereof. For coming to a place where there are three waies, if by
the sent they find that the Beast hath not gone in two of them,
they run directly to the third without senting, as if they argued
thus, the Beast went either this way, or that way, or that way,

being from the beginning proper to it by nature, as <hi>Chrysippus</hi>
in his first Book of Ends, who affirmes that the care of our selves,
and consciousnesse thereof, is the first property of all living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
For, Nature producing a living Creature, intended either
to alienate it from it self, or to commend unto its own care; but
the first is not likely; it followeth therefore, that Nature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
to every thing the preservation of it selfe, whereby it
repulseth whatsoever is hurtfull, and pursueth what is
convenient.</p>

of it self and its own state, and to the election of such things
as may preserve its state, but alienated from destruction, and
from all such things as may destroy it. This is manifest in as much
as before the accession of pleasure or grief, young creatures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
those things which conduce to their wellfare, and refuse
the contrary, which would not be, if they did not love their own
state, and fear destruction. Neither could they desire any thing
without having some sense of themselves, whereby they love
themselves, and what belongs to them. Hence it is manifest, that
the principle of this love is derived from themselves.</p>

                        <note n="c" place="margin">Laert.</note> Whereas some must hold the first appetite of a living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

which manner living creatures are exhilarated, and plants
sprout forth. Nature hath thus far made no difference betwixt
plants and living creatures, that whereas plants are ordered
without appetite or sense, there is in living creatures, something
according to the nature of plants: But, there being over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

those things that are proper for them, the naturall part in them

These comprehensions we conceive fit to be acquired for their
own sake, because they have in themselves something, as it were,
complex, including Truth. This is discernable in young ones,
whom we see delighted, though it nothing concernes them, if
they themselves finde out any thing by reason. Even the Arts
we conceive to be assumed for themselves, aswell because in
these there is something worthy assumption, as because they
consist of knowledge, and contain somethings constituted by

things which are according to nature being expetible in
themselves, their contraries avoidable in themselves, the first
office is to conserve it selfe in the state of nature, the next, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
those things which are according to nature.</p>
                     <p>Here beginneth good to be first understood, for it is the first
conciliation of man to things according to nature. This Good,
as soon as man receiveth intelligence or notion thereof, and seeth
the order and concord of Offices, he esteemeth far above those
things which he formerly loved, and by rationall knowledge
collecteth, that herein is placed the chief good of man, laudable
and expetible in it selfe. To this chiefe good, which consisteth in
homologie or convenience, all honest actions having reference,
honesty it selfe, which is reckoned amongst the good, though it
rise afterward, is notwithstanding alone expetible in its own
power and dignity. But, of those which are the first objects of
nature, none is expetible in it selfe.</p>
                     <p>Now whereas offices proceed from the first naturall objects,
they must necessarily be referred to the same; so as all Offices
tend to the fulfilling of the first naturall appetites; yet, not so,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51150:373"/>
as if therein consisted the ultimate good. Honest action is in the
first conciliation of nature, for it is consequent, and ariseth as
we said afterward; yet, it is according to nature, and much
more allective then all that go before it.</p>
                     <p>And seeing that all offices proceed from the first naturall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,
even wisdome it selfe must be derived from thence like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
But as it often happens, that he who is recommended to
another, more esteemeth him to whom he is recommended, then
the person which recommended him: so it is not strange, that we
being recommended to wisdome by the first naturall appetite,
afterwards more esteem that wisdome, then those things
whereby we arrived at it. And as our limbs are given to us for
a certain reason of living, so the appetition of the soul is given,
not for every kinde of life, but for one certain form of living; so
likewise reason and perfect reason. For, as action is proper to a
Player, motion to a Dancer; yet, not any, but one certain kinde:
so the life that is to be acted, is in one certain kinde, not in any,
which kinde we call convenient and consentaneous. Wisdome
is not like the art of a Pilot, or a Physician; but rather to that
Action we mentioned, and to Dancing, that the extream, that
is, the effection of the Art be in the Art it selfe, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecall.
There is another similitude betwixt Wisdome and
these Arts, for in them are those things which are done rightly;
yet, are not all the parts whereof they consist contained therein.
Things done rightly, or Rectitudes, contain all numbers of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
for, only wisdome is wholly converted into it selfe, which
is not in other Arts. But, improperly is the Art of a Pilot and a
Physician, compared with the ultimate of Wisdome: For, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
includeth Fortitude and Justice, and judgeth all things
that happen to man to be below it, which happen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

unlesse he affirm, there is nothing that is different, but
honest and dishonest.</p>

being a quodammodotative Hegemonick, and vertuous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

being an operation according to vertue, is plainly profit.
A vertuous man and a friend is not different from profit; for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
is a part of Vertuous, as being the Hegemoniack thereof.
Now the wholes are neither the same with their parts, for a man
is not a hand, nor different from their parts, for they subsist not
without parts; wherefore the whole is not different from its
parts, and consequently, a vertuous man being the whole, in
respect of his Hegemoniack, which is profit, is not different from
profit.</p>

                        <hi>Good</hi> is by some defined that which is expetible in it selfe;

comparison with other things, but by its proper power. For as
Hony, though it be most sweet, yet, in its proper kinde of tast,
not comparative to any other, we perceive it to be sweet: So
this good of which we speak, is that which is most to be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but that estimation consisteth in the kinde, not the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
For, estimation being neither amongst the good nor ill,
whatsoever you apply it to, it will remain in its kinde. Different
therefore is the proper estimation of vertue, which consisteth in
the kinde, not in increase.</p>

                        <note n="p" place="margin">Cic. de sin. 3.</note> That what is honest only is good, is proved thus. Whatsoever
is good is laudable, whatsoever is laudable is honest; therefore
whatsoever is good is honest. Again, there is no good which is
not expetible, nothing expetible which is not pleasant and amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
therefore approveable, therefore laudable, therefore honest.
Again, no man can glory in a life that is miserable or not happy,
therefore to glory is proper to the happy, but to glory relateth
onely to that which is honest, therefore honest life is happy.
And as he who is laudable, hath some eminent mark of renown &amp;
glory, for which he is justly stiled happy, the same may be said of
the life of such a man, whence if a happy life consist in honesty,
only that which is honest is to be esteemed good. Moreover, what
man can be termed constant, firm, magnanimous, unlesse wee
grant that paine is not an ill? For, hee who reckoneth death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Ills cannot but fear it; so no man in any thing can
neglect and contemn that which he accounteth ill. This being
granted, the next assumption is this, he who is magnanimous and
valiant, despiseth, as if they were nothing, all things that can
arrive to man, whence it followeth, that nothing is ill which is
not dishonest, and this sublime, excellent magnanimous person, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
all humane things below him, confideth in himself and
his own life past and future, knowing that no ill can happen to a
wise man. Whereby wee see that what is honest only is good,
which is to live happily and honestly.</p>

who is, or ever was so fervently covetous, and of such disordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
affections, that the same things, for the attainment whereof
he would perpetrate any wickednesse, he had not much attain'd
unto (setting aside all punishment) without all that wicked
means? What advantage or fruit do we aim at, in desiring to
know those things which are hidden from us, how they are
moved, and by what causes agitated in heaven? Who is so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage,
so obdurate to naturall studies, that he abhorres things
worthy knowledge, receives them without pleasure or some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
and values them at nothing? Who is there, that when he
heareth of the actions, speeches, counsels of magnanimous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
eminent in all vertue, is not affected with any pleasure?
Who is there, that being instituted in an honest family, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously
educated, is not offended at dishonesty, though it
bring no hurt to him? Who is there, that lookes without trouble
upon such as live impurely and flagitiously? Who doth not
hate fordid, vain, light, frivolous persons? If dishonesty were
not in it selfe avoidable, why should men, when they are in

them? Nothing therefore is more clear, then that honest
things are expetible in themselves, and dishonest things avoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in themselves.</p>
                     <p>Hence it followeth, that what is honest, is more estimable
then those mean things which accrue by it. And when we say,
that folly, temerity, injustice, and intemperance are avoidable,
in respect of those things which are consequent to them, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts
not the former assertion, that what is dishonest only is

happy life. Those holding pain to be an ill, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
that a wise man cannot be happy upon the rack. These,
who account not pains among the ills, hold, that a wise man
continueth happy in the midst of torments: For, if some bear
those pains with greater courage for their Country, or some
lighter cause, opinion, not nature increaseth or diminisheth the
power of the pain. Again, the Peripateticks asserting three kinds
of good, affirm a man to be so much the more happy, the fuller
he is of externall corporeall goods; or, in the Stoicks expression,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51150:376"/>
he who hath most corporeall estimables, is most happy, for as
much as by them, Beatitude is compleated. On the contrary,
the Stoicks hold, that those goods which they call of nature,
make not by their frequency a life more happy, or are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible,
or more estimable: For then wisdome being expetible,
and health expetible, both together would be more expetible
then wisdome alone; whereas either being worthy estimation,
both are not more worthy of estimation then wisdome alone.
For the Stoicks, who hold health to be estimable, but place it
not amongst the goods, hold likewise, that no estimation is to be
preferred before vertue. From this, the Peripateticks dissent,
asserting, that an honest action without pain, is more expetible,
then the same action with pain; the Stoicks otherwise. For, as a
Taper is darkened by the light of the Sun, and as a drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is lost in the vastnesse of the Aegean Sea, and as in the riches
of <hi>Croesus</hi> the accession of one farthing, and one step in the way
between this and <hi>India;</hi> so in that end of all good which the
Stoicks assert, all the estimation of corporeall things must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
be obscured, overwhelmed, and perish, by the splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
and magnitude of vertue. And as opportunity <gap reason="foreign">

and the good it selfe placed in it, that it be conformable to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
admitteth no accession of encrease. For as that opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
to those of which we speak, are not made greater by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of time, for which reason the Stoicks conceive, that
a happy life is not more to be desired, if it be long, then if it
be short; and they use this simile: As it is the praise of a shoe
to fit the foot, neither are many shoes preferred before two,
nor the greater before the lesse: So in those things, whose
good is confined to opportunity and convenience, neither
are the more to be preferred before the fewer, nor the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
before the shorter. Nor do they argue acutely, who say,
if long health be more to be esteemed then short, then likewise
a long use of wisdome, more then a short; they understand
not, that the estimation of health is judged by space, that of
vertue by opportunity; as if they should say likewise, a good
death, or a good labour to a woman in travell, is better long
then short: So that they see not, that some things are more
esteemed for their shortnesse, others for their length.</p>

fervour and concitation of the minde is inveterate, and, as it

infirmities and diseases. These differ only intentionally, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
are the same, arising from desire and pleasure; for, when
mony is desired, and reason not immediately apply'd, as a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratick
medicine, to cure that desire, the evill spreadeth through
the veines, and cleaveth to the bowells, and becommeth sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and infirmity, which when they grow inveterate, cannot
be plucked away. The name of this sicknesse is avarice. In like

                        </gap>, hatred
of mankinde, inhospitality, all which are infirmities of the
minde, arising from fear of those things which they flie and
shun.</p>
                     <p>Infirmity of minde is defined, a vehement opinion, inherent,
and wholly implanted in us, of a thing not to be desired, as if it
were exceedingly to be desired. That which ariseth from aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
is defined a vehement opinion, inherent, and throughly
implanted in us, of a thing that ought not to be shunn'd, as if it
ought to be shunned. This opinion is a judging our selves to
know what we have not.</p>
                     <p>Under <hi>Infirmity</hi> are these species, <hi>Love of mony, of honour, of

                     <p>Aversions are defined thus, Inhospitality is a vehement opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,

                     <p>As some are more prone to one sicknesse then to another; so
are some more inclinable to fear, others, to other passions; in

another to be angry, as anxiety differs from griefe; for all are not
anxious who are sometimes grieved, nor are all that are anxious
grieved alwaies: as there is a difference betwixt ebriety and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briosity,
and it is one thing to be a lover, another to be amorous.</p>
                     <p>This propensity of severall persons to severall sicknesses, is
called, from an analogy to the body, Infirmity, whereby is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
a propensity to be sick: but in good things, because some
are more apt to some goods then to others, it is stiled Facility,
in ill things Proclivity, implying a lapsion; in neuters it hath

As there is sicknesse, infirmity, and defect in the body, so in
the minde. Sicknesse is the corruption of the whole body. Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
is sicknesse with some weaknesse. Defect is, when the parts
of the body disagree with one another, whence ariseth pravity,
distortion, deformity of the limbs; so that those two, sicknesse
and infirmity, arise from the confusion and trouble of the health
of the whole body; defect is seen in perfect health. But, in the
minde, sicknesse is not distinguish'd from infirmity, but by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation
only.</p>
                     <p>Vitiosity is a habit or affection, inconstant in it selfe, and oft
differing in the whole course of life; so that in one by corruption
of opinions, is bred sicknesse and infirmity; in the other, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
and repugnance. For, every vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e hath not disagreeing
parts, as of them who are not far from wisdome, that affection
is different from it selfe, as being unwise, but not distorted
nor depraved.</p>
                     <p>Sicknesses and infirmities are parts of vitiosity; but, whether
passions are parts thereof also, it is a question. For vices are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
affections, passions are moving affections, so that they
cannot be parts of permanent affections.</p>
                     <p>And as in all things the Soul resembleth the Body, so in good
likewise. In the body, the chie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>est are beauty, strength, health,
foundnesse, agility; so likewise in the minde. And as the good
temper of the body is, when those things whereof we consist a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
well among themselves: so the health of the Soule is, when
the judgments and opinions thereof agree. This is the vertue of
the Soul, which some affirm to be Temperance; others, a Soule
obedient to the precepts of Temperance, and obsequious there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
not having any speciousnesse of her own. But, whether one
or other, it is only in a wiseman; yet, there is one kinde of health
of the soul, which is common also to the unwise, when by the
care of Physicians, the distemper of the minde is removed.</p>
                     <p>And as there is in the body an apt figure of the limbs, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a sweetnesse of colour, which is called Beauty; so in
the soule, equality, and constancy of opinions, and judgments fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
vertue, with a certain firmnesse and stability; or, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the very power of vertue, is called Beauty.</p>
                     <p>Likewise, correspondent to the powers, nerves, and efficacity
of the body, in the same termes are named the powers of the
Soul. Agility of body is called quicknesse, the same commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is ascribed to wit, in respect, that the Soul overrunneth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things in a short time.</p>
                     <p>Only there is this difference betwixt Soules and bodies:
Strong soules cannot be assaulted by diseases, strong bodies may<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
but, the offensions of bodies may happen without any fault,
those of the Soule cannot, all whose sicknesses and passions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from contempt of reason, and therefore are in men only;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51150:380"/>
for, though beasts do somethings like this, yet, they fall not into
passions.</p>
                     <p>Betwixt acute and obtuse persons, there is this difference, the
ingenious, as Corinthian Brasse rusteth, slowly falling into sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and more quickly got out of it: the dull do not so, neither
doth the soul of an ingenious person fall into every sicknesse and
passion; for, there are not many things extreamly savage and
cruell, and some also have a shew of humanity, as compassion,
griefe, fear.</p>
                     <p>But, the infirmities and sicknesses of the minde are lesse easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rooted out, then those great vices which are contrary to the
vertues; for, the sicknesses remaining, the vices may be taken
away, because the sicknesses are no sooner healed, then the
vices are removed.</p>

Whence <hi>Panaetius</hi> saith, it is in vertue as in many Archers,
who shoot at one mark distinguished by divers colours: every

convenient to nature. Every vertue is able to make a man live
convenient to nature: for, man hath naturall inclinations for
the finding out of Offices, for the composure of Appetites, for
tolerance and distribution. Vertue therefore is selfe-sufficient

he, magnanimity, as conceiving all things to be below it selfe, is
selfe-sufficient, and that be a part of vertue, vertue it selfe,
which despiseth all things that obstruct her, must also be selfe-sufficient

vertue is selfe-sufficient, affirming, that it requireth the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

throw a spear or an arrow at any thing, he must do all things
that he may take his aim aright, and yet so, as to do all things

to nature. Secondly, to live, preserving all, or the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

for that is a Rectitude, proper only to a wise man, this is
the office of a progressive, not perfect person, which may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be to the foolish. The third is, to live in enjoyment of all,
or the greater part of those things which are according to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
This is not constituted in our action, for it consisteth of that

                     <p>Good and ill, as we said, are these things which are honest or

Vertue; To hurt is a motion or state proceeding from Vice;
but Indifferents neither profit nor hurt, such are life,
health, pleasure, Beauty, Strength, riches, honour, Nobility, and
their contraries; death, sicknesse, grief, deformity, imbecillity,
poverty, dishonour, meannesse and the like. Thus <hi>Hecaton</hi> in his

These therefore are not goods, but indifferents. For, as the
property of Heat is to warm, not to cool, so is it of good to
profit, not to hurt. But health and wealth doe not hurt more then
they profit, therefore health and wealth are not goods. Again,
that which we may use ill as well as well, is not good; but
health and wealth may be used ill as well as well, therefore
health and wealth are not goods. Yet <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

should be numbred amongst the good, but if wisdom be good, it
followeth not that riches likewise be good, nor that any thing
which is not reckoned amongst the good, not that which is good
can be contained by any thing which is not amongst the good.

two pieces of Silver of equall value, no way different, which to
him who comes to make choice of either, are indifferent. There
is an appetition to the election of one, but not more of this then
of that. The third kind of indifferents are those which are neither

dignity, but those who are in some honour, next and second to
him in rank: so when we speak of life, we call not those things
which are in the first place, the preferred or promoted, but those
which are in the second: and so likewise in the rejected. Now
forasmuch as good hath the first place, it followes, that what is
preferred, is neither good nor ill. [No good is reckoned amongst
the preferred, because that hath the greatest estimation; but the
preferred having the second estimation, approacheth somewhat
to the nature of good. It is called preferred, not that it condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
to Beatitude, but in respect of the rejected.] We define it
thus: <hi>an Indifferent with mean estimation;</hi> for it could not be, that
nothing should be left in mean things, that is according to, or
contrary to nature, neither being left, that nothing should be
placed in them, which is sufficiently estimable, this being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51150:384"/>
that there is not somthing preferred. Rightly therefore this
distinction is made, and may more fully be explained by this
smile. As if we should suppose our ultimate end, to be so to cast
the dy that it may chance right, the dy that shall be so to cast as
to fall right, must have some thing preposed and preferred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
its end; and on the other side the contrary, yet the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the dy, nothing conduceth to that end; to those which
are preferred, relate indeed to the end, but nothing pertain to
the power and nature thereof.</p>

their contraries; for, there is something in this approvable, so
as a right reason may be given for it, as done approvably. That
which is so done is office. And forasmuch as in those things
which are neither vertues nor vices, there is somthing which may
be of use, it is not to be taken away. Again, it is manifest, that
a wise man doth something in these mean things; he therefore,
when he doth it, judgeth that it is his office so to do; but, a wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is never deceived in judgment, therefore there is an office
in mean things. Again, we see there is something which we call
a thing rightly done, or a Rectitude, but that is a perfect office;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51150:385"/>
therefore there is an inchoat office; as, if it be a Rectitude <hi>justly</hi>
to restore a depositum, to restore a depositum must be a simple
restitution without the additionall terme, is an office.</p>

                        <note n="d" place="margin">Cic. de finib. 3.</note> And since it is not to be doubted, but that in mean things,
some are to be performed, others rejected, whatsoever is done in
that manner, is comprehended in common office, whence it is
manifest, that all men by nature lov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ng themselves, as well the
foolish as the wise, will take those things which are according

office of the wise and unwise, conversant in mean things.</p>
                     <p>All offices proceeding from these, it is justly said, that to these
are referred all our thoughts, even the forsaking of life, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
in it. In whom most things are according to nature,
the office of that person is to remain in life, in whom there are,
or are foreseen to be more things contrary to nature, his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
is to forsake life, although he be happy, and of a fool to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ll, as we have often said, are things that follow afterwards. The
first principles of naturall appetite, fall under the judgement
and election of a wise man, and is as it were the matter subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to wisdome. Thus the reason of continuing in life, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
it, is to be measured by all those things we mentioned.
For, neither are they who enjoy vertue, obliged to continue in
life, nor they who live without vertue to die, and it is often the
office of a wise man, to part with his life, even when he is most
happy, if it may be done opportunely, which is to live conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
to nature. This they hold, that to live happily, depends on
opportunity; for wisdome commandeth, that a wise man, if it
be required, should part with his life. Wherefore vice not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
power to bring a cause of voluntary death, it is manifest,
that the office even of fooles, who are likewise wretched, is to
continue in life, if they are in the greater part of those things,
which we hold to be according to nature. And forasmuch as
going out of life and continuing in it be alike miserable, neither
doth continuance make his life more to be avoided. We say not
therefore without cause, that they who enjoy most naturalls,
should continue in life.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto it appertaines to know, that the love of Parents to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their Children is the effect of nature, from which begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
we may track all mankinde, as proceeding from thence.
First, by the figure and parts of the body, which declare, that
nature carefully provided for procreation. Neither can these
two agree, that nature orders procreation, and takes no care
that those which are procreated should be loved: For even in
beasts the power of nature may be seen, whose care when we
behold in bringing up of their young, me thinks we hear the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51150:386"/>
very voice of nature her selfe. Wherefore as it is manifest, that
we abhor pain by nature, so it is likewise apparent, that we a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Hence ariseth a common naturall commendation of men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men, that it behooveth a man not to seem alienate from
man, for this very reason, because he is man. For, as among the
parts of the body, some are made only for themselves, as the
eyes and ears; others assist towards the use of the other parts, as
the thighes and hands: so though some huge beasts are born only
for themselves; yet, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as also Ants, Bees, Storks, do something for the sake of
others. Much neerer is the conjunction of mankinde, so that we
are inclined by nature to Conventions, Counsells, Cities.</p>

                        <note n="e" place="margin">Cic. offic. 1.</note> Whatsoever is produced upon the earth, is created for
the use of man; but, men are generated for men that they may
profit one another. In this we ought to follow nature our
leader, and to bring forth common benefit to the publick, by
mutuall offices, by giving, by receiving, by arts, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
and by faculties, to unite the society of man with
man.</p>

                        <note n="f" place="margin">Cic. de sin. 3.</note> The world is governed by the power of God; it is as it were,
a common City of men and Gods, and each of us is a part of
the world, whence it followeth by nature, that we should
prefer the common benefit before our own. For as Lawes
prefer the safety of the generall before that of any particular;
so a good and wise man conformable to Law, not ignorant
of civill office, taketh more care for the benefit of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
then of any particular, or of his own. Nor is he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traies
his Country more to be condemned, then he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
the common benefit or safety. Whence it followeth,
that he is to be commended who undergoeth death for the
Common-wealth, and teacheth us, that our Country is dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to us then our selves. And because that speech is esteemed
inhuman and wicked of those who affirm, they care not when
they are dead if all the earth were set on fire; it is certainly
true, that we are likewise to provide for those who shall hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be, even for their own sake. From this affection of the soul,
whence proceed Wills and commendations of dying persons, as
also, forasmuch as no man will live solitary in a desart, even
with the greatest abundance or plenty, it is easily understood,
that we are born for conjunction, congregation, or naturall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,
we are impelled by nature to benefit others the most that
we can. All these are offices, chiefly by teaching and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
the reasons of prudence, so that it is not easie to finde one,
who will not communicate to some other what he knoweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.

Thus we are not only inclined to learn, but also to teach.

and neglected amongst our selves, that we should be dear to the
immortall Gods, and loved of them. As therefore wee make use
of our limbs, before that we have learnt for what cause of utility
we have them, so are we conjoined and consociated amongst
our selves by Nature to civill community, which if it were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
neither would there be any room for Justice or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                     <p>Yet though there are mutuall Chains betwixt man and man,

things saith <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> were made for men and the Gods, but
they for community and society one with another, so that men
may make use of Beasts for their benefit without doing any
wrong.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, since the nature of man is such, that there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
civill right betwixt him and all mankind, he who preserveth
that right, is just, who transgresseth it, unjust. But as in a Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
though it be common, that room which a man possesseth, is
justly said to be his place; so this civill right in a City and the

                     <p>Herein Friendship is requisite, as being one of those things
which benefit. Some affirm, that a good man ought to be as much
concern'd for his friend as for himself; others, that every man
ought to be most concern'd for himself. Yet these latter confesse,
that it is contrary to Justice, whereunto we are born, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
any thing from another, and assume it to our selves.</p>
                     <p>Neither can friendship be contracted, nor Justice performed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51150:387"/>
for private respects and advantages, for then these advantages
might overthrow and pervert them. But neither could Justice or
friendship be at all, unlesse they were expetible in themselves.
Justice is by Nature; it is contrary to a wise man, not only to do
an injury, but even to hurt. Neither can it be right to injure those
who are our friends, or have deserved well of us; Equity cannot
be separated from Utility; whatsoever is equall and just, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
honest, and reciprocally; whatsoever is honest, is equal and

is made, they are rendred unlike. That they are equall is evident

one falshood more falshood then another, neither is one deceit
more deceit then another, nor one sin more sin then another. He

impious, because he doth all things according to Vice, as the good
according to Vertue; and he who hath one vice hath all. He is an
Enemy to the Gods, for emnity is the discord of life, as amity is
the concord. The wicked differs from the Gods in his course of
life, and therefore is an Enemy to them, for they account all their
Enemies who are contrary to them. The wicked are contrary
to the good, God is good, therefore the wicked are Enemies to

wide, to so vast a world; and such is its touch, that it not onely
warmeth, but oftentimes burneth, neither of which it would do
if it were not fiery.</p>
                     <p>Now (saith he) the Sun being fiery, is either like that fire
which is requisite to the use of life, or unto that which is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

in the bodies of living creatures; but this our fire, which

he, there's no question to which of these fires the Sun is like,
for he causeth all things to flourish and sprout up, according
to their severall kinds: Wherefore the fire of the Sun being like
those fires which are in the bodies of living creatures, the Sun
must be a living creature also, and so must be likewise the rest
of the Starres in the celestiall fire, which is called Aether or
Heaven.</p>

                        <note n="*" place="margin">Cic. nat. deor. 2.</note> For seeing that of living creatures, one kinde is generated in
the earth, other kinds in the water, others in the aire, it were
absurd to think, that in that part which is most apt for generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of living creatures, no living creature is generated. The
Starrs possesse the Aether, which being most rare, and in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
agitation and vigour, it is necessary the living creature
that is generated in it be endued with most acute sense, quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
mobility. The starrs therefore have sense and intelligence,
whence it followeth, that they are to be reputed Gods. For we
say, that they who live in the purest aire are much more acute
and understanding, then those who live in a thick climate: The
diet likewise is thought to conduce not a little to the sharpening
of the understanding. Whence it is probable, the starrs are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with most excellent understanding, forasmuch as they
dwell in the aetheriall part of the world, and are nourished with
exhalations from the Sea and Earth, extenuated by a long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
                     <p>The sense and intellect of the Starrs is chiefly manifest from
their order and constancy, for nothing can be moved by propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and number without providence, in which nothing is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merarious,
nothing various, nothing casuall. But the order of
Starrs, and constancy throughout all eternity, cometh neither
from Nature, for that is void of Reason, nor from Fortune,
which affecteth variety, and disalloweth constancy.</p>
                     <p>Again, all things are moved either naturally, or violently, or
voluntarily. Those which move naturally, are carried either by
their weight downward, or by their lightnesse upwards, neither
of which is proper to the Starres, for their motion is circular.
Neither can it be said, that they are moved violently against
their own nature; for what power can be greater? it remaineth
therefore, that their motion be voluntary.</p>

from it selfe, or a spirit moving it selfe backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
He calleth it spirit, as being moved aire, answering in
some proportion to the Aether, so that it both meets in one; and
this motion is only according to those who think, that all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
receiveth mutation, solution, composition, and the like.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Composition, mixtion, temperament,</hi> and <hi>confusion</hi> are different.
Composition is a contract of bodies, whose superficies are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous
to one another, as in heaps of grain or sand. Mixtion is
of two or more bodies, whose qualities are diffused through the
whole, as we see in fire, and red hot iron, and in our own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oules;
for every where there is a diffusion through entire bodies, so as
one body doth passe through another. Temperament is of two
or more humid bodies, whose qualities are diffused through the
whole. Mixtion is also common to drie bodies, as to fire and
iron, to the soul and the body, temperament only to the humid.
For qualities appear from the temperament of severall humid
things, as of wine, honey, water, vinegar, and the like; that in
such temperament, the qualities of the things tempered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
is evident from this, that oftentimes they are by some
art separated from one another. For, if we put a spunge dipped
in oyle into wine mixt with water, the water, separating it selfe
from the wine, will gather to the spunge. Lastly, confusion is
the transmutation of two or more qualities into another of a
different nature, as in composition of Unguents and Medicines.</p>

                        <hi>POssidonius</hi> asserteth foure species of generation and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of things that are into things that are (for that of things
that are not, and of things that are not he rejected, conceiving
there is none such.) Of transmutations into things that are, one
is by division, another by alteration, a third by confusion, a
fourth of the whole by resolution. Of these, alteration concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the substance, the other three are of the qualities which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
in the substance. According to these are generations made.
But the substance it selfe is neither augmented nor diminished
by apposition or detraction, but is only altered as happeneth to
numbers and measures. But in things properly qualited, as <hi>Dion</hi>
and <hi>Theon,</hi> there is augmentation and diminution, wherefore
the quality of each remaineth from the generation untill the
corruption thereof, in plants and living creatures which are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of corruption. In things properly qualited, he asserted
two susceptible parts; one, according to the substance, another
according to the quality: This, as we have often said, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
augmentation and diminution. Neither is the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
qualited, and the substance out of which it is, all one, nor
divers, but only, not all one, because the substance is a part, and
occupateth the same place; but things that are divers have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
places, and are not consider'd in part. That as to the thing
properly qualited, and as to the substance, it is not the same,
<hi>Mnesarchus</hi> affirmeth to be evident, because it is necessary, that
to the same happen the same things. For if, for example, a man
having formed a horse, should break it, and make a dog, we
would presently, beholding it, say, this was not before, but it is
now: So are the qualited and the substance divers. Neither is it
likely that we should all be the same as to substance; for it often
happens, that the substance is preexistent to the generation, as
the substance of <hi>Socrates</hi> was, before <hi>Socrates</hi> was; and after the
corruption and death of <hi>Socrates,</hi> the substance remaineth,
though <hi>Socrates</hi> himselfe be not.</p>

receive by the temperature of Heaven, the fertility of the Earth,
and abundance of other benefits. The third from the Terrour of
Thunder, Tempest Rain, Snow, Hail, Devastation, Pestilence,
Earthquakes, and somtimes groanings, showers of stones and
blood, Portents, Prodigies, Comets and the like; with which
men are affrighted into a belief, that there is a heavenly divine
power. The fourth and greatest cause is the aequability of the

which made them, which is better then Man, and what is that

He proceedeth to urge this more strictly: Nothing, saith he,
that is void of minde and reason, can of it selfe generate that
which is animate and rationall; but the world generates ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
and rationall creatures, therefore the world is animate
and rationall.</p>
                     <p>Likewise, according to his custome, he concludeth his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with a similitude: IF out of an Olive-tree should come har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
Pipes, that made Musick, you would not doubt, but
that the science of Musick were in the Olive-tree. What if a
Plain-tree should bear Musicall instruments, you would think
there were musick in those Plain-trees: Why then should we
not judge the world to be animate and wise, that produceth out
of it selfe animate and wise creatures.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing besides the world which wanteth nothing,
and which is perfect and compleat in all its numbers and parts:
for as the cover, saith <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> was made for the shield's sake,
and the scabberd for the swords; so besides the world, all other
things were made for the sake of something else. Fruites of the
earth were made for living creatures, living irrationall creatures
for the use of man, horses for carriage, oxen for tillage, dogs
for hunting and defence; but, man himselfe was made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
and imitate the world. Not that he is at all perfect,
but only a part of that which is perfect. But the world it selfe,
forasmuch as it comprehendeth all things, neither is there any
thing which is not in it, is every way perfect. What therefore
can be wanting to that which is best? But, there is nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the minde and reason, therefore these cannot be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Chrysippus</hi> addeth this comparison: As all things are best in the
most perfect and mature creatures, as in a Horse better then in
a Colt, in a Dog better then in a Whelp, in a Man better then
in a Child: So that which is best in all the world, must be in
that which is perfect and absolute; but, then the world, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more perfect, nothing better then vertue, therefore the
world hath proper vertue. The nature of man is not perfect;
yet, in man there is vertue, how much more then in the world?
The world therefore hath vertue, therefore it is wise, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
God.</p>

                        <note n="d" place="margin">Plut. Pl. Ph. 1. 6.</note> Thus the notion and apprehension men have of God, is,
first, by conceiving the beauty of those things which are obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

were in the beginning constituted, and are in all time ordered.
This disputation they divided into three parts: The first, from the
same reason that teacheth us there are Gods, inferreth, that the
World is ordered by them, seeing that there is nothing higher or
more excellent, then this administration. The second, from that
reason which teacheth us, that all things are subjected to an
understanding nature, and exquisitely ordered by it, inferreth,
that it is generated of animate principles. The third place is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from admiration of celestiall and terrestriall things. Upon
these, <hi>Cicero</hi> discourseth at large, according to the opinion of the
Stoicks.</p>
                     <p>As to the fourth part of the question in generall concerning
the Gods, that they have a particular providentiall care of
man-kinde, it is manifest, in that whatsoever is in this world
was made for the use of man, and is conducible thereunto; and
if for the whole fpecies, they must consequently have the same
care of particulars, which they expresse by many portents, and
all those fignes whereupon the art of <hi>Divination</hi> depends. There
was never any great person without some divine inspiration.
But we must not argue from hence, that if the corn or vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
of any man be hurt by a Tempest, or Fortune deprive him
of any of the conveniencies of life, that he to whom this hath
happened, may be judged to be hated or neglected of God. The
Gods take care of great things, the little they neglect; but to
great persons all things have alwaies a happy issue.</p>

therefore there is no motion without a cause. And if so, then all
things that are done, are done by precedent causes, and if so, all
things are done by Fate. That all axioms are either true or false,

                        <note n="n" place="margin">Cic. de fate.</note> In answer to <hi>the sluggish reason,</hi> if it be your fate to die of
this sicknesse, you shall die whether you have a Physician or no;
and if it be your fate to recover, you shall recover whether you
have a Physitian or not. <hi>Chrysippus</hi> saith, that in things some are
<hi>simple,</hi> some <hi>conjunct.</hi> Simple is thus, <hi>Socrates</hi> shall die on such a
day; for whether he do any thing or not, it is appointed he
should die on such a day. But if it be destin'd thus, <hi>Laius</hi> shall
have a son <hi>Oedipus,</hi> it cannot be said, whether he accompany
with a woman or not, for it is a <hi>conjunct</hi> thing, and <hi>confatall,</hi> as
he termes it, because it is destin'd that <hi>Laius</hi> shall lie with his
wife, and that he shall get <hi>Oedipus</hi> of her. As if we should say,
<hi>Milo</hi> shall wrastle at the Olympick Games, and another should
infer, then he shall wrastle whether he have an adversary or
no, he were mistaken; for that he shall wrastle is a conjunct
thing, because there is no wrastling without an adversary. Thus
are refelled all sophismes of this kinde (you shall recover whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you have a Physician or not) for it is no lesse determined by
fate that you shall have a Physician, than that you shall recover.
They are <hi>confatall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus there being two opinions of the old Philosophers; one,
that all things are so done by Fate, that Fate inferreth a power
of Necessitie, as <hi>Democritus, Heraclitus, Empedocles,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi>
held; the other, that the motions of our souls were voluntary
without any Fate: <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> as an honourable Arbitratour,
took the middle way betwixt these, but inclining most to those
who conceived the motions of our souls free from necessitie.
The Antients, who held all things to be done by Fate, said,
it was by a violence and necessitie; those who were of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
opinion, denyed, that Fate had any thing to do with our
assent, and that there was no necessitie imposed upon assents.
They argued thus: If all things are done by Fate, all things are
done by an antecedent cause, and if appetite, then likewise
those things which follow appetite, therefore assents also. But,
if the cause of appetite is not in us, neither is the appetite it
selfe in our power, and if so, neither those things which are
effected by appetite are in our power, and consequently neither
assents nor actions are in our power; whence it followeth, that
neither praise can be just, nor dispraise, nor honour, nor pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment;
but this is false, therefore all things are not done by
Fate.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Chrysippus</hi> not allowing this necessity, yet maintaining that
nothing happened without precedent causes, distinguisheth thus.
Of Causes, saith he, some are perfect and principall, others as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistant
and immediate. When we say, all things are done by
Fate, from antecedent causes, we understand not the perfect
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51150:403"/>
and principall causes, but the assistent and immediate. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
answers the former objection thus: If all things are done
by Fate, it followeth, that all things be done by antecedent
causes, but not by the principall and perfect, but by the assistent
and immediate, which though they be not in our power, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
not, that the appetite likewise is in our power. This Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
therefore concludes well against those who joyne ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
with Fate, but nothing against those who assert antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
causes not perfect nor principall. What assent is, and how
it commeth to be in our power, we have already shewn in the
<hi>Logick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence it followeth, that<note n="o" place="margin">Agell. 6. 2.</note> notwithstanding that all things are
necessarily coacted and connected by Fate, with a certain prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
reason; yet (saith <hi>Chrysippus</hi>) our mindes are so obnoxious
to Fate, as their property and quality is. For, if at the first by
nature they were formed soundly and profitably, all that power
which commeth upon them extrinsecally from Fate, they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
easily and inoffensively; but, if they are harsh, ignorant, and
rude, not supported by any helps of good art, although they are
pressed by little or no conflict of fatall incommodity, yet by
their own unluckinesse, and voluntary impulsion, they rush into
continuall sins and errours, which thing maketh that this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
and necessary consequence of things, which is called Fate,
be by this reason. For it is. as it were, fatall, and consequent in
its kinde, that wicked minds should not be without sins and
errours, an instance whereof he bringeth not unapposite. As,
saith he, a rolling stone, if you turn it down a steep place, you
first give it the cause and beginning of its precipitation, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
it rolleth headlong of it selfe; not that you make it do
so any longer, but because its figure, and the volubility of its
form is such. In like manner, order, and reason, and necessitie,
moveth the beginnings of causes; but the impetuousnesse of our
thoughts and mindes, and our own actions, are guided by every
mans private will and minde. Thence continueth he, the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoreans say,
<q>Men of their own accord their ills procure.</q>
As conceiving that all ills proceed from themselves, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their own appetites when they sin and offend, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their own minde and signe.</p>
                     <p>For this reason he denyeth, that we ought to suffer and hear
such wicked, or idle, or noxious, or impudent persons, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken in some fault and wickednesse, have recourse to the
necessity of Fate, as to a Sanctuary, affirming that they have done
wickedly, is not to be attributed to their temerity, but to Fate.</p>

of the Stoicks, the motion of it selfe, not of heaven, and

or the measure of swiftnesse and slownesse, one part of it being
present, the other future, the present connected to the future by
something like a point. It is called <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Chrysippus</hi> saith, that Time is the intervall of motion, the
measure of swiftnesse and slownesse; a consequent intervall to
the worlds motion, according to which all things are, and are
moved, unlosse rather there be a two-fold Time, as the Earth
and Sea, and Vacuity and Universe, have the same names with
their parts. And as vacuity is every way infinite, so Time is both
waies infinite, for the present and future have no end. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
asserts, that no entire present is Time, for continuous things
being divided into infinite, Time likewise admitteth of the same
division; so that no Time is properly present, but so called, after
a lesse accurate manner. The present only is subsistent, unlesse it
be understood as of Categorems; as, walking is attributed to
him that walketh, but not to him that sitteth or lyeth. Thus
much for the STOICALL PHILOSOPHY.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hrysippus</hi> was of <hi>Soli,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Laert.</note> (a City of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
called <hi>Pompeiopolis.</hi>) his Father was of
<hi>Tarsis,</hi> named <hi>Apollonius,</hi> or, as <hi>Suidas, Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides,</hi> who came and lived at <hi>Soli,</hi> which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
gave <hi>Laertius,</hi> and from him <hi>Suidas,</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to doubt whether <hi>Chrysippus</hi> himself were
not of <hi>Tarsis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He first exercised in the <hi>Hippodrome. Hecaton</hi> saith, that having
wasted his Patrimony in the Kings service, hee applyed himself
to Philosophy. Coming to <hi>Athens,</hi> he heard, as some affirm <hi>Zeno,</hi>
or rather (as <hi>Diocles</hi> and others) <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> from whom whilst he
was yet alive he dissented. He was an eminent Philosopher, inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
and acute in every thing; so that in most opinions he
differ'd from <hi>Zeno</hi> and <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> to whom he would only say, <hi>tell
me the Doctrines and let me alone for proofes.</hi> If at any time he crossed
<hi>Cleanthes</hi> in dispute, he was afterwards sorry for it, often saying,
<q>
                           <l>Of happinesse in all I am possesses'd,</l>
                           <l>But in <hi>Cleanthes;</hi> there alone unbless'd.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was so famous for <hi>Dialectick,</hi> that it was a common speech,
<hi>If the Gods themselves would use Dialectick, they would make use only of
the Chrysippean.</hi> But he was more plentifull in matter then free in
expression.</p>
                     <p>He was infinitely studious and industrious, as appeareth from
the multitude of his Books. An old woman that waited on him
said, that he wrote every day 500. Paragraphs.</p>
                     <p>When any question'd him in private, he answer'd meekly and
freely; but assoon as any company came, he grew eager and liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
saying,
<q>
                           <l>Brother, there hangs a cloud before your eyes,</l>
                           <l>Cast quite away this madnesse, and be wise.</l>
                        </q>

                        <pb n="131" facs="tcp:51150:407"/>
When he drunk at Feasts he lay very still, only shaked his
legs; whereupon his woman said, <hi>Chrysippus's legs only are drunk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He had so good an opinion of himselfe, that to one who asked
him to whom he should commend his son, he answered, <hi>To me;
for if I knew any better, I would hear Philosophy of him my selfe;</hi>
Whence it was said of him,
<q>
                           <l>
                              <hi>He is inspir'd by</hi> Jove,</l>

                        <note place="margin">Laert.</note>
he studyed Philosophy with them, whence he disputed

swearing truly, and betwixt swearing false and forswearing.
That which is sworn, at the time that it is sworn must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<hi>Axiom:</hi> But he that sweareth, at the same time that he swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
is not necessarily perjur'd, or sweareth true, because the
time is not yet arived that must determine his oath. For as a
man is said to have covenanted truely or falsely, not when the
covenant is made, but when the time whereby it is limited is
come: so a man is said to swear truly or falsely, when the time
comes wherein he promised to make good his oath.</p>

                     <p>The number of all his writings, according to <hi>Laertius,</hi> was
705. He wrote so much, that he had often occasion to treat upon
the same subject, and setting down whatsoever came into his
minde, he often corrected and enlarged it by the testimonies of
others; whence having in one book inserted all <hi>Euripides's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi>
one having the book in his hand, answer'd another that
asked him what book it was, It is <hi>Chrysippus's Medea.</hi> And <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodorus</hi>
the Athenian, in his collection <hi>of Doctrines,</hi> asserting, that
<hi>Epicurus</hi> had written many books upon his own strength, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
using the testimonies of others, and that he therein far excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Chrysippus,</hi> addes these words; <hi>For if a man should take out of</hi>
Chrysippus's <hi>writings all that belongs to other men, he would leave the
paper blank.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Seneca</hi> gives this censure of him:<note n="q" place="margin">De Benef. 1. 3.</note> He is most subtle and acute,
penetrating into the depth of truth. He speaks to the thing that is
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51150:412"/>
to be done, and useth no more words then are necessary to the
understanding thereof; but addes, that his<note n="r" place="margin">Sen de Benef. 1. 4.</note> acutenesse being too
fine, is many times blunted, and retorted upon it selfe; even
when he seemes to have done something, he only pricks, not
pierceth.</p>

                        <note n="s" place="margin">Laert.</note> Some there are who inveigh against him, as one that wrote
many obscene things, not sit to be spoken, as in his <hi>Commentary of
the antient Physiologists,</hi> what he writes concerning <hi>Iupiter</hi> and
<hi>Iuno</hi> is obscenely feigned, delivering that in 600 Paragraphs,
which the most impudent person would not have committed to
writing; for, say they, he hath related the story most unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly,
and though he prais'd it as naturall, yet it becommeth
Curtezans rather then Gods.</p>
                     <p>Moreover what he saith of those that writ <hi>of Tables</hi> is false,
not to be found neither in <hi>Polemo,</hi> nor <hi>Hipsicrates,</hi> nor <hi>Antigonus,</hi>
but forged by himselfe.</p>
                     <p>In his book <hi>of a Commonwealth,</hi> he allowes marriage with a
mother and a daughter, and repeats the same in the beginning of
his book, <hi>Concerning things expetible in themselves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In his third book <hi>of Iustice,</hi> extending to a thousand Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs,
he advised to feed upon the very dead.</p>
                     <p>In his second book <hi>of Life and Transaction,</hi> he affirmeth, a wise
man ought to take care to provide himselfe food; but to what
end must he provide himselfe food? for Livelyhood? Life is an
<hi>indifferent.</hi> For Pleasure? Pleasure also is <hi>indifferent.</hi> For Vertue?
that is selfe-<hi>sufficient</hi> for <hi>Beatitude.</hi> Such kinds of acquisition of
wealth are very ridiculous. If they proceed from a King, there
is a necessitie of complying with him; if from a friend, that
friendship is veniall; if from wisdome, that wisdome is merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.
For these things, saith <hi>Laertius,</hi> some have inveigh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

that being in the <hi>Odaeum</hi> (a kinde of publick Theatre at

taking a draught of wine, he was immediately seiz'd by a
Vertigo, of which at the end of five daies he died. Others report,
he died of excessive laughter: Seeing an Asseeafigs, he bad his
woman offer it some wine, and thereat fell into such extremity
of laughter, that it killed him.</p>

<hi>divine, most wise, most holy, the</hi> Homer of <hi>Philosophers.</hi> But his
opinion of the immortality of the Soul he approved not, arguing
thus; Whatsoever is generated dieth; but soules are generated,
as is manifest from the likenesse of those that are begotten to their
Parents, not only in body, but disposition. His other argument
was, There is nothing that is grieved or pained but is subject to
be sick; whatsoever is subject to sicknesse is likewise subject to
death; souls are subject to griefe, therefore they are subject to
death.</p>
