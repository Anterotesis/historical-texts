            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Present Pen and Ink War rais'd against
a Standing Army, has more ill Consequences
in it, than are at first Sight to be Discern'd.
The Pretence is specious, and the cry of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is very pleasing; but the Principle is Mortally Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
and Destructive of the Essential Safety of the
Kingdom; Liberty and Property, are the Glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of the <hi>English</hi> Nation; and the dearer they are to
us, the less Danger we are in of Loosing them; but I
cou'd never yet see it prov'd, that the danger of loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them by a small Army was such as we shou'd
expose our selves to all the World for it. Some Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
talk so big of our own Strength, that they think
<hi>England</hi> able to Defend it self against all the
World. I presume such talk without Book; I think
the prudentest Course is to prevent the Trial, and
that is only to hold the Ballance of <hi>Europe</hi> as the
King now does; and if there be a War to keep it
abroad. How these Gentlemen will do that with a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,</hi>
I shou'd be glad to see Proposed; 'tis not the King
of <hi>England</hi> alone, but the Sword of <hi>England</hi> in the
Hand of the King, that gives Laws of Peace and
War now to <hi>Europe;</hi> And those who would thus write the
<pb facs="tcp:48807:3"/>
Sword out of his Hand in time of Peace, bid the
fairest of any Men in the World to renew the
War.</p>
            <p>The Arguments against an Army have been strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
urg'd; and the Authors with an unusual Assurance,
Boast already of their Conquest, tho' their Armour
is not yet put off. <hi>I think their Triumph goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Victory;</hi> and if Books and Writing will
not, God be thanked the Parliament will Confute them,
by taking care to maintain such Forces, and no more,
as they think needful for our safety abroad, without
danger at home, and leaving it to time to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that such an Army, with Consent of Parliament,
is not inconsistent with a Free Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <head>An ARGUMENT, shewing, that a
Standing Army, with Consent of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
is not Inconsistent with a Free
Government, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN the Great Debates about a Standing Army;
and in all the Arguments us'd on one side and
'tother, in the Case it seems to me, that both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are Guilty of running into the Extreams
of the Controversie.</p>
            <p>Some have taken up such terrible Notions of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
that take it how you will, call it what you will;
be it Rais'd, Paid or Commanded by whom you will,
and let the Circumstances be alter'd never so much, the
Term is synonimous, an Army is an Army; and if
they don't Enslave us, the Thanks is not to our good
Conduct; for so many Soldiers, so many Masters:
They may do it if they will; and if they do not do
it now, they may do it in another Reign, when a King
shall arise who knows not <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and therefore the
Risque is not to be run by any means: From hence
they draw the Consequence, <hi>That a Standing Army is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with a Free Government,</hi> &amp;c. which is the Title to
the Argument.</p>
            <p>This we find back'd by a Discourse of <hi>Militia</hi>'s, and
by a Second part of the Argument, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all these
Three, which seem to me to be wrote be the same
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48807:4"/>
Hand, agree in this Point in General<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the War
being at an end, <hi>no Forces at all</hi> are to be kept in
Pay, <hi>no Men</hi> to be Maintained whose Profession is
bearing Arms, whose Commission is to Kill and Slay,
as he has it in <hi>the Second Part;</hi> but they must be Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,
as Men for whom there is no more Occasion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
an Enemy, and are dangerous to be kept up,
least they find Occasion against our selves.</p>
            <p>The Advocates for the Necessity of a <hi>Standing Army,</hi>
seem to make light of all these Fears and Jealousies;
and Plead the Circumstances of the Kingdom, with Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to our Leagues and Confederacys abroad, the Strength
of our Neighbours, a Pretender to the Crown in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Uncertainties of Leagues, and the like, as
Arguments to prove an Army necessary. I must own
these are no Arguments any longer than those Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
continue, and therefore can amount to no more
than to argue the necessity of an Army for a time, which
time none of them has ventured to Assign, nor to say
how, being once Establish'd, we shall be sure to be
rid of them, in case a new King shou'd succeed before
the time be expir'd, who may not value our Liberty at
the rate his present Majesty has done.</p>
            <p>I desire calmly to consider both these Extreams, and
if it be possible, to find out the safe <hi>Medium</hi> which may
please us all.</p>
            <p>If there be any Person who has an ill Design in push<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus against the Soldery. I am not to expect, that
less than a Disbanding the whole Army will satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
him; but such who have no other End than preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
our Liberties entire, <hi>and leaving them so to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,</hi>
will be satisfied with what they know is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to that End; <hi>for he who is not content with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48807:4"/>
what will fully answer the End he proposes, has some
other End than that which he proposes.</hi> I make no
Reflections upon any Party, but I propose to direct
this Discourse to the Honest well meaning English<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Freeholder, who has a share in the <hi>Terra firma,</hi> and
therefore is concern'd to preserve Freedom to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant
that loves his Liberty better than his Life,
and won't sell it for Money; and this is the Man who
has the most reason to fear a Standing Army, for he
has something to loose; as he is most concern'd for the
the Safety of a Ship, who has a Cargo on her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>
            <p>This Man is the hardest to be made believe that he
cannot be safe without an Army, because he finds he is
not easie with one. To this Man all the sad Instances
of the Slavery of Nations, by Standing Armies, stand
as so many Buoys to warn him of the Rocks which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Free Nations have split upon; and therefore 'tis to
this Man we are to speak.</p>
            <p>And in order to state the Case right, we are to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
first between <hi>England</hi> formerly, and <hi>England</hi>
now; between a Standing Army able to enslave the
Nation, and a certain Body of Forces enough to make
us safe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> now is in sundry Circumstances, different
from <hi>England</hi> formerly, with respect to the Manner of
Fighting, the Circumstances of our Neighbours, and of
our Selves; and there are some Reasons why a Militia
are not, and perhaps I might make it out cannot be
made fit for the Uses of the present Wars. In the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Times of <hi>England</hi>'s Power, we were for many
years the Invaders of our Neighbours, and quite out of
fear of Invasions at home; but before we arriv'd to
that Magnitude in the World, 'tis to be observed we
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48807:5"/>
were hardly ever invaded, but we were conquer'd,
<hi>William</hi> the Conqueror was the last; and if the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard
did not do the same, 'twas because God set the
Elements in Battel array against them, and they were
prevented bringing over the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Army;
which if they had done, 'twould have gone very hard
with us; but we owe it wholly to Providence.</p>
            <p>I believe it may be said, that from that Time to this
Day, the Kingdom has never been without some Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Troops of Souldiers entertain'd in pay, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
either kept at Home or employ'd Abroad; and
yet no evil Consequence follow'd, nor do I meet with
any Votes of the Parliament against them as Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or Motions made to Disband them, till the Days
of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First. Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> tho' she
had no <hi>Guard du Corps,</hi> yet she had her <hi>Guards du Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</hi>
She had even to her last hour several Armies, <hi>I
may call them,</hi> in Pay among Forreign States and
Princes, which upon any visible Occasion were ready
to be call'd Home. King <hi>Iames</hi> the First had the same
in <hi>Holland,</hi> in the Service of <hi>Gustavus Adolphus</hi> King
of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and in the Unfortunate Service of the King
of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> and that Scotch Regiment, known by the
name of <hi>Douglass</hi>'s Regiment, have been, <hi>(they say)</hi> a
Regiment Two hundred and fifty Years. King <hi>Charles</hi>
the First had the same in the several Expeditions for the
Relief of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and that fatal Descent upon the Isle of
<hi>Rhe,</hi> and in his Expeditions into <hi>Scotland;</hi> and they
would do well to reconcile their Discourse to it self,
who say in one place, <hi>If King</hi> Charles <hi>had had Five
thousand Men, the Nation had never struct one stroak
for their Liberties;</hi> and in another, <hi>That the Parliament
were like to have been petitioned out of doors by an
Army a hundred and fifty Miles off, tho there was a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48807:5"/>
Scotch Army at the Heels of them:</hi> for to me it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that King <hi>Charles</hi> the First had an Army then,
and would have kept it, but that he had not the Purse
to pay them, of which more may be said hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>But <hi>England</hi> now stands in another Posture, our
Peace at Home seems secure, and I believe it is so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
to maintain our Peace abroad, 'tis necessary to enter
into Leagues and Confederacies: Here is one
Neighbour grown too great for all the rest; <hi>as they are
single States or Kingdoms,</hi> and therefore to mate him,
several must joyn for mutual Assistance, according
to the Scotch Law of Duelling, <hi>that if one can't beat
you ten shall.</hi> These Alliances are under certain Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulations
and Agreements, with what Strength and in
what Places, to aid and assist one another; and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
these Stipulations, something of Force must be at
hand if occasion require. That these Confederacies are
of absolute and indispensible necessity, to preserve the
Peace of a weaker against a stronger Prince, past
Experience has taught us too plainly to need an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>There is another constant Maxim of the present
State of the War; and that is, <hi>carry the War into your
Enemies Country, and always keep it out of your
own.</hi> This is an Article has been very much opposed 'tis
true; and some, who knew no better, would talk much
of the fruitless Expence of a War abroad; as if it was
not worth while to defend your Confederates Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
to make it a Barrier to your own. This is too
weak an Argument also to need any trouble about;
but this again makes it absolutely necessary to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
some Troops ready to send to the assistance of
those Confederates if they are invaded. Thus at the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48807:6"/>
Peace of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> six Regiments were left in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to continue there in time of Peace, to be ready
in case of a Rupture. To say, that instead of this we
will raise them for their assistance when wanted, would
be something, if this potent Neighbour, were not the
<hi>French</hi> King, whose Velocity of Motion the <hi>Dutch</hi>
well remember in 1672. But then, <hi>say they,</hi> we may
send our Militia. First, <hi>The King can't command them
to go;</hi> and Secondly, if he could, <hi>no body wou'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
them;</hi> and if they would go, and would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of, <hi>they would be good for nothing:</hi> Is we have
no Forces to assist a Confederate, who will value our
Friendship, or assist us if we wanted it? To say we
are Self-dependent, and shall never need the Assistance
of our Neighbour, is to say what we are not sure of,
and this is certain it is as needful to maintain the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of <hi>England</hi> in the Esteem of our Neighbours,
as 'tis to defend our Coasts in case of an Invasion; for
keep up the Reputation of our Power, and we shall
never be Invaded.</p>
            <p>If our Defence from Insurrections or Invasions,
were the only necessary part of a future War, I shou'd
be the readier to grant the Point, and to think our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia
might be made useful; but our business is <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piis
Obsta,</hi> to beat the Enemy before he comes to our
own door. Our Business in case of a Rupture, is to aid
our Confederate Princes, that they may be able to
stand between us and Danger: Our Business is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<hi>Flanders,</hi> to Garrison the Frontier Towns, and be
in the Field in Conjunction with the Confederate Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
This is the way to prevent Invasions, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scents:
And when they can tell us that our Militia is
proper for this work, then we will say something to
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48807:6"/>I'll suppose for once what I hope may never fall out,
That a Rupture of this Peace shou'd happen, and the
<hi>French,</hi> according to Custom, break suddenly into
<hi>Flanders,</hi> and over-run it, and after that <hi>Holland,</hi> what
Condition wou'd such a Neighbourhood of such a
Prince, reduce us to? If it be answer'd again, Soldiers
may be raised to assist them. I answer, as before, let
those who say so, read the History of the <hi>French</hi> King's
Irruption into <hi>Holland</hi> in the year 1672. where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
Sixty strong fortified Towns in six Weeks time:
And tell me what it will be to the purpose to raise Men,
to fight an Enemy after the Conquest is made?</p>
            <p>'Twill not be amiss to observe here that the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and Influence the <hi>English</hi> Nation has had abroad
among the Princes of <hi>Christendom,</hi> has been always
more or less according as the Power of the Prince, to
aid and assist, or to injure and offend, was Esteem'd.
Thus Queen <hi>Rlizabeth</hi> carried her Reputation abroad
by the Courage of her <hi>English</hi> Souldiers and Seamen;
and on the contrary, what a ridiculous Figure did King
<hi>Iames,</hi> with his <hi>Beati Pacifici,</hi> make in all the Courts
of <hi>Christendom?</hi> How did the Spaniard and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<hi>banter</hi> and <hi>buffoon</hi> him? How was his Ambassador
asham'd to treat for him, while Count <hi>Colocedo</hi> told
Count <hi>Mansfield, That his New Master</hi> (meaning King
<hi>Iames) knew neither how to make Peace or War?</hi> King
<hi>Charles</hi> the First far'd much in the same manner: And
how was it altered in the Case of <hi>Oliver?</hi>

            <q>
               <lg>
                  <l>Tho' his Government did a Tyrant resemble,</l>

               <bibl>Dialogue of the Houses.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>And what is it places the present King at the Helm of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48807:7"/>
Confederacies? Why do they commit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Armies to his
Charge, and appoint the Congress of their Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries
at his Court? Why do Distressed Princes seek
his Mediation, as the Dukes of <hi>Holstien, Savoy,</hi> and
the like? Why did the Emperor and the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
leave the whole Management of the Peace to him?
'Tis all the Reputation of his Conduct and the <hi>English</hi>
Valour under him; and 'tis absolutely necessary to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
this Character which <hi>England</hi> now bears in the
World, for the great Advantages which may and will be
made from it; and this Character can never Live, nor
these Allyances be supported with no Force at Hand to
perform the Conditions.</p>
            <p>These are some Reasons why a Force is necessary,
but the Question is, What Force? For I Grant, it
does not follow from hence, that a great Army must
be kept on Foot in time of Peace, as the Author
of the Second Part of the Argument says is pleaded
for.</p>
            <p>Since then no Army, and a great Army, are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams
equally dangerous, the one to our Liberty at
Home, and the other to our Reputation Abroad,
and the Safety of our Confederates; it remains to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what <hi>Medium</hi> is to be found out; or in plain <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi>
what Army may, with Safety to our Liberties,
be Maintained in <hi>England,</hi> or what Means may be found
out to make such an Army serviceable for the Defence
of us and our Allies, and yet not dangerous to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</p>
            <p>That any Army at all can be Safe, <hi>the Argument de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
but that cannot be made out; a Thousand Men
is an Army as much as 100000; as the <hi>Spanish</hi> Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
is call'd, <hi>An Armado,</hi> tho' they seldom fit out above
Four Men of War; and on this Account I must crave
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48807:7"/>
leave to say, I do Confute the Assertion in the Title of
the Argument, that a Standing Army is Inconsistent
with a Free Government, and I shall further do it by the
Authority of Parliament.</p>
            <p>In the Claim of Right, presented to the present King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and which he Swore to observe, as the <hi>Pacta Conventa</hi>
of the Kingdom, it is declar'd, <hi>in hac verba, That the Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
or Keeping a Standing Army within the Kingdom in
time of Peace, unless it be by Consent of Parliament,
is against Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This plainly lays the whole stress of the thing, not
against the thing it self, <hi>A Standing Army,</hi> nor against
the Season, <hi>in time of Peace,</hi> but against the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<hi>Consent of Parliament;</hi> and I think nothing is
more Rational than to Conclude from thence, that a
Standing Army in time of Peace, with Consent of
Parliament, is not against Law, and I may go on, nor
is not Inconsistent with a Free Government, nor Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of the <hi>English</hi> Monarchy.</p>
            <p>There are Two Distinctions necessary therefore in the
present Debate, to bring the Question to a narrow
Compass.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>I distinguish between a Great Army and a small
Army. And</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<hi> I distinguish between an Army kept on Foot
without Consent of Parliament, and an Army with
Consent of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas we are told, an Army of Soldiers is an
Army of Masters, and the Consent of Parliament don't
alter it, but they may turn them out of doors who
Rais'd them, as they did the Long Parliament. The
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48807:8"/>
First distinction answers that; for if a great Army may
do it, a small Army can't; and then the Second Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
regulates the First. For it cannot be supposed,
but the Parliament when they give that Consent which
can only make an Army Lawful, will not Consent to
a larger Army then they can so Master, as that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
or People of <hi>England,</hi> shall never be in danger from
them.</p>
            <p>No Man will say this cannot be, because the Number
may be supposed as small as you please; but to avoid
the Sophistry of an Argument, I'll suppose the very
Troops which we see the Parliament have not Voted to
be Disbanded; that is, those which were on Foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Year 1680. No Man will deny them to be
a Standing Army, and yet sure no Man will imagine
any danger to our Liberties from them.</p>
            <p>We are ask'd, if you establish an Army, and a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to pay them, <hi>How shall we be sure they will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
themselves?</hi> But will any Man ask that Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of such an Army as this? Can Six Thousand Men
tell the Nation they won't Disband, but will continue
themselves, and then Raise Money to do it? Can they
Exact it by Military Execution? If they can, <hi>our
Militia must be very despicable.</hi> The keeping such a
Remnant of an Army does not hinder but the Militia
may be made as useful as you please; and the more
useful you make it, the less danger from this Army:
And however it may have been the Business of our Kings
to make the Militia as useless as they could, the present
King never shew'd any Tokens of such a Design. Nor is
it more than will be needful, for 6000 Men by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
won't do, if the Invasion we speak of should ever
be attempted. What has been said of the Appearance of
the People on the <hi>Purbeck fancied Invasion,</hi> was very
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48807:8"/>
true; but I must say, had it been a true One of Forty
Thousand Regular Troops, all that Appearance cou'd
have done nothing, but have drove the Country in
order to starve them, and then have run away: I am
apt enough to grant what has been said of the Impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cableness
of any Invasion upon us, while we are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
at Sea; but I am sure the Defence of <hi>England</hi>'s
Peace, lies in making War in <hi>Flanders.</hi> Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
found it so, her way to beat the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> was by
helping the <hi>Dutch</hi> to do it. And she as much Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>England</hi> in aiding Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> to win the Great
Battel of <hi>Newport,</hi> as she did in Defeating their <hi>Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
Armado. Oliver Cromwel</hi> took the same Course;
for he no sooner declared Wat against <hi>Spain,</hi> but he Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd
his Army for <hi>Flanders:</hi> The late King <hi>Charles</hi>
did the same against the <hi>French,</hi> when after the Peace of
<hi>Nimeguen,</hi> Six Regiments of <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
left in the Service of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the present
War is a further Testimony: For where has it been
Fought, not in <hi>England, God be thanked,</hi> but in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders?</hi>
And what are the Terms of the Peace, but more
Frontier Towns in <hi>Flanders?</hi> And what is the Great
Barrier of this Peace, but <hi>Flanders;</hi> the Consequence
of this may be guess'd by the Answer King <hi>William</hi> gave
when Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in the late Treaty of <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen;</hi>
when, to make the Terms the easier, 'twas offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>That a Satisfaction shou'd be made to him by the</hi>
French, <hi>for his Lands in</hi> Luxemburgh; to which the
Prince reply'd. <hi>He would part with all his Lands in</hi> Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburgh
<hi>to get the</hi> Spaniards <hi>one good Frontier Town in</hi>
Flanders. The reason is plain; for every one of those
Towns, tho' they were immediately the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
were really Bulwarks to keep the <hi>French</hi> the further
off from his own Country; and thus it is now: And
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48807:9"/>
how our Militia can have any share in this part of the
War, I cannot imagine. It seems strange to me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
the Arguments made use of to magnifie the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceableness
of the Militia, and the Arguments to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
the Dread of a Standing Army; for they stand
like two Batteries one against another, where the Shot
from one dismounts the Cannon of the other: <hi>If a small
Army may enslave us, our Militia are good for nothing; if
good for nothing, they cannot defend us,</hi> and then an Army
is necessary: <hi>If they are good, and are able to defend us,
then a small Army can never hurt us,</hi> for what may defend
us Abroad, may defend us at Home; and I wonder this is
not consider'd. And what is plainer in the World than
that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> have all along agreed to
this Point. That a Standing Army in time of Peace, <hi>with
Consent of Parliament,</hi> is not against Law. The Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of the Forces in the time of K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. was
not as I remember ever objected against in Parliament, at
least we may say the Parliament permitted them if they
did not establish them: And the Present Parliament seems
enclin'd to continue the Army on the same foot, so far as
may be suppos'd from their Vote to disband all the
Forces raised since 1680. To affirm then, <hi>That a Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Army,</hi> (without any of the former Distinctions) <hi>is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent,</hi>
&amp;c. is to argue against the General Sense of the
Nation, the Permission of the Parliament for 50 years past,
and the Present apparent Resolutions of the best Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
House that perhaps ever entred within those Walls.</p>
            <p>To this House the whole Nation has left the Case, to
act as they see cause; to them we have committed the
Charge of our Liberties, nay the King himself has only
told them His Opinion, with the Reasons for it, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
leading them at all;</hi> and the Article of the <hi>Claim
of Right</hi> is left in full force: For this Consent of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48807:9"/>
is now left the whole and sole Judge. Whether
<hi>an Army</hi> or <hi>no Army;</hi> and if it Votes an Army, 'tis
left still the sole Judge of the Quantity, <hi>how many,</hi> or
<hi>how few.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here it remains to enquire the direct Meaning of
those words, <hi>Vnless it be by Consent of Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and I
humbly suppose they may, among other things, include
these Particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That they be rais'd and continued not by a Tacit, but
Explicite Consent of Parliament; or, to speak di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
by an Act of Parliament.</item>
               <item>2. That they be continued no longer than such Explicite
Consent shall limit and appoint.</item>
            </list>
            <p>If these two Heads are granted in the word <hi>Consent,</hi>
I am bold to affirm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such an <hi>Army is not Inconsistent with
a Free Government,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I am as positively assur'd of the Safety of our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
under the Conduct of King and Parliament, while
they concur, <hi>as I am of the Salvation of Believers by
the Passion of our Saviour;</hi> and I hardly think 'tis fit
for a private Man to impose his positive Rules on them
for Method, any more than 'tis to limit the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
whose free Agency is beyond his Power: For the
King, Lords and Commons, can never err while they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
nor is an Army of 20 or 40000 Men <hi>either</hi> a
Scarcrow enough to enslave us, while under that Union.</p>
            <p>If this be allow'd, then the Question before us is, What
may conduce to make the Harmony between the King,
Lords and Commons eteernal? And so the Debate about
an Army ceases.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48807:10"/>But to leave that Question, since Frailty attends the
best of Persons, and Kings have their <hi>faux Pas,</hi> as well as
other Men, we cannot expect the Harmony to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal;
and therefore to provide for the worst, our
Parliaments have made their own Consent the only
Clause that can make an Army Legitimate: But to say
that an Army directly as an Army, without these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions,
is destructive of the <hi>English</hi> Monarchy, and
Inconsistent with a Free Government, &amp;c. is to say then
that the Parliament can destroy the <hi>English</hi> Monarchy,
and can Establish that which is Inconsistent with a Free
Government; which is ridiculous. But then we are
told, that <hi>the Power of the Sword was first placed in the
Lords er Barons, and how they serv'd the King in his
Wars with themselves and their Vassals, and that the
King had no Power to Invade the Priviledges of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,
having no other Forces than the Vassals of his own
Demeasnes to follow him:</hi> And this Form is applauded
as an extraodinary Constitution, <hi>because there is no
other Limitation of a Monarchy of any Signification
than such as places the Sword in the hand of the Subject:
And all such Government where the Prince has the
Power of the Sword, tho' the People have the Power
of the Purse, are no more Monarchies but Tyrannies:
For not only that Government is tyrannical which is
tyrannically exercis'd, but all Governments are tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
which have not in their Constitution sufficient
Security against the Arbitrary Power of their Prince;</hi>
that is, which have not the Power of the Sword to
Imploy against him if need be.</p>
            <p>Thus we come to the Argument: Which is not
how many Troops may by allow'd, or how long; but
in short, <hi>No Mercenary-Troops at all can be maintain'd
without Destroying our Constitution, and Metamorphizing
our Government into a Tyranny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:48807:10"/>I admire how the Maintainer of this Basis came to
omit giving us an Account of another Part of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
very needful to examine, in handing down the
True Notion of Government in this Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> of
Parliaments. To supply which, and to make way
for what follows, I must take leave to tell the Reader,
that about the time, when this Service by Villenage
and Vassalage began to be resented by the People, and
by Peace and Trade they grew rich, and the Power of
the Barons being too great, frequent Commotions,
Civil Wars, and Battels, were the Consequence, nay
sometimes without concerning the King in the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel:
One Nobleman would Invade another, in which
the weakest suffered most, <hi>and the poor Man's Blood
was the Price of all;</hi> the People obtain'd Priviledges
of their own, and oblig'd the King and the Barons to
accept of an <hi>Equilibrium;</hi> this we call a Parliament:
And from this the Due Ballance, we have so much
heard of is deduced. I need not lead my Reader
to the Times and Circumstances of this, but this
Due Ballance is the Foundation on which we now
stand, and which the Author of the Argument so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
applaudes as the best in the World; and I appeal to
all Men to judge if this Ballance be not a much nobler
Constitution in all its Points, than the old <hi>Gothick</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
of Government.</p>
            <p>In that the Tyranny of the Barons was intollerable,
the Misery and Slavery of the Common People insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable,
their Blood and Labour was at the absolute
Will of the Lord, <hi>and often sacrifice to their private
Quarrels:</hi> They were as much at his beck as his Pack
of Hounds were at the Sound of his Horne; whether
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48807:11"/>
it was to march against a Forreign Enemy, or <hi>against
their own Natural Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> So that this was but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing
one Tyrant for Three hundred, for so many
the Barons of <hi>England</hi> were accounted at least. And
this was the Effect of the Security vested in the People,
against the Arbitrary Power of the King; which was
to say the Barons took care to maintain their own Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
and to prevent the Kings Tyrahnizing over
them.</p>
            <p>But 'tis said, <hi>the Barons growing poor by the Luxury
of the Times, and the Common People growing rich,
they exchang'd their Vassalage for Leases, Rents, Fines,
and the like.</hi> They did so, and thereby became enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled
to the Service of themselves; and so overthrew
the Settlement, and from hence came a <hi>House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons:</hi>
And I hope <hi>England</hi> has reason to value the
Alteration. Let them that think not reflect on the
Freedoms the Commons enjoy in <hi>Poland,</hi> where the
<hi>Gothick</hi> Institution remains, and they will be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>In this Establishment of a Parliament, the Sword is
indeed trusted in the Hands of the King, and <hi>the Purse
in the Hands of the People;</hi> the People cannot make
Peace or War without the King, no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the King cannot
raise or maintain an Army without the People; and
this is the True Ballance.</p>
            <p>But we are told, <hi>The Power of the Purse is not a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Security without the Power of the Sword:</hi> What!
not against Ten thousand Men? To answer this, 'tis
necessary to examine how far the Power of the Sword
is in the Hands of the People already, and next whether
the Matter of Fact be true.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:48807:11"/>I say the Sword is in part in the Hands of the People
already, by the Militia, who, as the Argument says
<hi>are the People themselves.</hi> And how are they
Ballanc'd? 'Tis true, they are Commissioned by
the King, but they may refuse to meet twice, till the
first Pay is reimburst to the Countrey: And where
shall the King Raise it without a Parliament? that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Militia would prevent him. So that our Law there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Authorizing the Militia to refuse the Command of the
King, tacitly puts the Sword into the Hands of the People.</p>
            <p>I come now to Examine the Matter of Fact, <hi>That
the Purse is not an Equivalent to the Sword,</hi> which
I deny to be true; and here 'twill be necessary to
Examine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How often our Kings of <hi>England</hi> have Rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Armies on their own Heads, but have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to Disband them for want of Moneys, nay, have
been forced to call a Parliament to Raise Money to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
them.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> the First is an Instance of both these;
for his First Army against the <hi>Scots</hi> he was forced to
Dismiss for want of Pay; and then was forced to call
a Parliament to Pay and Dismiss the <hi>Scots;</hi> and tho' he
had an Army in the Field at the Pacification, and a
Church Army too, yet he durst not attempt to Raise
Money by them.</p>
            <p>I am therefore to affirm, <hi>that the Power of the Purse
is an Equivalent to the Power of the Sword;</hi> and
I believe I can make it appear, if I may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to instance in those numerous Armies which <hi>Gaspar
Coligny,</hi> Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth
King of <hi>Navar,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> the First P. of <hi>Orange</hi> brought
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48807:12"/>
of <hi>Germany</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> and into the Low Countries,
which all vanished, and could attempt nothing for
want of a Purse to maintain them: But to come
nearer, what made the Efforts of King <hi>Charles</hi> all
Abortive, but <hi>Want of the Purse?</hi> Time was he had
the Sword in his Hand, when the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
went on those Fruitless Voyages to <hi>Rochell,</hi> and
himself afterwards to <hi>Scotland,</hi> he had Forces on Foot,
a great many more than Five Thousand, which the
Argument mentions, but he had not the Purse, at
last he attempted to take it without a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>and that Ruin'd him.</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Second found the Power of the Purse, so much out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballanced
the Power of the Sword, that he sat still,
and let the Parliament Disband his Army for him, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
whether he would or no.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides the Power of the Purse in <hi>England,</hi> differs
from what the same thing is in other Countries, because
'tis so Sacred a thing, that <hi>no King ever touch'd at it but
he found his Ruine in it.</hi> Nay, 'tis so odious to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that whoever attempts it, must at the same
time be able to make an Entire Conquest or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>If then neither <hi>the Consent of Parliament,</hi> nor the
<hi>smalness of an Army proposed,</hi> nor the Power of <hi>the
Sword in the Hands of the Milia,</hi> which are the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
themselves, nor <hi>the Power of the Purse,</hi> are not a
sufficient Ballance against the Arbitrary Power of the
King, what shall we say? Are Ten Thousand Men in
Arms, without Money, without Parliament Authority,
hem'd in with the whole Militia of <hi>England,</hi> and
<hi>Dam'd by the Laws?</hi> Are they of such Force as to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48807:12"/>
break our Constitution? I cannot see any reason for
such a Thought. The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> is a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of whom we may say, <hi>That no Weapon Formed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them cou'd ever Prosper;</hi> and they know their own
Strength, and they know what Force is needful, and
what hurtful, and they will certainly maintain the <hi>First</hi>
and Disband the <hi>Last.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It may be said here,</hi> 'Tis not the fear of Ten Thousand
Men, 'tis not the matter of an Army, but 'tis not the <hi>Thing</hi>
it self; grant a Revenue for Life, and the next King
will call it, <hi>My Revenue,</hi> and so grant an Army for
this King, and the next will say, <hi>Give Me my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To which I Answer,</hi> That these things have been no
oftner ask'd in Parliament than deny'd; and we have
so many Instances in our late Times of <hi>the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Purse,</hi> that it seems strange to me, that
it should not be allowed to be a sufficient Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, as I hinted before, was
very loath to part with his Army Rais'd in 1676.
but he was forced to it for want of Money to pay
them; he durst not try whether when <hi>Money had Rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an Army, an Army cou'd not Raise Money.</hi> 'Tis true,
his Revenues were large, but Frugality was not his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and that ruin'd the Design. King <hi>Iames</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
was a good Husband, and that very Husbandry
had almost Ruin'd the Nation; for his Revenues being
well managed, he maintain'd an Army out of it. For
'tis well known, the Parliament never gave him a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
towards it; but he never attempted to make his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48807:13"/>
Raise any Money; if he had; 'tis probable his Work
had been sooner done than it was.</p>
            <p>But pray let us Examine abroad, if <hi>the Purse has not
Governed all the Wars of</hi> Europe. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were
once the most powerful People in <hi>Europe;</hi> their Infantry
were in the Days of the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> the most In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Troops in the World. The <hi>Dutch,</hi> who were
then his Subjects, and on whom he had Levied immense
Sums of Money, had the 10th Penny demanded of
them, and the Demand back'd by a great Army of these
very <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which, among many other Reasons
caused them to Revolt. The Duke <hi>D'Alva</hi> afterwards
attempted for his Master to raise this Tax by his Army,
by which he lost the whole <hi>Netherlands,</hi> who are now
the Richest People in the World; and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is
now become the meanest and most despicable Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in <hi>Europe,</hi> and that only because they are the
Poorest.</p>
            <p>The present War is another Instance, which having
lasted Eight Years, is at last brought to this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>That he who had the longest Sword has yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them who had the longest Purse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The late King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, is another most
lively Instance of this Matter, to what lamentable
Shifts did he drive himself? and how many despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Steps did he take, rather than call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which he hated to think of. And yet, tho'
he had an Army on Foot, he was forced to do it, <hi>or
starve all his Men;</hi> had it been to be done, he
wou'd have done it. 'Tis true, 'twas said the Earl of
<hi>Strofford</hi> propos'd a Scheme, <hi>to bring over an Army out
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48807:13"/>
of</hi> Ireland, <hi>to force</hi> England <hi>to his Terms;</hi> but
the Experiment was thought too desperate to be
attempted, and the very Project Ruin'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector;
such an ill Fate attends every Contrivance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I think I need go no further on that Head:
The Power of Raising Money is wholly in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
as a Ballance to the Power of Raising Men,
which is in the King; and all the Reply I can
meet with is, <hi>That this Ballance signifies nothing,
for an Army can Raise Money, as well as Money Raise
an Army; to which I Answer,</hi> besides what has been
said already; <hi>I do not think it practicable in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:
The greatest Armies, in the Hands of the
greatest Tyrants we ever had in <hi>England,</hi> never
durst attempt it. We find several Kings in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
have attempted to Raise Money without a
Parliament, and have tryed all the means they
could to bring it to pass; and they need not go
back to <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, to <hi>Edward</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, to <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth,
or to <hi>Charles</hi> the First, to remind the Reader of
what all Men who know any thing of History are
acquainted with: But not a King ever yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to Raise Money, by Military Execution, or
Billetting Soldiers upon the Country. King <hi>Iames</hi>
the Second had the greatest Army and the best,
as to Discipline, that any King ever had; <hi>and his
desperate Attempts on our Liberties show'd his
good Will,</hi> yet he never came to that Point. I won't
deny, but that our Kings have been willing to have
Armies at Hand, to back them in their Arbitrary
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48807:14"/>
Proceedings, and the Subjects may have been aw'd
by them from a more early Resentment; but I
must observe, that all the Invasion of our Rights,
and all the Arbitrary Methods of our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
has been under pretences of Law. King
<hi>Charles</hi> the First Levy'd Ship-Money as his due,
and the Proclamations for that purpose cite the
pretended Law, that in Case of Danger from a
Foreign Enemy, Ships shou'd be fitted out to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
us, and all Men were bound to contribute to
the Charge; <hi>Coat</hi> and <hi>Conduct Money</hi> had the like
Pretences; Charters were subverted by <hi>Quo War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantoes,</hi>
and Proceedings at Law; Patriots were
Murther'd under Formal Prosecutions, and all was
pretended to be done legally.</p>
            <p>I know but one Instance in all our <hi>English</hi>
Story, where the Souldery were employ'd as Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
in open Defyance of Law, to destroy the
Peoples Liberties by a Military Absolute Power,
and that stands as an Everlasting Brand of Infamy
upon our Militia; and is an Instance to prove,
beyond the Power of a Reply, <hi>That even our
Militia, under a bad Government, let them be our
selves, and the People, and all those fine things
never so much</hi> are under ill Officers and ill Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>as dangerous as any Souldery whatever,</hi>
will be as Insolent, and do the Drudgery of a
Tyrant as effectually.</p>
            <p>In the Year when Mr. <hi>Dubois</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Papillon,</hi> a Member of the Present Parliament,
were chosen Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Moor,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:48807:14"/>
under pretence of the Authority of the Chair,
pretended to nominate one Sheriff himself, and
leave the City to choose but one, and confirm
the Choice of the Mayor, the Citizens struggled
for their Right, and stood firm to their
Choice, and several Adjournments were made
to bring over the Majority of the Livery, but in
vain: At length the Day came when the Sheriffs
were to be sworn, and when the Livery-men as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
at <hi>Guild-hall</hi> to swear their Sheriffs, they
found the Hall Garrison'd with a Company of Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-Bands
under Lieutenant Coll. <hi>Quiney,</hi> a Citizen
himself, and most of the Soldiers, Citizens and
Inhabitants; and by this Force the Ancient Livery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were shut out, and several of them thrown
down, and insolently used, and the Sheriffs thrust
away from the Hustings, and who the Lord
Mayor pleased was Sworn in an open Defiance of the
Laws of the Kingdom, and Priviledges of the City. <hi>This
was done by the Militia to their Everlasting Glory,</hi> and
I do not remember the like done by a Standing Army
of Mercenaries, in this Age at least. Nor is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Tyranny practicable in <hi>England,</hi> if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the power the Laws have given to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Magistrate, unless you at the same time ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that Army large enough to subdue the whole
<hi>English</hi> Nation at once, which if it can be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by such an Army as the Parliament now
seem enclined to permit, we are in a very mean
Condition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:48807:15"/>I know it may be objected here, that the Forces
which were on Foot before 1680. are not the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in Debate, and that the Design of the Court was
to have a much greater Force.</p>
            <p>I do not know that, but this I know, that <hi>those
Forces were an Army,</hi> and the Design of all these
Oponents of an Army is in so many words, against
<hi>any Army at all,</hi> small as well as great; a Tenet
absolutely destructive of the present Interest of
<hi>England,</hi> and of the Treaties and Alliances made by
His Majesty with the Princes and States of <hi>Europe,</hi>
who depend so much on his Aid in Guard of the
present Peace.</p>
            <p>The Power of making Peace or War is vested
in the King: 'Tis part of his Prerogative, but 'tis
implicitly in the People, because their Negative as
to Payment, does really Influence all those Actions.
Now If when the King makes War, the Subject
shou'd refuse to assist him, the whole Nation would
be ruin'd: Suppose in the Leagues and Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
His Present Majesty is engag'd in for the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the present Peace, all the Confederates
are bound in case of a Breach to assist one another
with so many Men, say Ten thousand for the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Quota, more or less, where shall they be found?
<hi>Must they stay till they are Rais'd?</hi> To what purpose
would it be then for any Confederate to depend
upon <hi>England</hi> for Assistance?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:48807:15"/>It may be said indeed, if you are so engag'd by
Leagues or Treaties, you may hire Foreign Troops
to assist till you can raise them. This Answer leads to
several things which would take up too much room
here.</p>
            <p>Foreign Troops require Two things to procure
them; Time to Negotiate for them, which may
not be to be spar'd, for they may be almost as soon
rais'd; Time for their March from <hi>Germany,</hi> for
there are none nearer to be hir'd, and Money to
Hire them, which must be had by Parliament, or
the King must have it ready: If by Parliament,
that is a longer way still; if without, that opens a
worse Gate to Slavery than t'other: For if a King
have Money, he can raise Men or hire Men when
he will; and you are in as much danger then, and
more than you can be in now from a Standing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
So that since giving Money is the same thing
as giving Men, as it appear'd in the late K. <hi>Iames</hi>'s
Reign, both must be prevented, or both may be
allow'd.</p>
            <p>But the Parliament we see needs no Instructions
in this Matter, and therefore are providing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Forces to the same <hi>Quota</hi> they were in
before 1680. by which means all the fear of Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
our Liberties will be at an end, the Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so very small that 'tis impossible, and yet the
King will have always a Force at hand to assist his
Neighbours, or defend himself till more can be
Raised. The Forces before 1680. were an Army,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48807:16"/>
and if they were an Army by Consent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they were a Legal Army; and if they were Legal,
then they were not inconsistent <hi>with a Free Government,</hi>
&amp;c. for nothing can be Inconsistent with a <hi>Free Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
which is done according to the Laws of that
Government: And if a <hi>Standing Army</hi> has been
in <hi>England</hi> Legally, then I have proved, <hi>That a
Standing Army is not Inconsistent with a Free Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
