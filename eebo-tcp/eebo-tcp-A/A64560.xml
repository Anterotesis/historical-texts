         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

APOLOGY
FOR THE
Church
OF
ENGLAND,
In Point of
<hi>Separation</hi>
From it.</p>

<hi>William</hi> Lord Bishop of St. <hi>Davids.</hi>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>The design of this address is
to recite the occasion of
the writing, and of the
publishing of this Tract.
<hi>Hic Rhodus, hic saltus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the rise of the Composure
of it.</p>
            <p>Having had a conference, and
therein an amicable dispute with a
profest Pastor of a separate Church (in
the time of the Protectors Usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
he shortly after sent to me a large
<pb facs="tcp:100451:3"/>
letter fraught with arguments for vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating
his separation from the
Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I determined for some months to
wave any reply to it, being not the
enquiry of a disciple or sceptick, for
satisfaction, but rather the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
(in effect) of an adversary,
for victory, for triumph.</p>
            <p>I persisted in the same resolution,
till I was advertised that my silence
was interpreted conviction in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that the letter whilst unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
was concluded unanswerable.</p>
            <p>Though I could have tacitly
brooked a contempt, a contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as to my self; yet my duty
prompted me to assert the cause,
the honour of my Mother, the
<pb facs="tcp:100451:3"/>
Church of <hi>England,</hi> especially in
the distress, the umbrage of her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
being no Persian Votary to
adore the rising, to revile the setting
Sun.</p>
            <p>I have in this Apology entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
avoyded not only virulency of
passion, but also acrimony of style,
recollecting the grave, candid
animadversion of Mr. <hi>Hooker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There will come a time when
three words uttered with charity
and meekness, will receive a more
blessed reward, than three thousand
volumes written with disdainfull
sharpness of mitt.</p>
            <p>As for the printing of this
Tract, it had still layd dormant
in obscurity, had I not been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:100451:4"/>
informed, that the Original
(conveigh'd out of my study above
twenty years since without my
knowledge) was imperfectly copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
thereby disadvantagiously dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perst
in many hands; and that if I
would not recommend a true copy to
the press, a false would be obtrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
without my correction, or
approbation. I alleged my inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of compliance, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
not only of my first draught,
but indeed of any other.</p>
            <p>To remove this obstruction, the
same transcript which was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to my Antagonist was retrieved
and produced to me, which is now
exposed to the view of a censorious
world, without any alteration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100451:4"/>
One reason that (after much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy)
sways me to a publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
is the charitable sentiment
of several judicious persons, that
this Apology may, by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
blessing, conduce to reclaim
some who have unwarily separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
at least to fix others, to
prevent an unwarrantable recess,
which I primarily aim at with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
my own Episcopal charge,
that those precious souls I am
accountable for be not like clouds
whifled about with every gust of
wind; with every novel fancy, as
if their compass for Religion had as
many points to vary, as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
for navigation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100451:5"/>
I wish my dissenting Brethren would
pensively consider, what advantages
they exhibit to our Romish adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
who glory in the infamy of
our divisions (though fomented by
themselves in varieries of disguises)
accounting our brands their orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
our rents their Union. As <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistius</hi>
did recriminate, return the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
objection of Sects among the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians to the Philosophers,
divided, bandied against each other; so
may I retort the same papal Argument
against the Protestants; to the modern
Romanists, whose jarring parties are
not more linkt, cemented than ours, but
their enmities, animosities more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
smothered (as to vulgar notice)
How confidently do they spread their
<pb facs="tcp:100451:5"/>
plumes, whilst some Separatists no less
unadvisedly than invalidly attempt
to justify their separation from the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> by the separation
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> from
that of Rome. <hi>Par impar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In sum. They are not bottomed
on the same solid important grounds.</p>
            <p>They are not empower'd by the
same, or equal legal Authority (the
one withdrawn from a foreign, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct,
unlawfull usurpation, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from a genuine, direct, lawfull
jurisdiction.)</p>
            <p>They have not been managed by
the same sedate, prudent, regular me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
and expedients (as I have
assayed to demonstrate in this Tract)</p>
            <p>The one hath an amiable aspect
<pb facs="tcp:100451:6"/>
by the unsullied colours and linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of a Reformation (the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
beauty of truth, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness)</p>
            <p>The other hath an uncomely fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
disfigured with the scars, the
gashes of schism.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge, I received a speedy
rejoynder to my Apology, from my
Antagonist, the answering whereof
I deliberately declined for three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p>1. Because the rejoynder was not
compleat, nor distinct to my Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
as this was to his letter.</p>
            <p>Onely, some passages reflected on,
wherein the material exceptions
were discust before.</p>
            <p>2. The rejoynder started new debates
<pb facs="tcp:100451:6"/>
(like <hi>Hydra's</hi> heads) with reiterated,
sharp invectives against enormities
of practice in Ecclesiastical Courts;
which probably sifted, might prove
unweighed aspersions, no less readily
credited, than reported. Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are no evidences of Crimes.
Barely to be impeacht makes no man
a delinquent. However, I espous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no such quarrels. I neither was,
nor am an Advocate for the defail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
or corruptions of any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
or professors, but for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Discipline of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> which upon mature ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination,
my conscience hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
dictated to me, to be the best
constituted reformed Church in the
world, most untainted, unbyassed, for
<pb facs="tcp:100451:7"/>
principles of Piety and Loyalty (the
pillars of Church and State) of exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
correspondence with Christs signal
precept. <hi>Render unto Caesar the things
which are Caesars, and unto God the
things which are Gods,</hi> Matth. 22. 21.
Of nearest resemblance to primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
purity, so reputed by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interessed
persons, by eminently learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
accomplisht foreiners, <hi>Isaak Casau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,
Hugo Grotius,</hi> and many others.</p>
            <p>Whereas I scanned the arguments
of my Antagonist, which himself
framed to Syllogisms, by the rules of
Logick (the most proper test) hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
manifested their defects and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
in form and matter, having
reduced them to several sorts of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenchs,
of fallacyes, the better to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask
<pb facs="tcp:100451:7"/>
such specious pretences. He
hath offered no other defence for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
nor confutation of me but only
this concise Evasion, that he will not
meddle with my fallacies. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
I apprehended my self disengaged,
as to further contest, which, at this rate,
would prove fruitless and endless.</p>

                  <p>If you aver a Communion with the
Saints as Fellow Members, I desire to
be resolved, who those Saints are?
Not the reformed Protestants, not the
Primitive Christians, you exclude both,
their Church being not separate: if
they be acknowledged Members of the
Catholick Church, they are interested
in the Communion of Saints expressed
in the Creed. And then your separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from them amounts to a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Church, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
specified in the Creed. To a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
higher, are the Apostles the
Saints you own a Communion with?
Then prove they made such separations
from Christian Congregations as you
do. But you admit them not the Title
of Saints (let me inoffensively ask for my
own satisfaction) if they be real Saints,
why not Titular? If your selves as
real assume the Title, why may not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100451:16"/>
the Apostles be indulged that privilege
(in regard you plead to be Saints of
the same extraction) especially since us
to the judgment of others at least,
there is greater certainty, infallibility
of their Saintship than of yours.</p>
                  <p>As for your desire of company com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
to partake the things of God,
those Assemblies you have quitted do
afford those sacred Comforts you have
deserted them for; wherein sacred Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
are most comfortably, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
most charitably celebrated. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
private Persons or Pastors of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial

severity in repentance, not censure; to
be inquisitors in our own Breasts, to
condemn none but our selves. Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not tainted with Faction among
us, nor Zeal stained with Schism. We
bewail the practical prophaneness of
any, that the same tincture of Grace
is not visible in Worship and in Life:
however, our wickedness is not in <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi>
as to this charge; God's pure Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
are not slurred, not vitiated,

If you understand Saints by

                  <p>My Judgement (at least my Genius)
prompts me to approve much rather
directive, than coactive expedients in
Religion; yet the best Worthies of the
Church Ancient and Modern, allow
both to have their fit seasons and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
The Word is the Planting,
Inoculating, but the sword is the Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
Pruning Instrument. This may
lop off dead branches, though it cannot
graft the living: Your instance of
St. <hi>Peters</hi> chearful Auditors concerns
the first structure, not the repair of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
(the Conversion, not the Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration)
We must distinguish the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100451:29"/>
and the reforming of a
Church, betwixt Infidels and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;
betwixt the ignorance of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers

of Misbelievers, after they are

                  <p>As to some of the Branches, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate

Then the Sheep shall be sorted,

touching the damnation of others it
becomes you to be a Sceptick rather
than a Critick. Those you condemn
have the seed of immortality (the
Word of God) they have the Seals of
the Divine Promises (the Sacraments)
they invoke God for remission, for
whatever they offend him in. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
an eternal wrack, they cast An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
on the Merits of their Redeemer,
(<hi>Whosoever believeth on him, shall not

believe, though with much frailty; yet
they implore mercy for that frailty;
beseeching God to strengthen their
weak belief, to help their unbelief, to
pardon their misbelief. This is a state
of infirmity, not of infidelity.</p>
                  <p>As to your exception. There may
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100451:37"/>
be a doctrinal state of Salvation, where
there is not a practical evidence of
Sanctification. There may be Sap in
the Root, when there is no Verdure in
the Branches, as in <hi>David,</hi> who wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in lust and blood for the space of

and yet trod not out of the pale,

who caused him to be painted
in his Chappel, one half in Heaven,
the other in Hell. I shall recommend
in this case to your serious consideration
two pregnant instances. The first is
of <hi>Asa</hi> who is recorded by the Holy
Ghost,<note place="margin">2. Chron. 15. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>That his heart was perfect all his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100451:37"/>
days</hi> (or upright as most Translations
express) before the Lord (for the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustration
of the Original) <hi>He worshipped
God all his days,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Puro corde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um coluit. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabl.</note> 
                     <hi>with a pure and sincere
heart,</hi> saith <hi>Vatablus.</hi> And yet in the
next Chapter, offences of a very black
grain are charged upon him, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in an army of flesh, resting on
the King of <hi>Aram,</hi> in the seventh <hi>verse</hi>
his ungracious indignation, incensed
he was against the Prophet, whom
he imprisoned (<hi>Then Asa was wroth
with the Seer, and put him into prison,</hi>
vers. 10.) His tyrannical oppression
(<hi>He oppressed certain of the people at the
same time,</hi> vers. 10.) Lastly, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
of God in his visitation (<hi>He
sought not the Lord in his disease, but
to the Physicians,</hi> vers 12. My second
instance is <hi>Lot,</hi> who in his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
towards <hi>Abraham</hi> upon the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
started, acquitted himself nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
humble nor charitable, whose
magnified Hospitality was tainted with
impiety, an unholy overture (to be
his Daughters Pandor for to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
of Strangers) that checked with
the Principles of Nature, and of Grace.
But his distemper and his incest were
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100451:38"/>
monstrous blemishes, as if he would
transfer <hi>Sodom</hi> to <hi>Zoar;</hi> a reiterated
distemper and incest, wherein his
drunkenness did not abate, but aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
the guilt and horror of his wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness
(the cause being directly vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,
though not the effect.) In
this addition this cumulation of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the offence was the more heinous,
because Gods deliverance was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gracious. The meditation of the
burning of <hi>Sodom</hi> should have kindled
his zeal, not his lust, should have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
his Holiness, not his dissolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
yet notwithstanding these Crimes
and Prodigies, St <hi>Peter</hi> recites him
with no branded <hi>Epithet.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 7, 8.</note> 'Tis <hi>just Lot,</hi>
and <hi>vexed his righteous soul,</hi> (not his
incestuous.)</p>
                  <p>From these Instances I observe, that
God judgeth not as man, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the outward integrity, but the
inward sincerity. A manifest offender
may be a secret penitentiary. I press
this only to moderate your rigor,
to allay your acrimony in censuring,
not to animate the security of others

                  <p>
                     <hi>But you prove your black doom out
of</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10. Know you not that the
unrighteous shall not inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

nor effeminate persons, nor abusers of
themselves with mankind. Nor thieves,

                  <p>The visibility of Church Members

And yet I presume you will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church
at once all the Anabaptists, and
other erroneous factious assemblies;
nor among your selves exclude all such
who have been admitted, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
some spiritual sins, perhaps
not undiscerned, which if granted
are pollutions of visible sanctity, no
less than justly blamed Carnalities.</p>
                  <p>As for the Apostolical practice ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
as a pattern not copied out by
the Church of <hi>England</hi> in admission of
Members. I pray distinguish the times
of the infancy of a Church, and the
proficiency, the growth of it. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
of age was required in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
of the Church, an infancy of
age allowed to be admitted in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
of the Church (by Baptism.)
For I understand no other Church ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
or imitation but that. Were
persons in some measure ripen'd for
years and intellectuals only to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Members of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> (as in the Apostles time) the
dispute of a visible qualification were
no impertinency.</p>
                  <p>I pray add to this consideration the
Constitution of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:100451:40"/>

her admitting of Members, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing

closely to your own Track.</p>
                  <p>The first Constitution you insist on,
doth not prop your separation, no nor

                  <p>As touching real Saints, you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

But if my memory be not a
fraudulent Record, there is no such
passage extant in his Ecclesiastical Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
though I confess it consonant to
his weighty Judgement, if rightly
understood. The inconvenience of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100451:42"/>
your separate Churches is a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
proved by your concession of the
convenience of our Parochial Churches.
A convenience it is of great antiquity,
and importance. I shall take their
rise in the Western Church from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varistus</hi>
in the beginning of the second
Century.<note place="margin">Sabell. Enn. 7. l. 4. Platina in vit. Evarist. &amp; Dion. <hi>besides the testimony of</hi> Damas. Onuph. Polyd. Virg. de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</note> They were afterward
more disperst and regulated by <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
in the year 267, and by <hi>Marcellus</hi>
in the year 305. From which date
the Parochial Division was generally
embraced in all Christian Territories.
<hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Emperour did by a solemn Law
suppress all separate Churches, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no Religious Assemblies, but in
Cathedral or Parochial Churches for
the prevention of clandestine Heresies
and Schismes. <hi>Simplicius</hi> was round
with <hi>Victorinus,</hi> a famous Orator con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
from Paganism to Christianity,
but sequestring himself from Parochial
Congregations (I will not account you
in the Sacred List of Christians, unless
I see you in the Church among them)
A penalty was enacted for absentors
without necessary Diversions by the
<hi>Elibertine</hi> Council,<note place="margin">Elib. Conc. Cant. 21.</note> the year 310. The
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100451:43"/>
Great Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar
any Ordination of Ministers
<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,<note place="margin">Conc. Chalced. Can. 6.</note> without a particular Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
or interest, without a Parochial
Charge. A provident course (to restrain
vagrant Levites) seconded, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced
by diverse succeeding Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.
This was the wisdom of the
Primitive Christians. But you object,
this amounts only to a humane consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
A Parochial Church is of a
mixt nature; partly Divine, partly
Humane. There is a threefold consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of a Divine Institution.</p>
                  <p>First, for the matter as well as the
Power, the Author of it. This is
Gods own Law, simply and pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Moral, its subject being absolutely
good in it self, if commanded (in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict)
absolutely evil in its self, if coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termanded
(in an Interdict, a Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.)
This Law is universally reduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to a natural dictate, a principle
imprinted in the Souls of men: Of this
stamp and mould are the Branches
of the Moral Law, the Precepts of both
Tables.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. There is a Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
not for the convincing equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100451:43"/>
of the Matter, but the binding Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Power, the external im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of God, as a Lawgiver. Such
was Gods charge to our First Parents
touching the prohibited Fruit in
Paradise; The eating whereof was
not forbidden because evil, but evil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
forbidden.</p>
                  <p>3. Thirdly, a Constitution is Divine
for the Matter, and not the Power, not
immediately, but mediately, when the
Precepts of men are grounded upon
the Laws of God, on the Rules of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Equity.</p>
                  <p>In the present Question touching Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Churches, The constitution is
not entirely humane or positive (in the
Schoolmens expression) It is Divine
in the third Consideration, because of
its foundation. For though the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial
individual respect (the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
limits of Parishes as now sorted)
be humane, yet the substantial respect,
that there be a regular limitation for
bounds to Ministers and People, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely
comprehended in these two
grand Apostolical Canons,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 26, 40.</note> 
                     <hi>Let all things
be done to edification. Let all things be done
decently, and in order.</hi> The one being
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100451:44"/>
the spiritual Canon, the other the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical;
or the one diverting us
from a pompous superstitious gayness,
the other from a disordered, unbeauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
rudeness in Religion.</p>
                  <p>There is yet a more special Divine
Foundation touching the substantial
part. That Pastors and Flocks should
have their distinct Relations and Limits,
this being warranted by Apostolical
Precept and Practice.<note place="margin">Acts 14. 23. Apostoli planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas Ecclesias commiserunt propriis pastori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, Jun. &amp; Trem.</note>

that they may do it with joy, and not

                  <p>These Duties cannot commodiously,
conscienciously be discharged, without
distinction of charges, designation,
restriction of places. Vigilance for
souls is obstructed by distance. The
account also must needs be hudled,
when the charge is confused. The
Apostles had a general Oecumenical
commission qualified with unparallel'd
endowments (for Languages, for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles)
suitable to such dispersed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
employments. The Time,
Message, and Messengers were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.
This universall Embassy is
not exemplary.</p>
                  <p>Our bounded Parochial Churches

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> concludeth that no man
can separate from the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
with a good Conscience, since
it teacheth, obeyeth, believeth the
Doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles.
In the most justifiable cause of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he requires examination, convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
censure, (or condemnation.) To
separate without examination is not
Piety but Phrensie.<note place="margin">Arist. l. 1. Eth.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>2. To separate without conviction
is levity, to be like clouds, hover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with every sudden gale of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> condemns the want of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100451:49"/>
Moderation in those, that condemn the
Church of <hi>England</hi> without sufficient

                  <p>If any object admonition by Books;
take the same Authors resolute asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
his asseveration for a satisfactory

                  <p>I say again, there are grosser faults
in some of those Books, than any of
the faults that they reprove in the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that Books
are not fit to convince,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> on the Epistle to the Galatians the first Chapter and second verse.</note> especially a
Church.</p>
                  <p>3. To separate without a Juridical
Censure, an Authoritative, a Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Doom, is at least a hasty irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity.</p>
                  <p>Otherwise Separation paves a
Causey to Confusion; Schisms will be
endless, Synods needless.</p>
                  <p>If two or three Members of your
new Collected Church, should sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from your Church, branding it
to be a corrupt Church, not lawfully
to be communicated with; your selves
would esteem those two or three to be
very inconsiderable for number or
power, for to be ballanced with that
Collected Church, whereof they are,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100451:50"/>
or, as you alledge, ought to be Members.
I pray consider, the disproportion is
far greater betwixt your Collected
Church, and the National Church of
<hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To wind up this bottom: That you
have been prudent in Examination,

                     </gap>, whether
your conviction of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> hath been sufficient, or your
censure your condemnation. Nay, it
is a Question put out of all Question
negatively, since that the Church of
<hi>England</hi> hath not been disproved by
any Demonstrative Arguments upon
Scripture Principles, to be no truly
constituted Church; nor yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by any Synod. Till then I
pray forbear to separate from it. I
shall add by way of <hi>Prolepsis.</hi> If you
here object, that in being thus scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
you may be irrecoverably invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in guilt, for want of a Synodical
Condemnation, which is not in your
power. I answer, In case of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
there is allowable only a partial
Separation in the Church, not a total
from the Church. Or a Negative Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100451:50"/>
by not asserting, abetting,
countenancing, owning erroneous Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
or vitious enormous Practices;
not a positive separation by constituting
a new visible Church, by deserting
the Old in its Religious Duties and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies.</p>
                  <p>The best Christians in the Church of
<hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> nay, St. <hi>Paul</hi>
himself did separate no otherwise;
when there was conspicuous in the
one a tincture of Paganism, in the
point of Resurrection; in the other a
spot of Judaism, in point of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
They severed doctrinally (as to
those particulars) not personally, as to
the sacred publick Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>As to your Quotation of St. <hi>Jude,</hi> I
shall fortifie Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> Judgement
with Mr. <hi>Arthur Hildershams</hi> (upon
<hi>John 4. 45. Lect.</hi> 35.) Such as separate
from our Churches upon pretence of
the corruptions, that are in them.
These are marked with a black coal,
by <hi>Jude 19. These be they who sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
themselves, being sensual, having
not the Spirit.</hi> But herein Christians
must learn wisely to distinguish such as
are unjustly separated by others from
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100451:51"/>
the Church Assemblies; and such as
voluntarily separate themselves; These
deserve to be called Schismaticks, and
not the others. Neither are they to
be counted Schismaticks, as though
they dare not be Agents or Practisers
of any corruption that remaineth in
the Church, yet can bear and tolerate
them as burthens, without forsaking
the Church for them. To this sort I
will say no more, but wish them well
to weigh the Examples of Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
that have been mentioned in
this Doctrine, which frequented so
diligently the publick Worship of
God in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> when there were
far greater corruptions, both in the
Priests, and People, and Worship it
self, than can be found in ours. What
Mr. <hi>Hildersham</hi> here winds up is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel'd
in his thirty sixth Lecture; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Author is not lyable to your
exception, and proceeds upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Principles (your own appeal)
who hath been reputed by Dr. <hi>Willet,
Malleus Schismaticorum qui vulgo vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantur
Brownistae,</hi> I shall here insert
what himself hath dilated in his own
Language without contracting or alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</p>
                  <bibl>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:100451:51"/>
                     <hi>Upon</hi> John 4. 22.</bibl>
                  <q>We know what we worship, for salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is of the Jews.</q>
                  <p>Hereupon Mr. <hi>Hildersham</hi> observeth,
that our Saviour in commending the
Worship and Religion of the Jews,
makes himself one of their number,
acknowledgeth himself a Member of
their Church, professeth that himself
did worship God as they did; from
whence this Doctrine ariseth for our
Instruction.</p>
                  <p>That those Assemblies that enjoy the
Word and Doctrine of Salvation,
though they have many corruptions
remaining in them, are to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the true Churches of God, and
such as none of the faithful may make
separation from.</p>
                  <p>We shall need no further proof of
this Doctrine, than the example of
our Saviour himself. If we consider
of the one side how corrupt the state
of the Jews Church was in his time,
and on the other, how far our Saviour
did communicate with them.</p>
                  <p>For the first, what the state of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100451:52"/>
Church was in his time, we may know,
if we consider. First, What the Priests
and Teachers were themselves, that
had the ordering of God's Worship.
Secondly, What the people were with
whom he was to joyn in Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
Thirdly, What the Worship it
self was, wherein he was to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate.</p>
                  <p>First, The Priests and Teachers were
ignorant and unlearned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 16.
Secondly, They were wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 3. Thirdly, They
had a corrupt and unlawful entrance
into their Calling, yea, even the high
Priest himself. For whereas by Gods
Ordinance he was to hold that Office
during life, their Office was bought
and sold, and made Annual, <hi>John</hi> 11.
49. <hi>Caiphas</hi> was high Priest for that
year.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And what were the people? surely
the most of them in all places were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
and obstinately wicked. In</hi>
Nazareth, <hi>where he had lived most;
See what they were,</hi> Luke 4. 28,
29. All that were in the synagogue,
when they heard this doctrine, were filled
with wrath, and rose up, and thrust
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100451:52"/>
him out of the city, and led him to the
edge of an hill to cast him down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.
<hi>But were they better in other
places.</hi> He upbraided all the cities,
where most of his great works were done.
Wo be to thee, Chorazin, Wo be to thee,
Bethsaiada, <hi>Matth. 11. 20, 21. And
were the people of</hi> Jerusalem <hi>any
better. You shall perceive that by
that affection they shewed at the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of our Saviour, when</hi> Pilate <hi>a
Gentile made such an offer to them.</hi>
Luke 23. 18. All the multitude cryed at
once, Not him, but Barabbas. <hi>And
Matth.</hi> 27. 25. When Pilate had washed
his hands, and protested Christs inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
Then answered all the people, and
said desperately, His blood be on us and
our children.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Worship it self that
was used in the Church, had many
corruptions in it. They used many
superstitions, the observation whereof
they urged more strictly than the
commandments and Ordinances of
God, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 9. The Temple was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned,
and made a <hi>den of thieves,</hi>
Matth. 21. 12, 13. The Discipline and
Censures of the Church were shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100451:53"/>
abused, <hi>John</hi> 9. 22. The Jews
had decreed, that if any did confess
that Jesus was Christ, he should be
Excommunicated <hi>ipso facto.</hi> The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
was corrupt in many points, as
you shall find, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 21, 46. Some
corruptions also were crept into the
Administration of the Sacraments;
for they kept a day after our Saviour,
who observed the just time appointed
by God, <hi>John</hi> 19. 17. The day of his
Passion was but the day of the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to the Passover.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we seen how corrupt the
state of the Church was: And yet
mark how our Saviour made no sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from it, but communicated with
it in the Worship of God.</p>
                  <p>1. When he was an Infant, he was
Circumcised, and by that Sacrament
incorporated into the Church, <hi>Luke</hi>
2. 21.</p>
                  <p>2. When his Mother was purified,
he was brought into the Temple, and
presented to the Lord, and an oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was given for him as for other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<hi>Luke</hi> 2. 22.</p>
                  <p>3. He was content to be a hearer of
such Teachers, that taught in the
Church, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 46.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:100451:53"/>
4. He was every Sabbath wont to
joyn in Publick Prayer with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
that was at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> Luke
4. 16.</p>
                  <p>5. He received the Sacrament of
Baptism in a Congregation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>Luke 3. 21. When all the people
were baptized, he was baptized also.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. He communicated in the Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
with the People and the Priests,
<hi>John</hi> 2. 13.</p>
                  <p>7. He allowed his Disciples to hear
these Teachers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 12. Yea,
he commanded the Leper, whom he
had cleansed, to go and shew himself to
the Priest, and offer his gift in the
Temple, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 4.</p>
                  <p>The reasons why all men are
bound to count such Assemblies true
Churches as enjoy the Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Salvation, and may not sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from them for their corruptions,
are these.</p>
                  <p>1. So long as God continues his
Word and Doctrine of Salvation to a
people, so long it is evident God dwells
among them, and hath not forsaken
them. <hi>I will set my tabernacle among
you:</hi> By which he meaneth his solemn
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100451:54"/>
Worship, whereof this is a principal
part, <hi>Levit. 26. 11, 12. Psal.</hi> 76. 12. And
till God hath forsaken a Church, none
may forsake it. For shall we be holier,
and hate corruption more than the
Lord? It is no sufficient warrant for
any to separate from a Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is guilty of such sins and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
as deserve God should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
it, and for which God hath
threatned in his Word, that he will
forsake it; till it may appear to us God
hath indeed forsaken it, and put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
that which he hath justly
threatned against it, no man may
forsake it. Though Adultery (either
in Man or Wife) be a just cause of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
and that the Bond of Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock
should be broken, so as the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
party may justly forsake the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
yet till a Bill of Divorcement
have past between them, they still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
Man and Wife, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that sin. The Woman, whom her
Husband hath wronged in that kind, is
called his Wife, <hi>Mal. 2. 15. Esau</hi> just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deserved to loose the Prerogative of
his Birth-right and Superiority he had
over his Brother, when he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100451:54"/>
and sold it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 34. And
<hi>Saul</hi> to be deprived of his Kingdom;
yea, God by his Decree and Oracle had
said of <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Jacob: The elder shall
serve the younger,</hi> Gen. 25. 23. and of
<hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> that he had rejected
the one, and appointed the other to
Reign in his stead, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 14. and
15. 23, 26, 28. And yet till the Lord
saw it good to put this Decree and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
in execution, and actually to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the one from his Birth-right, and
the other from his Kingdom, <hi>Jacob</hi>
acknowledgeth <hi>Esau</hi> his Superior, his
Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 4, 5. and so did <hi>David
Saul, 1 Sam.</hi> 24. 7, 9. So though a
Church, for the many corruptions
in it be unworthy the name of Christs
Church, and be also such as the Lord
hath threatned to make no Church,
yet till the Lord hath put this his threat
in execution, and takes away his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
and Worship from it, it is
still to be acknowledged and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced,
as the Church of Christ.</p>
                  <p>2. Because no separation may be
made from those Assemblies, where
men may be assured to find and attain
Salvation. <hi>Lord to whom shall we go,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100451:55"/>
thou hast the Word of eternal life?</hi> saith
<hi>Peter</hi> to our Saviour, accounting this
as a sufficient reason why they might
not leave him, <hi>John</hi> 6. 68. But men
may be sure to find Salvation in such
Assemblies, where the Ministery of
the Word and Doctrine of Salvation
is continued. For the Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christ is called Salvation
here: and <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. because it is the
ordinary means ordained of God to
bring men to Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. Yea it is at one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
effectual in all Gods Elect that do
enjoy it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>James 1. 21. Calls it</hi> the engrafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
word, which is able to save your
souls.</p>
                  <p>Use 1. To teach us what to judge of
our Church, and the Brownists that
separate from it. 1. We cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it, but there is just cause of fear
that God may take away his Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
from amongst us, and remove
our Candlestick; Even the general
decay of our first Love may cause us
to fear it, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2. 5. And that a great
neglect of the Censures of the Church
upon scandalous offenders, in respect
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100451:55"/>
of that the Apostle saith, <hi>A little lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
leaveneth the whole lump,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 6.
But especially the general increase of all
filthy abominable sins in the Land, <hi>Deut.</hi>
32. 14. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8. 6. Though we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
our Church to be a true Church,
yet we may not communicate with it
in any corruptions that shall be detected
or approved to be in it. Herein we
have our Saviours Example to guide
us, though he esteemed the Church of
the Jews to be a true Church, and
joyned with it in Gods Worship, yet
would he not communicate with it in
the least corruption, he would not use
so much as their superstitious purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Mark</hi> 7. 6, 7. when they put off
the Passover a day longer than God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
he would not joyn with them
in that, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 17.</p>
                  <p>3. We should mourn for, and shew
our dislike to those things that are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
in our Church, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 4. So did
Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 41. But we may not
separate our selves, nor deny it to be a
true Church, for the reasons above al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</p>
                  <p>Thus far Mr. <hi>Arthur Hildersham</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds

your darling. I pray examine with
sober reason without distemper of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

to a Church Oecumenical? What
are Cities, Kingdoms, States, but Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies

Church is a National contracted;
a National Church is a Domestical en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged.
A Parochial intervenes, of a
larger extent than a Domestical, a
lesser than a National. Such was the

                  <p>The next words of binding and

by the Church, so of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension

                  <p>I dare not press with confidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Exposition that is eccentrical to the

only tender this sense of the Text al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
as probable, without a literal
wrench, which if admitted renders the
Testimony an impertinency as to your
drift.</p>
                  <p>But suppose the words in the most
indulgent acception to your advantage:
Because a heinous, notorious offender,
after reiterated fruitless reproofs, having
disregarded the Charity of a Brother,
and the Authority of his Mother the
Church, is to be proceeded against, or
reputed, rejected <hi>as a heathen and a
publican,</hi> as an alien to Religion; will
you hence argue that without these
Methods of varied addresses, without
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100451:70"/>
admonition ratified with conviction,
you a private person may separate
from the Church, whereof you were
a Member, a Son, and in effect explode
the Church it self, as if it were <hi>a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
and a publican.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no Engine of Logick or
Divinity will conclude it. This Text
stands at enmity with your opinion.
For if a man trespassing were not to
be accounted as <hi>Ethnicus,</hi> or <hi>Publicanus,</hi>
till there preceded a <hi>Dic Ecclesiae;</hi> not
to be branded or deserted, till that
Authority be disesteemed; then 'tis
unquestionable none can separate and
judge a Christian to be a Heathen, any
man to be a Publican at his own
pleasure. Authority of the Church
must be appealed to, and disobeyed, or
else no separation can be confirmed by
this Testimony.</p>
                  <p>You charge afresh, wicked persons
are called dogs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 6. The title
of a dog is a branding obloquy, a name
of reproach in all Languages (as Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
observe) Though the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the comparison of the holy Ghost
is not to be scrupled at, yet your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication

dogs may be permitted to pick up the

                  <p>Thus the Turks in a zeal of Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metanism

Sacred Elements of the Eucharist to
dogs (in a literal sense) which dogs

horrid an impiety and indignity. To
return to your Argument.</p>
                  <p>The Text you urge, forbids that
which is holy to be given to dogs. That
which is holy is there unvailed by the
best Commentators to be the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Doctrine: This debats Sermons
(as well as Sacraments) to Parochial
Members, which you allow to those
whom you account dogs. St. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi>
and <hi>Euthymius</hi> understood these
dogs to be Infidels. In this Notion it

                     <hi>and
to cast it to dogs,</hi> who will not regard,
but revile it.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> exasperated by
this snarling reception deserted the
Jews,<note place="margin">Acts 13. 46.</note> and applied themselves to the
Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>You reinforce your assault, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.
20, 22. to fix the aspersion of dogs on
Parochial Members, being apostatized,
degenerated persons. Without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
discussing of the Texts, I confess
as Infidels are compared to dogs for
barking, and tearing; so are Apostates
for a recidivation of trangression, like
dogs licking up what they disgorge.

You pretend this is contrary to
Gods Word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9. This Text
hath been already sifted. As to your

This debars such offenders from being

                  <p>Your next Text is, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 6. (<hi>If
we say that we have fellowship with him,
and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not
the truth.</hi>) This excludes practical,
habitual Malefactors (such as walk in
darkness) from being comprehended
in the Catholick invisible Church, not
in a particular visible Church. The next
verse points out as an evidence of this
innocence (<hi>Fellowship one with another</hi>)
an united Congregation, not a disjoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  <p>
                     <hi>Your third Citation is</hi> Matth. 3. 7, 8.
And when he saw many of the Pharisees
come to his baptism; he said to them, O
generation of vipers, who had warned
you to flee from the wrath to come.
Bring forth therefore fruits meet for

This by way of Analogy (betwixt
Baptism, and the Eucharist) proves
that every Communicant ought to be a

                  <p>Hag. 2. 12, 13, 14. If one bear holy
Flesh in the Skirt of his Garment, and
with his Skirt do touch Bread or Pottage,
or Wine, or Oyl, or any meat, shall it

said, No.</p>
                  <p>Then said Haggai, if one that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean

offer there is unclean.</p>
                  <p>The Judgement of the Priest was

the Prophet manifests the Sacrifices of

that contract impurity by the dead.

unclean. Whence what can you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

That I cannot peremptorily determine,

                  <p>Hezekiahs <hi>candor deserves a serious

did they eat the passover otherwise than

                  <p>However, I deny your Minor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
which is illogically expressed,
and helps to shape your Syllogism a

I shall crave leave to rectifie, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
it.</p>
                  <p>Let [testified by sad experience] be
inserted in your Major Proposition. A
Church that, testified by sad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
consists of ignorant, prophane,

                  <p>Let your Minor be thus framed.

of your selves from its Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a redress by other lawful ways of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
                  <p>The first part is not so properly a

to calumniate, not demonstrate (The

                  <p>To conclude, as to the first part of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100451:91"/>
your Minor Proposition:<note place="margin">Homo sum de area Christi<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> hujus ar<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

so by the Church.</p>
                  <p>The second part of your Minor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
asserts other lawful ways of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
besides communicating with the
Church of <hi>England</hi> degenerated.</p>
                  <p>Separation is no lawful way, this
is <hi>Petitio principii,</hi> the begging, not
the proving of the Question. This
loud vaunt of other lawful ways is not
unlike the Cyclops clamor in <hi>Homer,</hi>

                     </gap>. It is but an empty sound.
It is the grave Caveat of Dr. <hi>Kellet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dr. Kellett in the first b. of his Miscel. chap. 8.</note>
take it in his own expression. Reasons
more than ordinary, will be expected
by God and good men from him, who
leapeth out of the Church, in which
he was born and bred, kicking at the
breasts of his Mother, running with
the bit in his teeth, his own ways.
He chalks out these paths as the most
lawful ways, and expedients. First,
Integrity,<note place="margin">Jer. 4. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>To wash the heart from
wickedness.</hi> (A Church is ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100451:91"/>
by ill depraved men.)</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>To pray for, and practice hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</hi>
First cast out the beam out of
thy own eye,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 5.</note> and thou shalt see clearly to
cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye,
(<hi>so likewise out of thy Mothers
eye.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>A second Expedient is conference
(without prejudice) with learned pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Pastors of a different Opinion;
that truth (not interest or faction)
may impartially be promoted. If our
addresses be made to, our discourses
held only with those, who are byast
with our own Tenets, we must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be soothed, applauded in our
judgements, not informed and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                  <p>If after these assays having been
sanctified, humbled, having conferred
we remain yet unsatisfied, he prescribes
a retired mourning and silence; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he pleads the current judgement of
<hi>Jerome, Ockam,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Field.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus without separation may the
peace of the Church, and our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
be secured inviolable.</p>
                  <p>Thus with Unity and Humility of
spirit may we uprightly renounce the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100451:92"/>
Errors and Vices of any Members of
the Church, but not renounce the
Church it self for the Errors and
Vices of any of its members.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, you affix to your Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as an appendant to your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as a corollary naturally result<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(though of a far different Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

I have a few things against
thee, because thou sufferest the woman
Jesabel, which calleth her self a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess
to teach, and to seduce my servants
to commit fornication, and to eat things
sacrificed to idols.</hi> I shall not dispute
whether the woman <hi>Jesabel</hi> be meant
<hi>Helena (Simon Magus</hi> lascivious
darling) or <hi>Priscilla,</hi> the wanton Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>Montanus,</hi> or any Gnostick un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chast
favourite (wherein learned Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors
vary in their conjectures)
<hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Junius</hi> understood fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in that verse, to be an idolatrous
sacrifice or worship seconded expresly
with an idolatrous Feast, to eat things
sacrificed to Idols. Because the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
of the Church of <hi>Thyatyra</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
for permitting idolatry; will
you hence conclude, that the Church
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100451:92"/>
of <hi>England</hi> is not to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by a private person in her Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Piety.</p>
                  <p>You object, it was Gods Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie.
I grant a Controversie it was,
not a Judgement, ('tis <hi>lis sub judice</hi>)
no sentence past, no Bill of Divorce,
no Separation. This instance is very
inconsiderately obtruded. How gentle
is the Controversie (<hi>I have a few things
against thee,</hi>) It is no sharp Indictment.
In the immediately precedent verse,
God vouchsafes a high Elogy. <hi>I know
thy works,</hi>

                     <hi>and charity, and service, and
faith, and patience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Jesabel</hi> was suffered, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived
at, yet others were not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
not counsell'd to separate from
the Church for that permission, but
their perseverance in good is instructed,
and a recompence promised, <hi>vers.</hi> 24,
25, 26.</p>
                  <p>Blemishes are recited in other

but the unblemish'd are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
to a Separation, to a Schism, for
any stain or corruption.</p>

                  <p>To prove this, I will instance in the
Ordinance of Excommunication. If all
should be excommunicated, as the word
requires, I could make it appear (though
I heartily desire it were otherwise) that

                  <head>The ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>This Argument is lyable to Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Exception (the terms being va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed,
and thereby multiplied.) But
I shall not scruple at the form,
but answer to the matter of your Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism.</p>
                  <p>The Major Proposition is not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
true to be granted, nor absolutely
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100451:93"/>
false to be denied, but ambiguous to be
distinguish'd.</p>
                  <p>Gods Ordinances is an equivocal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.
Some Ordinances are essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
requisite to the constitution, the
very being of the Church, others are
accidental Ornaments to conduce to
its perfection, its well being: Of the
first sort are the preaching of the Word
only, and the administration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
(in the judgement of the
best reformed Worthies, in direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to the Romanists.) Of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sort is the Ordinance of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</p>
                  <p>That Church which entirely wants
the former sort, is not of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
or Approbation: In the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we must distinguish betwixt not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
Excommunication to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised,
and not practising it, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved;
and in the not practising,
there is a vast difference betwixt a
willing consent, and an unwilling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint.
This last is the case of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> which desires to
enjoy the Ordinance of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
according to the Primitive,
Apostolical Purity, and vehemently
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100451:94"/>
bewails its not enjoying. So that the
substance of your Argument is a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phism,
<hi>A dicto secundum quid ad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum
simpliciter.</hi> From an outward im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment,
to an inward defect in the
Church of <hi>England;</hi> from its disaster,
to its default; from its calamity, to its
impiety, its nullity.</p>
                  <p>I may tender the retortion of your
Argument for its refutation.</p>
                  <p>God never instituted such a Church,
wherein his whole Worship, and all his
Ordinances cannot be enjoyed. But
some, if not all, of the collected
Churches are such, that all his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
cannot be enjoyed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>To prove the Minor, I will instance
in singing Psalms, reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
baptising Infants, which are not
allowed, nor practised in some col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
Churches. I only hint this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion,
and proceed to your illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is over severe like <hi>Dracos</hi>
Law written in Blood, accented with
horror; that you could make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that if we should be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated,
that the Word requires,
that most, if not all, in many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100451:94"/>
should be excommunicated.

                  <p>Here you sentence most, if not all,

Excommunication; in a former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
you widely, expresly charge
the Parishes of the Churches of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
generally to consist of ignorant,
prophane, scandalous scoffers. You

the abominations of many

vilest humiliation of our bodies, the
most abject prostration in Sack-cloath
and Ashes. Yet we are not the sole
offenders.</p>
                  <p>There is little, too little sincerity of

were as guiltless for spiritual trespasses,
as our Parishes are guilty of carnal:</p>
                  <p>That the maturity of our iniquity
(as you urge) may prevent yours, that
there were no tincture, of avarice or
malice out of our Parochial Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations:
That the voice being <hi>Jacobs</hi>
voice, there might be no hands of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau;</hi>
that you were all endowed as
well as titled Saints, to be heavenly
men, according to the Greek Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
sequestred, refined from earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dregs. But the detestation of our
gross offences is no priviledge, nor plea
before Gods dreadful Tribunal, for the
prosecution of your own, though spun
with a finer thread.</p>
                  <p>I pray God of all hands pierce us
with a deep mournful apprehension of
our own personal offences; that our
Parochial Assemblies may be more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

charitable.</p>

                  <p>The second part of your Answer
observes the likeness of Tares to
Wheat, scarce to be discerned. 'Tis
true, in the blade, but not in the ear.
The Text doth manifestly assert their
manifestation.<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 26.</note> (<hi>But when the blade was
sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then
the tares appeared also.</hi>) They were not
permitted to be served before Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,
not because they were obscur'd,
not sufficiently discover'd; but lest
the pure grain should be hazarded to
be rooted up, being so intermingled
with the Tares. When this mischief
of a promiscuous extirpation may be
prevented, Tares ought not to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd,
(I confess) but Tares do often
improve to be so numerous and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in such strength and multitude,
that they prevail above the Wheat, in
this case both must be reserved till
Harvest to be separated.</p>

of Tares.</p>
                  <p>In the renowned dispute the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
betwixt the Catholick Bishops,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:100451:109"/>
and the Donatist Bishops, assembled
by the Edict of the Emperour (our
Controversie being then in solemn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation)
The Parable of the Net col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
the good and bad Fish being
pressed by the Catholick Bishops, the
Donatists were pinch'd so far, as to
confess good and wicked persons to be
in the Church, but the wicked only
covertly, as in a Net in the Sea, whilst
the good Fish are not distinguish'd
from the bad: But the Catholick
Bishops reinforc'd their Parabolical
Argument. The Church is not only
compared to a Net, hut also to a Floor,
wherein the Chaff is more apparent
that the Corn. The Donatists, though
convinced, yet were not silenced, but
clamor'd. This were to constitute
two Churches, one on Earth mingled
with sacred and prophane: the other
in Heaven severed, sanctified, refined
from dress and mixtures.</p>
                  <p>The Catholick Bishops vindicated
the Church to be one and the same,
but not in one and the same state Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant
and Triumphant. The Church
may in some considerations be expressed
mortal, because consisting of mortal
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100451:109"/>
members on Earth, but immortal in
Heaven: As Christ himself was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
before his Passion, but immortal
after his Resurrection. Hereupon the
Donatists reviled rather than argued,
and triumph'd (or rather vapor'd)
when themselves were conquered; as
if a strange Paradox had been vented
in asserting the Church is mortal. The
Catholick Bishops candidly reply:
Times ought to be distinguish'd. The
Church in its present condition admits
corruptible Saints, in its future incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible;
when a mortal dress shall
be exchanged for a robe of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.<note place="margin">Confutatos Ã  Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicis Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistas omnium documentorum manifestatione pronuncians, Aug. in op. Brev. Collat. cum Donat. in fine 3. diei coll.</note>

                  <p>But you are still unsatisfied, that
though Tares be permitted (as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discerned,
covert Hyppocrites) yet
that no way be left that pernicious
weeds should be ejected. I grant they
may be rooted out by excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but I deny a separation without
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100451:110"/>
it. The wholesome Herbs and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
Flowers in the Garden are not
to be neglected, abandon'd, because
some pestilent weeds are not rooted
up. Beware left your separating be
the weeding of our Garden.</p>
                  <p>If you wave Humility and Charity,
your selected Flowers are but perfumed
Thistles; like the <hi>Ibides</hi> in <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
which exclude one stench, but create
another.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, you Syllogise.</p>
                  <p>If Christ should allow of wicked
men to be taken into his Church, and
to be continued in, he would contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
himself, as hath been proved.</p>
                  <p>But Christ doth not contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Therefore,</p>
                  <p>Not to except against the illogical

we do not separate. I shall not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
this debated Problem, with the
Rabbinical dilatory evasion in such
disputes, When <hi>Elias</hi> comes, he will
resolve us. In the mean time, we
are countenanced by the uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

Churches in all ages, excepting such

recorded for Schismatical at least, if
not Heretical.</p>
                  <p>You argue, that Ministers are like
good Stewards to divide the word
aright, and to give every man his
portion. In this you bicker only
with your own shadow. I shall not
discuss the confirmation by Text,
2 <hi>Tim. 2. 5. 1 Cor.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3. Since I
grant the whole assertion. It is their
duty to divide the word aright, or
to handle it, according to the Remists.
(The Latin Fathers calling their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
Tracts, as the Greek Tomes)
To preach the Word aright (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

You conduct my Pen from the
Ministers to the Church, alledging
<hi>Gods church to look to it,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 4, 5.
This objection hath already past the
Anvil. Neither the active care nor

doth properly belong to the whole
Church collectively, nor to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

not to those that tug and row: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
you will consound the Helm and

the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. (<hi>Obey them

to their Ecclesiastical censure.</p>
                  <p>As to your objection. Grant your
own expression in your own interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
(that the <hi>Church is to look to it</hi>)
This warrants the Church to censure
its Members, it doth not justifie the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:100451:117"/>
Member to censure the Church, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from it.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, you add, 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 6. It is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to the same man that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked
