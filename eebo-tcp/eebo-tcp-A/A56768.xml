            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SOME OBSERVATIONS Made upon the ROOT called Caſmunar, Imported from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THis rare and excellent Root being ſent me by my Brother, who is Factor to the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company, and it being ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully commended, and approved of by the <hi>Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> for its great Cures, I could not chooſe but publiſh it to the World, for the Advantage of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Brachmanes</hi> are a ſort of <hi>Indian</hi> Phyſicians, much celebrated not only by the Natives, but by Foreign Merchants that reſide there, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring them before their own Countrey Doctors, when they labour under any Diſtempers. They are of the Sect of the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> and as they eat no Fleſh, but are nouriſht by the Produce of the Earth, ſo they rather chooſe to cure Diſeaſes by Plants
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44436:3"/>
than Minerals. They have Great skill in Herbs, and know their Natures, as if they had been inſtructed by <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Solomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Root is warm but not hot, of a very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Quality; it conſiſts of very fine, ſubtil, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous parts, and hath a peculiar Odour, diſtinct from any that I ever ſmelled to: It exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creates the Vital and Animal Spirits, and by its Taſte and Colour may eaſily be known to be Ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative and Cephalick, comforting the Brain and Nerves, and putting the Animal Spirits into Order, when they have been in a Tumult by any Paſſion or Convulſive motions.</p>
            <p>When perſons are in Convulſive Fitts, Nature ſeems to be as it were in an Earthquake, and in its laſt Agony; and by the frequent Returns of ſuch Fitts, thoſe Endowments which diſtinguiſh us from Brute Creatures, are in a great meaſure loſt: our Underſtanding, that great Light, is darkned, and our Memory that excellent Repoſitory is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and like a Sive lets through whatever is put into it.</p>
            <p>A Gentlewoman who had a Concuſsion of her Head, cauſed by a Fall down Stairs, with great Debility of her Spirits, was Cured by this Root, to her and my great admiration; and although whileſt her Vapours were upon her, ſhe would not be perſwaded but that ſhe was dying; yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhe would ſmile at thoſe Gentlewomen who talked ſo, and would name her ſelf as an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſo great Folly.</p>
            <p>

Perhaps it is the beſt Medicine in the World for Women in Childbed, or any who have received prejudice by Frights, they quickly reſtore them to the uſe of their Senſes, and make them lively and chearfull.</p>
            <p>A Shop-keepers Wife at <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who had dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Fits of the Mother, with unuſual Symptoms, and great Oppreſſions, almoſt ſtrangled with ſuffocating Vapours in her Throat, was cured, that they have not returned, nor I ſee no ſuſpicion of it. But I muſt ſay, that I have ever found the Spirit, the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and the Extract drawn out of this Root, far more effectual than any Compoſition whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>It's very lamentable to obſerve, three thouſand in a Year tumbled into their Graves by theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, as we find by the Bills of Mortality.</p>
            <p>When our Compaſſionate Saviour was upon Earth, he demonſtrared his Divine Power in the Cure of theſe Diſtempers more than in any other; becauſe labouring under theſe Diſeaſes, we are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fit for the ſervice of God or Man, nor are capable of the Exerciſe of Reaſon or Faith.</p>
            <p>I could tell you of a Learned Divine, whoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in his Head was ſo great, cauſed by Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Diſtempers and Vertiginous Fumes, that he could not preach, being attended with frequent Convulſive Motions in all his Nerves, yet by the uſe of the Drops drawn out of this Root, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:44436:4"/>
Many young Children have been miraculouſly reſtored by it from Convulſion Fits, both in the Brain and Bowels: For as Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, The Griping in the Guts is but an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Nerves in thoſe parts, and no Remedies ſo efficacious in that Diſeaſe, as thoſe that ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the ſame.</p>
            <p>I cannot chooſe but recommend it to all Nurſes, to drop into their Childrens Victuals, it being ſo exceeding temperate and pleaſant, that I have known them take it, when they have refuſed all other Forms of Medicines.</p>
            <p>By this wonderful Root ſome Children when they have been Toothing, were cured only by Rubbing their Gumms with the Electuary: Others by the Nurſes taking the Drops in all her Drink, for which Cauſe it's called by ſome the <hi>Childrens Guardian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know a young Gentleman, who being ſubject to Convulſions from his Cradle, and could have no relief from the beſt Remedies in vulgar uſe, but was to the grief of his Relations caſt ſometimes into the Fire, and ſometimes into the Water, by the Force of this Diſeaſe; and at laſt by the uſing of theſe Drops every New and Full Moon, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and Married a Wife, and none of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ever had Fitts.</p>
            <p>A poor Old Woman alſo who was many years afflicted with Fits of the Mother, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44436:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
People thought her Poſſeſs'd, her Symptoms of Skreeching, and ſtrange Motions and Diſtorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ſo terrible; yet by the Uſe of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy found great Advantage, and recommended it to all ſhe knew.</p>
            <p>I am credibly inform'd by an Eminent Chyrurgion who came from the <hi>Indies,</hi> that the Inhabitants in thoſe Countreys Anoynt their bodies with a mixture of the Powder of this Root, and only by that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Application cure many Diſtempers, and live to a great Age.</p>
            <p>An able Phyſician of my Acquaintance boyls the ſliced Root in all his Broath, as a great Secret a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gripings in his Guts and Bowels proceeding from the Wind Collick, and finds Admirable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>I am well aſſured that there is an Hoſpital in <hi>Italy,</hi> for the Cure of Lunatical perſons, where the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors uſe this Root with wonderful ſucceſs, it mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Relieving all Diſcompoſures of the Brain.</p>
            <p>To ſee Perſons foaming at mouth, Tearing their Hair, beating their Breaſts, Weeping, and Wailing, and Gnaſhing their teeth, is a Melancholy Proſpect, and may well move pity: And therefore none but the Devil or his Agents can Envy mankind the Knowledge of ſo uſeful a Remedy.</p>
            <p>Let none deſpiſe this Root becauſe it is a ſimple uncompounded thing, for I remember the Great Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> reckons it amongſt one of the Deficients in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44436:5"/>
Phyſick, that we ſtudy Art more than Nature, and Elaborate Methods more than ſimple Medicins. Whereas nine parts in ten of the known World truſt to the latter more than the former.</p>
            <p>A Captain of a Ship who is Extreamly troubled with Griping in his Guts, and Cramps in his Bowels, conſtantly procures Eaſe, only by Chewing a bit of this Root and Swallowing his Spittle.</p>
            <p>I know a modeſt diſcreet young Gentleman, that on a ſudden when he is Writing, o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Twenty Drops of the Tincture are to be taken every Morning in Tea, the ſame Quantity of the Spirits every Afternoon in Mum, and alſo twenty Drops of the Extract at Night in Chocolate, for Men or Women; half the Quantity for Children.</p>
