            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>All Creatures but Man, haue continued in the kinde and nature of the first Creation; The Sunne, the Moone, the Starres, and euery Planet in his seuerall orbe or <hi>Sphere,</hi> haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued their order to the glory of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, euer since the day of their first Creation.

It is the worst world (saith an old Man) that euer was, and the best that euer will be. No maruell if Nature grow out of kinde in the procreation of children, when men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally goe out of kynde in the Actes of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Forbidden sinnes are most of all pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised, and sinnes committed that are not to be named: So deepe hath Mans iniquity descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it hath brought mishapen formes and deuises out of hell, and it hath againe soared so high, that it hath brought downe vengeance from heauen.</p>
            <p>This causeth the <hi>Earth</hi> to bring forth prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Monsters, so farre from the faire frame of Nature, that they make Nature her selfe afraid to looke vpon them, in whom shee findes her lawes and order to haue beene vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. Neuer Countrey hath brought forth more, then this of <hi>England,</hi> and that of late yeeres, which haue beene so prodigious, that they haue brought horror to the looker on, and haue also proued certaine predictions, forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many notable euents. The Sea cast forth and horrid Monster of a strange shape and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, vpon the Coast of <hi>Cornewall,</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that fatall yeere <hi>Eighty Eight,</hi> when the <hi>Spanish</hi> fleete soone after frighted <hi>England</hi> with a dangerous Inuasion, euen to the vtter extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation

of the <hi>English</hi> name out of this Land, had not <hi>Almighty God</hi> with his high hand of grace and glory made preuention, returning the <hi>Spanish</hi> purposes vpon them selues. The Island <hi>of Lecale</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> within the County of <hi>Downe,</hi> produced an hidious Monster, bearing the shape both of a Man and a beast, whose eyes sparkling like fyer, and his voyce soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding harsh and shrill, farre from the common strayne, gaue certaine foresignifications of those troubles that the yeere following beganne to vexe both the kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in that fearefull yet memorable warre of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> that in few yeeres after prooued so fatall to both Nations, that it brought wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chednesse not onely to the people then liuing, but hath also prepared misery for the Child yet vnborne, as is too well knowne by the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble death and slaughter, not onely of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort of people, but also by the lamentable ouerthrowes and slaughters of many great, and honorable Personages, famous in blood and quality, that by that vnlucky warre, and other fatall accidents depending thereupon, found vtter ruyne, and destruction, not onely to the incessant griefe of their owne particular families, and dependancies, but also to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall losse &amp; sorrow of all the English Nation: which warre, monstrous warre, (for so I may call it) when the body against the head, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect against the Prince shall rebelliously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire,
<pb facs="tcp:7770:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God neuer gaue vnto the world a more memorable example, either in what vnsurety stands the state of any Name, or Nation, or what vnhappy successe followes such vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall attempts, or finally what end followes such bloody, and despiteous cruelly, as both the head and principall members of that Irish faction, that bloody, and horrid warre, doe at this day endure, as appeareth in the present state, and condition of the Originall of that monstrous warre, bloody <hi>Tyrone</hi> himselfe, and other his Associates, who hauing made by their Attaynders, forfeitures, and confiscations both of lands and goods, doe now wander vp and downe <hi>Spayne, Italy,</hi> and other Countryes, poore, forsaken, wretched, miserable, and hated of all the world.</p>
            <p>There was another Monster produced in <hi>Antwerpe</hi> with foure hands and Armes, two heads, and two bodies, ioynd in one backe, not much vnlike to this Monster, wee are now to write of; and this happened in the yeare foregoing the beginning of those troubles of the low Countryes, which the matchlesse cruelty of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spayne,</hi> hath plagued with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable miseries. But aboue all, that hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous monster bred in <hi>Russia</hi> not aboue fiue yeeres since with three paire of hands, foresignifying that miserable warre that since hath happened, betwixt the three kingdomes, <hi>Russia</hi> (otherwise called <hi>Muscouia) Poland,</hi> and <hi>Swethland,</hi> vnder
<pb facs="tcp:7770:5"/>
the Raignes of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> Emperor of <hi>Russia, Sigismond</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Swethland,</hi> the fame whereof will neuer dye, so long as the memory of those kingdomes states endure.</p>
            <p>It is credibly reported that neere <hi>Lirpoole</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> about a Tweluemoneth since a childe was borne, both monstrous in shape, and strange in accident; It is fresh in memory, though it liued not aboue three dayes. But I stay too long in matters, though extrauagant yet not impertinent to our present discourse, where I am to deliuer as strange a produce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a prodigious birth, as was euer knowne in this part of the world; and this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened but of late, at a Towne called <hi>Adlington</hi> in the Parish of <hi>Standish</hi> neere <hi>Wigon</hi> in the County of <hi>Lancaster;</hi> where there was a childe borne of a strange and wonderfull shape, with foure legges foure Armes, two bellyes, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably ioyned to one back, one head two faces, like double faced <hi>Ianus,</hi> the one before, the other behinde, foure eyes, and two noses. It behoues vs to looke about, when such examples beyond the order of Nature are brought forth to put vs in minde of our iniquities, especially the sinnes of Adultery and fornication, which are euer iustly punished by the righteous lawe and iustice of God, euen vpon the Childrens children vnto the third and fourth generation of them that hate him, who also shewes mercy vnto
<pb facs="tcp:7770:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thousands, in them that loue him, and keepe his commandements, which is well proued in the grace, and blessing that Almighty God secretly infundeth in right generation, the contrary whereof is knowne in the curse that he denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth against Bastardy, which the <hi>Prophet</hi> vtters in these wordes, <hi>Spuria vitulamina non agent ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices altas. Bastard slippes shall neuer take deepe roote:</hi> which was showne in the example of this Monster, the father and mother whereof were both branded, shee with the marke of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdy, and from her Parents crimes in Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, indured this punishment: he of very lewde carriage and conditions: neither was this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster borne in the night time, but towards the day, when the morning Sunne beganne to glad the earth with his brightnesse, to this end, that the blacke mantle of the night should not couer this childe of darkenesse, but that the day might plainely discouer to all eyes this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull example of his Iustice.</p>
            <p>Certaine Gentlemen, and many of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, that were then at Cockepit, when the newes came of this prodigious birth, left their sports and went to behold it with wonder and amazement. Many people came flocking from all places thereunto adioyning, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held it with astonishment. The most impious of all could not but confesse, that it was a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example of Gods fearefull wrath, which God for his mercy sake turne from vs. This
<pb facs="tcp:7770:6"/>
happened a little before Easter Terme last vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on relation of some of the Inhabitants there, Master <hi>William Leigh</hi> Bachelour of Diuinity, a very worthy and Reuerend gentleman, Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the Parish of <hi>Standish</hi> aforesaid, being also an eye witnesse of the same.</p>
            <p>Thus haue you a true relation of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious birth, testified by the generall report, (besides the particular mentions) of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. The consideration whereof I leaue to the godly disposed, whether as a punishment of sinnes and offences past, or as a true foresigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of some notable euent to follow in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding times, or both; Onely thus much, when Nature is thus violated through the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there commonly fall out many strange and vnheard of actions, either for the time present, or to come, such as hath amazed the world to looke vpon, as in that memorable and euer to be adored Passion of our Sauiour, where after his bloody sufferings in his body, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy expiration of his Soule, the vaile of the Temple rent in sunder from the top to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, the Sunne without any natural cause lost his light, and there was a sodayne darkenesse ouer all the Land, the graues opened and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered forth their dead, who appeared in the holy City vnto many. In the same day and yeare the <hi>Panthaeon</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> which was the Temple of the <hi>Romane</hi> Gods, sodaynely fell, and one cryed out in a <hi>Propheticall</hi> manner, that either the
<pb facs="tcp:7770:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
frame of the world was at that time to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or the God of Nature suffered vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>Let vs once more cast backe our eyes vpon the wounders of this mishapen monster (the cause of this Treatise) the report whereof not giuing full satisfaction to some people that were incredulous of it, vnles they might be made also eye witnesses of such an vnheard of accident: the graue was opened againe wherein it had been buryed, and the body layde to the view of a great number of beholders: which were at the least fiue hundreth, that not onely beare a bare report, but can also giue true Testimony of this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current to their much wonder, and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Yet these monstrous and prodigious birthes aswell of other Countreyes as our owne, are not great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

kingdomes) to throw away the rod, that it hath so long held ouer vs, to correct, nay rather to draw blood of vs. Yet all these worke not in vs the effects of our amendment, but that we still wallow in the myre of our wonted wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The foure Elements of <hi>Earth, Water, Ayre,</hi> and <hi>Fyre,</hi> haue seuerally commenced their warres against vs: <hi>Ayre</hi> hath breathed forth pestiferous fumes to choake vs, shee hath burst open the Cloudes of Infection, and hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red sicknesse vpon our heads. <hi>Water</hi> (like <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian Grashoppers</hi>) hath often couered our Cornefields, and eaten vp the fruites of the <hi>Earth;</hi> whilst the <hi>Earth</hi> by that misery hath closed vp her wombe, nothing being promised by her (that hath alwayes beene so plentifull to her Children) but barrennesse. <hi>Fire</hi> hath also had his seuerall dayes of triumph to increase in vs our sorrowes, and to shew vnto vs Gods wrath and displeasure against vs for our iniquities. So that all that is aboue vs, and all that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our feete, haue conspired to worke our ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, or to cause our amendment. Those Creatures, which in the first, and great Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Creation, were appointed to be our Comforters, haue beene many times sent forth and armed with Celestiall weapons to be our destroyers.</p>
            <p>Besides these inflictions, which Tyme (occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioning mens sorrowes and great losses) hath brought forth, there haue beene also many mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
<pb facs="tcp:7770:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the prodigious portraytures of the like misshapen Creatures: which who can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold without trembling? or if hee behold, not shed teares in abundance to thinke vpon Gods heauy indignation against vs? The causes of his iust quarrell with vs, are writ vpon euery mans forehead, the defiance is in our lips, the maintenance of it in our hearts, the end of it (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we suddenly repent, and amend,) wil bee dangerous wounds in our soules.</p>
            <p>There is yet a meanes to be made for recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, the first borne of the great King of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, goes betweene his father and vs as mediator to worke our peace and attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: It may easily be brought to passe and take effect, if we would but vtterly shake of a bad and base company of vgly and detestable sinnes, that hang vpon euery one of vs: If we doe not, let vs bee well assured, that these fatherly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, will bee turned into causes of greater mournings, and these friendly chastisments and beatings, will be changed into blowes not to be indured, to the taking away of our liues for euer.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Earth</hi> that hath yet but begunne to shrinke vp her nerues, and to hide a handfull of her blessings, will open her veynes to swallow vp the memory of them. The <hi>water</hi> that hath gone about but to drowne a few, will be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of generall shipwrackes. The <hi>Ayre</hi> will in surphureous flakes drop downe all on
<pb facs="tcp:7770:8"/>
fire, and that <hi>Fyre</hi> bring the world to a consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to be restored. Yea and these Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous birthes which as yet the Earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in hir wombe, shall at length be deliuered by her, and produced as witnesses against vs of our hardnesse of heart, and obduracy, and of our carelesse negligence and slacknesse of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Nature therefore of the disease be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowne, and the Phisicall remedy heard, be Councelled, take what is ministred (so long as you finde it wholesome) and grow strong both to your body, and your soules comfort.</p>
