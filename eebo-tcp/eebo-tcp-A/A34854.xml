            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS againſt the Bill for Prohibiting
the Exportation of the Woollen Manufactures of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> to Foreign Parts.</head>
            <p>THE Bill for Prohibiting the Exportation of the
Woollen Manufacture out of <hi>Ireland</hi> to Foreign
Parts, being now under your Lordſhips Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
I have preſumed to offer my Thoughts concerning
it, and ſhall endeavour to ſhew it will be detrimental to the
Intereſt of both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> If this hath the end
I deſign by it, I ſhall think my time well ſpent; If not, I
hope the Sincerity of my Intentions will atone for my Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of Performance.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin by ſhewing the great Advantages <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
reaps by the Trade of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that your Lordſhips
may judge how little Reaſon there is to be jealous of
them, and how tender this Nation ought to be of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
unneceſſary Difficulties upon them.</p>
            <p>'Tis a common Saying amongſt us, that it would be well
for <hi>England</hi> if <hi>Ireland</hi> was under the Sea; whereas I hope
to make it appear, that <hi>England</hi> gets more by <hi>Ireland</hi> than
by the Trade of the whole World beſides; and if in the late
Reigns <hi>Ireland</hi> had not in a great meaſure ſupplied the
Loſſes we ſuffer'd by the French, Indian and Eaſtern Trades,
we had been long ſince undone, and it had not been now
the common Debate of the Town how to undo them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:66381:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
This will appear to be evident, if we conſider the
Particulars relating to both Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Near a third part of all the Lands of that Kingdom,
belonging to Engliſh Proprietors who inhabit here, and
have their Rents conſtantly return'd in ready Money.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, moſt of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
ſpend their Eſtates here; they live no longer in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
than to raiſe a ſum of Money to ſpend here in their
Pleaſures. This is the Seat of Government: Here are
the Court and the Societies of Law: Here all the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Gentry come for Employments, Education, or
Pleaſure; which Conſiderations alone would exhauſt
that Kingdom, if it had the Riches of both <hi>Indies</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will add to this, that <hi>England</hi> ſupplies <hi>Ireland</hi> with
moſt of the Commodities they conſume; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all our frights, there are nine in ten of that
Country, that are able to buy it, clothed in Woollen
Manufactures ſent from <hi>England,</hi> and in exchange we
have very few Commodities from them; for their Cattle
are prohibited, there are Impoſitions upon their Tallow,
Leather, and Corn, which almoſt amount to a Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and laſt Year the Tonnage and Poundage was dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
upon their Linen and other Manufactures; and ſuch
Commodities as are ſuffer'd to come from thence are either
abſolutely neceſſary to us, or Materials for our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,
as Wooll, Flax, Cony skins, raw Hides, Sheep-skins,
Rape-ſeed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In times of Peace there was near 100000 <hi>l. per annum</hi>
return'd near to the Court, beſides the Charge of that
Government; and ſince the War they have contributed
to the Publick Charge as far as their late Misfortunes
would ſuffer them, and without doubt in a new War
will advance large Supplies of Men and Money, if we
do not diſable them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:66381:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Beſides this, moſt of the Trade of that Kingdom is
carried on by Engliſh Stocks, and in Engliſh Bottoms;
and a great number of their E<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tates are mortgaged to
Engliſh Men at the unreaſonable Intereſt of ten <hi>per cent.</hi>
They are but Factors, and moſt of the Profit redounds to
us; they toil for our Advantage, they ſow and we reap.</p>
            <p>I have enumerated theſe Particulars, to ſhew, that
whatſoever <hi>Ireland</hi> gets by Trade from the whole World
centers in <hi>England,</hi> and is returned hither by Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
from <hi>Spain, Holland, France,</hi> the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> and
other places. If they gain'd ten Millions a Year, it
would come to <hi>England;</hi> and if they get but ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pounds, we can have no more from them. They
have no Mines of Silver and Gold, and therefore can
ſend none to us but what they get firſt from others; and
if we hinder them from making Advantages of other
Nations, we can make none of them; ſo that what is
loſt in the Pariſh is got in the Hundred. Nor is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould advance in Riches in any propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>England,</hi> for the former Iſſues will draw away
their Wealth as faſt as ever they get it: and this is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
by twenty Years Experience before the War; for
though they got a great many Millions over-balance
from the reſt of the World, yet according to the beſt
Computations they never had above three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pounds in that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Particulars I have mentioned amount to above
<hi>600000 l. per annum,</hi> beſides the great Advantages we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by being ſupplied from thence with Materials for
our Manufactures, as before-mentioned. If ſo, I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to your Lordſhips, whether the Over-balance we
have of the reſt of the World amount to as much more:
If it does, I am ſure we ſhall quickly be a rich People;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66381:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but if not, then how tenderly ought we to uſe a Nation
that yields us ſo much Profit? There is a Mediocrity in
Nature which we cannot exceed without deſtroying what
we deſign to advance. Moderate Impoſitions raiſe large
Sums, and great ones often raiſe nothing. We may ſheer
our Sheep ſo cloſe, as to flee them that they ſhall never
bear Wooll again. I have heard of a Man that try'd to
bring his Horſe to live without Meat, and then he died.
I wiſh this be not the caſe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that we deſire to
get ſo much from them, till at laſt we put them out of a
condition to pay us any thing.</p>
            <p>But there is another Conſideration which ſtrikes deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
yet; Whether by Bills of this kind we ſhall not make
the Poſſeſſion of that Kingdom inſecure to us, and after
ſo much expence of Blood and Treaſure at laſt throw it
again into Iriſh hands.</p>
            <p>My Lords I have heard but of two ways of keeping con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
Countries in Subjection, by Arms, or by Colonies</p>
            <p>As to the firſt (beſides the Charge of it, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
eats up the whole Profit) I think few will deny but
it is equally dangerous to the conquering or the conquered
Country: There can be no Force in the Province but may
be brought to the Mother Kingdom; and if they are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
without other Aſſiſtance to keep one Country in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Subjection, in time they will keep the other ſo too.</p>
            <p>The other way is by Colonies, and this is the method that
free Governments have always taken to ſecure their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts.
This <hi>Rome</hi> did for four hundred years, till at laſt
their Conqueſts were ſo large that their Government
grew top-heavy, the Trunk was not large enough to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
its Branches. This our Anceſtors did to ſecure
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and is the eaſieſt, leaſt chargeable, and leaſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Method.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:66381:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Now the eſtabliſhing Colonies, my Lords, is often done
by eſtabliſhing the conquering Army on ſome part of the
conquered Lands, ſometimes by ſending forth a number of
your People to inhabit there; but always by giving them
ſuch Encouragements, that it ſhall be their Intereſt to keep
the Natives in ſubjection.</p>
            <p>This is the caſe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that after five hundred years
contending, 52 Rebellions and Maſſacres, to the loſs of a
Million of Engliſh, the conquering Army often planted in
the Country, and multitudes beſides leaving <hi>England</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit
there, almoſt the whole Kingdom is at laſt got into
the Engliſh hands; and if we ſhould lay ſuch difficulties up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, that they ſhould think it their Intereſt to leave the
Country, or not be very ſolicitous for the Engliſh Intereſt
there, I ſubmit to your Lordſhips great Wiſdom, whether
that Kingdom may not hereafter give us freſh trouble.
<hi>France</hi> is but a new Friend, and <hi>Scotland</hi> for late reaſons is
not much in humour with us; and we know the whole
North of <hi>Ireland</hi> is inhabited by that Nation, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of them go over every day, and will do ſo notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
this or any other Law that can be made.</p>
            <p>I would not ſuggeſt ſuch improbable and ſuch wicked
thoughts, as that the Engliſh of that Country ſhould join
with them in any Intereſt but in ſubſerviency to <hi>England;</hi>
but I hope I may ſay without offence that the better any
People are uſed, the better Subjects they will make: And
I believe no one will deny, if they had thought it their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
to have joined with the late King, we had had much
more trouble in reducing the Country. The Town of
<hi>Londonderry,</hi> the <hi>Iniskillen-men,</hi> and the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
had their ſhare, and a conſiderable one too, in bringing
the Country to obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:66381:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
No one knows what unhappy occaſions may ariſe in
ages to come of difference between our Kings and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and therefore we ought to be tender how we make
it the Intereſt of a whole Kingdom to be ſubſervient to
the deſigns of a corrupt Court, who will offer them any
advantages. Moſt of us have read, and ſome of us have
ſeen with our Eyes, thoſe times that Courts have plaid
<hi>England</hi> againſt <hi>Scotland, Scotland</hi> againſt <hi>England,</hi> and
<hi>Ireland</hi> againſt both; and we have heard of the time,
that an Iriſh Parliament hath been called to give Money
to reduce an Engliſh one.</p>
            <p>They are not contending for Power or great Riches;
they neither Trade to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies, Turkey,</hi> or <hi>Africa;</hi>
they have neither <hi>Hamborough, Hudſons-Bay, Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
or <hi>Ruſſia</hi> Companies; they have no Fleets or
Plantations; they ask only the common benefits of Earth
and Air. They deſire only to change their native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
for thoſe they want, and to manufacture a ſmall
part of their own Product, which is a liberty ſeems to be
allowed them by the Law of Nature, and which I don't
find hath been denied by the moſt ſevere Conquerors.</p>
            <p>And here, my Lords, I would diſtinguiſh between
Colonies for Trade, and Colonies for Empire. The firſt
is when a ſmall number of your people are ſent forth to
plant Commodities which your native Country does not
produce, as in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> or elſe when they are ſent
to negotiate a Trade with the Natives, and build Forts
for their Security, as in <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt Indies.</hi> In
both theſe caſes it hath been uſual to reſtrain their whole
Trade to their Mother Kingdom; for there can be no other
reaſon for their eſtabliſhment, and their number being
ſmall, they will have ſufficient encouragement for all their
Charge, Induſtry, and Hazard.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:66381:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But Colonies for Empire ſtand upon quite different rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
they are always planted to keep great Countries in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and prevent the charge and hazard of conſtant ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Armies. Theſe have always received the utmoſt Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
much leſs been reſtrained from making the beſt
advantage of their natural Product, and having their whole
Trade reſtrained to their Mother-Kingdom; but with hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſubmiſſion, the Caſe of <hi>Ireland</hi> is yet harder: for by this
Act they will be reſtrained to carry their Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
to Foreign parts, and the Impoſitions formerly laid,
are ſufficient to hinder them from coming hither, ſo that
they muſt carry them no where.</p>
            <p>But my Lords, if we had deſtroyed the Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> is it neceſſary that all will be made in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that is hindred from being made in <hi>Ireland?</hi> That's a
Tartar's Conceit, that if they kill any man, they ſhall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
enjoy his Wiſdom and Beauty; but I am afraid this
will not be the Caſe of <hi>England:</hi> for <hi>Holland, Scotland, Venice,
Germany,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> pretend to the Woollen Manufacture as
well as they; and <hi>France</hi> hath been always equal, if not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
to us, in their skill of making Stuffs: and can it be
conceived that they will not ſhare, if not in a great meaſure
engroſs the benefit we propoſe in the deſtruction of that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture
in <hi>Ireland?</hi> If ſo, then how much more will it be
to our advantage to receive the whole profit at ſecond hand,
than at beſt to divide it with other Nations, and chiefly with
<hi>France,</hi> which hath always ſent Stuffs to <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi>
as well as <hi>England?</hi> and theſe are the only Nations I have
heard of, which <hi>Ireland</hi> hath dealt with in that kind; and
thô for a few years before the War, <hi>Ireland</hi> might increaſe in
their Manufacture of Stuffs, yet it is very plain it was not
upon the ruines of <hi>England,</hi> for thoſe Manufactures both then,
and during the War, have advanced prodigiouſly here, as
will appear by the Entries in the Cuſtom-houſe, as well as by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66381:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a greater conſumption of them at home; and it ſeems a very
hard caſe to hinder <hi>Ireland</hi> from enriching themſelves, and in
conſequence this Kingdom, at the expence of other Nations.</p>
            <p>But it ſeems we are particularly afraid of <hi>Ireland,</hi> becauſe
we are told they can under-work us, and ſend their Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
to a Foreign Market cheaper than we; which fact
with humble ſubmiſſion is otherwiſe. 'Tis true, common la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in Husbandry is much cheaper there then here, but
ſuch as requires skill and knowledg is not ſo: and this is
true not only in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but in all Countries thin of people,
for there cannot be brought together numbers enough to
carry on any Manufacture with ſucceſs; and if they could,
Stocks and Materials are wanting to ſet them to work: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
naturally men chooſe rather to live in idleneſs and ſloth,
than labour; and in poor Countries, where they can ſatisfy
the ordinary occaſions of life with little induſtry, they will
hardly be perſwaded to learn an Art, to which it will coſt
them ſeven years pains to attain; and thoſe who give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
that trouble, will be ſure to be better paid than in a well
peopled Country, where they muſt either work or ſtrave.
This is the reaſon that in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> where the labour
of a Black, is not worth above Six pence a day, yet an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Artificer will earn a Crown, and ſometimes ten Shillings.
This is the reaſon that linnen Cloth doth not thrive ſo well in
<hi>Ireland</hi> as in <hi>Holland,</hi> where common labour is three times
as dear; and this is the reaſon that Woollen Cloth could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be made in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſo cheap as it is ſent from <hi>England,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
Freight and great Cuſtoms paid there; which
appears by their being never able to ſet up that Manufacture
with ſucceſs, moſt of the Gentry and Merchants of that
Kingdom being cloth'd with Engliſh Cloth. They make on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a few Stockings, Stuffs, and Frizes, which are different
from thoſe made in <hi>England,</hi> and the ſale of them is more ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the particular way of making them, than any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66381:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the price; and yet notwithſtanding they ſend but very
few abroad, it appearing by the Cuſtom-houſe Books of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that the Woollen Manufacture imported into <hi>Ireland</hi>
from <hi>England,</hi> is ten times the value of what is exported
from <hi>Ireland</hi> to the reſt of the World. But admitting they
could work cheaper there, yet 'tis no conſequence they can
ſell the Manufacture cheaper. There are ſeveral Foreign Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
neceſſary to it, which come cheaper to us than them:
beſides, the difference of Intereſt gives us a great advantage.
No man will imploy his Time and Stock in any Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
without trebling the common Intereſt of his Money.
This Conſideration alone makes above fifteen <hi>per cent.</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
beſides, men upon ſmall Stocks, and in a poor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
will expect to get much more in proportion, than upon
great ones in a rich Country, becauſe there are ſo many ways
in the former, of turning their money to advantage. Great
Stocks and low Intereſt carry away the Trade of the World;
and, as is obſerved by Sir <hi>Joſiah Child</hi> in his Book of Trade,
where Labour is deareſt, there are moſt Manufactures, as in
<hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> more than in any Countries in <hi>Europe,</hi>
and in the Weſt of <hi>England</hi> more than the North. Whether
this is the Cauſe or Effect, is not material, ſince 'tis plain that
Dearneſs of Wages does not deſtroy Manufactures, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
is an Evidence that they thrive, as we experience every
day, that when the Woollen Manufacture is moſt deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
Wages run higheſt.</p>
            <p>But they tell us, that <hi>Ireland</hi> will drein away our People;
thô by the way they give but a ſcurvy Argument for it, when
they ſay, they can earn leſs Wages there. Now, my Lords,
I could be glad to know how many People have gone to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
that could live in <hi>England?</hi> Few Men leave their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
their Acquaintance and Relations, but for neceſſity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they would not hang or ſtarve at home; Men who are
in Debt, Unfortunate, or ſpent what they had; and if they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66381:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had not <hi>Ireland</hi> to go to, would go to the Plantations, or elſe
to <hi>Holland</hi> and other Countries, and be loſt to the Kingdom
for ever.</p>
            <p>But what ſhall thoſe men do, that are bred up to that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and underſtand nothing elſe? Men that
have ſpent their whole Life-time in learning an Art, will not
go to School again to learn a new one: They will rather
leave their Country, and find another, where they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
more Encouragement. They can't come to <hi>England,</hi>
for the Laws of the Poor prohibit them to live in any Pariſh:
<hi>Holland</hi> will receive the Proteſtants, and <hi>France</hi> the Papiſts;
or perhaps they will go to ſome Country, and ſet up the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture
where 'tis not yet pretended to. All the Nations in
the World would promote any Propoſition of that kind, and
with open Arms receive thoſe who would give them any Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
'Twas the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi>'s driving out the <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>emins
that ſet up the Woollen Manufacture in <hi>England,</hi> and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
in <hi>France</hi> hath very much improv'd it, and many of
the French Proteſtants for want of Imployment in <hi>England,</hi>
are gone to <hi>Ireland;</hi> and if we ſhould drive them and other
Proteſtants out there, they will go ſomewhere elſe, where
they will be ſure to be received: and the Conſequence to
the Publick is the ſame, whether People leave their Country
for fear of Perſecution, or becauſe they can't live in it; but
the Conſequence will be much more fatal to <hi>Ireland,</hi> by dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
out ſuch a number of Proteſtants, to the leſſening the
Engliſh Intereſt there.</p>
            <p>And after all, are we ſure, my Lords, this Act will anſwer
the ends deſigned by it? I would not ſuggeſt ſo unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
a Thought, as that the Magiſtrates in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould
not do their utmoſt to execute it, but that we find the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
in other Countries are not over-zealous for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Intereſt when their own is concerned. Few Men are in
any Imployments in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but either have or hope to have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66381:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an Intereſt in the Country: and what probability can there
be of having a Law well executed, when the Nobility, the
Gentry, and the whole Body of the People have an Intereſt
againſt it? We have an Inſtance of this in the Coaſts of <hi>Kent</hi>
and <hi>Suſſex:</hi> for though 'tis the Intereſt of the whole Kingdom
beſides to prohibit Wooll going to <hi>France,</hi> yet becauſe 'tis the
Intereſt of a few hundreds that it ſhould, all the Laws made
to the contrary have proved ine<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fectual; and in my humble
Opinion it is worth your Lordſhips deepeſt Conſideration,
whether this Law may not put <hi>Ireland</hi> upon negotiating a
ſecret Trade with <hi>France,</hi> than which nothing can be more
fatal to <hi>England.</hi> But there is another Country that pretends
to the Woollen Manufacture nearer than <hi>France. Scotland</hi>
fies but three hours ſail from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the whole North
of that Kingdom is inhabited by Scots, and if we ſhould
put ſuch Hardſhips upon them, I am afraid it will not be an
eaſy matter to hinder their trafficking with their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
which may be done in little Boats; and what is not
work'd up in <hi>Scotland,</hi> may be ſent from thence to <hi>France.</hi>
The whole Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> thinks it as much their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
as ours to prohibit the carrying their Wooll to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Parts: but if we ſhould hinder them from ſharing in the
Benefit of that Law, 'tis to be feared they will ſend it where
they can get moſt for it, notwithſtanding this or any Laws
that can be made to prevent it. Beſides, there is another
thing worthy of Conſideration, whether if we ſhould hinder
the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> from ſending any of their Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
abroad, they will not agree together to ſpend none
but their own at home, which if they do, this Act will recoil
upon <hi>England</hi> with a witneſs. The Bill prohibiting their
importing Iriſh Cattel hath put them upon Navigation, and
an extentive Trade with other Nations; and 'tis to be feared,
if we ſhould hinder them from ſelling their Manufactures to
other Nations, they will have Wit enough to ſpend none
but their own in <hi>Ireland.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:66381:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But if, my Lords, notwithſtanding all that may be ſaid, it
ſhall be thought the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> to deſtroy the Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Manufacture in <hi>Ireland,</hi> there is an eaſier and Gentler
way of doing it. The Power of the Government is very
great in that Country, and may give it ſecret Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and let it decline by degrees: they may divert it by
ſetting up the Linnen Manufacture in the places where the
Woollen moſt proſpers. Perhaps the Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
now they ſee the Pleaſure of <hi>England,</hi> will do their Endeavours
to divert their Stock and People to the Linnen Manufacture;
but with the utmoſt <hi>Submiſſion</hi> I ſay it, that it ſeems too ſevere
to tell them and the whole World in ſo ſolemn a manner, that
they ſhall not Manufacture any of their own Product; it
bears a Sting in the Tail of it, and teaches them this hard
Leſſon, that whenever hereafter they with great Charge,
Hazard, and perhaps forty Years Induſtry arrive to a degree
of Perfection in any thing, if it appears to be the real or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> to ſuppreſs it, all their hopes and
Endeavours muſt be daſht to pieces in a moment, their Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
are already prohibited, their Corn, their Leather, their
Tallow, are ſo in a great meaſure, they cannot come from
the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> but muſt touch in <hi>England:</hi> But this Bill goes
farther yet; it ſays, in effect, they ſhall not bring their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
here, nor carry them any where elſe: why may
they not expect that another Parliament will ſay, that the
carrying abroad their Beef will leſſon the Price of our Beef,
the carrying abroad their Corn will leſſen the Price of our
Corn, and ſo the reſt of their Commodities; and with ſo
much the greater probability, as they have the Precedent
of this Act to juſtify the Reaſonableneſs of it; Nay, my
Lords, 'tis the common Subject of the Pamphlets, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of the Town, that it ought to be done already; and
what Aſſurance ſhall they have that the Linnen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
(which they are ſo often complimented with) will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66381:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be ſet up in <hi>England?</hi> It hath been often attempted, and
the want of Succeſs in my poor Opinion hath been more
owing to the Stock-jobbing and ill Conduct of the Managers,
than any reaſon from the nature of the thing: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
a great deal of Linnen is made in <hi>Lancaſhire, Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland</hi>
and other Parts of the North of <hi>England,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
already to grumble at the bringing in Flax and Linnen
from <hi>Ireland.</hi> And if thoſe Countries ſhould improve in that
Manufacture, I know no reaſon why it ſhould not be as
much Juſtice to prohibit the Linnen Manufacture in <hi>Ireland</hi>
as now the Woollen, and no doubt the Parliament will not
want Petitions to that purpoſe; they trade in no Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that <hi>England</hi> does not produce, and if they muſt not
trade in thoſe, they muſt trade in none; and then the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
at beſt will quit the Country, and it muſt be maintained
by vaſt Armies ſupported by the Men and Money of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and even that is an uncertain Security, when all the
Natives are their Enemies, and neighbouring Nations ready
to aſſiſt them. But what ſeeems hardeſt yet is, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>England</hi> ſhould do that, now almoſt the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is in Engliſh and Proteſtants hands, which was never
thought fit to be done whilſt in Iriſh and Popiſh.</p>
            <p>I have often lamented that ſome method hath not been
found out to make <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> joyn hand in hand in
the ſame Intereſt, that <hi>England</hi> may not look upon <hi>Ireland</hi>
as Rivals of their Trade, nor <hi>Ireland</hi> upon <hi>England</hi> as ſevere
Maſters, who would ſacrifice them upon every imaginary
and perhaps miſtaken advantage. <hi>I</hi> doubt not but Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
of this kind may be offered, but 'tis not now my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
'tis a Subject worthy of the Legiſlative Power, and your
Lordſhips great Wiſdom; but I humbly conceive Acts to ruine
their Trade will work a quite contrary effect, and make <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
look upon <hi>England</hi> inſtead of their Protectors, as the
check to all their endeavours, and the obſtacle to all their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66381:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hopes. I know your Lordſhips are not to be diverted from
your purpoſes by diſtant Surmiſes; but 'tis no diſhonour to
apprehend juſt conſequences; for to fear nothing is as great
an extravagance, as to fear every thing.</p>
            <p>It's your Lordſhips noble Province in this Government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Heaven, to redreſs Grievances, to relieve the Oppreſſed,
and not only to correct the Exhorbitances of Inferiour
