            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In brief, a Quaker is a <hi>Cynick</hi> in Religion, one that would have <hi>Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature</hi> translated <hi>Grace;</hi> as if the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> (that <hi>pure sweet gentle Dove<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire men with <hi>sullen humours</hi> and <hi>waspish</hi>

               <hi>Fifty-Cuffs,</hi> then turn the other <hi>cheek</hi> to the Smiter.</p>
            <p>'Tis a prudent <hi>maxime</hi> in the Art Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, never to think <hi>too contemptibly</hi> of an Enemy. Our Grandfathers saw that <hi>Scotch-mist Presbytery</hi> rising no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then a mans hand, and yet how dismally did it in few years over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread our whole <hi>Horizon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Consider but this <hi>Quaking Gang</hi> in its true dimensions, and the <hi>Arts</hi> they have to promote their Designs, and they will appear more formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable then most of the other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>For, First, They are a People ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally <hi>subtle, frugal, industrious,</hi> and <hi>wary</hi> in their dealing; by which and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44707:10"/>
their large pretensions to a punctual Honesty, they have ingrossed a grand part of the Nations <hi>Trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Whereas other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions are divided into distinct Congregations, and so have seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral particular TEACHERS, who frequently broaching different whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seys, mince them into <hi>Subdivisions,</hi> whilest some dare not hear <hi>such an one,</hi> and others scruple to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with <hi>such a one,</hi> though all of a PARTY.</p>
            <p>The QUAKERS on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, though no two of them scarce agree in all things, doe yet general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly throughout <hi>England</hi> keep themselves up in <hi>one entire Body,</hi> glewed together with a strict Unity, as to <hi>Affection,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:44707:11"/>
and <hi>Correspondence,</hi> as is evident by their <hi>Weekly Collections</hi> in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty continually sent up to <hi>London,</hi> where their common <hi>stock</hi> cannot but in so many years as they have maintained it, be very vast. To which add the exact Accompt and <hi>Registry</hi> they every where keep of all their <hi>Births</hi> and <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials</hi> (which are likewise duely trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted up) so that in an instant they are able to give a near estimate of their <hi>number</hi> and <hi>strength</hi> in all the three Nations. These and some other <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

<q>
                  <l>As white Powder discharges without noise,</l>
                  <l>So many Saint-seeming Hypocrites destroys.</l>

Trust not too far, the soft hand sometimes smites,</l>
                  <l>And Larks are Birds of prey as well as Kites.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, a <hi>Quaker</hi> is a <hi>Canting</hi> thing that Cozens the world by the <hi>purity of his Cloaths,</hi> a few <hi>Close-stool faces</hi> and <hi>whine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expressions,</hi> his <hi>Life</hi> is only a <hi>real Lye,</hi> his Doctrine contrary to all sober <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and withal so <hi>troublesome</hi> that I am grown quite weary of drawing his <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi> and cannot but wish <hi>him</hi> and all his <hi>Trihe</hi> fairly <hi>Embarqu'd</hi> for <hi>terra incognita,</hi> or the late found <hi>Isle of Pines,</hi> underthe conduct of <hi>Penn</hi> their <hi>high Admiral.</hi>
