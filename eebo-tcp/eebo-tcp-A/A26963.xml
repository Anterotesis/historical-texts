            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have Reaſon to judg you no Stran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger
to ſuch Addreſſes as theſe: and
therefore have adventured more
boldly to apply my ſelf to you.
Others would, it may be, rigedly
cenſure this Attempt; but your
more Chriſtian Temper will induce you,
I hope, to judg more charitably, did you
but underſtand with what reluctancy I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
this task.</p>
            <p>I have had many Diſputes with my ſelf,
whether or no I ſhould ſtifle theſe Doubts,
or ſeek Satisfaction. Shame to own ſuch
Principles bid me do the firſt; but the
weight of the Concern obliged me to the
laſt. For I could not with any chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
or with that vigor I thought
did become me, purſue thoſe unſeen Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
thoſe Objects of Faith Religion
holds forth, except I did really believe their
exiſtence, and my own capacity of enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:105299:3"/>
I thought at firſt to ſatisfie my ſelf in
the certainty of the things I did believe,
to confirm and eſtabliſh my Faith by theſe
Studies, that I might be able to render a
Reaſon of the hope that is in me: but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of building up, I am ſhaken; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of a clearer evidence, I am inviron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with uncertainties.</p>
            <p>Unhappy that I am! I had better have
taken all upon Truſt, could I ſo have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
my Reaſon, than thus to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
my ſelf in an endleſs Study. For
ſuch I am afraid it will prove without help:
for that I may not in this Concern reſt
without ſatisfaction; and yet the more I
conſider, and weigh things, the more are
my doubts multiplied. I call them only
doubts, not to palliate any opinions; for
I have not yet eſpouſed any; but becauſe
they have not yet attained ſo much matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
or ſtrength, as to take me off thoſe
things, my doubts being ſatisfied, I ſhould
conclude of indiſpenſable neceſſity; they
are but yet in the Womb: aſſiſt to make
them Abortives.</p>
            <p>I have not been wanting to my ſelf, but
in the uſe of all means to me known,
have ſought ſatisfaction, both by Prayer,
Reading, and Meditation. I have weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and conſulted things according to my
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105299:3"/>
Capacity. I have been as faithful to my ſelf
in all my reaſonings, as I could, and void
of prejudice, have paſſed impartial Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
on the things in debate, ſo far as that
light I have would enable me; and what
to do more, I know not, except this courſe
I now take, prove effectual, you inclining
to aſſiſt me, that I know have ſtudied theſe
things.</p>
            <p>My requeſt to you therefore is, If your
more publick Studies will permit you,
That you would condeſcend to ſatisfie me
in the Particulars I ſhall mention. I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you,
I have no other deſign, but to
know the Truth: which in things of ſuch
moment, certainly cannot be difficult, tho
to my unfurniſhed Head they have proved
ſo: I hope my ſhaking may prove my eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment.</p>
            <p>That I may therefore put you to as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
trouble as I can, I will firſt tell you
what I do believe, and then what I ſtick
at.</p>
            <p>Firſt, therefore, I do really believe, and
am very well ſatisfied, That there is a God,
or a firſt Cauſe that hath created all things,
and given to every thing its Being. For I
am not acquainted with any independent
Being. I know not any thing that is able
to ſubſiſt without the Contribution of its
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105299:4"/>
Fellow-Creatures. I am conſcious to my
ſelf, when ſickneſs invades me, and death
ſummons my Compound to a diſſolution,
I can do nothing to the preſervation of the
Being I enjoy. And if I cannot preſerve
my ſelf as I am, much leſs could I make
my ſelf what I am: For when I was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
I could do nothing. And Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Senſe tells me, As it is with me,
ſo it is with others; as there is none can
preſerve their Beings, ſo there is none
could acquire to themſelves the Being they
have; and if none, then not the firſt
man. And indeed that was it I enquired
after, from whence every <hi>ſpecies</hi> had at
firſt their Beings; the way, how, and
means by which they are continued. I
know not any Cauſe of the Being of any
thing, of which again I may not enquire
the Cauſe: and ſo from Cauſe to Cauſe,
till through a multitude of Cauſes, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
arrive at the firſt Cauſe of all
Cauſes, a Being wholly uncauſed, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Cauſe, except what it was unto it
ſelf.</p>
            <p>My next Enquiry was into my ſelf; and
my next buſineſs, to find what Concern I
have with my Creator: which I knew no
better way to attain, than by ſearching
the bounds of humane Capacity. For I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105299:4"/>
concluded it reaſonable to judg thoſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
I was capable of in my Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I was deſigned for. Now if man is
nothing more than what is viſible, or may
be made ſo by Anatomy or Pharmacy, he
is no Subject capable of enjoying, or loving
God, nor conſequently of a life of Retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution.</p>
            <p>In this Enquiry I found Man conſiſted
of ſomething viſible and inviſible; the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
which is viſible, and ſomething elſe
that inviſibly actuates the ſame. For I
have ſeen the Body, the viſible part of
man; when the inviſible, either through
indiſpoſition of its Orgains, or its ſelf, or
being expelled its Manſion, hath ceaſed to
act (I ſpeak as one in doubt): the Body
hath been left to outward appearance the
ſame; it was yet really void of Senſe, and
wholly debilitated of all power to act:
But then what this inviſible is, what to
conclude of it, I know not: Here I am at
a ſtand, and in a Labyrinth, without a
Clue: For I find no help any where. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have, I acknowledg, defended the
Souls Immortality; but none have proved
the exiſtence of ſuch a Being, and a life
of Retrobution,<note place="margin">Here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

but none have proved a Subject
capable of it. I know all our Superior
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105299:5"/>
Faculties and Actings, are uſually attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the Soul; but what it is in man
they call ſo, they tell us not. To ſay it is
that by which I reaſon, or that now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
to me what I write, is not ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory:
For I look for a definition, and
ſuch an one, as may not to ought elſe be
appropriated. Is it therefore a real Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
really different from the Body, and
able to be without it? or is it not? If not,
whatever it be, I matter not. If it be, is
it a pure Spirit, or meerly material? If
meerly material, and different only from
the Body gradually, and in ſome few de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of ſubtilty, it is then a queſtion,
whether or not that we call Death, and
ſuppoſe a ſeparation of the Compound,
be not rather a Concentration of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Principle in its own Body, which
through ſome indiſpoſition of the whole,
or ſtoppage in its Orgains, through groſs
Corporeity, hath ſuffocated its actings. If
it be a pure Spirit, I would then know,
what is meant by <hi>Spirit?</hi> and whether or
no all things inviſible, and imperceptable
to Senſe, are accounted ſuch? If ſo, it is
then only a term to diſtinguiſh between
things evident to Senſe, and things not.
If other wiſe, how ſhall I diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the higheſt degree of material, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105299:5"/>
the loweſt degree of ſpiritual Beings, or
know how they are diverſified, or be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Being of the Soul is rightly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated.
For to me, an immaterial and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Being, ſeems but a kind of <hi>Hocus,</hi>
and a Subſtance ſtript of all materiality,
a ſubſtantial nothing. For all things at
firſt had their Origine from the deep dark
Waters: witneſs <hi>Moſes Philoſophy,</hi> in the
1 <hi>ſt</hi> of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> on which the Spirit of God
is ſaid to move. I am far from believing
thoſe Waters ſuch as that Element we dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make uſe of; but that they were mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
appears by thoſe multitudes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Productions they brought forth.
And if thoſe Waters were material, ſuch
were all things they d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d produce, among
which was Man, of whom the Text aſſerts
nothing more plain; for it ſaith, <hi>God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
man of the duſt of the earth;</hi> the moſt
groſs part and ſedement of thoſe Waters,
after all things elſe were created. Now
the Body only is not Man; for Man is a
living Creature: it is that therefore by
which the Body lives and acts, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes
the Man. Now the Apoſtle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth
Man to conſiſt of Body, Soul and
Spirit. My Argument then is this, <hi>God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
man of the duſt of the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:105299:6"/>
But Man conſiſts of a Body Soul and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</p>
            <p>Therefore Body, Soul and Spirit are
made of the duſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and are mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.</p>
            <p>The <hi>major</hi> and <hi>minor</hi> are undeniable;
and therefore the concluſion. Yet do I
not therefore conclude its annihilation:
for I know all matter is eternal; but am
rather perſwaded of its concentration (as
afore) in its own body.</p>
            <p>But of its real Being, purely ſpiritual,
and ſtript of all materiality, really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from its body, I doubt.</p>
            <p>Becauſe that by ſeveral accidents hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
to the body, the man is incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from acting rationally, as before; as
in thoſe we call Ideots, there is not in ſome
of them ſo much a ſign of a reaſonable
Soul, as to diſtinguiſh them from Bruits:
Whereas were the Soul ſuch as repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it would rather ceaſe to act, than act
at a rate below it ſelf. Did it know its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
ſuch as we make them, it would
as ſoon deſert its being, as degrade its ſelf
by ſuch bruitiſh acts: It is not any defect
in its Organs could rob the Soul of its
Reaſon, its Eſſential Faculty. Tho the
Workman breaks his Tools, his hands do
not loſe their skill, but ceaſeth to act, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105299:6"/>
than to do ought irregularly: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
would the Soul then act contrary to its
own nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe all the <hi>ſpecies</hi> both of
the Mineral, Vegitable, and Animal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
appear to me, but as the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Works of a moſt excellent Operator,
as Engines of the moſt accurate Engineer;
they all live, and have a Principle of Life
manifeſt in their growth and augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſo far as they are living weights,
as I can perceive from the ſame ſource.
But then comes in thoſe Natures and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
whereby each is diſtinguiſhed from
other, even like ſeveral pieces of Clock,
or Watch-work: the one ſhews the hour
of the day, and no more; the next ſhews
the hour and minutes, another ſhews both
the former, and likewiſe the Age of the
Moon; another hath not only the three
former motions, but an addition of the
riſe and fall of Tides; yet all this, and
many more that in that way are perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
are ſeveral diſtinct motions, ariſing all
from the ſame Cauſe, the Spring or Weight,
the Principle of motion in them. So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
living Weights, the firſt do only
grow and augment their bulk, and have
no poſſibility in nature to augment their
kind; the next, to wit, Vegitables, do not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105299:7"/>
only grow and increaſe their bulk, but
likewiſe have a power of propagating
their like: the third Family, I mean the
Animal Kingdom, do not only live and
encreaſe their kind, but likewiſe are made
ſenſative. And laſtly, we our ſelves that
are not only poſſeſt of all the former, but
of ſomething, I know not what, we think
more excellent, and call Reaſon, and all
this from the ſame ſource; namely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
we live; which if we did not, we could
not perform any of theſe acts. For life
in us is the ſame as the Spring or Weight
in the Watch or Clock, which ceaſing,
all other motion ceaſeth, as in a Watch
or Clock, the Spring or Weight being
down.</p>
            <p>As Life therefore is the Cauſe of all
Motion, and all natural Operation and
Faculties; yet thoſe multifarious Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Faculties, manifeſt in, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the particular <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the Three
Kingdoms, requires not divers Principles
of Life, no more than divers motions ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
in a Watch or Clock, requires di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Weights or Springs. And as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of motion in Watch or Clock, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth
not from diverſity of Weights or
Springs, but rather from other means: ſo
thoſe diverſities of Natures and Faculties,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105299:7"/>
manifeſt throughout the Three Kingdoms,
ariſe not from divers Principles of Life,
but from one Principle of Life, manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
its power in Bodies diverſly organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.
So that a Tree or Herb that only
vegitates and propagates its kind, hath
no other Principle of Life than an Animal
that hath Senſe, and more eminent
Faculties. The difference only, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
is, this Principle of Life in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitable,
is bound up in a Body organized
to no other end, by which Life is hindred
exerting any other power: but in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
it's kindled in a purer matter, by
which it's capacitated to frame more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Orgains, in order to the exerting
more eminent Acts. For the Principle of
Life can no more act rationally in matter
capable of naught but vegitation (for it
acts in matter according to the nature
thereof, advancing it to its utmoſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency),
than a man can ſaw with a Coult-Staff,
or file with an Hatchet, or make a
Watch with a Betle and Wedges.</p>
            <p>I am apt to believe thoſe rare Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and eminent Faculties, wherewith
men ſeem to excel meer Senſatives, are
only the improvement of Speech, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we have the advantage of them, and
the reſult of reiterated Acts, until they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105299:8"/>
become habits. For by the firſt we are able
to communicate our Conceptions and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
each to other; and by the other we
do gradually aſcend to the knowledg of
things. For is all the knowledg either in
the acts, Liberal or Mechanical, any
more than this acts reiterated, until they
become habits; which when they are, we
are ſaid to know them? And what is all
our reaſoning, but an Argument in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
toſſed from one to another, till the
Truth be found, like a Ball between two
Rackets, till at laſt a lucky blow puts an
end to the ſport? We come into the
World hardly men; and many whoſe
natures want cultivation, live, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to diſtinguiſh them from Brutes,
but the outward form, ſpeech, and ſome
little dexterity, ſuch as in Apes or Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys,
in the things they have been taught,
and the Affairs they have been bred to.
And could we imagine any man to have
lived Twenty or Thirty years in the
World, without the benefit of Humane
Converſe, What would appear then,
think you, of a rational Soul? which the
wiſe man well ſaw when he aſſerted the
Condition of Men and Beaſts to be the
ſame what a meer Ignorant hath, <hi>Moſes</hi>
himſelf made of <hi>Adam,</hi> that in his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105299:8"/>
beſt ſtate, knew not that he was
naked: but I believe the Nine Hundred
and Thirty years Experience of his own,
and the continual Experiments of Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
in that time communicated to him,
might quicken his Intellect. So that he
died with more Reaſon than he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and humane nature in his poſterity.
The next Generation was imbelliſhed
with his attainments, to which their own
Experiences ſtill made a new addition.
The next Generation built on their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and the next on their; and ſo on:
and we are got on the ſhoulders of them
all. So that it's rather a wonder, that
we know no more, than that we know
ſo much. So that what we have, ſeems
rather times product, through the means
aforeſaid, than what our Natures were at
firſt enricht with.</p>
            <p>The which appears likewiſe in thoſe
whoſe memory fails, and in whom the
<hi>veſtigia</hi> of things is wore out; the habits
they had contracted, and manner of
working in their ſeveral acts being forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
what ſilly Animals are they? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
were the Soul ſuch as repeſented, who
could rob it of its Endowments? It's true
the debilitating of a hand, may impead a
manual labour; but raſe what hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105299:9"/>
been done out of the Memory,
and you render Man a perfect Bruit, or
worſe: for he knows not how to give a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of his own mind.</p>
            <p>And indeed, I know not any thing
wherein Man excels the Beaſts, but may
be referred to the benefit of Speech and
Hands, capable of effecting its Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
nor find any better way to attain a
right knowledg of our ſelves, but by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
our ſelves in <hi>Adam,</hi> and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
what Nature had endued him with,
which will fall far ſhort of what we now
admire in our ſelves.</p>
            <p>But now ſuppoſing all this anſwer'd,
what will it avail us to a Life of Retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution,
if all return to one Element, and
be there immerged as Brooks and Rivers
in the Sea? If we loſe our Individuation;
and all the Souls that have exiſted, be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up of one, where are the Rewards
and Puniſhments of each individual. And
we have reaſon to judg it will be thus, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than otherwiſe, becauſe we ſee every
thing tends to its own Centre, the Water
to the Sea, and all that was of the Earth
to the Earth, from whence they were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The ſpirit returns
to God that gave it.</hi> Every thing then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to its own Element, loſeth its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuation.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105299:9"/>
For we ſee all bodies return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the earth, are no more individual
bodies, but earth: Have we not reaſon then
to judg the ſame of Spirits returning to
their own Element? And what happineſs
then can we hope for, more than a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from the preſent calamity? or what
miſery are we eapable of, more than what
is common to all?</p>
            <p>The ſame is more evident in the body
with which we converſe, and are more
ſenſibly acquainted with, ſeems wholly
uncapable of either, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For all bodies
are material, and matter it ſelf is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of multiplication, but of being
changed. Therefore Nature cannot mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
bodies, but changeth them; as ſome
bodies ariſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others periſh. Natures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
in continual Productions being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
ſupplied by the diſſolution of other
Compounds: were it otherwiſe, her Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
would be exhauſted; for its by
continual Circulations, Heaven and Earth
is maintain'd; and by her even Circular
motion, ſhe keeps her ſelf imployed on the
ſame ſtock of matter, and maintains every
<hi>ſpecies.</hi> There is no body the ſame to day
it was yeſterday, matter being in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
flux; neither immediately on the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of a Compound, and Corruption
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105299:10"/>
of the body, doth the earth thereof retain
any ſpecifick difference of that body it once
was, but is immediately beſtowed by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and ordered to the new production of
other things. That part of matter therefore
which conſtituteth a humane body, in a ſhort
time is putrified, and made earth, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
produceth either other inferior Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
or Graſs, or Corn, for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Beaſts and Fowl, which again are the
nouriſhment of men. Thus circularly innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
times round, Nature continually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
new forms of the ſame matter. So
that that matter that now conſtitutes my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
it may be a thouſand years ago was the
matter of ſome other mans, or it may be of
divers mens, then putrified; which in this
time hath ſuffered infinite changes, as it may
be ſometime Graſs, or Corn, or an Herb, or
Bird, or Beaſt, or divers of them, or all,
and that divers times over, before my body
was framed; who then can ſay, why this
matter ſo changeable, ſhould at laſt be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
my body rather than his, whoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
it was, or the body of a Bird, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Animal? For by the ſame Reaſons that
the body of man is proved to ariſe again,
may, I think, be proved the Reſtoration of
all other bodies, which is equally incredible to
me (if underſtood at one time). For Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105299:10"/>
ſtock of matter being all at firſt exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
ſhe could not employ her ſelf in new
Productions, without deſtroying ſome of
the old; much leſs can ſhe at once fabricate
out of the ſame quantity of matter, all the
bodies that ever were, are, or ſhall be;
which yet, notwithſtanding could ſhe, they
could not be ſaid to be the ſame bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
all bodies ſuffer ſuch alteration daily,
that they cannot be ſaid to be the ſame to
day they were yeſterday; how then can
they be capable of Reward or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p>Theſe are now my doubts; but are they
the fruits of Diligence? and am I thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
for not believing at a common rate?
A great deal cheaper could I have ſate down,
and believed as the Church believes; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a why, or a wherefore, have been ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of theſe Diſputes, and never have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merged
my ſelf in this gulf, than thus by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
to create my own diſturbance. Had
I been made a meer Animal, I had had none
of theſe Doubts nor Fears that thus torment
my mind; for doubting, happy Bruits hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
far more happy than my ſelf! With
you is none of this; with you only is ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of mind, and you only void of Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties;
you only enjoy what this world is
able to accommodate with, and it may be too
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105299:11"/>
have thoſe Careſſes we know not of, while we,
your poor purveyors, go drooping and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding,
doubting, fearing, and caring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and our whole lives only a preying
on one another, and tormenting our ſelves.
You have the carnal content and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
we nothing but the ſhell, a vain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
boaſt of our Lordſhip over you, with
which we ſeek to ſatisfie our ſelves, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digals,
with husks, while the truth is, we
are afraid to confront our Vaſſals, except
we firſt by craft and treachery beguile them
from whom likewiſe we flee, if once enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged:
and what a poor comfort is this? Is
this a Priviledg to boaſt of? Is this all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
advanceth to, only a Purveyor to
Beaſts, and to make my life more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by how much more ſenſible of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry!
Well might <hi>Solomon</hi> prefer the dead
before the living; and thoſe that had not
been, before both; intimating thereby, that
being beſt, leaſt capable of miſery; that is,
of Trees, of Herbs, of Stones, and all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animates,
which wanting ſenſe, are inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of miſery. Better any thing than man
therefore, ſince that every brute and inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
ſtock or ſtone, are more happy in that
meaſure: they are leſs capable of miſery.
What the advantage then, what the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
that occurs to us from them, or what
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105299:11"/>
preheminence have we above them, ſeeing
as dieth the one, ſo dieth the other, and that
they have all one breath?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pardon this Degreſſion; the real ſenſe
and apprehenſion I have of things, extort it
from me. For I, as</hi> Job, <hi>cannot refrain
my mouth, but ſpeak in the bitterneſs of
my Spirit, and complain in the anguiſh of
my Soul,</hi> Why died I not from the womb?
why did I not give up the ghoſt when I came
out of the belly? Why did the knees prevent
me? or why the breaſts, that I ſhould ſuck?
<hi>I had then been among</hi> Solomon<hi>'s happy
ones:</hi> I ſhould now have lain ſtill and been
quiet; I ſhould have ſlept, and been at reſt:
<hi>whereas now I am weary of life. For</hi> tho
I ſpeak, my grief is not aſſwaged; and tho I
forbear, I am not eaſed; but now he hath
made me weary, and made deſolate all my
company: he hath filled me with wrinkles,
which is a witneſs againſt me; and my lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
riſing up in me, beareth witneſs to my
face, God hath delivered me to the ungodly,
and turned me cver into the hand of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and my familiar friends have forgotten
me. I ſaid, I ſhall die in my neſt, and ſhall
multiply my days as the ſand, when my root
was ſpread out by the waters, and the dew lay
all night on my branch; when my glory was
freſh, and my bow was renewed in my hand:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105299:12"/>
but I find while my fleſh is upon me, I ſhall
bave pain, and while my ſoul is in me, it ſhall
mourn. Have pity upon me, O my friend!
for the hand of God hath touched me. The
wicked live, and become old; yea, they are
mighty in power, their ſeed is eſtabliſhed in
their ſight with them, and their off-ſpring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their eyes; their houſes are ſafe from fear,
neither is the rod of God upon them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they
are planted, and take root, they grow; yea,
they bring forth fruit, yet God is never in
their mouth, and far from their reins. In
vain then do I waſh my hands in innocency, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all things come alike to all. There is one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
to the righteous and to the wicked, to the
good, to the clean, and to the unclean; to him
that ſacrificeth, and to him that ſacrificeth
not: as is the good, ſo is the ſinner; and
he that ſweareth, as he that feareth an
oath.</p>
            <p>I have now done (tho I hardly know
how), leſt I too far trouble you; and only
beg your peruſal of theſe lines, and two or
three in anſwer of them by this Bearer,
who ſhall at your appointment wait on
you for the ſame. Let me farther beg theſe
two things of you: firſt, That you would
conſider you have not to do with a Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
Wrangler, or with one that would
willingly err, but with one that deſires to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105299:12"/>
know the Truth. Let therefore your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
be, as much as you can, void of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtick
Terms, or Notions that may lead
me more into the dark. And then, as <hi>Job</hi>
did beg, That God would withdraw his
hand far from him, and that his dread might
not make him afraid; ſo I. And further,
That you would not awe me with his
greatneſs, nor ſuppreſs my Arguments with
his Omnipotence. Then call thou, and I
will anſwer; or let me ſpeak, and anſwer
thou me. Thus begging the Divine Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to direct you, and enlighten me, I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe

            <p>§. 1. IT is your wiſdom in Caſes of ſo
great moment, to uſe all juſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
for ſatisfaction; and I think you
did but your duty, to ſtudy this as hard as
you ſay you have done. But 1. I wiſh you
had ſtudied it better; for then you would
not have been a ſtranger to many Books
which afford a juſt ſolution of your Doubts,
as I muſt ſuppoſe you are, by your taking
no notice of what they have ſaid. 2. And
I wiſh you had known, that between the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of all your Objections, and taking all
on Truſt from men, or believing as the
Church believeth, there are Two other
ways to ſatisfaction (which muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct):
1. Diſcerning the unanſwerable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
in Nature and Providence, of the
Souls future Life. 2. And taking it on
truſt from Divine Revelation; which is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
to be proved, than by believing
as the Church by Authority requireth
you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:105299:13"/>
I have written on this Subject ſo much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
that I had rather you had told me,
why you think it unſatisfactory, than deſire
me to tranſcribe it, while Print is as legible
as Manuſcript. If you have not read it,
I humbly offer it to your conſideration. It
is moſt in two Books: The firſt which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you to read, is called, <hi>The Reaſons of
the Chriſtian Religion:</hi> the other is called,
<hi>The Unreaſonableneſs of Infidelity.</hi> If you
think this too much labour, you are not ſo
hard or faithful a Student of this weighty
Caſe, as it deſerveth, and you pretend to
be. If you will read them (or the firſt at
leaſt), and after come to me, that we may
fairly debate your remaining Doubts, it
will be a likelier way for us to be uſeful to
each other, than my going over all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes
of your Paper will be. And I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
you know, that we have full aſſurance
of a multitude of Verities, againſt which
many Objections may be raiſed, which
no mortal man can fully ſolve, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
from Modes and Accidents. Nay,
perhaps there is nothing in the World
which is not liable to ſome ſuch Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

<hi>what this God is to man,</hi> as manifeſt in his

<hi>what of man is paſt doubt,</hi> and thence <hi>in

you have the <hi>power</hi> of ſo acting. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

which hath this <hi>power:</hi> For nothing can do
nothing.</p>
            <p>IV. It is evident, that it is <hi>not</hi> the <hi>viſible

and no other. Were it not for the <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous</hi>
Nature which is active, or for <hi>Spirits,</hi>
they would be ceſſant. Therefore you are
thus far paſt the dark, That there is <hi>in man</hi>
an <hi>Inviſible Subſtance, which hath,</hi> yea,
<hi>which is a Power or Virtue of Vital Action,
Intellection, and Volition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. And that this <hi>Active Power</hi> is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
thing from meer <hi>Paſſive Power,</hi> or

VI. And that this is not a meer <hi>accident</hi>
of the Soul, but its <hi>eſſential form,</hi> I have
proved ſo fully in my <hi>Methodus Theologiae,</hi> in
a peculiar Diſputation, that I will not here
repeat it. It's evident, That even in the
<hi>igneous</hi> Subſtance, the <hi>Vis Motiva, Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nativa,
Calefactiva,</hi> is more than an <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>
even its <hi>eſſential form:</hi> But were it
otherwiſe, it would but follow, That if
the very <hi>accidental Acts</hi> or qualities of
a Soul be ſo noble, its <hi>eſſential</hi> muſt be
greater.</p>
            <p>VII. But it is certain, That neither <hi>Souls,</hi>
nor <hi>any thing,</hi> have either <hi>Being, Power,</hi> or
<hi>Action,</hi> but in <hi>conſtant receptive dependence</hi>
on the continued emanation of the <hi>prime
Cauſe;</hi> and ſo no Inviduation is a <hi>total ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from him,</hi> or an <hi>Independence,</hi> or a

you what Souls are.</p>
            <p>§. 7. You add your ſelf, That thoſe <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments

not ſuch noble Faculties or Capacities

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105299:16"/>
and of ſtudying your duty to
him, in hope of Reward, and of thinking
what will become of you after Death, and
of hoping for future Bleſſedneſs, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
future Miſery: all which no Bruit was
ever capable of. Therefore God deſigned
you to ſuch ends which you are thus capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of.</p>
            <p>§. 8. You ſay (<hi>p. 3.) Many have defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

It's a Contradiction to be <hi>immortal,</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,</hi>

How many Score Volumes have told it us?
I have now briefly told you what it is. You

not ſatiſfactory. I look for a Definition</hi>].
But on Condition you look not to <hi>ſee</hi> or <hi>feel</hi>

ſatisfied. I have given you a Definition.
The <hi>Genus</hi> is <hi>Subſtantia puriſſima;</hi> the <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia</hi>

            </p>

Anſw.</hi> I told you, Nothing can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Is it really different from the Body?
Anſw.</hi> A <hi>Subſtance</hi> which hath in it ſelf an

2. Thoſe that are ſeperable, are really dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</p>
            <p>3. You ask, <hi>Is it able to be without it?
Anſw.</hi> What ſhould hinder it? The Body
made not the Soul: A viler Subſtance giveth
not being to a nobler. 2. Nothing at all
can be without continued Divine ſuſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But we ſee, <hi>Juxta naturam,</hi> God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilateth
no Subſtance: Changes are but
by compoſition, and ſeparation, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but not by annihilation. An Atome of
Earth or Water, is not annihilated; and
why ſhould we ſuſpect, that a Spiritual

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It cannot be denied, but the
Operations of the Soul here, are much of
them upon the organized body; and tho
<hi>not organical,</hi> as if they acted <hi>by an Organ,</hi>
yet <hi>organical,</hi> as acting <hi>on an Organ;</hi> which

called Acts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:105299:19"/>
2. And the Soul doth nothing indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
but as dependent on God, in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Operation: and therefore doth
what <hi>God knoweth,</hi> and <hi>uſeth it</hi> too, as his
Inſtrument, in the forming of the body;
and in what it knoweth not it ſelf. And
as God, as <hi>fons naturae<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neceſſitateth</hi> the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
agency</hi> of the Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he doth the
<hi>Soul of Bruits.</hi> But as the wiſe and free
Governor of the world, he hath to <hi>moral

<hi>conducting Reaſon;</hi> which it needs

freely</hi> and <hi>rationally,</hi> ſo neither <hi>at all times,</hi>
as in Apoplexies, Infancy, Sleep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It
is eſſential to the Soul, to have the <hi>active
power</hi> or <hi>virtue</hi> of <hi>Intellection</hi> and <hi>Free-will,</hi>
but not always to uſe it. As it is <hi>eſſential</hi> to

            </p>
            <p>And its conſiderable, that as a traveller
in his journey, thinking and talking only of
other things, retaineth ſtill a <hi>ſecret act</hi> of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending</hi>
his end, (elſe he would not go on)
when he perceiveth and obſerveth it not at

only <hi>per modum naturae,</hi> not by <hi>free-acts,</hi>
but neceſſitated by God by the order
of nature. Only <hi>moral</hi> acts are free; and
that ſome other are but brutiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and

than that it ſhould <hi>underſtand</hi> in the <hi>head,</hi>
and be <hi>ſenſible</hi> only in the moſt of the body,

by <hi>Spirits</hi> alſo as <hi>lucid,</hi> for that
uſe.</p>
            <p>§. 14. But never forget this, That <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at any time doth what it cannot do:</hi> but
many <hi>can do</hi> that which <hi>they do not.</hi> Tho
the Soul in the Womb, or Sleep, remember
not, or reaſon not; if <hi>ever it do it,</hi> that
proveth it had the <hi>power</hi> of doing it. And
that power is not a <hi>novel accident,</hi> tho the <hi>act</hi>
may be ſo.</p>
            <p>§. 18. To your Explications <hi>p.</hi> 4. I ſay,
1. None doubts, but all the world is the
work of <hi>one prime operating Cauſe;</hi> Whom
I hope you ſee in them, is of perfect power,

2. I doubt not, but the <hi>created univerſe</hi>

or part totally ſeparated from, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
on the reſt.</p>
            <p>3. But yet the parts are multitudes, and
heterogeneous, and have their Individua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and are at once <hi>many</hi> and <hi>one</hi> in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
reſpects. And the unity of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
or of inferior univerſal Cauſes (as
the Sun, or an <hi>anima telluris,</hi> &amp;c.) are
certainly conſiſtent with the ſpecifick and
individual differences of the parts.</p>

Millions of Trees, as alſo of Herbs
and Flowers, good and poyſonous, all grow
in the ſame earth. Here is Unity, and great
Diverſity. And tho ſelf-moving. Animals
be not fixed on the earth, no doubr they
have a contiguity, or continuity, as parts
with the Univerſe. But for all that, a Toad
is not a Man, nor a man in torment, undif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenced

man all one with a good.</p>
            <p>§. 19. And if any ſhould have a conceit,
That there is nothing but <hi>God and matter.</hi>
I have fully confuted it in the Appendix to

               <hi>Reaſ. of Chriſtian Religion. Matter</hi> is no
ſuch <hi>omnipotent ſapiential</hi> thing in it ſelf, as

him, is antecedently abſurd, but conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
notoriouſly falſe. For tho nothing
be acted <hi>without him,</hi> it's evident that he

from a <hi>clod,</hi> by more than being <hi>matter va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly

            <p>§. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When you tell us of [<hi>One life in
all, differenc'd only by diverſity of Organs</hi>],
you mean <hi>God,</hi> or a <hi>common created Soul.</hi> If
<hi>God,</hi> I tell you where I have confuted it.
It's pity to torment or puniſh <hi>God</hi> in a <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,</hi>

ſay, That nothing is to be ſeen in the brain
of other Animals, why they might not be
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105299:21"/>
as rational as Men. And if it be an <hi>Anima
creata communis</hi> that you mean, either you
think it is an <hi>univerſal Soul</hi> to the <hi>univerſal
world,</hi> or only to <hi>this Earth</hi> or <hi>Vortex.</hi> If
to <hi>all the World,</hi> you feign it to have <hi>Gods</hi>
Prerogative. If to <hi>part</hi> of the world, if
each <hi>Vortex, Sun, Star,</hi> &amp;c. have a diſtinct

inferiors? And why may not millions of
individual Spirits conſiſt with <hi>more common</hi>
or <hi>univerſal</hi> Spirits, as well as the life of
<hi>Worms</hi> in your belly with <hi>yours.</hi> That
which hath no <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> of its <hi>own,</hi> is
not fit for ſuch reception and communion
with ſuperior Spirits, as that which hath.
Communion requireth ſome ſimilitude. We
ſee God uſeth not all things alike, becauſe
he makes them not like.</p>
            <p>§. 21. But if the difference between
Beaſts, Trees, Stones, and <hi>Men,</hi> be only
the <hi>organical contexture of the body;</hi> then
1. Either all theſe have put <hi>one Soul,</hi> and ſo
are <hi>but one,</hi> ſave corporeally. 2. Or elſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Stone, Tree and Beaſt hath an <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual</hi>
Soul: for it is evident that <hi>man</hi> hath,
by its Operations.</p>
            <p>I. Had you made but <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> to
be only the effects of the <hi>bodies contexture,</hi>
ſure you would only blame the <hi>maker</hi> of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105299:22"/>
your <hi>body,</hi> and not <hi>your ſclf,</hi> for any of
your Crimes: For yon did not make your

            <p>Is the common light and ſenſe of <hi>Nature</hi>
no Evidence? Doth not all the world dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice, moral good</hi> and <hi>evil?</hi>
Is it only the difference of an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Inſtrument in
Tune, and out of Tune? Either then <hi>all
called ſin is good;</hi> or <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>univerſal
Soul,</hi> only is to be blamed. Then to call
you a Knave, or a Lyar, or Perjured, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
is no more diſgrace, than to ſay, that you are
<hi>ſick,</hi> or <hi>blind.</hi> Then all Laws are made on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to bind <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>Amima mundi;</hi> and
all puniſhment is threatned to <hi>God,</hi> or this
<hi>common Soul.</hi> And it is <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>common
Soul</hi> only in a body, which ſorroweth, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
feeleth pain or pleaſure.</p>
            <p>II. And if you equal the Souls of Beaſts,
Trees, Stones and Men, you muſt make
them all to have an <hi>Intellectual Soul.</hi> If man
had not, he could never underſtand. And
if <hi>they</hi> have ſo alſo, <hi>fruſtra fit potentia quae

this, That as the <hi>gravitation</hi> of <hi>one poiſe,</hi>

            <p>§. 24. <hi>You</hi> are apt to believe, That thoſe
eminent Faculties wherewith men ſeem meer
Senſitives, are only the improvement of Speech,

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I had a Parrot that ſpoke ſo very
plainly, that no Man could diſcern but he
could have ſpoke as well as a Man, if he
had but had the Intellect of a Man; and
quickly would learn new words, but ſhewed
no underſtanding of them.</p>
            <p>2. Many men born deaf and dumb, are
of a ſtrong underſtanding (enquire of a
Brother of Sir <hi>Richard Dyett</hi>'s, a Son of Mr.
<hi>Peter Whalley</hi> of <hi>Northampton,</hi> a Son in Law
of the Lord <hi>Wharton</hi>'s, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Faculty</hi> and the <hi>Habit</hi> are Two
things. The <hi>Faculty</hi> is the <hi>Eſſential form</hi>
of the Subſtance. The <hi>Habit,</hi> or Act, is
but an <hi>Accident.</hi> The <hi>Faculty</hi> is nothing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105299:23"/>
but the <hi>active Power.</hi> And the <hi>Power</hi> goeth
before the <hi>Act.</hi> Doth <hi>acting,</hi> without <hi>Power</hi>
to act, cauſe the <hi>Power?</hi> What need you
the Power, if you can act without it? And
What's a Contradiction, if this be not, to
ſay, I do that which I cannot do, or I can
do that which I have no power to do? You
are not a man without the Faculty, but
you are without the Act; or elſe you are
no man in your ſleep. The <hi>act</hi> then is but
the <hi>Faculties act;</hi> and <hi>Habits</hi> are nothing
but the Faculties <hi>promptitude</hi> to act. And
this indeed is cauſed ſometime by very
<hi>ſtrong acts,</hi> and ſometime, and uſually, by
<hi>frequent acts;</hi> and ſometime ſuddenly, by a
ſpecial Divine Operation. No doubt, but
Oratory, and all Arts and Sciences, are
cauſed by frequent acts, and their Objects:
But thoſe <hi>acts</hi> are cauſed by <hi>humane Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
under God, the firſt Cauſe. You can
never cauſe a Carcaſs, or a Parrot, or any
Bruit, to <hi>think of God,</hi> and the <hi>glory to
come,</hi> nor to do any proper humane
act.</p>
            <p>Credible Hiſtory aſſureth us, That De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
or ſeparate Souls, have acted Carcaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and diſcourſed in them, and ſeemed to
commit Fornication in them, and left them
dead behind them; and they were known
to be the ſame that were lately executed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105299:24"/>
or dead, and were re-buried. Here the dead
Organ was capable, when a Spirit did but
uſe it.</p>
            <p>You too much confound <hi>Intellection</hi> and
<hi>Ratiocination.</hi> The prime acts of intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Perception; are before Ratiocination.
And there are a multitude of Complex Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
which all found men know without,
Syllogiſms. The diſpoſition to know them,
is so ſtrong, that ſome call it Actual Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</p>

So far are they from being but <hi>like
Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkeys;</hi> if they be not Ideots,

thoſe that have been ſo courſly clad, and

Arts and Sciences. They did not end at
night, and were not all new made the next

receptivity of the paſſive Organ ceaſed:
but the Habit and Faculty continued. And
when memory in old men faileth about
names, and words, and little matters, their
judgments about great things are uſually
ſtronger (by better Habits) than young

            <p>§. 28. <hi>You ſay, You</hi> know nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Man excels Beaſts, but may be referred to
the benefit of ſpeech and hands, capable of effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
its Conceptions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:105299:25"/>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is anſwered before. Thoſe
<hi>Conceptions</hi> are the <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>words</hi> and <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi>
and is there <hi>no cauſe</hi> of thoſe <hi>Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi>
And if <hi>mans Conceptions</hi> differ from the
<hi>beaſts,</hi> the <hi>cauſes</hi> differed. And if the <hi>firſt</hi>
Conceptions did not differ, the Subſequent
would not differ neither, without a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the <hi>cauſal Faculties.</hi> Why do not
Beaſts ſpeak as well as Men? Parrots ſhew,
That it is not in all for want of a <hi>ſpeaking
Organ.</hi> If one be born dumb, and not
deaf, he will know but little the leſs for his
dumbneſs. If he be born dead and dumb,
and not blind, he will ſtill be rational, as
Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> can tell you, who hath taught ſuch
to talk and converſe intelligibly by their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and other ſigns, without words. I
confeſs, if <hi>all the outward Senſes</hi> were ſtopt
from the Birth, I ſee not how the Soul
could know <hi>outward ſenſible things,</hi> as being
<hi>no Objects</hi> to it. And how it would work
on it ſelf alone, we know not; but <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,</hi>
and <hi>will,</hi> we are ſure it doth: and
therefore <hi>can do it.</hi> And it's one thing to
prove <hi>Beaſts to be men,</hi> or <hi>rational,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing to prove Men to be <hi>Beaſts,</hi> or <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational.</hi>
If you could prove the former,
<hi>viz.</hi> That Beaſts have Souls that can think
of God, and the Life to come, if they
could but ſpeak, this would rather prove
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105299:25"/>
               <hi>them immortal,</hi> than prove <hi>man unreaſonable,</hi>
or of a <hi>mortal</hi> Soul. Your whole ſpeech
makes more to <hi>advance bruits,</hi> than to deny
the <hi>reaſon of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 29. <hi>You ſay, You</hi> know no better way
to attain a right knowledg of our ſelves, than
by beholding our ſelves in <hi>Adam,</hi> and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
what Nature had endued him with, which
will fall far ſhort of what we now admire in
our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. As a <hi>multitude</hi> of Objects, and
Experiences, more tend to Wiſdom than
<hi>one alone;</hi> ſo to know both <hi>what Adam
was,</hi> and <hi>what all men are,</hi> and <hi>do,</hi> doth
evidence more to our information, than to
know <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt Caſe alone.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt <hi>Powers</hi> are to be known
by <hi>his acts;</hi> and <hi>his acts</hi> were not to be
done at once, in a minute or a day: And
we have not the Hiſtory of his Life much
after his Fall. But we may be ſure, that
<hi>Adam</hi>'s Nature in Innocency, was no baſer
than ours corrupted. And therefore <hi>Adam</hi>
had the Powers of doing whatever other
men ſince have done.</p>
            <p>3. But let us come to your Teſt: 1. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
was made a <hi>living Soul</hi> by the <hi>breath</hi>
of God, after the making of his body of the
earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:105299:26"/>
2. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were bleſſed with a
generative multiplying Faculty: but they
did not <hi>generate God;</hi> nor did <hi>every bruit</hi>
that had alſo that Faculty. Therefore
there is a <hi>Soul</hi> which is <hi>not God,</hi> in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<hi>Animal,</hi> (nor yet an Universal
Soul).</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Adam,</hi> no doubt, could not know ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
ſenſible Objects, till they were brought
within the reach of his ſenſe: no more can
we.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Adam</hi> knew the Creatures as ſoon as
he ſaw them; and gave them Names ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
This is more than we could ſo ſoon
do.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Adam</hi> had a <hi>Law</hi> given him; and
therefore knew that God was his Ruler.
He knew that God was to be obeyed; he
knew what was his Law: elſe it had been
no ſin to break it. He knew that he ought
to love, and believe, and truſt God, and
cleave to him: elſe it bad been no ſin to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
him, and to believe the Tempter, and
to love the forbidden Fruit better than God.
He knew that Death was the threatned Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Sin. In a word, He was made in the
<hi>Image of God:</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, it is <hi>that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi>
into which we are <hi>renewed</hi> by Chriſt:
And he deſcribeth it to <hi>conſiſt in wiſdom, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
and true holineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:105299:26"/>
6. And we have great reaſon to think,
that it was <hi>Adam</hi> that taught <hi>Abel</hi> to <hi>offer
Sacrifice in Faith,</hi> and delivered to his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
the Traditions which he had from
God. Tho <hi>Adam</hi> did not <hi>do</hi> all this at
once, he did not receive a new Soul or
Faculty for every new act. Can <hi>Apes</hi> and
<hi>Monkeys</hi> do all this? Doth God give them
Laws to know and keep as moral free-agents?</p>
            <p>But you ſay, <hi>Adam knew not that he was
naked. Anſ.</hi> What! and yet knew God
and his Law, and how to name the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and how to dreſs and keep the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den?
He knew not that <hi>nakedneſs</hi> was ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
for he had newly <hi>made</hi> it ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you think of <hi>Adam</hi>'s forbidden
<hi>deſire of knowledg,</hi> and his miſerable <hi>attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of it. But that did not make him a
<hi>new Soul,</hi> that had no ſuch Faculty before.
<hi>Adam</hi> was the <hi>Son of God</hi> by Creation, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.
and it was his <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>intereſt</hi> to live <hi>as a

mobility of the matter, which can
cauſe this difference.</p>
            <p>Indeed if we have all but <hi>one Soul,</hi> it's eaſie
to <hi>love our Neighbours as our ſelves,</hi> becauſe
our Neighbours <hi>are our ſelves.</hi> But it's as
eaſie to hate our <hi>ſelves</hi> as our <hi>Enemies,</hi> and
the <hi>good</hi> as the <hi>bad,</hi> if all be one (for <hi>forma
dat nomen &amp; eſſe</hi>). But it is ſtrange, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God, or the Soul of the World, ſhall
<hi>hate it ſelf,</hi> and put it ſelf to pain, and fight
againſt it ſelf, as in Wars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if you think ſtill, That there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>God</hi> and <hi>dead matter actuated by
him,</hi> I would beg your Anſwer to theſe few
Queſtions.</p>
            <p>1. Do you really believe, that there is a
<hi>God?</hi> that is, an <hi>eternal infinite ſelf-being,</hi>
who hath all that power, knowledg, and
goodneſs of will, in tranſcendent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4+ letters">
                  <desc>••••…</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey,
which any Creature hath formally, and
is the efficient Governor of all elſe that is. If
not, all the world condemneth you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for <hi>it
is</hi> not an uncauſed Being, and can have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but from its Cauſe, who can give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
greater than it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:105299:28"/>
2. Do you think this God <hi>can</hi> make a
Creature that hath a ſubordinate Soul, or
Spirit, to be the Principle of its own Vital
Action, Intellection, and Volition, or not?
Cannot God make a Spirit? If not, it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
becauſe it is a Contradiction (which
none can pretend), or becauſe God is not
Omnipotent; that is, is <hi>not God;</hi> and ſo
there is <hi>no God;</hi> and ſo you deny what you
granted. But if God <hi>can</hi> make a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</p>
            <p>3. Why ſhould you think he <hi>would</hi> not?
Some of your mind ſay, That he <hi>doth all
the good that he can; or elſe he were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
good.</hi> Certainly his <hi>goodneſs</hi> is equal
to his <hi>greatneſs,</hi> and is commmunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
            <p>4. Hath he not imprinted his Perfections
in ſome meaſure, in his Works? Do they
not ſhew his glory? Judg of his Greatneſs
by the Sun, Stars, and Heavens; and of
his Wiſdom, by the wonderful Order, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture,
and Goverument of all things. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Fabrick of a Fly, or any Animal,
poſeth us. And do you think, that his
love and goodneſs hath no anſwerable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?</p>
            <p>5. Do you think, that <hi>paſſive matter</hi> doth
as much manifeſt Gods Perfection, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the Efficient, as <hi>vital</hi> and <hi>Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105299:28"/>
Spirits?</hi> If it be a far nobler Work for
God to make a <hi>free, vital, mental Spirit,</hi>
to act under him <hi>freely, mentally, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,</hi>
than to make <hi>meer atomes,</hi> why
ſhould you think that God <hi>will not</hi> do
it?</p>
            <p>6. And do you not diſhonour, or blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
the prime Cauſe, by ſuch diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
of his <hi>Work,</hi> as to ſay, he never
made any thing more noble than Atomes,
and Compoſitions of them.</p>
            <p>7. Is there not in the <hi>Creature</hi> a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative
diſpoſition to cauſe their like? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
generate their like: Fire kindleth
fire: Wiſe men would make others wiſe:
God is eſſential infinite Life, Wiſdom and
Love: and can he, or would he make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
liker to himſelf than dead Atomes?
Yea, you feign him to make nothing but
by Compoſition, while you ſay, That <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
it ſelf is <hi>eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. But when the matter of Fact is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and we ſee by the actions, that there
is a difference between things moved by
God, ſome having a created <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>mind,</hi>
and ſome <hi>none,</hi> what needs then any further
proof?</p>
            <p>§. 31. But if you hold, That we have
<hi>now diſtinct Spirits,</hi> which are <hi>individual,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105299:29"/>
Subſtances,</hi> why ſhould you fear the <hi>loſs of
our individuation,</hi> any more than our anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation,
or ſpecifick alteration? If God
made as many ſubſtantial individual Souls,
as men, is there any thing in Nature or
Scripture, which threatneth the loſs of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuation?
I have ſhewed you, and ſhall
further ſhew you enough againſt it.</p>
            <p>§. 32. <hi>You ſay,</hi> page 7. Every thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth
to its element, and loſeth its indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duatiou:
Earth to Earth, Water to the Sea,
the Spirit to God that gave it. What happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
then can we hope for more than deliverance
from the preſent calamity; or what miſery
are we capable of, more than is common to
all?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Bodies loſe but their <hi>Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and <hi>Spiritual forms.</hi> Do you think,
that any <hi>Atome</hi> loſeth its individuation? If
it be ſtill diviſible <hi>in partes infinitas,</hi> it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.
And if every Atome be infinite, it
is as much, or more than all the world;
and ſo is no part of the world; and ſo
there would be as many Worlds, or Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,
as Atomes. It is but an <hi>aggregative
motion</hi> which you mention. <hi>Birds of a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will flock together,</hi> and yet are <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals
ſtill.</hi> Do you think any duſt, or
drop, any Atome of Earth or Water, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105299:29"/>
any thing of it ſelf, by its union with
the reſt? Is any <hi>Subſtance</hi> loſt? Is the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Nature changed? Is it not Earth and
Water ſtill? Is not the <hi>Haecceity,</hi> as they
call it, continued? Doth not God know e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
duſt, and every drop from the reſt?
Can he not ſeparate them when he will?
And if Nature in all things tend to <hi>aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi>
or <hi>union,</hi> it is then the <hi>Perfection</hi> of
everything. And why ſhould we fear Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?</p>
            <p>2. But <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> and <hi>Air,</hi> are
<hi>partible matter. Earth</hi> is eaſily ſeparable:
The parts of <hi>Water</hi> more <hi>hardly,</hi> by the
means of ſome terrene Separaror. The
parts of <hi>Air</hi> yet more hardly: and the
Sun-beams, or ſubſtance of fire, yet harder
than that (tho it's contraction and effects
are very different): And <hi>Spirits</hi> either yet
<hi>harder,</hi> or <hi>not at all.</hi> Some make it eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to them to be <hi>indiſcerptible;</hi> and all
muſt ſay, That there is nothing in the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of them, <hi>tending to diviſion,</hi> or ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
And therefore tho God, who can
<hi>annihilate</hi> them, can <hi>divide</hi> them into parts,
if it be no Contradiction; yet it <hi>will never
be,</hi> becauſe he uſeth every thing according
to its nature, till he cometh to miracles.
Therefore their <hi>diſſolu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion of parts</hi> is no
more to be feared, than their <hi>annihilation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:105299:30"/>
3. But if you take Souls to be <hi>partible</hi>
and <hi>unible,</hi> then you muſt ſuppoſe every
part to have ſtill its own exiſtence in the
<hi>whole.</hi> And do you think, that this doth
not more <hi>advance</hi> Souls than <hi>abaſe</hi> them?
Yea, you ſeem to <hi>Deifie</hi> them, while you
make them all to return into <hi>God,</hi> as drops
into the Sea. And if you feign <hi>God</hi> to be
<hi>partible,</hi> is it not more honour and joy to
be a <hi>part of God,</hi> who is <hi>joy it ſelf,</hi> than
to be a <hi>created Soul?</hi> If a thouſand Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
were put out, and their light turned
into one <hi>Luminary,</hi> as great as they all, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
part would have its ſhare in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning
of the place about it. Is it any
loſs to a ſingle Soldier, to become part of a
victorious Army.</p>
            <p>4. But indeed this is too high a Glory for
the Soul of man to deſire, or hope for. It
is enough to have a bleſſed union with
Chriſt, and the holy Society, conſiſtent
with our Individuation. Like will to like,
and yet be it ſelf. Rivers go to the Sea,
and not to the Earth. Earth turns to
Earth, and not to the Sun, or Fire. And
the holy and bleſſed, go to the holy and
bleſſed: And I believe, that their union
will be nearer than we can now well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
or than this ſelfiſh ſtate of man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth:
But as every drop in the Sea, is the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105299:30"/>
ſame Water it was, ſo every Soul will be
the ſame Soul.</p>
            <p>2. And as to the <hi>incapacity of miſery</hi>
which you talk of, why ſhould you think
it more <hi>hereafter</hi> than <hi>here?</hi> If you think
all Souls now to be but <hi>one,</hi> doth not an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Tooth, or a gouty Foot, or a calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Bladder, ſuffer pain, tho it be not the
<hi>body</hi> that feeleth; but the ſame <hi>ſenſitive
Soul</hi> is pain'd in one part, and pleas'd in
another. And if all Souls be now but God
in divers Bodies, or the <hi>Anima mundi,</hi> try
if you can comfort a man under the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Stone,</hi> or other Malady, or on
the Rack, or in terror of Conſcience, by
telling him, That his <hi>Soul</hi> is <hi>a part of God.</hi>
Will this make a Captive bear his Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or a Malefactor his Death? If not here,
why ſhould you think that their miſery
hereafter will be ever the leſs, or more
tolerable for your conceit, that they are
parts of God? They will be no more parts
of him then, than they were here. But
it's like, that they alſo will have an <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
inclination,</hi> even to ſuch as themſelves;
or that God, will ſeparate them from all
true unity, and ſay, <hi>Go you curſed into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
fire, prepared for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>

§. 33. No doubt it's true, that you ſay,
<hi>page</hi> 7, and 8. That <hi>matter is ſtill the
ſame, and liable to all the changes which you
mention.</hi> But it's an <hi>unchanged God,</hi> who
doth all this by <hi>Spirits,</hi> as ſecond Cauſes,
who are not of ſuch a <hi>changeable,</hi> diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
partible nature, as Bodies are: It is
<hi>Spirits</hi> that do all that's done in the world!
And I conjecture, as well as you, That <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal
Spirits</hi> are <hi>univerſal Cauſes.</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
That this Earth hath a <hi>vegitative

cauſeth not the difference between the Roſe,

unſearchable Virtue of the Seed
cauſeth that. And if you would know
that Virtue, you muſt know it by the
effects. You cannot tell by the <hi>Seed</hi> only
of a Roſe; a Vine, an Oak, what is in
it. But when you ſee the Plants in ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
you may ſee that the <hi>Seeds had a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying
Virtue,</hi> by the influx of the general
Cauſe, to bring forth thoſe Plants, Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,

in the Egg, but by the ripe Bird; nor

of which I will now ſay but this; <hi>Chriſt

and nothing is difficult to God. <gap reason="foreign">

The <hi>Body</hi> hath more parts than <hi>Earth</hi> and

are the <hi>igneous</hi> parts, lodged in the pureſt

How much of theſe <hi>material Spirits</hi> the

§. 35. <hi>You add,</hi> how eaſie it would have
been to you to believe as the Church believeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and not to have immerged your ſelf in theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The <hi>Church</hi> is nothing but all <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
Chriſtians;</hi> and it is their <hi>Belief</hi> which
makes them <hi>capable</hi> of being of the Church:
As we muſt be <hi>men</hi> in order of Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are a <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>men;</hi> ſo we are
<hi>Believers</hi> before we are a <hi>Church</hi> of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
A <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Policy</hi> maketh us not
<hi>men,</hi> but is made of <hi>men;</hi> and <hi>Church-ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi>
or <hi>Policy</hi> maketh us not <hi>Believers,</hi>
but is made up of <hi>Believers.</hi> Therefore
<hi>Belief</hi> is <hi>firſt,</hi> and is not cauſed by that
which followeth it? And why doth the
Church believe? Is it becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve?</p>
            <p>And <hi>whom do they believe?</hi> Is it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
I doubt you have fallen into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with thoſe whoſe <hi>Intereſt</hi> hath
made it their <hi>Trade</hi> to puzzle and confound
men about things as hard to themſelves as
others, that they may bring them to truſt
the Church, and then tell them that it's <hi>they</hi>
that are that <hi>Church,</hi> as a neceſſary means
to the quieting their minds. And they tell
them, <hi>You are never able by reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the mysteries of Faith; the more you
ſearch, the more you are confounded. But if
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105299:32"/>
you believe as the Church believeth, you ſhall
ſpeed as the Church ſpeedeth,</hi> But it's one
thing to believe the <hi>ſame thing</hi> which the
Church believeth; and another to believe
it with the <hi>ſame faith,</hi> and upon the ſame
<hi>Authority.</hi> If a man believe all the Articles
of the Creed only becauſe men tell him
that they are true, it is but a <hi>human Faith,</hi>
as reſting only on mans <hi>Authority;</hi> but the
true Members of the Church believe all the
<hi>ſame things,</hi> becauſe God <hi>revealeth</hi> and <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testeth</hi>
them; and this is a <hi>Divine Faith:</hi>
And ſo muſt you.</p>
            <p>If you love light more than darkneſs and
deceit, diſtinguiſh, 1. Believing men for
<hi>Authority.</hi> 2. Believing men for their <hi>Honeſty,</hi>
3. Believing men for the <hi>natural impoſſibility
of their deceiving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the foundation of this difference is
here: Mans Soul hath two ſorts of acts,
<hi>Neceſſary</hi> and <hi>Contingent,</hi> or <hi>mutably free<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To love our ſelves, to be unwilling to be
miſerable,</hi> and <hi>willing to be happy;</hi> to <hi>love
God</hi> as <hi>good,</hi> if known, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are acts of the
Soul as <hi>neceſſary,</hi> as for fire to <hi>burn</hi> combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible
contiguous matter; or for a Bruit to
eat; ſo that all the Teſtimonies which is
produced by theſe <hi>neceſsary</hi> acts by <hi>knowing
men,</hi> hath a Phyſical certainty, the contrary
being impoſſible. And this is <hi>infallible hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105299:33"/>
knowledg</hi> of <hi>matter of fact.</hi> Thus
we know there is ſuch a City as <hi>Rome, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,
Venice,</hi> &amp;c. and that there was ſuch a
man as K. <hi>James, Ed. 6. Hen. 8. William</hi> the
Conqueror, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that the Statutes now
aſcribed to <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and other Kings and their
Parliaments are genuine. For Judges
judge by them, Lawyers plead them, Kings
own them, all men hold their Eſtates and
Lives by them. Contrary mens Intereſt by
Lawyers are daily pleaded by them againſt
each other; and if any one would deny,
forge or corrupt a Statute, Intereſt would
engage the reſt againſt him to detect his
fraud.</p>
            <p>1. The certain effect of natural neceſſary
Cauſes hath natural neceſſary evidence of
Truth.</p>
            <p>But when all knowing men of contrary
Diſpoſitions <hi>and</hi> Intereſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> acknowledg a thing
true, this is the effect of natural neceſſary
Cauſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo</hi> it hath natural neceſſary evidence of
Truth.</p>
            <p>2. It is impoſſible there ſhould be an Effect
without a ſufficient Cauſe.</p>
            <p>But that a thing ſhould be falſe which all
knowing men of contrary Diſpoſitions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
acknowledg to be true, would be an
Effect without a Cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>for there is no Cauſe</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:105299:33"/>
in nature to effect it. It is impoſſible in
<hi>nature</hi> that all men in <hi>England</hi> ſhould agree
to ſay, There was a King <hi>James,</hi> K. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> or that theſe Statutes were
made by them, if it were falſe. This is
<hi>infallible Hiſtorical Testimony.</hi> It were not
ſo ſtrong if it were only by <hi>one Party,</hi> and
not by Enemies alſo, or men of contrary
Minds and Intereſts. And thus we know
the Hiſtory of the Goſpel; and this <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
is naturally <hi>infallible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. But all the Teſtimony which depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
on humane Acts, <hi>not neceſſary,</hi> but <hi>free,</hi>
have but an <hi>uncertain moral humane Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
For ſo <hi>all men are Lyars;</hi> i. e. <hi>fallible,</hi>
and not fully to be truſted.</p>
            <p>And I. Thoſe Teſtimonies which depend
on mens <hi>Honeſty,</hi> are no farther credible,
than we <hi>know the Honeſty</hi> of the men: which
in ſome is <hi>great,</hi> in ſome is <hi>none,</hi> in moſt is
<hi>mixt,</hi> and <hi>lubricous,</hi> and <hi>doubtful,</hi> Alas!
what abundance of falſe Hiſtory is in the
world! Who can truſt the <hi>Honeſty</hi> of ſuch
men, as multitudes of Popes, Prelates, and
Prieſts have been? Will they ſtick at a Lye,
that ſtick not at Blood, or any wickedneſs?
Beſides, the <hi>ignorance</hi> which invalidates their
Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>II. And to pretend <hi>Authority</hi> to rule our
Faith, is the moſt unſatisfactory way of all.

believed, before you believe that he is Chriſt.
3. You muſt know who they be whom you
muſt believe; whether all, or ſome, or a <hi>major</hi>
vote. Whether out of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the world, or a party.
4. And how far their Authority extendeth?
Whether to judg whether there be a God,
or no God; a Chriſt, or no Chriſt; a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
or none; a Goſpel, or none: or what.
5. And how their determinations out of all the
world may come with certainty to us: and
where to find them. 6. And when Countreys
and Councils contradict and condemn each
other, which is to be believed. Many ſuch <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities</hi>
in the <hi>Roman</hi> way, muſt be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
before a man can believe that Jeſus is the
Chriſt. In a word, you muſt not puzzle your
head to know <hi>what a man is,</hi> or <hi>whether he
have an immortal ſoul;</hi> but you muſt, 1. believe
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Believers,</hi> before you are a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
in Chriſt.</hi> 2. And you muſt believe, that
Chriſt was God and Man, and came to ſave
man, before you believe that there is ſuch a
creature as <hi>man,</hi> or <hi>what he is,</hi> and whether he
have a ſoul capable of ſalvation. But I have oft
elſewhere opened theſe Abſurdities and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105299:34"/>
where you may ſee them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed,
if you are willing.</p>
            <p>§. 36. Your queſtion about the <hi>ſouls nature,
exiſtence, and Individuation,</hi> may be reſolved
by a <hi>ſurer and eaſier</hi> way as followeth:</p>
            <p>I. <hi>By</hi> your own certain experience.</p>
            <p>1. You perceive that you <hi>ſee, feel, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
will</hi> and <hi>execute.</hi> 2. You may know, as
is oft ſaid, that therefore you have an <hi>active
power</hi> to do theſe. 3. You may thence know,
that it is a <hi>ſubſtance</hi> which hath that power.
Nothing can do nothing. 4. You may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that it is not the <hi>terrene</hi> ſubſtance, but
an <hi>inviſible</hi> ſubſtance, actuating the body.
5. You may know, that there is no probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that ſo noble a ſubſtance ſhould be <hi>annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</hi>
6. Or that a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>ſimple</hi> ſubſtance
ſhould be <hi>diſſolved</hi> by the ſeparation of parts
(or if that were every part would be a <hi>ſpirit</hi>
ſtill). 7. You have no cauſe to ſuſpect, that this
ſubſtance ſhould loſe thoſe <hi>powers</hi> or <hi>facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
which are its <hi>eſſential form,</hi> and be turned
into ſome other <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or thing. 8. And you
have as little cauſe to ſuſpect, that an eſſential
vital intellective power, will not be <hi>active,</hi>
when <hi>active inclination</hi> is its <hi>Eſſence.</hi> 9. You
have no cauſe to ſuſpect, that it will want <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
to action in a World of ſuch variety of
Objects. 10. And you have as little cauſe to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105299:35"/>
ſuſpect, that it will be unactive, for want of
Organs, when God hath made its <hi>Eſſence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive;</hi>
and either can make new Organs; or
that which can act <hi>on matter,</hi> can act <hi>without,</hi>
or on other matter. He that can play on a
Lute, can do ſomewhat as good, if that be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
11. And experience might ſatisfie you,
that <hi>ſeveral</hi> men have <hi>ſeveral</hi> ſouls, by the
<hi>ſeveral</hi> and <hi>contrary</hi> Operations. 12. And you
have no reaſon to ſuſpect, that God will turn
<hi>many,</hi> from being <hi>many, into one;</hi> or that <hi>unity</hi>
ſhould be any of their <hi>loſs.</hi> All this, Reaſon
tells you, beginning at your own experience,
as I have (and elſewhere more fully) opened.</p>
            <p>§. 37. II. And you have at hand <hi>ſenſible
proof of the individuation of ſpirits,</hi> by <hi>Witches,
Contracts,</hi> and <hi>Apparitions:</hi> of which the world
has unqueſtionable proof, tho there be very
many Cheats. Read Mr. <hi>Glanvill</hi>'s new Book,
publiſhed by Dr. <hi>Moore, Lavater de Spectris,
Zanchy de Angilii, Manlii Collect. Bodin</hi>'s <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monolog.
Remigius</hi> of Witches, beſides all the
<hi>Mallei Malificorum,</hi> and doubt if you can. If
you do, I can give you yet more, with full
proof.</p>
            <p>§. 38. III. But all that I have ſaid to you,
is but the <hi>leaſt part,</hi> in compariſon of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
which you may have by the <hi>full
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:105299:35"/>
revelatson of Jeſus Chriſt, who hath brought
life and immortality to light in the Goſpel,</hi>
where the ſtate, the doom, the rewards and
puniſhment of ſouls is aſſerted.</p>
            <p>And without dark and long Ambages,
or <hi>Roman</hi> Juggles, we prove the truth of
this Goſpel, briefly and infallibly thus:</p>
            <p>I. The <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of Chriſt's Life, Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
Doctrine, Death, Reſurrection, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion,
the Apoſtles Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is
proved by ſuch forementioned evidence, as
hath <hi>phyſical certainty:</hi> Not ſuch as dependeth
<hi>only</hi> on <hi>mens honeſty,</hi> or <hi>moral argument,</hi>
much leſs on a pretended <hi>determining au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;</hi>
but ſuch as dependeth on <hi>neceſſary
acts of man,</hi> even the <hi>conſent of all ſorts</hi> of
<hi>contrary minds</hi> and <hi>intereſts,</hi> as we know
the Statutes of the Land, or other certain
Hiſtory. But we are ſo far from needing
to ask, <hi>which part of Chriſtians</hi> it is that is
<hi>this Church,</hi> that is to be believed, that it
tendeth to the aſſertaining of us, that all
the Chriſtian World, <hi>Papiſts, Proteſtants,
Greeks, Moſcovites, Armenians, Jacobites,
Neſtorians,</hi> &amp;c. herein agree, even while
they oppoſe each other. To know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there was a <hi>Julius,</hi> or <hi>Auguſtus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi>
a <hi>Virgil, Ovid Cicero,</hi> and which are their
Works; yea, <hi>which are the Acts of Councils,</hi>
no man goeth to an <hi>authorized determining
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:105299:36"/>
Judg</hi> for the matter of Fact, but to <hi>hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Cal
proof.</hi> And this we have moſt full.</p>
            <p>II. And if the <hi>History</hi> be true, the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
muſt needs be true, ſeeing it is fully
proved by the matters of Fact. Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
proved to be Chriſt, all his words muſt
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eeds be true.</p>
            <p>§. 39. The <hi>Goſpel</hi> of Chriſt, hath theſe
four parts of its infallible evidence.</p>
            <p>I. The <hi>antecedent</hi> and <hi>inhererent Prophecies</hi>
fulfilled.</p>
            <p>II. The <hi>inherent impreſs</hi> of <hi>Divinity</hi> on
the <hi>Goſpel it ſelf,</hi> unimitable by man. It
hath <hi>Gods Image and Superſcription;</hi> and
its Excellency, <hi>propria luce,</hi> is diſcerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>III. All the <hi>Miracles,</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection,</hi>
and <hi>Aſcention</hi> of Chriſt, the Gift <hi>of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
and extraordinary <hi>Miracles</hi> of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi>
and firſt Churches.</p>
            <p>IV. The <hi>ſanctifying work</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> by
this Goſpel, on all Believers in all Ages of
the World, by which they have the Witneſs
in themſelves. A full conſtant unimitable
Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>§. 40. And now how highly ſoever you
think of Bruits, think not too baſely of
Men, for whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> became a <hi>Saviour:</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:105299:36"/>
And yet think not ſo <hi>highly</hi> of <hi>Men, Bruits</hi>
and <hi>Stones,</hi> as to think that they are <hi>God.</hi>
And think not that your true <hi>diligence</hi> hath
confounded you, but either your <hi>negligence,</hi>
or <hi>ſeducers,</hi> or the unhappy ſtifling of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
truth, by the ill ordering of your
thoughts. And I beſeech you remember,
that <hi>Gods Revelationt</hi> are ſuited to <hi>mans uſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and our <hi>true knowledg</hi> to his <hi>Revtlations.</hi> He
hath not told us <hi>all that man would know,</hi> but
<hi>what we muſt know.</hi> Nothing is more known
to us than that <hi>of God</hi> which is <hi>neceſſary</hi> for
us: Yet nothing ſo incomprehenſible as God.
There is much of the <hi>Nature of Spirits,</hi> and
the <hi>world to come, unſearchable</hi> to us, which
will poſe all our Wits: yet we have ſufficient
certainty of ſo much as tells us our <hi>duty</hi> and
our hopes. God hath given us <hi>Souls to uſe,</hi> and
to <hi>know only ſo far as is uſeful.</hi> He that <hi>made</hi>
your <hi>Watch,</hi> taught not you <hi>how it's made,</hi>
but how to <hi>uſe it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Inſtead therefore of your
concluding complaints of your condition,
thank God, who hath made man capable to
ſeek him, ſerve him, love him, praiſe him,
and rejoyce in hope of promiſed Perfection.
Live not as a <hi>willful ſtranger</hi> to your <hi>Soul
and God.</hi> Uſe faithfully the Faculties which he
hath given you: ſin not willfully againſt the
truth revealed; and leave things <hi>ſecret</hi> to <hi>God,</hi>
till you come into the clearer light: and you
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:105299:37"/>
ſhall have no cauſe to complain, that God,
whoſe goodneſs is equal to his greatneſs,
hath dealt hardly with mankind. Inſtead
of truſting <hi>fallible man, truſt Chriſt,</hi> who
hath fully proved his truſtineſs; and his <hi>Spirit</hi>
will advance you to higher things than bruits
are capable of. God be merciful to us dark
unthankful ſinners.</p>
