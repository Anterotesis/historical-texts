            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN things are at worſt, then God begins a change. The
ſtate of the Jewiſh Church was extreamly corrupted, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
before the news of the Goſpel; yet, as bad as it
was, not only the Prieſthood, but the courſes of attendance
continued, even from <hi>Davids</hi> time till Chriſts. It is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately
depraved condition of a Church, where no good
orders are left. Judea paſſed many troubles, many alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet this orderly combination endured about an eleven hundred years. A
ſetled good will not eaſily be defeated, but in the change of perſons will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
unchanged, and if it be forced to give way, leaves memorable footſteps
behinde it. If <hi>David</hi> fore-ſaw the perpetuation of this holy Ordinance, how
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> much did he rejoice in the knowledge of it? who would not be glad to doe
good, on condition, that it may ſo long out-live him?</p>
                  <p>The ſucceſſive turnes of the Legal miniſtration held on in a Line never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted.
Even in a forlorn and miſerable Church, there may be a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
ſucceſſion. How little were the Jewes better for this, when they had loſt
the Urim and Thummim, ſincerity of Doctrine and Manners? This ſtayed
with them even whiles they and their Sons crucified Chriſt. What is more
ordinary, then wicked Sons of holy Parents? It is the ſucceſſion of Truth
and Holineſs that makes or inſtitutes a Church, whatever become of the
perſons. Never times were ſo barren, as not to yeeld ſome good; The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> dearth affords ſome few good Eares to the Gleaners. Chriſt would not
have come into the world, but he would have ſome faithful to entertain
him: He, that had the diſpoſing of all times and men, would caſt ſome holy
ones into his own times: There had been no equality, that all ſhould either
over-run, or follow him, and none attend him. <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> are juſt,
both of <hi>Aarons</hi> blood, and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> of theirs: whence ſhould an holy ſeed
ſpring if not of the Loyns of <hi>Levi?</hi> It is not in the power of Parents to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Holineſſe to their Children: it is the bleſſing of God, that feoffes them
in the Vertues of their Parents, as they feoffe them in their ſinnes. There is
no certainty, but there is likelihood, of an holy Generation, when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> are ſuch. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was juſt, as well as <hi>Zachary,</hi> that the fore-runner of
a Saviour might be holy on both ſides. If the ſtock and the griffe be not both
good, there is much danger of the fruit. It is an happy match, when the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and the Wife are one, not onely in themſelves, but in God, not more in
fleſh, then in the ſpirit. Grace makes no difference of ſexes, rather the weaker
carries away the more honour, becauſe it hath had leſſe helps. It is eaſie to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44233:7"/>
obſerve, that the New Teſtament affordeth more ſtore of good women then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
the old. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> led the ring of this mercy, whoſe barrenneſs ended in a
miraculous fruit both of her body and of her time.</p>
                  <p>This religious pair made no leſſe progreſs in vertue then in age, and yet
their vertue could not make their beſt age fruitfull: <hi>Elizabeth was barren.</hi> A
juſt ſoul and a barren womb may well agree together. Amongſt the Jews bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs
was not a defect only, but a reproach: yet while this good woman was
fruitful of holy obedience, ſhe was barren of children. As <hi>John,</hi> which was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly
conceived by man, was a fit fore-runner of him that was conceived
by the Holy Ghoſt; ſo a barren Matron was meet to make way for a Virgin.</p>
                  <p>None but a ſon of <hi>Aaron</hi> might offer incenſe to God in the Temple, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
not every ſon of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and not any one at all ſeaſons: God is a God of order,
and hates confuſion no leſſe then irreligion. Albeit he hath not ſo ſtreightned
himſelf under the Goſpel as to tie his ſervice to perſons or places, yet his
choice is now no leſſe curious becauſe it is more large. He allows none but
the authoriſed: he authoriſeth none but the worthy. The incenſe doth ever
ſmell of the hand that offers it. I doubt not but that perfume was ſweeter
which aſcended up from the hand of a juſt <hi>Zacharie.</hi> The ſacrifice of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is abomination to God. There were courſes of miniſtration in the Legal ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices:
God never purpoſed to burthen any of his creatures with devotion.
How vain is the ambition of any ſoul that would load it ſelf with the univerſal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
charge of all men? How thankleſs is their labour that do wilfully overſpend
themſelves in their ordinary vocations? As <hi>Zacharie</hi> had a courſe in Gods
houſe, ſo he carefully obſerved it: the favour of theſe reſpites doubled his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.
The more high and ſacred our calling is, the more dangerous is neglect.
It is our honour that we may be allowed to wait upon the God of heaven in
theſe immediate ſervices. Woe be to us if we flacken thoſe duties wherein
God honours us more then we can honour him.</p>
                  <p>Many ſons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> yea of the ſame family, ſerved at once in the Temple
according to the variety of imployments. To avoid all difference, they agreed
by lot to aſſign themſelves to the ſeveral offices of each day: the lot of this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
day called <hi>Zacharie</hi> to offer Incenſe in the outer Temple. I doe not finde any
preſcription they had from God of this particular manner of deſignment.
Matters of good order in holy affairs may be ruled by the wiſe inſtitution of
men according to reaſon and expediencie.</p>
                  <p>It fell out well that <hi>Zacharie</hi> was choſen by lot to this miniſtration, that Gods
immediate hand might be ſeen in all the paſſages that concerned his great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;
that as the perſon, ſo the occaſion might be of Gods own chuſing. In lots
and their ſeeming caſual diſpoſition, God can give a reaſon, though we can give
none. Morning and Evening, twice a day, their Law called them to offer Incenſe
to God, that both parts of the day might be conſecrate to the maker of time.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
The outer Temple was the figure of the whole Church upon earth, like as the
Holy of holieſt repreſented Heaven. Nothing can better reſemble our faithful
prayers then ſweet perfume: theſe God looks that we ſhould (all his Church
over) ſend up unto him Morning and Evening. The elevations of our hearts
ſhould be perpetual: but if twice in the day we do not preſent God with our
ſolemn invocations, we make the Goſpel leſſe officious then the Law.</p>
                  <p>That the reſemblance of prayers and incenſe might be apparent, whiles
the Prieſt ſends up his incenſe within the Temple, the people muſt ſend up
their prayers without. Their breath and that incenſe, though remote in the
firſt riſing, met ere they went up to heaven. The people might no more goe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
into the Holy place to offer up the incenſe of prayers unto God, then <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
might goe into the Holy of holies. Whiles the partition wall ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Jews and Gentiles, there were alſo partitions betwixt the Jews and
themſelves. Now every man is a Prieſt unto God, every man (ſince the veil
was rent) prayes within the Temple. What are we the better for our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44233:7"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> freedome of acceſſe to God under the Goſpel, if we doe not make uſe of
our priviledge?</p>
                  <p>Whiles they were praying to God, he ſees an Angel of GOD: as <hi>Gideon</hi>'s
Angel went up in the ſmoak of the ſacrifice, ſo did <hi>Zacharie</hi>'s Angel (as it were)
come down in the fragrant ſmoak of his incenſe. It was ever great news to ſee
an Angel of God; but now more, becauſe God had long withdrawn from them
all the means of his ſupernaturall revelations. As this wicked people were
ſtrangers to their God in their converſation, ſo was God grown a ſtranger to
them in his apparitions: yet now that the ſeaſon of the Goſpel approached, he
viſited them with his Angels; before he viſited them by his Son. He ſends his
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Angel to men in the form of man, before he ſends his Son to take humane
form. The preſence of Angels is no novelty, but their apparition; they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
with us, but rarely ſeen, that we may awfully reſpect their meſſages when
they are ſeen. In the mean time our faith may ſee them, though our ſenſes doe
not; their aſſumed ſhapes doe not make them more preſent, but viſible.</p>
                  <p>There is an order in that heavenly Hierarchie, though we know it not.
This Angel that appeared to <hi>Zacharie</hi> was not with him in the ordinary courſe
of his attendances, but was purpoſely ſent from God with this meſſage. Why
was an Angel ſent? and why this Angel? It had been eaſie for him to have
raiſed up the prophetical ſpirit of ſome <hi>Simeon</hi> to this prediction. The ſame
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Holy Ghoſt which revealed to that juſt man, that he ſhould not ſee death ere
he had ſeen the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> might have as eaſily revealed unto him the birth of
the forerunner of Chriſt, and by him to <hi>Zacharie:</hi> but God would have this
voice, which ſhould goe before his Son, come with a noiſe. He would have
it appear to the world, that the harbinger of the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> ſhould be conceived
by the marvellous power of that God whoſe coming he proclaimed. It was
fit the firſt Herald of the Goſpel ſhould begin in wonder. The ſame Angel
that came to the Bleſſed Virgin with the news of Chriſts conception, came
to <hi>Zacharie</hi> with the news of <hi>John</hi>'s, for the honour of him that was the
greateſt of them which were born of women, and for his better reſemblance
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to him which was the ſeed of the woman. Both had the Goſpel for their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,
one as the meſſenger of it, the other as the Author; both are foretold
by the ſame mouth.</p>
                  <p>When could it be more fit for the Angel to appear unto <hi>Zacharie,</hi> then
when prayers and incenſe were offered by him? Where could he more fitly
appear then in the Temple? In what part of the Temple more fitly then at
the Altar of Incenſe? and whereabout rather then on the right ſide of the
Altar? Thoſe glorious ſpirits as they are alwaies with us, ſo moſt in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions;
and as in all places, ſo moſt of all in Gods houſe. They rejoice to be
with us whiles we are with God; as contrarily they turn their faces from us
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> when we goe about our ſins.</p>
                  <p>He that had wont to live and ſerve in the preſence of the maſter, was now
aſtoniſhed at the preſence of the ſervant. So much difference there is betwixt
our faith and our ſenſes, that the apprehenſion of the preſence of the God of
ſpirits by faith goes down ſweetly with us, whereas the ſenſible apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of an Angel diſmayes us. Holy <hi>Zacharie,</hi> that had wont to live by faith,
thought he ſhould dye when his ſenſe began to be ſet on work. It was the
weakneſſe of him that ſerved at the Altar without horror, to be daunted
with the face of his fellow-ſervant. In vain doe we look for ſuch Miniſters
of God as are without infirmities, when juſt <hi>Zacharie</hi> was troubled in his
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> devotions with that wherewith he ſhould have been comforted. It was
partly the ſuddenneſs, and partly the glory of the apparition, that affrighted
him. The good Angel was both apprehenſive and compaſſionate of <hi>Zacharie</hi>'s
weakneſs, and preſently incourages him with a cheerful excitation, (<hi>Fear
not, Zacharias.</hi>). The bleſſed ſpirits, though they doe not often vocally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
it, doe pity our humane frailties, and ſecretly ſuggeſt comfort unto us
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44233:8"/>
when we perceive it not. Good and evil Angels, as they are contrary in eſtate,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
ſo alſo in diſpoſition. The good deſire to take away fear, the evil to bring it.
It is a fruit of that deadly enmity which is betwixt Satan and us, that he would,
if he might, kill us with terror; whereas the good ſpirits affecting our relief
and happineſſe, take no pleaſure in terrifying us, but labour altogether for our
tranquillity and chearfulneſſe.</p>
                  <p>There was not more fear in the face then comfort in the ſpeech; <hi>Thy
prayer is heard.</hi> No Angel could have told him better newes. Our deſires are
uttered in our praiers. What can we wiſh but to have what we would? Many
good ſuits had <hi>Zachary</hi> made, and amongſt the reſt for a Son. Doubtleſſe it
was now ſome ſpace of years ſince he made that requeſt. For he was now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
ſtricken in age, and had ceaſed to hope: yet had God laid it up all the while;
and when he thinks not of it, brings it forth to effect. Thus doth the mercy of
our God deale with his patient and faithfull ſuppliants. In the fervour of their
expectation he many times holds them off; and when they leaſt think of it,
and have forgotten their own ſuits, he graciouſly condeſcends. Delay of effect
may not diſcourage our faith. It may be God hath long granted ere we ſhall
know of his grant. Many a father repents him of his fruitfulneſſe, and hath
ſuch ſons as he wiſhes unborn: but to have ſo gracious and happy a ſon as the
Angel foretold, could not be leſſe comfort then honor to the age of <hi>Zacharie.</hi>
The proof of children makes them either the bleſſings or croſſes of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
To heare what his ſon ſhould be before he was, to heare that he ſhould
have ſuch a ſon, a ſon whoſe birth ſhould concern the joy of many, a ſon
that ſhould be great in the ſight of the Lord, a ſon that ſhould be ſacred to
God, filled with God, beneficial to man, an harbinger to him that was God
and man, was news enough to prevent the Angel, and to take away that tongue
with amazement, which was after loſt with incredulity.</p>
                  <p>The ſpeech was ſo good, that it found not a ſudden belief. This good
news ſurpriſed <hi>Zachary.</hi> If the intelligence had taken leiſure, that his thoughts
might have had time to debate the matter, he had eaſily apprehended the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
power of him that had promiſed; the pattern of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sara;</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
would ſoon have concluded the appearance of the Angel more miraculous
then his prediction. Whereas now, like a man masked with the ſtrangeneſſe
of that he ſaw and heard, he miſdoubts the meſſage, and asks, <hi>How ſhall I
know?</hi> Nature was on his ſide, and alledged the impoſſibility of the event
both from age and barrenneſſe. Supernaturall tidings at the firſt hearing aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the heart, and are entertained with doubts by thoſe which upon further
acquaintance give them the beſt welcome.</p>
                  <p>The weak apprehenſions of our imperfect faith are not ſo much to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
as pittied. It is a ſure way for the heart, to be prevented with the
aſſurance of the omnipotent power of God, to whom nothing is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
ſo ſhall the hardeſt point of faith goe down eaſily with us. If the eye of
our minde look upward, it ſhall meet with nothing to avert or interrupt it:
but if right forward, or downward, or round about, every thing is a block in
our way.</p>
                  <p>There is a difference betwixt deſire of aſſurance and unbelief. We cannot be
too carefull to raiſe up our ſelves arguments to ſettle our faith; although it
ſhould be no faith, if it had no feet to ſtand upon, but diſcurſive. In matters
of faith, if reaſons may be brought for the conviction of the gain-ſayers, it is
well; if they be helps, they cannot be grounds of our belief. In the moſt
faithful heart there are ſome ſparks of infidelity: ſo to believe, that we ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
have no doubt at all, is ſcarce incident unto fleſh and blood. It is a great perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
if we have attained to overcome our doubts. What did miſlead <hi>Zacharie,</hi>
but that which uſes to guide others, Reaſon? (<hi>I am old, and my wife is of great
age.</hi>) As if years and drie loines could be any let to him which is able of very
ſtones to raiſe up children unto <hi>Abraham.</hi> Faith and reaſon have their limits:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44233:8"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> where reaſon ends, faith begins: and if reaſon will be encroaching upon the
bounds of faith, ſhe is ſtraight taken captive by infidelity. We are not fit to
follow Chriſt, if we have not denied our ſelves; and the chief piece of our
ſelves is our reaſon. We muſt yield God able to doe that which we cannot
comprehend, and we muſt comprehend that by our faith which is diſclaimed
by reaſon. <hi>Hagar</hi> muſt be driven out of doors, that <hi>Sara</hi> may rule alone.</p>
                  <p>The authority of the reporter makes way for belief in things which are
otherwiſe hard to paſſe; although in the matters of God we ſhould not ſo
much care who ſpeaks, as what is ſpoken, and from whom. The Angel tells
his name, place, office, unasked, that <hi>Zacharie</hi> might not think any news im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that was brought him by an heavenly meſſenger. Even where there
is no uſe of language, the ſpirits are diſtinguiſhed by names, and each knows
his own appellation and others. He that gave leave unto man his Image, to
give names unto all his viſible and inferiour creatures, did himſelf put names
unto the ſpiritual: and as their name is, ſo are they mighty and glorious. But
leſt <hi>Zacharie</hi> ſhould no leſſe doubt of the ſtile of the meſſenger, then of the
errand it ſelf, he is at once both confirmed, and puniſhed with dumbneſs.
That tongue which moved the doubt, muſt be tyed up: He ſhall ask no more
queſtions for forty weeks, becauſe he asked this one diſtruſtfully.</p>
                  <p>Neither did <hi>Zacharie</hi> loſe his tongue for the time, but his ears alſo; he was
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not onely mute, but deaf: For otherwiſe, when they came to ask his allowance
for the name of his Son, they needed not to have demanded it by ſigns, but
by words. God will not paſſe over ſlight offences, and thoſe which may
plead the moſt colourable pretences in his beſt children, without a ſenſible
check: it is not our holy entireneſs with God that can bear us out in the leaſt
ſin; yea rather the more acquaintance we have with his Majeſty, the more
ſure we are of correction when we offend. This may procure us more favour
in our well-doing, not leſſe juſtice in evil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zacharie</hi> ſtaied, and the people waited: whether ſome longer diſcourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Angel and him then needed to be recorded, or whether aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> at the apparition and news, withheld him, I inquire not; the multitude
thought him long, yet though they could but ſee afar off, they would not
depart till he returned to bleſſe them. Their patient attendance without,
ſhames us that are hardly perſwaded to attend within, whiles both our ſenſes
are imploied in our divine ſervices, and we are admitted to be co-agents with
our Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>At laſt <hi>Zacharie</hi> comes out ſpeechleſſe, and more amazes them with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
then with his delay. The eyes of the multitude that were not worthy
to ſee his viſion, yet ſee the ſigns of his viſion, that the world might be put
into the exſpectation of ſome extraordinary ſequell. GOD makes way for
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his voice by ſilence. His ſpeech could not have ſaid ſo much as his dumbneſs.
<hi>Zacharie</hi> would fain have ſpoken, and could not with us too many are dumb,
and need not. Negligence, Fear, Partiality ſtop the mouthes of many, which
ſhall once ſay, Woe to me, becauſe I held my peace. His hand ſpeaks that
which he cannot with his tongue, and he makes them by ſigns to underſtand
that which they might read in his face. Thoſe powers we have, we muſt uſe.
But though he have ceaſed to ſpeak, yet he ceaſed not to miniſter. He takes
not this dumbneſs for a diſmiſſion, but ſtayes out the eight daies of his courſe,
as one that knew the eyes and hands and heart would be accepted of that
God which had bereaved him of his tongue. We may not ſtraight take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of withdrawing our ſelves from the publick ſervices of our God, much
leſſe under the Goſpel. The Law, which ſtood much upon bodily perfection,
diſpenſed with age for attendance. The Goſpel, which is all for the Soul, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
thoſe inward powers, which whiles they are vigorous, exclude all excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of our miniſtration.</p>

that which concerns the Incarnation of GOD. It was fit no cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
ſhould be omitted in that Story, whereon the faith &amp; ſalvation of all the World dependeth. We cannot ſo much as doubt
of this truth, and be ſaved; no not the number of the moneth, not the name
of the Angel is concealed: Every particle imports not more certainty then
excellence. The time is the ſixth moneth after <hi>John</hi>'s Conception, the prime <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
of the Spring. Chriſt was conceived in the Spring, born in the Solſtice. He
in whom the World received a new life, receives life in the ſame ſeaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the World received his firſt life from him; and he which ſtretches out the
dayes of his Church, and lengthens them to Eternitie, appeares after all the
ſhort and dimme light of the Law, and enlightens the World with his glory.
The Meſſenger is an Angel. A man was too mean to carry the news of the
Conception of God. Never any buſineſſe was conceived in Heaven, that did
ſo much concerne the earth as the Conception of the GOD of Heaven in
Womb of earth: No leſſe then an Arch-Angel was worthy to bear this ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
and never any Angel received a greater honour then of this Embaſſage.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was fit our reparation ſhould anſwer our fall. An evil Angel was the
firſt motioner of the one to <hi>Eve</hi> a Virgin, then eſpouſed to <hi>Adam,</hi> in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of Eden: a good Angell is the firſt reporter of the other to <hi>Mary,</hi> a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
eſpouſed to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in that place which (as the Garden of <hi>Galilee,</hi>) had a
name from flouriſhing. No good Angel could be the Author of our reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
as that evil Angel was of our ruine. But that which thoſe glorious
Spirits could not doe themſelves, they are glad to report as done by the God
of Spirits. Good news rejoices the bearer. With what joy did this holy Angel
bring the news of that Saviour, in whom we are redeemed to life, himſelf
eſtabliſhed in life and glory? The firſt Preacher of the Goſpel was an Angel.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
That office muſt needs be glorious that derives it ſelf from ſuch a Predeceſſor.
God appointed his Angel to be the firſt Preacher, and hath ſince called his
Preachers Angels. The meſſage is well ſuited. An Angel comes to a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
<hi>Gabriel</hi> to <hi>Mary;</hi> He that was by ſignification the ſtrength of God, to her
that was by ſignification exalted by God, to the conceiving of him that was
the God of ſtrength: to a Maid, but eſpouſed; a Maid for the honour of
Virginity, eſpouſed for the honour of Marriage. The marriage was in a ſort
made, not conſummate, through the inſtinct of him that meant to make her
not an example, but a miracle of women. In this whole work God would
have nothing ordinary. It was fit that ſhe ſhould be a married Virgin, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
ſhould be a Virgin mother. He that meant to take mans nature without mans
corruption, would be the Son of man without mans ſeed, would be the ſeed
of the woman without man; and amongſt all women, of a pure Virgin; but
amongſt Virgins, of one eſpouſed, that there might be at once a Witneſs and
a Guardian of her fruitful Virginity. If the ſame God had not been the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of Virginity and Marriage, he had never countenanced Virginity by
Marriage.</p>
                  <p>Whether doth this glorious Angel come to finde the Mother of him that
was GOD, but to obſcure Galilee? A part which even the Jewes themſelves
deſpiſed, as forſaken of their priviledges, (<hi>Out of Galilee ariſeth no Prophet.</hi>)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
Behold, an Angel comes to that <hi>Galilee,</hi> out of which no Prophet comes, and
the God of Prophets and Angels deſcends to be conceived in that <hi>Galilee,</hi>
out of which no Prophet ariſeth. He that filleth all places, makes no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of places. It is the perſon which gives honour and priviledge to the
place,
not the place to the perſon; as the preſence of God makes the Heaven,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44233:9"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the Heaven doth not make the honour glorious. No blinde corner of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
can hide the bleſſed Virgin from the Angel. The favours of God will
finde out his children whereſoever they are withdrawn.</p>
                  <p>It is the faſhion of God to ſeek out the moſt deſpiſed, on whom to beſtow
his honours. We cannot run away as from the judgements, ſo not from the
mercies of our God. The cottages of Galilee are preferred by God to the
famous Palaces of Jeruſalem: he cares not how homely he converſe with his
own. Why ſhould we be tranſported with the outward glory of places, whiles
our God regards it not? We are not of the Angels diet, if we had not rather be
with the bleſſed Virgin at Nazareth, then with the proud Dames in the Court
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of Jeruſalem. It is a great vanity to reſpect any thing above goodneſs, and to
diſeſteem goodneſs for any want. The Angel ſalutes the Virgin, he prayes
not to her; he ſalutes her as a Saint, he prayes not to her as a Goddeſs. For us
to ſalute her as he did, were groſſe preſumption; for neither are we as he
was, neither is ſhe as ſhe was. If he that was a Spirit ſaluted her that was fleſh
and blood here on earth, it is not for us that are fleſh and blood to ſalute her
which is a glorious Spirit in Heaven. For us to pray to her in the Angels ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation,
were to abuſe the Virgin, the Angel, the ſalutation.</p>
                  <p>But how gladly doe we ſecond the Angel in the praiſe of her, which was
more ours then his? How juſtly doe we bleſſe her, whom the Angel pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> bleſſed? How worthily is ſhe honoured of men, whom the Angel proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
beloved of God? O bleſſed <hi>Mary,</hi> he cannot bleſſe thee, he cannot ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
thee too much, that deifies thee not. That which the Angel ſaid of thee,
thou haſt propheſied of thy ſelf: we believe the Angel, and thee. All Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
ſhall call thee bleſſed, by the fruit of whoſe womb all Generations are
bleſſed. If <hi>Zachary</hi> were amazed with the ſight of this Angel, much more the
Virgin: That very Sex had more diſadvantage of fear. If it had been but a
man that had come to her in that ſecrecie and ſuddenneſs, ſhe could not but
have been troubled; how much more, when the ſhining glory of the perſon
doubled the aſtoniſhment?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> The troubles of holy mindes end ever in comfort: Joy was the errand of
the Angel, and not terrour. Fear (as all paſſions) diſquiets the heart, and
makes it for the time unfit to receive the meſſages of God. Soon hath the
Angel cleared theſe troubleſome miſts of paſſions, and ſent out the beams of
heavenly conſolation in the remoteſt corner of her ſoul by the glad news of
her Saviour. How can joy but enter into her heart out of whoſe womb ſhall
come ſalvation? What room can fear finde in that breaſt that is aſſured of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour?
<hi>Fear not, Mary, for thou haſt found favour with God.</hi> Let thoſe fear
who know they are in diſpleaſure, or know not they are gracious. Thine
happy eſtate calls for confidence, and that confidence for joy. What ſhould,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> what can they fear, who are favoured of him at whom the Devils tremble?
Not the preſence of the good Angels, but the temptations of the evil, ſtrike
many terrors into our weakneſſe: we could not be diſmaied with them, if we
did not forget our condition. We have not received the ſpirit of bondage to
fear again, but the ſpirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, <hi>Abba, Father.</hi> If that
Spirit (O God) witneſſe with our ſpirits that we are thine, how can we fear
any of thoſe ſpirituall wickedneſſes? Give us aſſurance of thy favour, and let
the powers of Hell doe their worſt.</p>
                  <p>It was no ordinary favour that the Virgin found in Heaven: No mortall
Creature was ever thus graced, that he ſhould take part of her nature that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> was the God of Nature; that he which made all things, ſhould make his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
body of hers; that her womb ſhould yield that fleſh which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally
united to the Godhead; that ſhe ſhould bear him that upholds the
world: <hi>Loe, thou ſhalt conceive and bear a Son, and ſhalt call his name Jeſus.</hi> It
is a queſtion, whether there be more wonder in the Conception or in the
Fruit; the Conception of the Virgin, or Jeſus conceived. Both are marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44233:10"/>
but the former doth not more exceed all other wonders then the latter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
exceedeth it. For the childe of a Virgin is the reimprovement of that power
which created the world: but that God ſhould be incarnate of a Virgin, was
an abaſement of his Majeſtie, and an exaltation of the creature beyond all
example. Well was that Child worthy to make the mother bleſſed. Here was
a double Conception, one in the wombe of her body, the other of the ſoul.
If that were more miraculous, this was more beneficiall; that was her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
this was her happineſſe: If that were ſingular to her, this is common
to all his choſen. There is no renewed heart wherein thou, O Saviour, art
not formed again. Bleſſed be thou that haſt herein made us bleſſed. For
what womb can conceive thee, and not partake of thee? Who can partake <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
of thee, and not be happy?</p>
                  <p>Doubtleſſe the Virgin underſtood the Angel, as he meant, of a preſent
Conception, which made her ſo much more inquiſitive into the manner and
means of this event: <hi>How ſhall this be, ſince I know not a man?</hi> That ſhe
ſhould conceive a Son by the knowledge of man after her Marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate,
could have been no wonder: But how then ſhould that Son of hers
be the Son of God? This demand was higher. How her preſent Virginity
ſhould be inſtantly fruitfull might be well worthy of admiration, of inquiry.
Here was deſire of information, not doubts of infidelitie; yea rather this
queſtion argues Faith: it takes for granted that which an unbelieving heart <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
would have ſtuck at. She ſayes not, Who and whence art thou? what King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is this? where and when ſhall it be erected? but ſmoothly ſuppoſing
all thoſe ſtrange things would be done, ſhe inſiſts onely on that which did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
require a further intimation, and doth not diſtruſt, but demand. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth ſhe ſay, This cannot be, nor, How can this be? but, How ſhall this be?
So doth the Angel anſwer, as one that knew he needed not to ſatisfie curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie,
but to informe judgement, and uphold faith. He doth not therefore tell
her of the manner, but of the Author of this act; <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon
thee, and the power of the moſt High ſhall over-ſhadow thee.</hi> It is enough to
know who is the undertaker, and what he wil doe. O God, what doe we ſeek <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
a clear light, where thou wilt have a ſhadow? No Mother knows the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of her naturall Conception: what preſumption ſhall it be for fleſh and
blood, to ſearch how the Son of God took fleſh and blood of his Creature?
It is for none but the Almighty to know thoſe works which he doth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
concerning himſelf; thoſe that concern us, he hath revealed: Secrets
to God, things revealed to us.</p>
                  <p>The anſwer was not ſo full, but that a thouſand difficulties might ariſe out of
the particularities of ſo ſtrange a meſſage; yet after the Angels Solution, we
hear of no more Objections, no more Interrogations. The faithfull heart,
when it once underſtands the good pleaſure of God, argues no more; but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
ſweetly reſts it ſelf in a quiet expectation: <hi>Behold the Servant of the Lord, be it
to me according to thy Word.</hi> There is not a more noble proof of our Faith, then
to captivate all the powers of our underſtanding and will to our Creator, and
without all ſciſcitations to goe blind-fold whither he will lead us. All diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
with God (after his will known) ariſe from infidelity. Great is the
Myſterie of godlineſſe, and if we will give Nature leave to cavil, we cannot
be Chriſtians. O God, thou art faithfull, thou art powerfull: It is enough,
that thou haſt ſaid it: In the humilitie of our obedience we reſign our ſelves
over to thee. Behold the Servants of the Lord, be it unto us according to
thy Word.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>How fit was her womb to conceive the fleſh of the Son of God by the
power of the Spirit of God, whoſe breaſt had ſo ſoon by the power of the ſame
Spirit conceived an aſſent to the will of God? and now of an Hand-maid of
God, ſhe is advanced to the Mother of God. No ſooner hath ſhe ſaid (<hi>be it
done</hi>) then it is done, the Holy Ghoſt over-ſhadows her and forms her Saviour
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44233:10"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in her own body. This very Angel that talks with the Bleſſed Virgin; could
ſcarce have been able to expreſs the joy of her heart in the ſenſe of this Divine
burden. Never any mortall creature had ſo much cauſe of exultation. How
could ſhe that was full of God be other then full of joy in that God? Grief
grows greater by concealing; Joy by expreſſion. The holy Virgin had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by the Angel, how her Couſin <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was no leſſe of kin to her in
condition; the fruitfulneſſe of whoſe age did ſomewhat ſuit the fruitfulneſſe of
her Virginitie. Happineſſe communicated doubles it ſelf. Here is no ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of courteſie. The bleſſed Maid whom vigor of age had more fitted for the
way, haſtens her journey into the Hill-country to viſit that gracios Matron
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> whom God had made a ſign of her miraculous Conception. Onely the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Saints in Heaven can parallel the meeting of theſe two Couſins: the two
wonders of the World are met under one roof, and congratulate their mutual
happineſſe. When we have Chriſt ſpiritually conceived in us, we cannot be
quiet till we have imparted our joy. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> that holy Matron did no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
welcome her bleſſed Couſin, then her Babe welcomes his Saviour. Both
in the retired Cloſets of their Mothers Womb are ſenſible of each others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;
the one by his omniſcience, the other by inſtinct. He did not more fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
Chriſt then over-run Nature. How ſhould our hearts leap within us,
when the Son of God vouchſafes to come into the ſecret of our Souls, not to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> viſit us, but to dwell with us, to dwell in us!</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The Birth of Chriſt.</head>
                  <p>AS all the actions of men, ſo eſpecially the publick actions of publick
men are ordered by God to other ends then their own. This Edict
went not ſo much out from <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> as from the Court of Heaven.
What, did <hi>Caeſar</hi> know <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary?</hi> His charge was univerſal to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> a world of ſubjects through all the Roman Empire. God intended this Cenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
onely for the Bleſſed Virgin and her Son, that Chriſt might be born where
he ſhould. <hi>Caeſar</hi> meant to fill his Coffers, God meant to fulfil his Propheſies;
and ſo to fulfill them, that thoſe whom it concerned might not feel the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment.
If God had directly commanded the Virgin to goe up to Bethleem,
ſhe had ſeen the intention, and expected the iſſue: but that wiſe Moderatour
of all things, that works his will in us, loves ſo to doe it as may be leaſt with
our fore-ſight and acquaintance, and would have us fall under his Decrees
unawares, that we may ſo much the more adore the depths of his Providence.
Every Creature walkes blind-fold, onely he that dwels in light ſees whither
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> they goe.</p>
                  <p>Doubtleſs, bleſſed <hi>Mary</hi> meant to have been delivered of her Divine burden
at home, and little thought of changing the place of Conception for another
of her Birth. That houſe was honoured by the Angel, yea, by the over-ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing
of the Holy Ghoſt, none could equally ſatisfie her hopes or deſires:
It was fit that he which made choice of the Womb wherein his Son ſhould be
conceived, ſhould make choice of the place where his Son ſhould be born.
As the work is all his, ſo will he alone contrive all the circumſtances to his
own ends. Oh the infinite Wiſedom of God in caſting all his Deſigns!
There needs no other proof of Chriſt then <hi>Caeſar</hi> and Bethleem; and of <hi>Caeſars,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> then <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> his Government, his Edict pleads the truth of the <hi>Meſsias.</hi>
His Government now was the deep peace of all the world under that quiet
Scepter which made way for him who was the Prince of Peace. If Wars be a
ſign of the time of his ſecond coming, Peace was a ſigne of his firſt. His Edict;
now was the Scepter departed from <hi>Juda.</hi> It was the time for <hi>Shilo</hi> to come.
No power was left in the Jewes, but to obey. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> is the Emperor of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44233:11"/>
World, under him <hi>Herod</hi> is the King of <hi>Judaea, Cyrenius</hi> is preſident of <hi>Syria; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
Jurie</hi> hath nothing of her own. For <hi>Herod</hi> if he were a King, yet he was no Jew;
and if he had been a Jew, yet he was no otherwiſe a King, then tributary and
titular. The Edict came out from <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> was executed by <hi>Cyrenius; Herod</hi>
is no actor in this ſervice. Gain and glory are the ends of this taxation: each
man profeſt himſelf a ſubject, and paid for the priviledge of his ſervitude.
Now their very heads were not their own, but muſt be payed for to the head of
a forrein Seate. They which before ſtood upon the termes of their immunitie,
ſtoop at the laſt. The proud ſuggeſtions of <hi>Judas</hi> the Galilean might ſhed their
blood and ſwell their ſtomacks, but could not eaſe their yoak; neither was it
the meaning of God, that holineſſe (if they had been as they pretended) ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
ſhelter them from ſubjection. A Tribute is impoſed upon Gods free people.
This act of bondage brings them liberty. Now when they ſeemed moſt neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
of God, they are bleſſed with a Redeemer; when they are moſt preſſed
with forrein Soveraignty, God ſends them a King of their own, to whom <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
himſelf muſt be a ſubject. The goodneſſe of our God picks out the moſt
needfull times of our relief and comfort: Our extremities give him the moſt
glory. Whither muſt <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Marie</hi> come to be taxed, but unto <hi>Bethleem
David</hi>'s Citie? The very place proves their deſcent: He that ſucceeded <hi>David</hi>
in his Throne, muſt ſucceed him in the place of his Birth. So clearly was <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leem</hi>
deſigned to this honour by the Prophets, that even the Prieſts and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Scribes could point <hi>Herod</hi> unto it, and aſſured him the King of the Jews could
be no where elſe born. <hi>Bethleem</hi> juſtly <hi>the houſe of bread;</hi> the bread that came
down from Heaven is there given to the world: whence ſhould we have the
bread of life, but from the houſe of bread? O holy <hi>David,</hi> was this the Well
of <hi>Bethleem,</hi> whereof thou didſt ſo thirſt to drink of old, when thou ſaidſt, <hi>O
that one would give me drink of the water of the Well of Bethleem!</hi> Surely that
other water, when it was brought thee by thy Worthies, thou pouredſt it on
the ground, and wouldſt not drink of it. This was that living Water for which
thy ſoul longed, whereof thou ſaidſt elſewhere, <hi>As the Hart brayeth after the
water-brooks, ſo longeth my ſoul after thee, O God: My ſoul thirſteth for God, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
the living God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was no leſſe then four daies journey from <hi>Nazareth</hi> to <hi>Bethleem:</hi> How
juſt an excuſe might the Bleſſed Virgin have pleaded for her abſence? What
woman did ever undertake ſuch a journey ſo near her delivery? And doubtleſſe
<hi>Joſeph,</hi> which was now taught of God to love and honour her, was loath to
draw forth a dear wife in ſo unwieldy a caſe, into ſo manifeſt hazard. But the
charge was peremptory, the obedience exemplary. The deſire of an inoffenſive
obſervance even of Heatheniſh authority, digeſts all difficulties. We may not
take eaſie occaſions to withdraw our obedience to ſupreme commands. Yea
how didſt thou (O Saviour) by whom <hi>Auguſtus</hi> reigned, in the Womb of thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
Mother yield this homage to <hi>Auguſtus?</hi> The firſt leſſon that ever thy example
taught us, was Obedience.</p>
                  <p>After many ſteps are <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> come to <hi>Bethleem.</hi> The plight
wherein ſhe was would not allow any ſpeed, and the forced leiſure of the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
cauſeth diſappointment: the end was worſe then the way; there was no reſt
in the way, there was no room in the Inne. It could not be but that there were
many of the kindred of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> at that time in <hi>Bethleem;</hi> for both
there were their Anceſtors born, if not themſelves, and thither came up all
the Couſins of their blood; yet there and then doth the holy Virgin want
room to lay either her head or her burthen. If the houſe of <hi>David</hi> had not loſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
all mercy and good nature, a Daughter of <hi>David</hi> could not ſo near the time of
her travel have been deſtitute of lodging in the City of <hi>David.</hi> Little did the
<hi>Bethleemites</hi> think what a gueſt they refuſed: elſe they would gladly have
opened their doors to him, which was able to open the gates of Heaven to
them. Now their inhoſpitality is puniſhment enough to it ſelf: They have
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44233:11"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> loſt the honour and happineſſe of being hoſt to their God. Even ſtill, O bleſſed
Saviour, thou ſtandeſt at our doors and knockeſt; every motion of thy good
Spirit tells us thou art there: Now thou comeſt in thine own name, and there
thou ſtandeſt, whiles thy head is full of dew, and thy locks wet with the drops
of the night. If we ſuffer carnal deſires and worldly thoughts to take up the
lodging of our heart and revel within us whiles thou waiteſt upon our admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſurely our judgement ſhall be ſo much the greater, by how much better we
know whom we have excluded. What do we cry ſhame on the <hi>Bethleemites,</hi>
whileſt we are wilfully more churliſh, more unthankfull? There is no room in
my heart for the wonder at this humility. He for whom Heaven is too ſtreight,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> whom the Heaven of heavens cannot contain, lies in the ſtreight cabbin of the
womb, and when he would inlarge himſelf for the world, is not allowed
the room of an Inne. The many manſions of Heaven were at his diſpoſing;
the Earth was his and the fulneſſe of it; yet he ſuffers himſelf to be refuſed of
a baſe cottage, and complaineth not. What meaſure ſhould diſcontent us wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
men, when thou (O God) fareſt thus from thy creatures? How ſhould we
learn both to want and abound, from thee, which abounding with the glory
and riches of heaven, wouldſt want a lodging in thy firſt welcome to the earth?
Thou cameſt to thine own, and thy own received thee not: How can it trouble
us to be rejected of the world, which is not ours? What wonder is it if thy
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſervants wandred abroad in ſheeps skins and goats skins, deſtitute and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
when their Lord is denyed harbour? How ſhould all the world bluſh at
this indignity of <hi>Bethleem?</hi> He that came to ſave men, is ſent for his firſt
lodging to the beaſts: the ſtable is become his Inne, the cratch his bed. O
ſtrange cradle of that great King, which heaven it ſelf may envy! O Saviour,
thou that wert both the Maker and Owner of Heaven, of Earth, couldſt have
made thee a Palace without hands, couldſt have commanded thee an empty
room in thoſe houſes which thy creatures had made. When thou didſt but
bid the Angels avoid their firſt place, they fell down from Heaven like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
and when in thy humbled eſtate thou didſt but ſay, <hi>I am he,</hi> who was
able to ſtand before thee? How eaſie had it been for thee to have made place
for thy ſelf in the throngs of the ſtatelieſt Courts? Why wouldſt thou be thus

contemn them? that thou mighteſt ſanctifie poverty to them, whom thou

beaſts gave way to the God of all the world. It is the great myſterie of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
that God was manifeſted in the fleſh, and ſeen of Angels; but here, which
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> was the top of all wonders, the very beaſts might ſee their Maker. For thoſe
ſpirits to ſee God in the fleſh, it was not ſo ſtrange, as for the brute creatures to
ſee him which was the God of ſpirits. He that would be led into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
amongſt wilde beaſts to be tempted, would come into the houſe of beaſts
to be born, that from the height of his divine glory his humiliation might be
the greater. How can we be abaſed low enough for thee (O Saviour) that
haſt thus neglected thy ſelf for us? That the viſitation might be anſwerable

home, and have no ſummons to attend him by whom they reign: God hath
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> choſen the weak things of the world to confound the mighty. In an obſcure
time (the night) unto obſcure men (ſhepherds) doth God manifeſt the light of
his Son by glorious Angels. It is not our meanneſſe (O God) that can exclude
us from the beſt of thy mercies; yea thus far doſt thou reſpect perſons, that
thou haſt put down the mighty, and exalted them of low degree. If theſe ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
had been ſnorting in their beds, they had no more ſeen Angels, nor

with this heavenly viſion. Thoſe which are induſtrious in any calling are
capable of further bleſſings, whereas the idle are fit for nothing but temptation.
No leſſe then a whole Chore of Angels are worthy to ſing the hymn of <hi>Glory
to God,</hi> for the incarnation of his Son. What joy is enough for us, whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
he took, and whom he came to reſtore by his incarnation? If we had the
tongues of Angels, we could not raiſe this note high enough to the praiſe of our
glorious Redeemer. No ſooner doe the Shepherds hear the news of a Saviour,
then they run to <hi>Bethleem</hi> to ſeeke him. Thoſe that left their beds to tend
their flocks, leave their flocks to enquire after their Saviour. No earthly thing
is too dear to be forſaken for Chriſt. If we ſuffer any worldly occaſion to ſtay <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
us from <hi>Bethleem,</hi> we care more for our ſheep then our ſouls. It is not poſſible
that a faithfull heart ſhould heare where Chriſt is, and not labour to the ſight,
to the fruition of him. Where art thou, O Saviour, but at home in thine own
houſe, in the aſſembly of thy Saints? where art thou to be found but in thy
Word and Sacraments? yea there thou ſeekeſt for us: if there we haſt not to
ſeek for thee, we are worthy to want thee, worthy that our want of thee here
ſhould make us want the preſence of thy face for ever.</p>

ſhepherds that ſeemed not more like a King, then that King whom

There lies the Babe in the ſtable, crying in the manger, whom the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
came down from heaven to proclaim, whom the Sages come from the
Eaſt to adore, whom an heavenly Star notifies to the world, that now men
might ſee that Heaven and earth ſerves him that neglected himſelf. Thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
lights that hang low are not far ſeen, but thoſe which are high placed are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeen in the remoteſt diſtances. Thy light, O Saviour, was no leſſe then hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly.
The Eaſt ſaw that which <hi>Bethleem</hi> might have ſeen: oft-times thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
which are neereſt in place are fartheſt off in affection. Large objects when they
are too cloſe to the eye, doe ſo overfill the ſenſe, that they are not diſcerned.
What a ſhame is this to <hi>Bethleem?</hi> the Sages came out of the Eaſt to worſhip
him whom that village refuſed. The <hi>Bethleemites</hi> were Jews; the wiſe-men
Gentiles. This firſt entertainment of Chriſt was a preſage of the ſequel: The
Gentiles ſhall come from far to adore Chriſt, whiles the Jews reject him.
Thoſe Eaſterlings were great ſearchers of the depths of Nature, profeſſed Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
them hath God ſingled out to the honour of the manifeſtation of
Chriſt. Humane Learning well improved makes us capable of Divine. There
is no Knowledge whereof God is not the Authour: he would never have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
any gift that ſhould lead us away from himſelf. It is an ignorant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
that inquiry into Nature ſhould make men Atheous. No man is ſo apt

                     </gap> that is wiſe for his own ſoul. If theſe wiſe men
had been acquainted with all the other ſtars of heaven, and had not ſeen the
Star of Chriſt, they had had but light enough to lead them into utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
Philoſophy without this Star is but the wiſp of Errour. Theſe Sages
were in a mean between the Angels and the Shepherds. God would in all the
ranks of intelligent Creatures have ſome to be witneſſes of his Son. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
direct the Shepherds, the Star guides the Sages. The duller capacity
hath the more clear and powerful helps: the wiſdome of our good God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the means unto the diſpoſition of the perſons. Their Aſtronomy had
taught them this Star was not ordinary, whether in ſight, or in brightneſs, or
in motion. The eyes of Nature might well ſee that ſome ſtrange news was
portended to the world by it; but that this Star deſigned the birth of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi>
there needed yet another light. If the Star had not beſides had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
of a revelation from God, it could have led the wiſe-men onely into
a fruitleſs wonder. Give them to be the offspring of <hi>Balaam,</hi> yet the true pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of that falſe Prophet was not enough warrant. If he told them the
<hi>Meſsias</hi> ſhould ariſe as a Star out of <hi>Jacob,</hi> he did not tell them that a Star
ſhould ariſe far from the poſterity of <hi>Jacob,</hi> at the birth of the <hi>Meſsias.</hi> He that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> did put that Propheſie into the mouth of <hi>Balaam,</hi> did alſo put this illumination
into the heart of the Sages. The Spirit of God is free to breathe where he
liſteth: <hi>Many ſhall come from the Eaſt and the Weſt</hi> to ſeek Chriſt, when <hi>the
Children of the Kingdome ſhall be ſhut out.</hi> Even then God did not ſo confine his
election to the pale of the Church, as that he did not ſometimes look out for
ſpecial inſtruments of his glory. Whither do theſe Sages come, but to <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem?</hi>
where ſhould they hope to hear of the new King, but in the mother
City of the Kingdome? The conduct of the Star was firſt only general to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea;</hi>
the reſt is for a time left to inquiry: they were not brought thither for
their own ſakes, but for <hi>Jewrie</hi>'s, for the worlds; that they might help to make
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Jews inexcuſable, and the world faithful. That their tongues therefore
might blazon the birth of Chriſt, they are brought to the head City of <hi>Judaea,</hi>
to report and inquire. Their wiſdome could not teach them to imagine that a
King could be born to <hi>Judaea</hi> of that note and magnificence, that a Star from
heaven ſhould publiſh him to the earth, and that his ſubjects ſhould not know
it: and therefore as preſuppoſing a common notice, they ſay, <hi>Where is he that is
born King of the Jews?</hi> There is much deceit in probabilities, eſpecially when
we meddle with ſpiritual matters. For God uſes ſtill to goe a way by himſelf.</p>
                  <p>If we judge according to reaſon and appearance, who is ſo likely to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
heavenly truths as the profound Doctors of the world? Theſe God
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> paſſes over, and reveals his will to babes. Had theſe Sages met with the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
of the villages near <hi>Bethleem,</hi> they had received that intelligence of Chriſt
which they did vainly ſeek from the learned Scribes of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Clerks are not alwaiess the wiſeſt in the affairs of God: theſe things goe
not by diſcourſe, but by revelation.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner hath the Star brought them within the noiſe of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> then
it is vaniſhed out of ſight. God would have their eyes lead them ſo far, as till
their tongues might be ſet on work to win the vocal atteſtation of the chief
Prieſts and Scribes to the fore-appointed place of our Saviours nativity. If the
Star had caried them directly to <hi>Bethleem,</hi> the learned Jews had never ſearched
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the truth of thoſe propheſies, wherewith they are ſince juſtly convinced. God
never withdraws our helps, but for a further advantage. However our hopes
ſeem croſſed, where his Name may gain, we cannot complain of loſſe.</p>
                  <p>Little did the Sages think this queſtion would have troubled <hi>Herod:</hi> they
had (I fear) concealed their meſſage, if they had ſuſpected this event. Sure,
they thought it might be ſome Son or grandchild of him which then held the
Throne, ſo as this might win favour from <hi>Herod,</hi> rather then an unwelcome
fear of rivalty. Doubtleſs they went firſt to the Court; where elſe ſhould
they ask for a King: The more pleaſing this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> if it had falne
upon <hi>Herod</hi>'s own loyns, the more grievous it was to light upon a ſtranger.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> If <hi>Herod</hi> had not over-much affected greatneſs, he had not upon thoſe indirect
terms aſpired to the Crown of <hi>Jewry:</hi> ſo much the more therefore did it
trouble him to hear the rumor of a ſucceſſor, and that not of his own. Setled
greatneſs cannot abide either change or partnerſhip. If any of his ſubjects had
moved this queſtion, I fear his head had anſwered it. It is well that the name
of forrainers could excuſe theſe Sages. <hi>Herod</hi> could not be brought up among
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44233:13"/>
the Jews, and not have heard many and confident reports of a <hi>Meſsias</hi> that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
ſhould ere long ariſe out of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and now when he hears the fame of a King
born, whom a Star from Heaven ſignifies and attends, he is netled with the
news. Every thing affrights the guilty. Uſurpation is full of jealouſies and
fear; no leſſe full of projects and imaginations: it makes us think every buſh
a man, and every man a thief.</p>
                  <p>Why art thou troubled (O <hi>Herod?</hi>) A King is born; but ſuch a King, as
whoſe Scepter may ever concur with lawfull Soveraignty; yea ſuch a King, as
by whom Kings doe hold their Scepters, not loſe them. If the wiſe-men tell
thee of a King, the Star tells thee he is heavenly. Here is good cauſe of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
none of fear. The moſt general enmities and oppoſitions to good ariſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
from miſtakings. If men could but know how much ſafety and ſweetneſſe
there is in all Divine truth, it could receive nothing from them but welcomes
and gratulations. Miſconceits have been ſtill guilty of all wrongs and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
But if <hi>Herod</hi> were troubled, (as Tyranny is ſtill ſuſpicious) why was all
<hi>Hieruſalem</hi> troubled with him? <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> which now might hope for a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xation
of her bonds, for a recovery of her liberty and right? <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi>
which now onely had cauſe to lift up her drooping head in the joy and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a Redeemer? Yet not <hi>Herod</hi>'s Court, but even <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled;
ſo had this miſerable City been overtoiled with change, that now they
were ſetled in a condition quietly evil, they are troubled with the news of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
They had now got a habit of ſervility, and now they are ſo acquainted
with the yoke, that the very noiſe of liberty (which they ſuppoſed would not
come with eaſe) began to be unwelcome.</p>
                  <p>To turn the cauſes of joy into ſorrow, argues extreme dejectedneſſe, and a
diſtemper of judgment no leſſe then deſperate. Fear puts on a viſor of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Herod</hi> calls his learned counſel, and as not doubting whether the <hi>Meſsiah</hi>
ſhould be born, he asks where he ſhall be born. In the diſparition of that
other light, there is a perpetually-fixed Star ſhining in the writings of the
Prophets, that guides the chief Prieſts and Scribes directly unto <hi>Bethleem.</hi>
As yet envy and prejudice had not blinded the eyes and perverted the hearts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
of the Jewiſh teachers; ſo as now they clearly juſtifie that Chriſt whom they
afterwards condemne, and by thus juſtifying him condemn themſelves in
rejecting him. The water that is untroubled yields the viſage perfectly. If
God had no more witneſſe but from his enemies, we have ground enough of
our faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Herod</hi> feared, but diſſembled his fear, as thinking it a ſhame that ſtrangers
ſhould ſee there could any power ariſe under him worthy of his reſpect or awe.
Out of an unwillingneſſe therefore to diſcover the impotency of his paſſion, he
makes little adoe of the matter, but onely, after a privy inquiſition into the
Time, imployes the informers in the ſearch of the Perſon; <hi>Goe and ſearch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
for the Babe,</hi> &amp;c. It was no great journy from <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> to <hi>Bethleem:</hi>
how eaſily might <hi>Herod</hi>'s cruelty have ſecretly ſuborned ſome of his bloody
Courtiers to this inquiry and execution? If God had not meant to mock him
before he found himſelf mocked of the wiſe-men, he had rather ſent before
their journey, then after their diſappointment. But that God in whoſe hands
all hearts are did purpoſely beſot him, that he might not finde the way to ſo
horrible a miſchief.</p>

are upon their way full of exſpectation, full of deſire: I ſee no man either of the
City or Court to accompany them. Whether diſtruſt or fear hindred them,
I inquire not: but of ſo many thouſand Jews, no one ſtirs his foot to ſee that
King of theirs which ſtrangers came ſo far to viſite. Yet were not theſe reſolute
Sages diſcouraged with this ſolitarineſſe and ſmall reſpect, nor drawn to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44233:13"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> repent of their journey, as thinking, What do we come ſo farre to honour a
King whom no man will acknowledge? what mean we to travell ſo many
hundred miles to ſee that which the inhabitants will not look out to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold?
but chearfully renew their journey to that place which the ancient
light of Propheſie had deſigned. And now behold, God encourages their
holy forwardneſſe from Heaven, by ſending them their firſt guide; as if he
had ſaid, What need ye care for the neglect of men, when ye ſee Heaven ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
the King whom ye ſeek? What joy theſe Sages conceived when their
eyes firſt beheld the re-appearance of that happy Starre, they onely can tell,
that after a long and ſad night of Tentation have ſeen the loving counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of God ſhining forth upon their ſouls. If with obedience and courage
we can follow the calling of God in difficult enterpriſes, we ſhall not want ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
of comfort. Let not us be wanting to God, we ſhall be ſure he cannot be
wanting to us.</p>
                  <p>He that led <hi>Iſrael</hi> by a Pillar of fire into the Land of Promiſe, leads the
wiſe-men by a Star to the Promiſed ſeed. All his directions partake of that
light which is in him: For God is light. This Star moves both ſlowly and
low, as might be fitteſt for the pace, for the purpoſe of theſe Pilgrims. It is
the goodneſs of God that in thoſe means wherein we cannot reach him, he
deſcends unto us. Surely when the wiſe-men ſaw the Star ſtand ſtill, they
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> looked about to ſee what Palace there might be near unto that ſtation fit
for the birth of a King; neither could they think that ſorry ſhed was it which
the Star meant to point out, but finding their guide ſetled over that baſe roof,
they goe in to ſee what gueſt it held. They enter, and, O God, what a King
doe they finde! how poor! how contemptible! wrapt in clouts, laid in ſtraw,
cradled in the manger, attended with beaſts! what a ſight was this, after all
the glorious promiſes of that Star, after the predictions of Prophets, after the
magnificence of their expectation!</p>
                  <p>All their way afforded nothing ſo deſpicable as that Babe whom they came
to worſhip. But as thoſe which could not have been wiſe-men unleſſe they
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> had known that the greateſt glories have ariſen from mean beginnings, they
fall down and worſhip that hidden Majeſty. This baſeneſs hath bred wonder
in them, not contempt: they well knew the Star could not lie. They which
ſaw his Star afar off in the Eaſt, when he lay ſwadled in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> do alſo ſee
his Roialty further off, in the deſpiſed eſtate of his infancy: A Roialty more
then humane. They well knew that Stars did not uſe to attend earthly Kings;
and if their aime had not been higher, what was a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> King to <hi>Perſian</hi> ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers?
Anſwerable therefore hereunto was their adoration. Neither did they
lift up empty hands to him whom they worſhip'd, but preſented him with the
moſt precious commodities of their Country, <hi>Gold, Incenſe, Myrrhe;</hi> not as
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thinking to enrich him with theſe, but by way of homage acknowledging him
the Lord of theſe. If theſe Sages had been Kings, and had offered a Princely
weight of gold, the Bleſſed Virgin had not needed in her Purification to have
offered two young pigeons, as the ſign of her penury. As God loves not empty
hands, ſo he meaſures fulneſs by the affection. Let it be Gold, or Incenſe, or
Myrrhe, that we offer him, it cannot but pleaſe him, who doth not uſe to ask
how much, but how good.</p>

to our Souls that was done to thy Body? We cannot be therefore thine,
if our hearts be uncircumciſed. Doe thou that in us which was done to
thee for us; cut off the ſuperfluitie of our maliciouſneſſe, that we may be holy
in and by thee, which for us wert content to be Legally impure.</p>
                  <p>There was ſhame in thy Birth, there was paine in thy Circumciſion. After
a contemptible welcome into the world, that a ſharp raſor ſhould paſſe

What pain or contempt ſhould we refuſe for thee, that haſt made no ſpare

Chriſt born, adored, circumciſed. No ſooner is the Bleſſed Virgin either
able or allowed to walk, then ſhe travels to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to perform her

If purifying were a ſhadow, yet thankſgiving is a ſubſtance. Thoſe
whom God hath bleſſed with fruit of body and ſafety of deliverance, if they

(as to countermine <hi>Herod</hi>) is come from <hi>Bethleem</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Dangers that
are aloof off, and but poſſible, may not hinder us from the duty of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.
God ſaw it not yet time to let looſe the fury of his adverſaries, whom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
he holds up like ſome eager maſtives, &amp; then onely lets goe when they ſhall
moſt ſhame themſelves and glorifie him.</p>
                  <p>Well might the Bleſſed Virgin have wrangled with the Law, and challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
an immunity from all ceremonies of purification; What ſhould I need
purging, which did not conceive in ſinne? This is for thoſe mothers whoſe
births are unclean: mine is from God, which is Purity it ſelf. The Law of
<hi>Moſes</hi> reaches onely to thoſe women which have conceived ſeed: I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not this ſeed, but the Holy Ghoſt in me. The Law extends to the mothers
of thoſe ſons which are under the Law: mine is above it. But as one that
cared more for her peace then her priviledge, and more deſired to be free <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
from offence then from labour and charge, ſhe dutifully fulfils the Law of that
God whom ſhe carried in her wombe and in her armes: like the mother
of him who, though he knew the children of the Kingdome free, yet would
pay tribute unto <hi>Caeſar:</hi> like the mother of him whom it behoved to fulfill
all righteouſneſſe. And if ſhe were ſo officious in ceremonies, as not to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44233:14"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> admit of any excuſe in the very circumſtance of her obedience, how much more
ſtrict was ſhe in the main duties of morality? That Soul is fit for the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
conception of Chriſt, that is conſcionably ſcrupulous in obſerving all
Gods Commandements; whereas he hates all alliance to a negligent or fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
heart.</p>
                  <p>The law of Purification proclaims our uncleanneſſe. The mother is not
allowed after her child-birth to come unto the Sanctuary, or to touch any
hallowed thing, till her ſet time be expired. What are we whoſe very birth
infects the mother that bears us? At laſt ſhe comes to the Temple; but with
Sacrifices, either a Lamb and a Pigeon, or Turtle, or (in the meaner eſtate)
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> two Turtle-doves, or young Pigeons: whereof one is for a burnt-offering, the
other for a ſin-offering; the one for thankſgiving, the other for expiation:
for expiation of a double ſin, of the mother that conceived, of the childe that
was conceived. We are all born ſinners, and it is a juſt queſtion, whether we
doe more infect the world or the world us. They are groſs flatterers of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that tell her ſhe is clean. If our lives had no ſin, we bring enough with
us: the very Infant that lives not to ſin as <hi>Adam,</hi> yet he ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi>
and is ſinful in himſelf. But, oh the unſpeakable mercy of our God! we
provide the ſin, he provides the remedy. Behold an expiation welnear as
early as our ſin; the blood of a young lamb, or dove, yea rather the blood
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of Him whoſe innocence was repreſented by both, cleanſeth us preſently
from our filthineſs. Firſt went Circumciſion, then came the Sacrifice; that
by two holy acts that which was naturally unholy might be hallowed unto
God. Under the Goſpel our Baptiſm hath the force of both: it does away
our corruption by the water of the Spirit; it applies to us the ſacrifice of
Chriſts blood, whereby we are cleanſed. Oh that we could magnifie this
goodneſs of our God, which hath not left our very infancy without redreſſe,
but hath provided helps whereby we may be delivered from the danger of our
hereditary evils.</p>
                  <p>Such is the favourable reſpect of our wiſe God, that he would not have us
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> undoe our ſelves with devotion: the ſervice he requires of us is ruled by our
abilities. Every poor mother was not able to bring a lamb for her offering:
there was none ſo poor, but might procure a pair of turtles or pigeons. Theſe
doth God both preſcribe and accept from poorer hands, no leſſe then the
beaſts of a thouſand mountains. He looks for ſomewhat of every one, not of
every one alike. Since it is he that makes differences of abilities, (to whom it
were as eaſie to make all rich) his mercy will make no difference in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation.
The truth and heartineſs of obedience is that which he will crown
in his meaneſt ſervants. A mite from the poor Widow is more worth to him
then the talents of the wealthy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> After all the preſents of thoſe Eaſtern worſhippers (who intended rather
homage then ditation) the Bleſſed Virgin comes in the form of poverty with
her two doves unto God: ſhe could not without ſome charge lie all this
while at <hi>Bethleem,</hi> ſhe could not without charge travel from <hi>Bethleem</hi> to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi>
Her Offering confeſſeth her penury. The beſt are not ever the
wealthieſt. Who can deſpiſe any one for want, when the mother of Chriſt
was not rich enough to bring a Lamb for her Purification? We may be as
happy in ruſſet as in tiſſue.</p>
                  <p>While the Bleſſed Virgin brought her Son into the Temple with that pair
of doves, here were more doves then a pair. They for whoſe ſake that offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> was brought, were more doves then the doves that were brought for that
offering. Her Son, for whom ſhe brought that dove to be ſacrificed, was that
ſacrifice which the dove repreſented. There was nothing in him but perfection
of innocence: and the oblation of him is that whereby all mothers and ſons
are fully purified. Since in our ſelves we cannot be innocent, happy are we if
we can have the ſpotleſs Dove ſacrificed for us, to make us innocent in him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:44233:15"/>
The Bleſſed Virgin had more buſineſs in the Temple then her own; ſhe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
came, as to purifie her ſelf, ſo to preſent her Son. Every male that firſt opened
the womb, was holy unto the Lord. He that was the Son of God by eternal
Generation before time, and by miraculous Conception in time, was alſo by
common courſe of Nature conſecrate unto God. It is fit the holy Mother
ſhould preſent God with his own. Her firſt-born was the firſt-born of all
creatures. It was he whoſe Temple it was that he was preſented in, to whom
all the firſt-born of all creatures were conſecrated, by whom they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted;
and now is he brought in his Mothers arms to his own houſe, and as
Man is preſented to himſelf as God. If <hi>Moſes</hi> had never written Law of
God's ſpecial propriety in the firſt-born, this Son of God's Eſſence and Love <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
had taken poſſeſſion of the Temple. His right had been a perfect Law to
himſelf. Now his obedience to that Law which himſelf had given doth no
leſſe call him thither then the challenge of his peculiar intereſt.</p>
                  <p>He that was the Lord of all creatures (ever ſince he ſtruck the firſt-born of
the <hi>Egyptians</hi>) requires the firſt male of all creatures, both man and beaſt, to
be dedicated to him: wherein God cauſed a miraculous event to ſecond Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which ſeems to challenge the firſt and beſt for the Maker. By this Rule
God ſhould have had his ſervice done onely by the heirs of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But ſince
God, for the honour and remuneration of <hi>Levi,</hi> had choſen out that Tribe to
miniſter unto him, now the firſt-born of all <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt be preſented to God as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
his due, but by allowance redeemed to their parents. As for beaſts, the firſt
male of the clean beaſts muſt be ſacrificed, of unclean exchanged for a price.
So much Morality is there in this conſtitution of God, that the beſt of all
kindes is fit to be conſecrated to the Lord of all. Every thing we have is too
good for us, if we think any thing we have too good for him.</p>
                  <p>How glorious did the Temple now ſeem, that the Owner was within the
walls of it? Now was the hour and gueſt come, in regard whereof the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Temple ſhould ſurpaſſe the firſt. This was his Houſe built for him,
dedicated to him: there had he dwelt long in his ſpirituall Preſence, in
his typical. There was nothing either placed or done within thoſe walls <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
whereby he was not reſembled: and now the Body of thoſe Shadows is
come, and preſents himſelf where he had been ever repreſented. <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
is now every where. There is no Church, no Chriſtian heart, which is
not a Temple of the living God: there is no Temple of God wherein
Chriſt is not preſented to his Father. Look upon him (O God) in whom
thou art well pleaſed; and in him and for him be well pleaſed with us.</p>
                  <p>Under the Goſpel we are all firſt-born, all heirs; every ſoul is to be
holy unto the Lord; we are a royal generation, an holy Prieſthood. Our
Baptiſm as it is our Circumciſion and our ſacrifice of purification, ſo is it
alſo our preſentation unto God. Nothing can become us but holineſſe. O <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
God to whom we are devoted, ſerve thy ſelf of us, glorifie thy ſelf by us,
till we ſhall by thee be glorified with thee.</p>

they not miſdoubting his intention, purpoſe to fulfill his charge. It could not in
their apprehenſion but be much honour to them to make their ſucceſſe known,
that now both King and people might ſee it was not fancie that led them, but
an aſſured Revelation. That God which brought them thither, diverted them,
and cauſed their eies to ſhut, to guide them the beſt way home.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Theſe Sages made a happy voyage: for now they grew into further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with God. They are honoured with a ſecond meſſenger from
heaven. They ſaw the Star in the way, the Angel in their bed: The Star gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
their journey unto Chriſt, the Angel directed their return. They ſaw the
Star by day, a viſion by night: God ſpake to their eies by the Star, he
ſpeaks to their heart by a dream. No doubt they had left much noiſe of
Chriſt behinde them: they that did ſo publiſh his Birth by their inquiry at
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> could not be ſilent when they found him at <hi>Bethleem.</hi> If they
had returned by <hi>Herod,</hi> I fear they had come ſhort home. He that meant
death to the Babe for the name of a King, could mean no other to thoſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that honoured and proclaimed a new King, and erected a throne beſides
his. They had done what they came for: and now that God whoſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
they came about, takes order at once for his Sons ſafety and for theirs.
God, which is perfection it ſelf, never begins any buſineſſe but he makes
and end, and ends happily. When our waies are his, there is no danger of
miſcarriage.</p>
                  <p>Well did theſe wiſe-men know the difference, as of Stars, ſo of dreams:
they had learned to diſtinguiſh between the natural and Divine; and once
apprehending God in their ſleep, they follow him waking, and return ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way. They were no ſubjects to <hi>Herod;</hi> his command preſſed them ſo
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> much the leſſe: or if the being within his dominions had been no leſſe bond
then native ſubjection, yet where God did countermand <hi>Herod,</hi> there could be
no queſtion whom to obey. They ſay not, We are in a ſtrange country, <hi>Herod</hi>
may meet with us, it can be no leſſe then death to mock him in his own
territories; but chearfully put themſelves upon the way, and truſt God
with the ſucceſſe. Where men command with God, we muſt obey men
for God, and God in men; when againſt him, the beſt obedience is to deny
obedience, and to turn our backs upon <hi>Herod.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The wiſe-men are ſafely arrived in the Eaſt, and fill the world full of
exſpectation as themſelves are full of wonder. <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> are returned
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> with the Babe to that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> where the wiſe-men had inquired for his
Birth. The City was doubtleſſe ſtill full of that rumor, and little thinks
that he whom they talk of was ſo neare them. From thence they are, at
leaſt in their way to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where they purpoſe their abode. God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
them by his Angel; and ſends them for ſafety into <hi>Aegypt. Joſeph</hi> was
not wont to be ſo full of viſions. It was not long ſince the Angel appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto him to juſtifie the innocency of the Mother, and the Deity of the
Son: now he appears for the preſervation of both, and a preſervation
by flight. Could <hi>Joſeph</hi> now chuſe but think, Is this the King that muſt
ſave <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that needs to be ſaved by me? If he be the Son of God, how
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> is he ſubject to the violence of men? How is he Almighty, that muſt ſave
himſelf by flight? or how muſt he flie, to ſave himſelf out of that Land
which he comes to ſave? But faithful <hi>Joſeph</hi> having been once tutored by
the Angel, and having heard what the wiſe-men ſaid of the Star, what
<hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> ſaid in the Temple; labours not ſo much to reconcile his
thoughts, as to ſubject them; and as one that knew it ſafer to ſuppreſſe doubts
then to aſſoil them, can believe what he underſtands not, and can wonder
where he cannot comprehend.</p>
                  <p>Oh ſtrange condition of the King of all the word! He could not be born
in a baſer eſtate, yet even this he cannot enjoy with ſafety. There was no
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> room for him in <hi>Bethleem;</hi> there will be no room for him in <hi>Judaea.</hi> He
is no ſooner come to his own, then he muſt flie from them; that he may
ſave them, he muſt avoid them. Had it not been eaſie for thee (O Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour)
to have acquit thy ſelf from <hi>Herod</hi> a thouſand waies? What could
an arm of fleſh have done againſt the God of Spirits? What had it been

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44233:16"/>
commanded fire from Heaven on thoſe that ſhould have come to apprehend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
thee? or to have bidden the Earth to receive them alive whom ſhe meant
to ſwallow dead? We ſuffer miſery, becauſe we muſt; thou, becauſe
thou wouldeſt. The ſame will that brought thee from Heaven into earth,
ſends thee from <hi>Jury</hi> to <hi>Egypt.</hi> As thou wouldſt be born mean and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
ſo thou wouldſt live ſubject to humane vexations; that thou, which
haſt taught us how good it is to bear the yoak even in our youth, mightſt
ſanctifie to us early afflictions. Or whether (O Father) ſince it was the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of thy wiſdom to manifeſt thy Son by degrees unto the world, was
it thy will thus to hide him for a time under our infirmity? And what other
is our condition? we are no ſooner born thine then we are perſecuted.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
If the Church travel and bring forth a male, ſhe is in danger of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
ſtreams. What do the Members complain of the ſame meaſure
which was offered to the Head? Both our births are accompanied with
tears.</p>
                  <p>Even of thoſe whoſe mature age is full of trouble, yet the infancie is
commonly quiet: but here life and toile began together. O Bleſſed Virgin!
even already did the ſword begin to pierce thy ſoul: thou which wert for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to bear thy Son in thy womb from <hi>Nazareth</hi> to <hi>Bethleem,</hi> muſt now
bear him in thy arms from <hi>Jury</hi> into <hi>Egypt:</hi> yet couldſt thou not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of the way whileſt thy Saviour was with thee. His preſence alone <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
was able to make the ſtable a Temple, <hi>Egypt</hi> a Paradiſe, the way more
pleaſing then reſt. But whither then? O whither doſt thou carry that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
burthen, by which thy ſelf and the world are upholden? To <hi>Egypt,</hi>
the ſlaughter-houſe of God's people, the fornace of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s ancient affliction,
the ſink of the world. <hi>Out of Egypt have I called my Son</hi> (ſaith God.) That
thou calledſt thy Son out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> O God, is no marvel: It is a marvel that
thou calledſt him into <hi>Egypt;</hi> but that we know all earths are thine, and
all places and men are like figures upon a table, ſuch as thy diſpoſition
makes them. What a change is here? <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the firſt-born of God, flies
out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into the promiſed Land of <hi>Judaea;</hi> Chriſt, the firſt-born of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
all creatures, flies from <hi>Judaea</hi> into <hi>Egypt. Egypt</hi> is become the Sanctuary,
<hi>Judaea</hi> the Inquiſition-houſe of the Son of God. He that is everywhere
the ſame, makes all places alike to his: He makes the fiery fornace a gallery
of pleaſure, the Lions den an houſe of defence, the Whales belly a lodging
chamber, <hi>Egypt</hi> an harbour.</p>
                  <p>He flees that was able to preſerve himſelf from danger; to teach us how
lawfully we may flee from thoſe dangers we cannot avoid otherwiſe. It is
a thankleſſe fortitude to offer our throat unto the knife. He that came to
die for us, fled for his own preſervation, and hath bid us follow him; <hi>When
they perſecute you in one City, flee into another.</hi> We have but the uſe of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
lives, and we are bound to husband them to the beſt advantage of God and
his Church. God hath made us, not as Butts to be perpetually ſhot at, but as
the marks of Rovers moveable, as the wind and Sun may beſt ſerve.</p>
                  <p>It was warrant enough for <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> that God commands them to
flee: yet ſo familiar is God grown with his approved ſervants, that he gives
them the reaſon of his commanded flight; (<hi>For Herod will ſeek the young child
to deſtroy him.</hi>) What wicked men will do, what they would do, is known
unto God before-hand. He that is ſo infinitely wiſe to know the deſigns of
his enemies before they are, could as eaſily prevent them that they might not
be: but he lets them run on in their own courſes, that he may fetch glory to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
himſelf out of their wickedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Good <hi>Joſeph</hi> having this charge in the night, ſtaies not till the morning;
no ſooner had God ſaid <hi>Ariſe,</hi> then he ſtarts up and ſets forward. It was not
diffidence, but obedience that did ſo haſten his departure. The charge was
direct, the buſineſs important. He dares not linger for the light, but breaks
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44233:16"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> his reſt for the journey, and taking vantage of the dark, departs towards <hi>Egypt.</hi>
How knew he this occaſion would abide any delay? We cannot be too
ſpeedy in the execution of God's commands; we may be too late. Here
was no treaſure to hide, no hangings to take down, no lands to ſecure: the
poor Carpenter needs doe no more but lock the doors and away. He goes
lightly that wants a load. If there be more pleaſure in abundance, there is
more ſecurity in a mean eſtate. The Buſtard or the Oſtridge, when he is
purſued, can hardly get upon his wings; whereas the Lark mounts with eaſe.
The rich hath not ſo much advantage of the poor in injoying, as the poor
hath of the rich in leaving.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Now is <hi>Joſeph</hi> come down into <hi>Egypt. Egypt</hi> was beholden to the name,
as that whereto it did owe no leſſe then their univerſal preſervation. Well
might it repay this act of Hoſpitality to that name and blood. The going down
into <hi>Egypt</hi> had not ſo much difficulty, as the ſtaying there: their abſence
from their Country was little better then a baniſhment. But what was this
other then to ſerve a prentiſhip in the houſe of bondage? To be any where
ſave at home was irkſome: but to be in <hi>Egypt</hi> ſo many years amongſt ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Pagans, muſt needs be painful to religious hearts. The Command
of their God and the Preſence of Chriſt makes amends for all. How
long ſhould they have thought it to ſee the Temple of God, if they had
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not had the God of the Temple with them? How long to preſent their
Sacrifices at the Altar of God, if they had not had him with them which
made all Sacrifices accepted, and which did accept the Sacrifice of their
hearts?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Herod</hi> was ſubtle in mocking the wiſe-men, whiles he promiſed to worſhip
him whom he meant to kill: now God makes the wiſe-men to mock him, in
diſappointing his expectation. It is juſt with God to puniſh thoſe which would
beguile others with illuſion. Great ſpirits are ſo much more impatient of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.
How did <hi>Herod</hi> now rage and fret, and vainely wiſh to have met with
thoſe falſe ſpies, and tell with what torments he would revenge their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and curſe himſelf for truſting Strangers in ſo important a buſineſſe?</p>
                  <p>The Tyrants ſuſpition would not let him reſt long. Ere many daies he ſends
to inquire of them whom he ſent to inquire of Chriſt. The notice of their ſecret
departure increaſeth his jealouſie; and now his anger runs mad, and his feare
proves deſperate. All the Infants of <hi>Bethleem</hi> ſhall bleed for this one; and
(that he may make ſure work) he cuts out to himſelf large meaſures both of
time and place. It was but very lately that the Starre appeared, that the wiſe-men
re-appeared not. They asked for him that was born, they did not name
when he was born. <hi>Herod,</hi> for more ſecuritie, over-reaches their time, and
ſetches into the ſlaughter all the Children of two years age. The Prieſts and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Scribes had told him, the town of <hi>Bethleem</hi> muſt be the place of the <hi>Meſsia</hi>'s
nativity. He fetches in all the Children of the coaſts adjoyning; yea his own
ſhall for the time be a <hi>Bethleemite.</hi> A tyrannous guiltineſſe never thinks it
ſelf ſafe, but ever ſeeks to aſſure it ſelf in the exceſſe of cruelty. Doubtleſſe
he which ſo privily inquired for Chriſt, did as ſecretly brew this maſſacre.
The mothers were ſet with their children on their laps, feeding them with the
breaſt, or talking to them in the familiar language of their love; when ſuddenly

pulling forth his Commiſſion and his knife, without regard to ſhrieks or teares,
murthers the innocent Babe, and leaves the paſſionate mother in a mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

and told thee of their unpartial diſpatch, thou ſmiledſt to think how
thou hadſt defeated thy rivall, and beguiled the Starre, and deluded the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies;
whiles God in Heaven and his Son on earth laugh thee to ſcorn,
and make thy rage an occaſion of further glory to him whom thou meanteſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

                  <p>He that could take away the lives of other, cannot protract his own. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>
is now ſent home. The coaſt is clear for the return of that holy Family:
now God calls them from their exile. Chriſt and his Mother had not ſtayed
ſo long out of the confines of the reputed viſible Church, but to teach us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
under the Croſſe. Sometimes God ſees it good for us not to ſip of
the cup of affliction, but to make a diet-drink of it, for conſtant and common
uſe. If he allow us no other liquor for many yeares, we muſt take it off chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and know that it is but the meaſure of our betters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> ſtir not without a command; their departure, ſtay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
is ordered by the voice of God. If <hi>Egypt</hi> had been more tedious
unto them, they durſt not move their foot till they were bidden. It is good
in our own buſineſſe to follow reaſon or cuſtome: but in God's buſineſſe, if
we have any other guide but himſelf, we preſume, and cannot expect a
bleſſing.</p>

I would (if I durſt) be ambitious of this only honour. Having therefore
drawn forth thoſe not frivolous thoughts out of the Old Teſtament,
I fetch theſe following from the New. God is the ſame in both; as
the body differs not with the age of the ſute, with the change of robes.
The old and new wine of holy Truth came both out of one vineyard; yet here may

honour, both in forrain nations and at home, is in this onely gainfull, that it yields
you leiſure to theſe happy thoughts, which ſhall more fully acquaint you with him
that is at once the God of Hoſts and the Prince of Peace. To the furtherance whereof
theſe my poor labours ſhall doe no thankleſs offices. In lieu of your noble favours to
me both at home and where you have merited command, nothing can be returned
but humble acknowledgments, and hearty prayers for the increaſe of your Honour,

                  <p>EVen the Spring ſhews us what we may hope for of the tree in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
In his nonage therefore would our Saviour give us a taſt of his
future proof; leſt if his perfection ſhould have ſhewed it ſelf without
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> warning to the world, it ſhould have been entertained with more
wonder then belief. Now this act of his Childhood ſhall prepare the faith
of men by fore-exſpectation. Notwithſtanding all this early demonſtration
of his Divine graces, the incredulous Jews could afterwards ſay, <hi>Whence hath
this man his wiſdome and great works?</hi> What would they have ſaid if he had
ſuddenly leapt forth into the clear light of the world? The Sun would dazle
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44233:18"/>
all eyes, if he ſhould break forth at his firſt riſing into his full ſtrength: now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
he hath both the day-ſtar to goe before him, and to bid men look for that
glorious body, and the lively colours of the day to publiſh his approach, the
eye is comforted, not hurt by his appearance.</p>
                  <p>The Parents of Chriſt went up yearly to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the Feaſt of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over:
the Law was only for the males. I do not finde the Bleſſed Virgin bound
to this voiage: the weaker ſex received indulgence from God. Yet ſhe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſpiritual profit of that journey, takes pains voluntarily to meaſure
that long way every year. Piety regards not any diſtinction of ſexes or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
neither yet doth God's acceptation: rather doth it pleaſe the mercy of
the Higheſt more to reward that ſervice which, though he like in all, yet out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
of favour he will not impoſe upon all. It could not be but that ſhe whom
the holy Ghoſt over-ſhadowed, ſhould be zealous of God's ſervice. Thoſe
that will goe no further then they are dragged in their Religious exerciſes, are
no whit of kin to her whom all Generations ſhall call bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>The childe <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the minority of his age went up with his Parents to the
holy ſolemnity, not this year only, but in all likelihood others alſo: He in the
power of whoſe Godhead and by the motion of whoſe Spirit all others aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
thither, would not himſelf ſtay at home. In all his examples he meant our
inſtruction. This pious act of his nonage intended to lead our firſt years into
timely Devotion. The firſt liquor ſeaſons the veſſel for a long time after. It is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
every way good for a man to bear God's yoke, even from his infancy: it is the
policie of the Devil to diſcourage early holineſſe. He that goes out betimes in
the morning, is more like to diſpatch his journey then he that lingers till the
day be ſpent. This Bleſſed Family came not to look at the Feaſt, and be gone;
but they duly ſtai'd out all the appointed daies of unlevened bread. They and
the reſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not want houſhold-buſineſſes at home: thoſe ſecular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
could not either keep them from repairing to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or ſend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
immaturely. Worldly cares muſt give place to the ſacred. Except we will
depart unbleſt, we muſt attend God's ſervices till we may receive his diſmiſſion.</p>
                  <p>It was the faſhion of thoſe times and places, that they went up, and ſo retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
by troups, to thoſe ſet meetings of their holy Feſtivals. The whole Pariſh
of <hi>Nazareth</hi> went and came together. Good fellowſhip doth no way ſo well
as in the paſſage to Heaven: much comfort is added by ſociety to that journey
which is of it ſelf pleaſant. It is an happy word, <hi>Come, let us goe up to the houſe
of the Lord.</hi> Mutual incouragement is none of the leaſt benefits of our holy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies.
Many ſticks laid together make a good fire, which if they lie ſingle
loſe both their light and heat.</p>
                  <p>The Feaſt ended, what ſhould they do but return to <hi>Nazareth?</hi> God's ſervices
may not be ſo attended as that we ſhould neglect our particular callings. Himſelf
cals us from his own Houſe to ours, and takes pleaſure to ſee a painful Client.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
They are foully miſtaken that think God cares for no other trade but devotion.
Piety and diligence muſt keep meet changes with each other. Neither doth
God leſſe accept of our return to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> then our going up to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot think that the Bleſſed Virgin or good <hi>Joſeph</hi> could be ſo negligent
of their Divine charge, as not to call the child <hi>Jeſus</hi> to their ſetting forth from
<hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But their back was no ſooner turned upon the Temple, then his face
was towards it. He had buſineſſe in that place when theirs was ended: there he
was both worſhipped and repreſented. He, in whom the Godhead dwelt bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
could doe nothing without God: his true Father led him away from his
ſuppoſed. Sometimes the affairs of our ordinary vocation may not grudge to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
yield unto ſpirituall occaſions. The Parents of Chriſt knew him well to be of a
diſpoſition not ſtrange, nor ſullen &amp; Stoicall, but ſweet and ſociable: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ſuppoſed he had ſpent the time and the way in company of their
friends and neighbours. They do not ſuſpect him wandered into the ſolitary
fields: but when evening came, they go to ſeek him among their kinsfolk and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44233:18"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> acquaintance. If he had not wonted to converſe formerly with them, he had not
now been ſought amongſt them. Neither as God nor man doth he take pleaſure in
a ſtern froward auſterity and wilde retiredneſs; but in a milde affableneſs and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
converſation.</p>
                  <p>But, O Bleſſed Virgin, who can expreſs the ſorrows of thy perplexed Soul, when
all that evening ſearch could afford thee no news of thy Son <hi>Jeſus?</hi> Was not this
one of thoſe ſwords of <hi>Simeon</hi> which ſhould pierce through thy tender breaſt?
How didſt thou chide thy credulous neglect, in not obſerving ſo precious a charge,
and blame thine eyes for once looking beſide this object of thy love? How didſt
thou, with thy careful Husband, ſpend that reſtleſs night in mutual expoſtulations
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and bemoanings of your loſs? How many ſuſpicious imaginations did that while
rack thy grieved ſpirit? Perhaps thou mighteſt doubt, leſt they which laid for
him by <hi>Herod</hi>'s command at his birth, had now by the ſecret inſtigation of <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi>
ſurpriſed him in his childhood: or it may be thou thoughteſt thy Divine Son
had now withdrawn himſelf from the earth, and returned to his heavenly Glory,
without warning: or peradventure thou ſtudiedſt with thy ſelf whether any care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs
on thy behalf had not given occaſion to this abſence.</p>
                  <p>O dear Saviour, who can miſs, and not mourn for thee? Never any ſoul conceived
thee by faith, that was leſs afflicted with the ſenſe of thy deſertion then comforted
with the joy of thy preſence. Juſt is that ſorrow, and thoſe tears ſeaſonable, that are
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> beſtowed upon thy loſſe. What comfort are we capable of whiles we want thee?
What reliſh is there in theſe earthly delights without thee? What is there to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate
our paſſionate diſcomforts, if not from thee? Let thy ſelf looſe, O my ſoul,
to the fulneſs of ſorrow, when thou findeſt thy ſelf bereaved of him in whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
is the fulneſs of joy; and deny to receive comfort from any thing ſave from
his return.</p>
                  <p>In vain is Chriſt ſought among his kindred according to the fleſh: So far are they
ſtill from giving us their aide to finde the true <hi>Meſsias,</hi> that they lead us from him.
Back again therefore are <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> gone to ſeek him at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> She goes
about in the City, by the ſtreets and by the open places, and <hi>ſeeks him whom her
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſoul loveth: ſhe ſought him</hi> for the time, <hi>and found him not.</hi> Do we think ſhe ſpared
her ſearch? The evening of her return ſhe haſtes to the Inne where ſhe had left
him: where miſſing him, ſhe inquires of every one ſhe met, <hi>Have you not ſeen him
whom my ſoul loveth?</hi> At laſt, the third day, ſhe finds him in the Temple. One day
was ſpent in the journey towards <hi>Galilee;</hi> another in the return to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> the
third day recovers him. He who would riſe again the third day, and be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the living, now alſo would the third day be found of his Parents, after the
ſorrow of his abſence. But where wert thou, O bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> for the ſpace of theſe
three daies? where didſt thou beſtow thy ſelf, or who tended thee whiles thou
wert thus alone at <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> I know, if <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould have been as unkind to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thee as <hi>Bethleem,</hi> thou couldſt have commanded the Heavens to harbour thee; and
if men did not miniſter to thee, thou couldſt have commanded the ſervice of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
But ſince the form of a Servant called thee to a voluntary homelineſs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it pleaſed thee to exerciſe thy ſelf thus early with the difficulties of a ſtranger,
or to provide miraculouſly for thy ſelf, I inquire not, ſince thou revealeſt not: only
this I know, that hereby thou intendedſt to teach thy Parents that thou couldeſt
live without them, and that not of any indigency, but out of a gracious diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
thou wouldeſt ordinarily depend upon their care.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time thy Divine wiſdome could not but foreknow all theſe corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thoughts wherewith the heart of thy dear Mother muſt needs bleed through
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> this ſudden dereliction; yet wouldſt thou leave her for the time to her ſorrow.
Even ſo, O Saviour, thou thoughteſt fit to viſit her that bore thee with this early
affliction. Never any loved thee whom thou doeſt not ſometimes exerciſe with
the grief of miſſing thee; that both we may be more careful to hold thee, and more
joyful in recovering thee. Thou haſt ſaid, and canſt not lie, <hi>I am with you to the end
of the world:</hi> but even whiles thou art really preſent, thou thinkeſt good to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44233:19"/>
unto our apprehenſions. Yet if thou leave us, thou wilt not forſake us; if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
thou leave us for our humiliation, thou wilt not forſake us to our final diſcomfort.
Thou mayeſt for three daies hide thy ſelf, but then we ſhall finde thee in the
Temple. None ever ſought thee with a ſincere deſire, of whom thou wert not
found. Thou wilt not be either ſo little abſent as not to whet our appetites,
nor ſo long as to fainten the heart. After three daies we ſhall finde thee: and
where ſhould we rather hope to finde thee then in the Temple? There is the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
for the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there is thy reſting place for ever. Oh all ye that are
grieved with the want of your Saviour, ſee where you muſt ſeek him. In vain ſhall
ye hope to finde him in the ſtreets, in the Taverns, in the Theaters: ſeek him in
his holy Temple: ſeek him with piety, ſeek him with faith; there ſhall ye meet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
him, there ſhall ye recover him. Whiles children of that age were playing in the
ſtreets, Chriſt was found ſitting in the Temple; not to gaze on the outward glory
of that houſe, or on the golden Candleſticks or Tables, but to hear and appoſe the
Doctors. He who as God gave them all the wiſdome they had, as the Son of man
hearkens to the wiſdome he had given them. He who ſate in their hearts, as the
Author of all learning and knowledge, ſits in the midſt of their ſchool, as an
humble Diſciple: that by learning of them, he might teach all the younger ſort hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and due attendance upon their Inſtructors. He could at the firſt have taught
the great Rabbins of <hi>Iſrael</hi> the deep myſteries of God, but becauſe he was not yet
called by his Father to the publick function of a Teacher, he contents himſelf to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
hear with diligence, and to ask with modeſty, and to teach only by inſinuation. Let
thoſe conſider this which will needs run as ſoon as they can go: and when they
finde ability, think they need not ſtay for a further vocation of God or men. Open
your eyes, ye rathe ripe invaders of God's Chair, and ſee your Saviour in his
younger years not ſitting in the eminent pulpits of the Doctors, but in the lowly
floors of the Auditors. See him that could have taught the Angels, liſtning in his
minority to the voice of men. Who can think much to learn of the Ancients, when
he looks upon the Son of God ſitting at the feet of the Doctors of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> Firſt he
hears, then he asks. How much more doth it concern us to be hearers ere we offer
to be teachers of others? He gathers that hears; he ſpends that teacheth: if we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
ſpend before we gather, we ſhall ſoon prove bankrupts.</p>
                  <p>When he hath heard, he asks; and after that he anſwers. Doubtleſs thoſe very
queſtions were inſtructions, and meant to teach more then to learn. Never had
theſe great Rabbins heard the voice of ſuch a Tutor, in whom they might ſee the
wiſdome of God ſo concealing it ſelf, that yet it would be known to be there. No
marvel then if they all wondred at his underſtanding and anſwers. Their eyes ſaw
nothing but humane weakneſs, their ears heard Divine ſublimity of matter: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
what they ſaw and what they heard, they could not but be diſtracted with a
doubting admiration. And why did ye not (O ye Jewiſh teachers) remember, <hi>That
to us a Childe is born, and unto us a Son is given, and the government is upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
and his name ſhall be called Wonderful, Counſellor, the mighty God, the everlaſting
Father, the Prince of peace?</hi> Why did ye not now bethink your ſelves what the
Star, the Sages, the Angels, the Shepherds, <hi>Zachary, Simeon, Anna,</hi> had premo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
you? Fruitleſs is the wonder that endeth not in faith. No light is ſufficient
where the eyes are held through unbelief or prejudice.</p>
                  <p>The Doctors were not more amazed to hear ſo profound a childhood, then
the Parents of Chriſt were to ſee him among the Doctors: the joy of finding
him did ſtrive with the aſtoniſhment of finding him thus. And now not <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi>
(he knew how little right he had to that Divine Son) but <hi>Mary</hi> breaks
forth into a loving expoſtulation, <hi>Son, why haſt thou dealt ſo with us?</hi> That ſhe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
might not ſeem to take upon her as an imperious Mother, it is like ſhe reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
this queſtion till ſhe had him alone: wherein ſhe meant rather to expreſſe
grief then correption. Onely herein the Bleſſed Virgin offended, that her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſideration
did not ſuppoſe (as it was) that ſome higher reſpects then could
be due to fleſh and blood called away the Son of God from her that was the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44233:19"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> daughter of man. She that was but the mother of humanity ſhould not have
thought that the buſineſs of God muſt for her ſake be neglected. We are all
partial to our ſelves naturally, and prone to the regard of our own rights. Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe
this gracious Saint would not for all the world have willingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
her own attendance to that of her God: through heedleſneſs ſhe doth ſo:
her Son and Saviour is her monitor, out of his Divine love reforming her natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
<hi>How is it that ye ſought me? Know ye not that I muſt goe about my Fathers
buſineſſe?</hi> Immediately before the Bleſſed Virgin had ſaid, <hi>Thy father and I
ſought thee with heavy hearts.</hi> Wherein both according to the ſuppoſition of
the world, ſhe called <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Father of Chriſt, and according to the faſhion
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of a dutiful Wife, ſhe names her <hi>Joſeph</hi> before her ſelf. She well knew that <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
had nothing but a name in this buſineſs, ſhe knew how God had dignified
her beyond him; yet ſhe ſaies, <hi>Thy father and I ſought thee.</hi> The Son of God
ſtands not upon contradiction to his Mother, but leading her thoughts from
his ſuppoſed father to his true, from earth to Heaven, he anſwers, <hi>Knew ye not
that I muſt go about my Fathers buſineſs?</hi> It was honour enough to her, that he
had vouchſafed to take fleſh of her: it was his eternal honour that he was God
of God, the everlaſting Son of the heavenly Father. Good reaſon therefore was
it that the reſpects to fleſh ſhould give place to the God of Spirits. How well
contented was holy <hi>Mary</hi> with ſo juſt an anſwer? how doth ſhe now again in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> her heart renew her anſwer to the Angel, <hi>Behold the ſervant of the Lord, be it
according to thy word?</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>JOHN</hi> did every way forerun Chriſt, not ſo much in the time of his Birth, as
in his office. Neither was there more unlikelineſs in their Diſpoſition and
carriage, then ſimilitude in their Function. Both did preach and baptize:
only <hi>John</hi> baptized by himſelf, our Saviour by his Diſciples: our Saviour
wrought miracles by himſelf, by his Diſciples; <hi>John</hi> wrought none by either.
Wherein Chriſt meant to ſhew himſelf a Lord, and <hi>John</hi> a ſervant: and <hi>John</hi>
meant to approve himſelf a true ſervant to him whoſe harbinger he was. He
that leapt in the womb of his mother, when his Saviour (then newly conceived)
came in preſence, beſtir'd himſelf when he was brought forth into the light of
the Church, to the honour and ſervice of his Saviour: he did the ſame before
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Chriſt, which Chriſt charged his Diſciples to do after him, <hi>Preach and Baptize.</hi>
The Goſpel ran alwaies in one tenor, and was never but like it ſelf. So it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the Word of him in whom there is no ſhadow by turning, and whoſe
Word it is, <hi>I am Jehova, I change not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was fit that he which had the Prophets, the Star, the Angel to foretell
his coming into the world, ſhould have his Uſher to goe before him, when
he would notifie himſelf to the world. <hi>John</hi> was the voice of a Cryer; Chriſt
was the Word of his Father: it was fit this Voice ſhould make a noiſe to the
world, ere the Word of the Father ſhould ſpeak to it. <hi>John</hi>'s note was ſtill,
<hi>Repentance;</hi> the <hi>Axe to the root,</hi> the <hi>Fan to the floor,</hi> the <hi>Chaffe to the fire:</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> as his raiment was rough, ſo was his tongue; and if his food were <hi>wilde Hony,</hi>
his ſpeech was ſtinging <hi>Locuſts.</hi> Thus muſt the way be made for Chriſt in
every heart. Plauſibility is no fit preface to Regeneration. If the heart of man
had continued upright, God might have been entertained without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
but now violence muſt be offered to our corruption, ere we can
have room for Grace. If the great Way-maker do not caſt down hills and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44233:20"/>
raiſe up valleys in the boſomes of men, there is no paſſage for Chriſt. Never <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
will Chriſt come into that Soul, where the Herald of Repentance hath not
been before him.</p>
                  <p>That Saviour of ours who from eternity lay hid in the Counſel of God,
who in the fulneſs of time ſo came, that he lay hid in the womb of his mother
for the ſpace of forty weeks, after he was come, thought fit to lye hid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>Nazareth</hi> for the ſpace of thirty years, now at laſt begins to ſhew himſelf to
the world, and comes from <hi>Galilee</hi> to <hi>Jordan.</hi> He that was God alwaies, and
might have been perfect man in an inſtant, would by degrees riſe to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
both of his Manhood, and execution of his Mediatorſhip; to teach
us the neceſſity of leaſure in ſpiritual proceedings: that many Suns and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
of ſeaſons and means muſt be ſtayed for, ere we can attain our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity;
and that when we are ripe for the imployments of God, we ſhould
no leſſe willingly leave our obſcurity, then we took the benefit of it for our
preparation. He that was formerly circumciſed, would now be baptized.
What is Baptiſm but an Evangelical Circumciſion? What was Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
but a Legal Baptiſm? One both ſupplied and ſucceeded the other; yet
the Authour of both will undergoe both. He would be circumciſed, to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
his Church that was; and baptized, to ſanctifie his Church that ſhould
be: that ſo in both Teſtaments he might open a way into Heaven. There
was in him neither filthineſs nor foreskin of corruption, that ſhould need either <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
knife or water. He came not to be a Saviour for himſelf, but for us: we
are all uncleanneſs and uncircumciſion: he would therefore have that done
to his moſt pure body, which ſhould be of force to clear our impure Souls:
thus making himſelf ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of
God in him.</p>
                  <p>His Baptiſm gives virtue to ours. His laſt action (or rather paſſion) was
his baptizing with blood: his firſt was his baptization with water: both of
them waſh the world from their ſins. Yea, this latter did not onely waſh the
ſouls of men, but waſheth that very water by which we are waſhed: from
hence is that made both clean and holy, and can both cleanſe and hallow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
us. And if the very handkerchief which touched his Apoſtles had power
of cure, how much more that Water which the ſacred body of Chriſt tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched?
Chriſt comes far to ſeek his baptiſm: to teach us (for whoſe ſake
he was baptized) to wait upon the Ordinances of God, and to ſue for the
favour of ſpiritual bleſſings. They are worthleſſe commodities that are not
worth ſeeking for. It is rarely ſeen, that God is found of any man unſought
for: that deſire which only makes us capable of good things, cannot ſtand
with neglect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> durſt not baptize unbidden: his Maſter ſent him to doe this ſervice;
and behold, the Maſter comes to his ſervant, to call for the participation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
that priviledge which he himſelf had inſtituted and injoyned. How willingly
ſhould we come to our ſpiritual Superiours, for our part in thoſe myſteries
which God hath left in their keeping? yea, how gladly ſhould we come to
that Chriſt who gives us theſe bleſſings, who is given to us in them?</p>
                  <p>This ſeemed too great an honour for the modeſty of <hi>John</hi> to receive. If his
mother could ſay, when her bleſſed couſin the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> came to viſit her,
<hi>Whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord ſhould come to me?</hi> how much
more might he ſay ſo, when the Divine Son of that mother came to call for a
favour from him? <hi>I have need to be baptized of thee, and comeſt thou to me?</hi>
O holy Baptiſt, if there were not a greater born of woman then thou; yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
thou couldeſt not be born of a woman, and not need to be baptized of thy
Saviour. He baptized with fire, thou with water. Little would thy water
have availed thee without his fire. If he had not baptized thee, how wert
thou ſanctified from the womb? There can be no fleſh without filthineſs:
neither thy ſupernatural Conception nor thy auſtere life could exempt thee
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44233:20"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> from the need of Baptiſm. Even thoſe that have not lived to ſin after the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of <hi>Adam,</hi> yet are they ſo tainted with <hi>Adam,</hi> that unleſs the ſecond
<hi>Adam</hi> cleanſe them by his Baptiſm, they are hopeleſs. There is no leſs uſe of
Baptiſm unto all, then there is certainty of the need of Baptiſm. <hi>John</hi> bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
without, Chriſt within. The more holy a man is, the more ſenſible he is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> his unholineſs. No carnal man could have ſaid, <hi>I have need to be baptized of
thee;</hi> neither can he finde what he is the better for a little Font-water. The
ſenſe of our wretchedneſs and the valuation of our ſpiritual helps, is the beſt
tryal of our regeneration. Our Saviour doth not deny that either <hi>John</hi> hath
need to be baptized of him, or that it is ſtrange that he ſhould come to be
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> baptized of <hi>John;</hi> but he will needs thus far both honour <hi>John</hi> and diſparage
himſelf, to be baptized of his Meſſenger. He that would take fleſh of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
education from his Parents, ſuſtenance from his creatures, will take Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm
from <hi>John.</hi> It is the praiſe of his Mercy, that he will ſtoop ſo low as to
be beholden to his creatures, which from him receive their Being, and power
both to take and give.</p>
                  <p>Yet no ſo much reſpect to <hi>John,</hi> as obedience to his Father, drew him to
this point of humiliation: <hi>Thus it behoves us to fulfill all righteouſneſs.</hi> The
Counſels and Appointments of God are Righteouſneſs it ſelf. There needs no
other motive, either to the ſervant or the Son, then the knowledge of thoſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> righteous purpoſes. This was enough to lead a faithful man through all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and inconveniencies; neither will it admit of any reply or any demur.
<hi>John</hi> yieldeth to this honour which his Saviour puts upon him, in giving
Baptiſm to the Authour of it. He baptized others to the remiſſion of their
ſins: now he baptizes him, by whom they are remitted both to the Baptizer
and to others.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner is Chriſt baptized, then he comes forth of the water. The ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  <p>The voice from Heaven acknowledged Chriſt to be the Son of God.
This Divine Teſtimony did not allay the malice of Satan, but exaſperate it:

Now that venomous Serpent ſwels with inward poiſon, and haſts to aſſail <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
him whom God hath honoured from Heaven. O God, how ſhould I look
to eſcape the ſuggeſtions of that wicked one, when the Son of thy love cannot
be free? when even grace it ſelf draws on enmity? That enmity that ſpared
not to ſtrike at the Head, will he forbear the weakeſt and remoteſt limme?
Arm thou me therefore with an expectation of that evil I cannot avoid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Make thou me as ſtrong as he is malicious. Say to my Soul alſo, <hi>Thou art

                  <p>All the time of our Saviours obſcurity I do not finde him ſet upon: now
that he looks forth to the publick execution of his Divine Office, Satan
bends his forces againſt him. Our privacy, perhaps, may ſit down in peace:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
but never man did endevour a common good without oppoſition. It is a ſign
that both the work is holy, and the Agent faithful, when we meet with
ſtrong affronts.</p>
                  <p>We have reaſon to be comforted with nothing ſo much as with reſiſtance.
If we were not in a way to do good, we ſhould finde no rubs: Satan hath
no cauſe to moleſt his own, and that whiles they goe about his own ſervice.
He deſires nothing more, then to make us ſmooth paths to ſinne; but
when we would turn our feet to Holineſſe, he blocks up the way with Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
                  <p>Who can wonder enough at the ſawcineſſe of that bold ſpirit, that dares <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
to ſet upon the Son of the ever-living God? Who can wonder enough at
thy meekneſſe and patience, O Saviour, that wouldſt be tempted? He wanted
not Malice and Preſumption to aſſault thee; thou wantedſt not Humility
to endure thoſe aſſaults. I ſhould ſtand amazed at this voluntary diſpenſation
of thine, but that I ſee the ſuſception of our Humane nature laies thee open
to this condition. It is neceſſarily incident to manhood to be liable to
Tentations. Thou wouldſt not have put on fleſh, if thou hadſt meant utterly
to put off this conſequence of our infirmity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If the ſtate of Innocence
could have been any defence againſt evil motions, the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had
not been tempted, much leſſe the ſecond. It is not the preſenting of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
Tentations that can hurt us, but their entertainment. Ill counſel is the
fault of the Giver, not of the Refuſer. We cannot forbid lewd eyes to look
in at our windows, we may ſhut our doors againſt their entrance. It is no
leſſe our praiſe to have reſiſted, then Satans blame to ſuggeſt evil. Yea,
O bleſſed Saviour, how glorious was it for thee, how happy for us, that
thou wert tempted? Had not Satan tempted thee, how ſhouldeſt thou
have overcome? Without blows there can be no victory, no triumph:
How had thy power been manifeſted, if no adverſary had tried thee? The
firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was tempted and vanquiſhed: the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> to repay and
repair that foile, doth vanquiſh in being tempted. Now have we not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
a Saviour and High Prieſt that cannot be touched with the feeling of
our infirmities, but ſuch an once as was in all things tempted in like ſort,
yet without ſin. How boldly therefore may we goe unto the Throne of
grace, that we may receive mercy, and finde grace of help in time of
need? Yea, this Duell was for us. Now we ſee by this conflict of our
Almighty Champion, what manner of Adverſary we have, how he fights,
how he is reſiſted, how overcome. Now our very Temptation affords
us comfort, in that we ſee, the dearer we are unto God, the more obnoxious
we are to this triall: neither can we be diſcouraged by the hainouſneſſe of
thoſe evils whereto we are moved, ſince we ſee the Son of God ſolicited to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
Infidelity, Covetouſneſſe, Idolatry. How glorious therefore was it for thee, O
Saviour, how happy for us, that thou wert tempted?</p>
                  <p>Where then waſt thou tempted, O Bleſſed Jeſu? or whither wenteſt thou
to meet with our great Adverſary? I do not ſee thee led into the market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,
or any other part of the City, or thy home-ſtead of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> but into

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the vaſt Wilderneſs, the habitation of beaſts; a place that carrieth in it both
horror and opportunity. Why wouldſt thou thus retire thy ſelf from men?
But as confident Champions are wont to give advantage of ground or weapon
to their Antagoniſt, that the glory of their victory may be the greater: ſo
wouldeſt thou, O Saviour, in this conflict with our common Enemy, yield
him his own terms for circumſtances, that thine honour and his foile may be
the more. Solitarineſs is no ſmall help to the ſpeed of a Tentation. <hi>Woe to him
that is alone, for if he fall, there is not a ſecond to lift him up.</hi> Thoſe that out of
an affectation of Holineſs ſeek for ſolitude in rocks and caves of the deſarts,
do no other then run into the mouth of the danger of Tentation, whiles they
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> think to avoid it. It was enough for thee, to whoſe Divine power the gates
of Hell were weakneſs, thus to challenge the Prince of darkneſs. Our care
muſt be alwaies to eſchew all occaſions of ſpiritual danger; and (what we may)
to get us out of the reach of Tentations</p>
                  <p>But, O the depth of the Wiſdome of God! How cameſt thou, O Saviour,
to be thus tempted? That Spirit whereby thou waſt conceived as man, and
which was one with thee and the Father as God, led thee into the wilderneſs
to be tempted of Satan. Whiles thou taughteſt us to pray to thy Father,
<hi>Lead us not into temptation,</hi> thou meanteſt to inſtruct us, that if the ſame Spirit
led us not into this perilous way, we goe not into it. We have ſtill the ſame
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> conduct. Let the path be what it will, how can we miſcarry in the hand of a
Father? Now may we ſay to Satan, as thou didſt unto <hi>Pilate, Thou couldſt
have no power over me, except it were given thee from above.</hi> The Spirit led
thee; it did not drive thee: here was a ſweet invitation, no compulſion of
violence. So abſolutely conformable was thy will to thy Deity, as if both thy
Natures had but one volition. In this firſt draught of thy bitter potion, thy
Soul ſaid in a reall ſubjection, <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> We imitate thee,
O Saviour, though we cannot reach to thee. All thine are led by thy Spirit:
Oh teach us to forget that we have wills of our own. The Spirit led thee;
thine invincible ſtrength did not animate thee into this combat uncalled.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> What do we weaklings ſo far preſume upon our abilities or ſucceſs, as that we
dare thruſt our ſelves upon Temptations unbidden, unwarranted? Who can
pitty the ſhipwrack of thoſe Marriners, which will needs put forth and hoiſe
fails in a Tempeſt?</p>
                  <p>Forty daies did our Saviour ſpend in the Wilderneſs, faſting and ſolitary,
all which time was worn out in Temptation; however the laſt brunt, becauſe
it was moſt violent, is only expreſſed. Now could not the adverſary complain
of diſadvantage, whiles he had the full ſcope both of time and place to do his
worſt. And why did it pleaſe thee, O Saviour, to faſt forty daies and forty
nights, unleſs, as <hi>Moſes</hi> faſted forty daies at the delivery of the Law, and <hi>Elias</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> at the reſtitution of the Law, ſo thou thoughteſt fit at the accompliſhment of
the Law and the promulgation of the Goſpel, to fulfill the time of both theſe
Types of thine, wherein thou intendeſt our wonder, not our imitation; not
our imitation of the time, though of the act. Here were no faulty deſires of
the fleſh in thee to be tamed, no poſſibility of a freer and more eaſie aſſent of
the Soul to God that could be affected of thee, who waſt perfectly united unto
God; but as for us thou wouldſt ſuffer death, ſo for us thou wouldſt ſuffer
hunger, that we might learn by faſting to prepare our ſelves for Tentations.
In faſting ſo long, thou intendeſt the manifeſtation of thy power; in faſting no
longer, the truth of thy manhood. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> through the miraculous
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſuſtentation of God, faſted ſo long, without any queſtion made of the truth of
their bodies: So long therefore thou thoughteſt good to faſt, as by the reaſon
of theſe precedents might be without prejudice of thine Humanity; which if
it ſhould have pleaſed thee to ſupport, as thou couldſt, without means, thy very
Power might have opened the mouth of cavils againſt the verity of thy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature. That thou mighteſt therefore well approve, that there was no
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44233:22"/>
difference betwixt thee and us but ſin, thou that couldſt have faſted without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
hunger, and lived without meat, wouldſt both feed, and faſt, and hunger.</p>
                  <p>Who can be diſcouraged with the ſcantneſſe of friends or bodily proviſions,
when he ſees his Saviour thus long deſtitute of all earthly comforts, both of
ſociety and ſuſtenance? Oh the policie and malice of that old Serpent! when he
ſees Chriſt bewray ſome infirmity of nature in being hungry, then he layes ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
at him by temptations. His eye was never off from our Saviour all the
time of his ſequeſtration; and now that he thinks he eſpies any one part to lye
open, he drives at it with all his might. We have to do with an Adverſary no
leſſe vigilant then malicious, who will be ſure to watch all opportunities of our
miſchief, and where he ſees any advantage of weakneſſe, will not neglect it.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
How ſhould we ſtand upon our guard for prevention, that both we may
not give him occaſions of our hurt, nor take hurt by thoſe we have given?</p>
                  <p>When our Saviour was hungry, Satan tempts him in matter of Food; not
then, of Wealth or Glorie: He well knows both what baits to fiſh withall,
and when and how to lay them. How ſafe and happy ſhall we be, if we ſhall
bend our greateſt care where we diſcern the moſt danger?</p>
                  <p>In every Temptation there is an appearance of good, whether of the
body, of mind, or eſtate. The firſt is the <hi>luſt of the fleſh,</hi> in any carnal deſire;
the ſecond, the <hi>pride of</hi> heart and <hi>life;</hi> the third, the <hi>luſt of the eyes.</hi> To all
theſe the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> is tempted, and in all miſcarried; the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
tempted to them all, and overcometh. The firſt man was tempted to Carnal
appetite by the forbidden fruit; to Pride, by the ſuggeſtion of being as God;
to Covetouſneſſe, in the ambitious deſire of knowing good and evil. Satan
having found all the motions ſo ſucceſſeful with the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocent
eſtate, will now tread the ſame ſteps in his temptations of the ſecond. The
ſtones muſt be made bread; there is the motion to a Carnal appetite. The
guard and attendance of Angels muſt be preſumed on; there is a motion to
Pride. The Kingdomes of the Earth and the glory of them muſt be offered;
there to Covetouſneſſe and Ambition.</p>
                  <p>Satan could not but have heard God ſay, <hi>This is my welbeloved Son,</hi> he had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
heard the Meſſage and the Carol of the Angels, he ſaw the Star and the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and Offerings of the Sages, he could not but take notice of the gratulations
of <hi>Zachary, Simeon, Anna,</hi> he well knew the Predictions of the Prophets; yet
now that he ſaw Chriſt fainting with hunger, as not comprehending how infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
could conſiſt with a Godhead, he can ſay, <hi>If thou be the Son of God.</hi>
Had not Satan known that the Son of God was to come into the World, he
had never ſaid, <hi>If thou be the Son of God.</hi> His very ſuppoſition convinces him:
The ground of his Temptation anſwers it ſelf. If therefore Chriſt ſeemed to
be a mere man, becauſe after forty daies he was hungry; why was he not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
more then a man, in that for forty daies he hungred not? The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
of the Temptation is worſe then the motion; <hi>If thou be the Son of God.</hi>
Satan could not chuſe another ſuggeſtion of ſo great importance. All the
work of our Redemption, of our Salvation, depends upon this one Truth,
Chriſt is the Son of God. How ſhould he elſe have ranſomed the World?
how ſhould he have done, how ſhould he have ſuffered that which was ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
to his Fathers wrath? how ſhould his actions or Paſſion have been valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the ſin of all the World? What marvel is it if we that are ſons by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption
be aſſaulted with the doubts of our intereſt in God, when the natural
Son, the Son of his Eſſence is thus tempted? Since all our comfort conſiſts
in this point, here muſt needs be laid the chief battery; and here muſt be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
placed our ſtrongeſt defence.</p>
                  <p>To turn Stones into Bread, had been no more faulty in it ſelf then to
turn Water into Wine: But to do this in a diſtruſt of his Fathers Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
to abuſe his power and liberty in doing it, to work a Miracle of
Satans choice, had been diſagreeable to the Son of God. There is nothing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44233:22"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> more ordinary with our ſpiritual enemy, then by occaſion of want to move us to
unwarrantable courſes: Thou art poor, ſteal; Thou canſt not riſe by honeſt
means, uſe indirect. How eaſie had it been for our Saviour to have confounded
Satan by the power of his Godhead? But he rather chuſes to vanquiſh him by
the Sword of the Spirit, that he might teach us how to reſiſt &amp; overcome the
powers of darkneſſe. If he had ſubdued Satan by the Almighty power of the
Deity, we might have had what to wonder at, not what to imitate: now he
uſeth that weapon which may be familiar unto us, that he may teach our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
how to be victorious. Nothing in Heaven or earth can beat the forces
of Hell, but the word of God. How carefully ſhould we furniſh our ſelves with
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> this powerful munition? how ſhould our hearts and mouths be full of it?
<hi>Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy Statutes: O take not from me the words of
Truth. Let them be my Songs in the houſe of my pilgrimage: So ſhall I make
anſwer to my Blaſphemers.</hi> What needed Chriſt to have anſwered Satan at
all, if it had not been to teach us that Temptations muſt not have their way;
but muſt be anſwered by reſiſtance, and reſiſted by the Word?</p>
                  <p>I do not hear our Saviour aver himſelf to be a God, againſt the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
inſinuation of Satan; neither do I ſee him working this miraculous
Converſion, to prove himſelf the Son of God: but moſt wiſely he takes
away the ground of the Temptation. Satan had taken it for granted, that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> man cannot be ſuſtained without bread; and therefore infers the neceſſity
of making bread of ſtones. Our Saviour ſhews him from an infallible Word,
that he had miſlayed his ſuggeſtion; That man <hi>lives</hi> not by uſual food only,
but <hi>by every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God.</hi> He can either ſuſtain
without bread, as he did <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias;</hi> or with a miraculous bread, as
the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with Manna; or ſend ordinary means miraculouſly, as food
to his Prophet by the Ravens; or miraculouſly multiply ordinary means,
as the Meal and Oyle to the <hi>Sareptan</hi> Widow. All things are ſuſtained by
his Almighty Word. Indeed we live by food, but not by any virtue that
is without God; without the concurrence of whoſe Providence, bread would
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> rather choak then nouriſh us. Let him withdraw his hand from his creatures,
in their greateſt abundance we periſh. Why do we therefore bend our eyes
on the means, and not look up to the hand that gives the bleſſing?</p>
                  <p>What ſo neceſſary dependance hath the bleſſing upon the creature, if our
Prayers hold them not together? As we may not neglect the means, ſo we
may not neglect the procurement of a bleſſing upon the means, nor be unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the hand that hath given the bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt aſſault Satan moves Chriſt to doubt of his Fathers Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and to uſe unlawful means to help himſelf: in the next, he moves
him to preſume upon his Fathers protection, and the ſervice of his bleſſed
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Angels. He grounds the firſt upon a conceit of want, the next of abundance.
If he be in extremes, it is all to one end, to miſlead unto evil: If we
cannot be driven down to deſpair, he labours to lift us up to preſumption.
It is not one foil than can put this bold ſpirit out of countenance. Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
like waves, break one in the neck of another. Whiles we are in this
warfare, we muſt make account that the repulſe of one Temptation doth but
invite to another.</p>
                  <p>That Bleſſed Saviour of ours that was content to be led from <hi>Jordan</hi>
into the Wilderneſſe, for the advantage of the firſt Temptation, yields to
be led from the Wilderneſſe to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the advantage of the ſecond.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> The place doth not a little avail to the act. The Wilderneſſe was fit for
a Temptation ariſing from Want, it was not fit for a Temptation mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to Vain-glory; the populous City was the fitteſt for ſuch a motion.
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was the glory of the World, the Temple was the glory of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
the Pinnacles, the higheſt piece of the Pinnacle, there is Chriſt
content to be ſet for the opportunity of Tentation. O Saviour of men, how
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44233:23"/>
can we wonder enough at this Humility of thine, that thou wouldeſt ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
farre abaſe thy ſelf as to ſuffer thy pure and ſacred Body to be tranſported
by the preſumptuous and malicious hand of that unclean Spirit? It was
not his Power, it was thy Patience that deſerves our admiration. Neither
can this ſeem over-ſtrange to us, when we conſider that if Satan be the
head of wicked men, wicked men are the members of Satan. What was
<hi>Pilate,</hi> or the Jews that perſecuted thine innocence, but limbs of this Devil?
And why are we then amazed, to ſee thee touched and locally tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the head, when we ſee thee yielding thy ſelf over to be crucified by
the members? If Satan did the worſe and greater mediately by their hands,
no marvel if he doe the leſſe and eaſier immediately by his own; yet neither <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
of them without thy voluntary diſpenſation. He could not have looked at
thee without thee. And if the Son of God did thus ſuffer his own holy and
precious Body to be carried by Satan; what wonder is it if that Enemy
have ſometimes power given him over the ſinful bodies of the adopted ſons
of God? It is not the ſtrength of Faith that can ſecure us from the outward
violences of that Evil one. This difference I finde betwixt his ſpiritual
and bodily aſſaults: thoſe are beaten back by the ſhield of Faith, theſe admit
not of ſuch repulſe. As the beſt man may be lame, blind, diſeaſed; ſo,
through the permiſſion of God, he may be bodily vexed by an old Man-ſlayer.
Grace was never given us for a Target againſt externall Afflictions.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Methinks I ſee Chriſt hoiſed upon the higheſt battlements of the Temple,
whoſe very roof was an hundred and thirty Cubits high; and Satan ſtanding
by him with this ſpeech in his mouth: <q>Well then, ſince in the matter of
nouriſhment thou wilt needs depend upon thy Father's Providence, that
he can without means ſuſtain thee, take now further tryall of that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in thy miraculous preſervation; Caſt thy ſelf down from this height.
Behold, thou art here in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the famous and holy City of the
World; here thou art, on the top of the pinnacle of that Temple which
is dedicated to thy Father, and, if thou be God, to thy ſelf. The eyes
of all men are now fixt upon thee: there cannot be deviſed a more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
ready way to ſpread thy glory and to proclaim thy Deity, then by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
thy ſelf headlong to the Earth. All the World will ſay there is
more in thee then a man. And for danger, there can be none. What
can hurt him that is the Son of God? and wherefore ſerves that glorious
Guard of Angels, which have by Divine Commiſſion taken upon them
the charge of thine Humanity? Since therefore in one act thou mayeſt be
both ſafe and celebrated, truſt thy Father and thoſe thy ſerviceable Spirits
with thine aſſured preſervation; <hi>Caſt thy ſelf down.</hi>
                     </q> And why didſt thou not,
O thou malignant ſpirit, endeavour to caſt down my Saviour by thoſe ſame
preſumptuous hands that brought him up, ſince the deſcent is more eaſie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
then the raiſing up? Was it for that it had not been ſo great an advantage
to thee that he ſhould fall by thy means as by his own? Falling into ſin
was more then to fall from the pinnacle. Still thy care and ſuit is, to make
us Authors to our ſelves of evil: thou gaineſt nothing by our bodily
hurt, if the Soul be ſafe. Or was it rather for that thou couldeſt not? I
doubt not but thy Malice could as well have ſerved to have offered this
meaſure to himſelf, as to his holy Apoſtle ſoon after. But he that bounded
thy power, tethers thee ſhorter. Thou couldeſt not, thou canſt not do
what thou wouldſt. He that would permit thee to carry him up, bindes thy
hands from caſting him down. And woe were it for us if thou wert not ever <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
ſtinted.</p>
                  <p>Why did Satan carry up Chriſt ſo high, but on purpoſe that his fall might
be the more deadly? So deals he ſtill with us; he exalts us, that we may be
dangerouſly abaſed: he puffs them up with ſwelling thoughts of their own
worthineſſe, that they may be vile in the eyes of God, and fall into condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44233:23"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> It is the manner of God, to caſt down that he may raiſe, to abaſe
that he may exalt: Contrarily Satan raiſes up that he may throw down,
and intends nothing but our dejection in our advancement.</p>
                  <p>Height of place gives opportunity of Tentation. Thus buſie is that Wicked
one in working againſt the members of Chriſt. If any of them be in eminence
above others, thoſe he labours moſt to ruinate. They had need to ſtand faſt,
that ſtand high. There is both more danger of their falling, and more hurt in
their fall.</p>
                  <p>He that had preſumed thus far, to tempt the Lord of Life, would fain
now dare him alſo to preſume upon his Deity: <hi>If thou be the Son of God, caſt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> thy ſelf down.</hi> There is not a more tried ſhaft in all his quiver then this; a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
to men, to bear themſelves too bold upon the favour of God. Thou
art the Elect and Redeemed of God; ſin, becauſe Grace hath abounded;
ſin, that it may abound. Thou art ſafe enough though thou offend: be not
too much an adverſary to thine own liberty. Falſe ſpirit! it is no liberty
to ſinne, but ſervitude rather; there is liberty, but in the freedome from ſin.
Every one of us that hath the hope of Sons, muſt <hi>purge himſelf, even as he
is pure</hi> that hath redeemed us. <hi>We are bought with a price, therefore muſt we
glorifie God in our body and ſpirits;</hi> for they are God's. Our Sonſhip teaches
us awe and obedience; and therefore becauſe we are Sons, we will not caſt our
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſelves down into ſin.</p>
                  <p>How idlely do Satan and wicked men meaſure God by the crooked line
of their own miſconceit? Iwis, Chriſt cannot be the Son of God, unleſſe
he caſt himſelf down from the Pinnacle, unleſſe he come down from the
Croſſe. God is not merciful unleſſe he honour them in all their deſires;
not juſt, unleſſe he take ſpeedy vengeance where they require it. But when
they have ſpent their folly upon theſe vain imaginations, Chriſt is the Son
of God, though he ſtay on the top of the Temple. God will be merciful,
though we miſcarry; and juſt, though ſinners ſeem lawleſſe. Neither will
he be any other then he is, or meaſured by any rule but himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> But what is this I ſee? Satan himſelf with a Bible under his arm, with a
Text in his mouth, <hi>It is written, He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee?</hi> How
ſtill in that Wicked one doth Subtilty ſtrive with Preſumption? Who
could not but over-wonder at this, if he did not conſider, that ſince the Devil
dar'd to touch the ſacred Body of Chriſt with his hand, he may well touch
the Scriptures of God with his tongue? Let no man henceforth marvel
to hear Hereticks or Hypocrites quote Scriptures, when Satan himſelf
hath not ſpared to cite them. What are they the worſe for this, more
then that holy Body wich is tranſported? Some have been poiſoned by
their meats and drinks; yet either theſe nouriſh us, or nothing. It is not
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the Letter of the Scripture that can carry it, but the Senſe; if we divide
theſe two, we prophane and abuſe that Word we alledge. And wherefore
doth this foul ſpirit urge a Text, but for imitation, for prevention, and
for ſucceſſe? Chriſt had alledged a Scripture unto him; he re-alledges
Scripture unto Chriſt. At leaſtwiſe he will counterfeit an imitation of the
Son of God. Neither is it in this alone: what one act ever paſſed the hand of
God, which Satan did not apiſhly attempt to ſecond? If we follow Chriſt in
the outward action with contrary intentions, we follow Satan in following
Chriſt. Or, perhaps, Satan meant to make Chriſt hereby weary of this wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon:
As we ſee faſhions, when they are taken up of the unworthy, are caſt off
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> by the Great. It was, doubtleſſe, one cauſe why Chriſt afterward forbad the
Devil even to confeſſe the Truth, becauſe his mouth was a ſtander. But chiefly
doth he this, for a better colour of his Tentation: He gilds over this falſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
with Scripture, that it may paſſe current. Even now is Satan transformed
into an Angel of Light, and will ſeem godly for a miſchief. If Hypocrites make
a fair ſhew to deceive with a glorious luſtre of Holineſſe, we ſee whence they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44233:24"/>
borrowed it. How many thouſand ſouls are betraied by the abuſe of that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
Word whoſe uſe is ſoveraign and ſaving? No Devil is ſo dangerous as the
religious Devil. If good meat turn to the nouriſhment, not of Nature, but of
the Diſeaſe, we may not forbear to feed, but endeavour to purge the body
of thoſe evil humours which cauſe the ſtomach to work againſt it ſelf. O God,
thou that haſt given us light, give us clear and ſound eyes, that we may take
comfort of that Light thou haſt given us. Thy Word is holy, make our hearts
ſo; and then ſhall they finde that Word not more true then cordial. Let not
this Divine Table of thine be made a ſnare to our ſouls.</p>
                  <p>What can be a better act then to ſpeak Scripture? It were a wonder if Satan
ſhould do a good thing well. He cites Scripture then, but with mutilation and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
diſtortion; it comes not out of his mouth, but maimed and perverted: One
piece is left, all miſapplied. Thoſe that wreſt or mangle Scripture for their
own turn, it is eaſie to ſee from what School they come. Let us take the Word
from the Author, not from the Uſurper. <hi>David</hi> would not doubt to eat that
ſheep which he pulled out of the mouth of the Bear or Lion. <hi>He ſhall give his
Angels charge over thee:</hi> Oh comfortable aſſurance of our protection. God's
children never goe unattended. Like unto great Princes, we walk ever in the
midſt of our guard; though inviſible, yet true, careful, powerful. What crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are ſo glorious as the Angels of Heaven? yet their Maker hath ſet them
to ſerve us. Our Adoption makes us at once great and ſafe. We may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
and ignominious in the eyes of the world; but the Angels of God
obſerve us the while, and ſcorn not to wait upon us in our homelieſt occaſions.
The Sun or the Light may we keep out of our houſes, the Aire we cannot;
much leſſe theſe Spirits that are more ſimple and immaterial. No walls,
no bolts can ſever them from our ſides: they accompany us in dungeons,
they goe with us into our exile. How can we either fear danger or complain of
ſolitarineſſe, whiles we have ſo unſeparable, ſo glorious Companions?</p>
                  <p>Is our Saviour diſtaſted with Scripture, becauſe Satan miſ-laies it in his diſh?
Doth he not rather ſnatch this ſword out of that impure hand, &amp; beat Satan
with the weapon which he abuſeth? <hi>It is written, Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
thy God.</hi> The Scripture is one, as that God whoſe it is: Where it carries an
appearance of difficulty or inconvenience, it needs no light to clear it but that
which it hath in it ſelf. All doubts that may ariſe from it are fully anſwered by
collation. It is true that God hath taken this care and given this charge of his
own: he will have them kept, not in their ſins: they may truſt him, they may
not tempt him: he meant to incourage their Faith, not their Preſumption.
To caſt our ſelves upon any immediate Providence when means fail not, is to
diſobey, in ſtead of believing God. We may challenge God on his Word, we
may not ſtrain him beyond it: we may make account of what he promiſed,
we may not ſubject his Promiſes to unjuſt examinations; and where no need <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
is, make triall of his Power, Juſtice, Mercy, by devices of our own. All the
Devils in Hell could not elude the force of this Divine anſwer: and now Satan
ſees how vainly he tempteth Chriſt to tempt God.</p>
                  <p>Yet again, for all this, do I ſee him ſetting upon the Son of God. Satan is
not foiled when he is reſiſted. Neither diffidence nor preſumption can faſten
upon Chriſt; he ſhall be tried with Honour. As ſome expert Fencer that chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
at all weapons, ſo doth his great Enemy. In vain ſhall we plead our skill
in ſome, if we fail in any. It muſt be our wiſedome to be prepared for all kinde
of aſſaults: as thoſe that hold Towns and Forts do not only defend themſelves
from incurſions, but from the Cannon and the Pionier. Still doth that ſubtil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
Serpent traverſe his ground for an advantage. The Temple is not high enough
for his next Tentation; he therefore carries up Chriſt to the top of an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
high Mountain. All enemies in pitcht fields ſtrive for the benefit of the
Hill, or River, or Wind, or Sun. That which his ſervant <hi>Balac</hi> did by his inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
himſelf doth now immediately, change places in hope of prevailing. If
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44233:24"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the obſcure country will not move us, he tries what the Court can do; if not
our home, the Tavern; if not the field, our cloſer. As no place is left free by
his malice, ſo no place muſt be made prejudicial by our careleſneſſe: and as
we ſhould alwaies watch over our ſelves, ſo then moſt when the opportunity
carries cauſe of ſuſpicion.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore is Chriſt carried up ſo high, but for proſpect? If the Kingdomes
of the earth and their glory were only to be preſented to his imagination, the
Valley would have ſerved; if to the outward ſenſe, no Hill could ſuffice. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
bodies though ſmall, cannot be ſeen at once. This ſhew was made to both;
divers Kingdomes lying round about <hi>Judea</hi> were repreſented to the eye, the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> glory of them to the imagination. Satan meant the eye could tempt the fancy,
no leſs then the fancie could tempt the will. How many thouſand ſouls have died
of the wound of the eye? If we do not let in ſin at the window of the eye or the
door of the eare, it cannot enter into our hearts.</p>
                  <p>If there be any pomp, majeſtie, pleaſure, bravery in the world, where ſhould
it be but in the Courts of Princes, whom God hath made his Images, his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
on earth? There is ſoft rayment, ſumptuous feaſts, rich jewels, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
attendance, glorious triumphs, royal ſtate; theſe Satan laies out to the
faireſt ſhew. But oh the craft of that old Serpent! Many a care attends Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
No Crown is without thorns: High ſeats are never but uneaſie. All
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> thoſe infinite diſcontentments which are the ſhadow of earthly Soveraigntie, he
hides out of the way; nothing may be ſeen but what may both pleaſe and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure.
Satan is ſtill and ever like himſelf. If Tentations might be but turn'd about
and ſhewn on both ſides, the Kingdome of darkneſs would not be ſo populous.
Now whenſoever the Tempter ſets upon any poor ſoul, all ſting of conſcience,
wrath, judgment, torment is concealed, as if they were not: nothing may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to the eye but pleaſure, profit, and a ſeeming happineſſe in the enjoying
our deſires. Thoſe other woful objects are reſerved for the farewell of ſin; that
our miſery may be ſeen and felt at once. When we are once ſure, Satan is a
Tyrant; till then, he is a Paraſite. There can be no ſafety, if we do not view
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as well the back as the face of Tentations.</p>
                  <p>But oh preſumption and impudence, that Hell it ſelf may be aſhamed of!
The Devil dares ſay to Chriſt, <hi>All theſe will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down
and worſhip me:</hi> That beggerly ſpirit, that hath not an inch of earth, can offer
the whole world to the maker, to the owner of it. The ſlave of God would
be adored of his Creator. How can we hope he ſhould be ſparing of falſe
boaſts and of unreaſonable promiſes unto us, when he dares offer Kingdomes
to him by whom Kings reign?</p>
                  <p>Tentations on the right hand are moſt dangerous. How many that have been
hardned with Fear, have melted with Honour? There is no doubt of that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſoul that will not bite at the golden hook.</p>
                  <p>Falſe lyars and vain-glorious boaſters ſee the top of their pedigree; if I
may not rather ſay, that Satan doth borrow the uſe of their tongues for a
time: Whereas faithfull is he that hath promiſed, who will alſo do it, Fidelity
and truth is the iſſue of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>If Idolatry were not a dear ſin to Satan, he would not be ſo importunate to
compaſſe it. It is miſerable to ſee how he draws the world inſenſibly into this
ſin, which they profeſſe to deteſt. Thoſe that would rather hazard the fornace
then worſhip Gold in a Statue, yet do adore in it the ſtamp, and finde no fault
with themſelves. If our hearts be drawn to ſtoop unto an over-high reſpect of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> any creature, we are Idolaters. O God, it is no marvel if thy jealouſie be kindled
at the admiſſion of any of thine own works into a competition of honour with
their Creator.</p>
                  <p>Never did our Saviour ſay, <hi>Avoid Satan,</hi> till now. It is a juſt indignation
that is conceived at the motion of a rivaltie with God. Neither yet did Chriſt
exerciſe his Divine power in this command, but by the neceſſary force of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44233:25"/>
drives away that impure Tempter; <hi>It is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> The reſt of our Saviours anſwers
were more full and direct then that they could admit of a reply; but this was
ſo flat and abſolute, that it utterly daunted the courage of Satan, and put him
to a ſhameful flight, and made him for the time weary of his trade.</p>
                  <p>The way to be rid of the troubleſome ſolicitations of that Wicked one, is
continued reſiſtance. He that forcibly drove the Tempter from himſelf, takes
him off from us, and will not abide his aſſaults perpetual. It is our exerciſe
and Triall that he intends, not our Confuſion.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

unreverent thronging, but rather incourages their forwardneſs. We cannot
offend thee, O God, with the importunity of our deſires. It likes thee well,
that the Kingdome of Heaven ſhould ſuffer violence. Our ſlackneſs doth ever
diſpleaſe thee, never our vehemency.</p>
                  <p>The throng of Auditors forced Chriſt to leave the ſhore, and to make
<hi>Peter</hi>'s ſhip his pulpit. Never were there ſuch nets caſt out of that fiſher-boat
before. Whiles he was upon the Land, he healed the ſick bodies by his touch;
now that he was upon the Sea, he cured the ſick Souls by his doctrine; and
is purpoſely ſevered from the multitude, that he may unite them to him. He
that made both Sea and Land, cauſeth both of them to conſpire to the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
of doing good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Simon</hi> was buſie waſhing his nets. Even thoſe nets that caught nothing
muſt be waſhed, no leſſe then if they had ſped well. The nights toile doth
not excuſe his daies work. Little did <hi>Simon</hi> think of leaving thoſe nets
which he ſo carefully waſhed; and now Chriſt interrupts him with the favour
and bleſſing of his gracious preſence. Labour in our calling (how homely ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever)
makes us capable of Divine benediction. The honeſt fiſher-man, when
he ſaw the people flock after Chriſt, and heard him ſpeak with ſuch power,
could not but conceive a general and confuſe apprehenſion of ſome excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
worth in ſuch a Teacher, and therefore is glad to honour his ſhip <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
with ſuch a Gueſt; and is firſt Chriſt's Hoſt by Sea, ere he is his Diſciple
by land. An humble and ſerviceable entertainment of a Prophet of God,
was a good foundation of his future honour. He that would ſo eaſily lend
Chriſt his hand and his ſhip, was likely ſoon after to beſtow himſelf upon his
Saviour.</p>

                     <hi>Simon</hi> hath no ſooner done this ſervice to Chriſt, then Chriſt is preparing
for his reward: when the Sermon is ended, the ſhip-room ſhall be paid for
abundantly: neither ſhall the Hoſt exſpect any other pay-maſter then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<hi>Lanch forth into the deep, and let down your Nets to make a draught.</hi> That
ſhip which lent Chriſt an opportunity of catching men upon the ſhore, ſhall
be requited with a plentiful draught of fiſh in the deep. It had been as eaſie
for our Saviour to have brought the fiſh to <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſhip, cloſe to the ſhore; yet
as chuſing rather to have the ſhip carried to the ſhole of fiſh, he bids <hi>Lanch
forth into the deep.</hi> In his Miracles he loves ever to meet Nature in her
bounds; and when ſhe hath done her beſt, to ſupply the reſt by his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> power. The ſame power therefore that could have cauſed the fiſhes to
leap upon drie land, or to leave themſelves forſaken of the waters upon the
ſands of the Lake, will rather finde them in a place natural to their abiding.
<hi>Lanch out into the deep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Rather in a deſire to gratifie and obey his gueſt, then to pleaſure himſelf,
will <hi>Simon</hi> beſtow one caſt of his net. Had Chriſt injoyned him an harder
task, he had not refuſed; yet not without an allegation of the unlikelihood
of ſucceſſe, <hi>Maſter, we have travailed all night, and caught nothing; yet at thy
word I will let down the Net.</hi> The night was the fitteſt time for the hopes of
their trade; not unjuſtly might <hi>Simon</hi> miſdoubt his ſpeed by day, when he
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> had worn out the night in unprofitable labour. Sometimes God croſſeth the
faireſt of our exſpectations, and gives a bleſſing to thoſe times and means
whereof we deſpair. That pains cannot be caſt away, which we reſolve to
loſe for Chriſt. O God, how many do I ſee caſting out their Nets in the
great Lake of the World, which in the whole night of their life have caught
nothing? <hi>They conceive miſchief, and bring forth iniquity; they hatch
Cockatrices egges, and weave the Spiders web: he that eateth of their egges
dieth, and that which is trodden upon breaketh out into a Serpent; their
webs ſhall be no garment, neither ſhall they cover themſelves with their
labours.</hi>

                     <hi>O ye ſons of men, how long will ye love vanity, and follow after lies?</hi> Yet if we
have thus vainly misſpent the time of our darkneſs, let us at the command
of Chriſt caſt out our new-waſhen nets: our humble and penitent obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſhall come home laden with bleſſings. <hi>And when they had ſo done, they
incloſed a great multitude of fiſhes, ſo that their Net brake.</hi> What a difference
there is betwixt our own voluntary acts and thoſe that are done upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
not more in the grounds of them, then in the iſſue? thoſe are oft-times
fruitleſſe, theſe ever ſucceſsfull. Never man threw out his Net at the word
of his Saviour, and drew it back empty. Who would not obey thee, O
Chriſt, ſince thou doſt ſo bountifully requite our weakeſt ſervices? It was
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> not mere retribution that was intended in this event, but inſtruction alſo:
This act was not without a myſterie. He that ſhould be made a fiſher of
men, ſhall in this draught foreſee his ſucceſs. <hi>The Kingdome of Heaven is like
a draw-net caſt into the Sea, which when it is full, men draw to land.</hi> The very
firſt draught that <hi>Peter</hi> made after the complement of his Apoſtleſhip, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
no leſſe then three thouſand Souls. O powerful Goſpel, that can fetch
ſinful men from out of the depths of natural corruption! O happy ſouls,
that from the blinde and muddy cells of our wicked nature, are drawn forth to
the glorious liberty of the ſons of God! <hi>Simon</hi>'s Net breaks with the ſtore.
Abundance is ſometimes no leſſe troubleſome then want. The Net ſhould
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> have held, if Chriſt had not meant to over-charge <hi>Simon</hi> both with bleſſing
and admiration. How happily is that Net broken, whoſe rupture draws the
fiſher to Chriſt? Though the net brake, yet the fiſh eſcaped not: He that
brought them thither to be taken, held them there till they were taken. <hi>They
beckned to their partners in the other ſhip, that they ſhould come and help them.</hi>
There are other ſhips in partnerſhip with <hi>Peter,</hi> he doth not fiſh all the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44233:26"/>
Lake alone. There cannot be a better improvement of ſociety then to help us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
gain, to relieve us in our profitable labours, to draw up the ſpiritual draught
into the veſſel of Chriſt and his Church. Wherefore hath God given us
partners, but that we ſhould becken to them for their aid in our neceſſary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions?
Neither doth <hi>Simon</hi> ſlacken his hand, becauſe he had aſſiſtants.
What ſhall we ſay to thoſe lazie fiſhers, who can ſet others to the Drag, whiles
themſelves look on at eaſe; caring only to feed themſelves with the fiſh,
not willing to wet their hands with the Net? What ſhall we ſay to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of gain? The Nets break, the ſhips ſink with their burden. Oh happy
complaint of too large a capture! O Saviour, if thoſe Apoſtolical veſſels of
thy firſt rigging were thus overlaid, ours flote and totter with a ballaſted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
lightneſs. Thou, who art no leſſe preſent in theſe bottoms of ours, lade them
with an equall fraught of converted ſouls, and let us praiſe thee for thus
ſinking.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Simon</hi> was a skilfull Fiſher, and knew well the depth of his trade; and now
perceiving more then Art or Nature in this draught, he falls down at the
knees of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Lord, goe from me, for I am a ſinfull man.</hi> Himſelf is
caught in this Net. He doth not greedily fall upon ſo unexſpected and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
a booty, but he turns his eyes from the draught to himſelf, from the
Act to the Author, acknowledging vileneſs in the one, in the other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie:
<hi>Goe from me, Lord, for I am a ſinfull man.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>It had been pity the honeſt Fiſher-man ſhould have been taken at his word.
O <hi>Simon,</hi> thy Saviour is come into thine own ſhip to call thee, to call others
by thee unto bleſſedneſs, and doſt thou ſay, <hi>Lord, goe from me?</hi> As if the
Patient ſhould ſay to the Phyſician, Depart from me, for I am ſick. It was the
voice of aſtoniſhment, not of diſlike; the voice of humility, not of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment:
yea, becauſe thou art a ſinfull man, therefore hath thy Saviour
need to come to thee, to ſtay with thee; and becauſe thou art humble in the
acknowledgment of thy ſinfulneſs, therefore Chriſt delights to abide with
thee, and will call thee to abide with him. No man ever fared the worſe for
abaſing himſelf to his God. Chriſt hath left many a ſoul for froward and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
uſage; never any for the diſparagement of it ſelf, and intreaties of
humility. <hi>Simon</hi> could not deviſe how to hold Chriſt faſter, then by thus
ſuing to him to be gone, then by thus pleading his unworthineſs.</p>
                  <p>O my Soul, be not weary of complaining of thine own wretchedneſs; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
thy ſelf to him that knows thy vileneſſe; be aſtoniſhed at thoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
which have ſhamed thine ill deſervings. Thy Saviour hath no power to
goe away from a proſtrate heart. He that reſiſts the proud, heartens the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
<hi>Fear not, for I will make thee henceforth a Fiſher of men.</hi> Loe, this Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is rewarded with an Apoſtleſhip. What had the Earth ever more glorious
then a Legacie from Heaven? He that bade Chriſt goe from him, ſhall have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
the honour to goe firſt on this happy errand. This was a Trade that <hi>Simon</hi>
had no skill of: it could not but be enough to him, that Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I will
make thee;</hi> the Miracle ſhewed him able to make good his word. He that hath
power to command the Fiſhes to be taken, can eaſily inable the hands to take
them.</p>
                  <p>What is this Divine Trade of ours then but a ſpiritual Piſcation? The
World is a Sea; Souls, like fiſhes, ſwim at liberty in this Deep; the Nets of
wholſome Doctrine draw up ſome to the ſhore of Grace and Glory. How
much skill, and toile, and patience is requiſite in this Art? <hi>Who is ſufficient
for theſe things?</hi> This Sea, theſe Nets, the Fiſhers, the Fiſh, the Veſſels are
all thine, O God; doe what thou wilt in us and by us. Give us ability and

made the world, in the roof of an humane breaſt, in a cottage of <hi>Nazareth.</hi> O
Saviour, none of thy miracles is more worthy of aſtoniſhment then thy not
doing of miracles. What thou didſt in private, thy wiſdome thought fit for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy:
but if thy Bleſſed Mother had not been acquainted with ſome dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
wonders, ſhe had not now expected a miracle abroad. The Stars are not
ſeen by day; the Sun it ſelf is not ſeen by night. As it is no ſmall art to hide
Art, ſo is it no ſmall glory to conceal glory. Thy firſt publick Miracle gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> a Marriage. It is an ancient and laudable inſtitution, that the rites of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
ſhould not want a ſolemn celebration. When are Feaſts in ſeaſon, if
not at the recovery of our loſt rib; if not at this main change of our eſtate,
wherein the joy of obtaining meets with the hope of further comforts? The
Son of the Virgin, and the Mother of that Son, are both at a wedding. It was
in all likelihood ſome of their kindred, to whoſe nuptial feaſt they were invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſo far: yet was it more the honour of the Act then of the Perſon that
Chriſt intended. He that made the firſt Marriage in Paradiſe, beſtows his firſt
Miracle upon a <hi>Galilean</hi> marriage. He that was the Author of Matrimony
and ſanctified it, doth by his holy preſence honour the reſemblance of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> union with his Church. How boldly may we ſpit in the faces of all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
Adverſaries of wedlock, when the Son of God pleaſes to honour it?</p>
                  <p>The glorious Bridegroom of the Church knew well how ready men would
be to place ſhame even in the moſt lawful conjunctions; and therefore his firſt
work ſhall be to countenance his own Ordinance. Happy is that Wedding where
Chriſt is a gueſt. O Saviour, thoſe that marry in thee, cannot marry without
thee. There is no holy Marriage whereat thou art not (however inviſible, yet)
truly preſent by thy Spirit, by thy gracious benediction. Thou makeſt marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in Heaven, thou bleſſeſt them from Heaven. O thou that haſt betrothed
us to thy ſelf in Truth &amp; Righteouſneſs, do thou conſummate that happy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of ours in the higheſt Heavens. It was no rich or ſumptuous Bridal to
which Chriſt with his Mother &amp; Diſciples vouchſafed to come from the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of <hi>Galilee.</hi> I find him not at the magnificent Feaſts or triumphs of
the Great. The proud pomp of the World did not agree with the ſtate of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.
This poor needy Bridegroom wants drink for his gueſts. The Bleſſed
Virgin (though a ſtranger to the houſe) out of a charitable compaſſion, and a
friendly deſire to maintain the decencie of an hoſpital entertainment, inquires
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> into the wants of her Hoſt, pities them, bemoans them where there was power
of redreſſe: <hi>When the wine failed, the mother of Jeſus ſaid unto him, They have
no wine.</hi> How well doth it beſeem the eyes of piety and Chriſtian love, to look <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
into the neceſſities of others? She that conceived the God of mercies both in
her heart and in her womb, doth not fix her eyes upon her own teacher, but
ſearcheth into the penurie of a poor <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> and feels thoſe wants whereof he
complains not. They are made for themſelves, whoſe thoughts are only taken
up with their own ſtore or indigence.</p>
                  <p>There was wine enough for a meal, though not for a Feaſt; and if there
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44233:27"/>
were not wine enough, there was enough water: yet the Holy Virgin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
of the want of wine, and is troubled with the very lack of ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
The bounty of our God reaches not to our life only, but to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment:
neither hath he thought good to allow us only the bread of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency,
but ſometimes of pleaſure. One while that is but neceſſary, which
ſome other time were ſuperfluous. It is a ſcrupulous injuſtice to ſcant ourſelves
where God hath been liberal.</p>
                  <p>To whom ſhould we complain of any want, but to the Maker and Giver
of all things? The Bleſſed Virgin knew to whom ſhe ſued: She had good
reaſon to know the Divine nature and power of her Son. Perhaps the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
was not ſo needy, but if not by his purſe, yet by his credit, he might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
have ſupplied that want; or, it were hard if ſome of the neighbour-gueſts
(had they been duely ſolicited) might not have furniſhed him with ſo
much wine as might ſuffice for the laſt ſervice of a dinner. But Bleſſed <hi>Mary</hi>
knew a nearer way: ſhe did not think beſt to lade at the ſhallow Channel,
but runs rather to the Well-head, where ſhe may dip and fill the Firkins at
once with eaſe. It may be ſhe ſaw that the train of Chriſt (which unbidden fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
unto that Feaſt, and unexſpectedly added to the number of the gueſts)
might help forward that defect, and therefore ſhe juſtly ſolicits her Son JESUS
for a ſupply. Whether we want Bread, or Water, or Wine, neceſſaries or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
whither ſhould we run, O Saviour, but to that infinite munificence of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
thine, which neither denieth nor upbraideth any thing? We cannot want, we
cannot abound, but from thee. Give us what thou wilt, ſo thou give us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
with what thou giveſt.</p>
                  <p>But what is this I hear? A ſharp anſwer to the ſuit of a Mother? <hi>Oh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
what have I to doe with thee?</hi> He whoſe ſweet mildneſs and mercy never
ſent away any ſuppliant diſcontented, doth he only frown upon her that bare
him? He that commands us to honour Father and Mother, doth he diſdain
her whoſe fleſh he took? God forbid: Love and Duty doth not exempt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
from due admonition. She ſollicited Chriſt as a Mother, he anſwers her
as a Woman. If ſhe were the Mother of his fleſh, his Deity was eternal. She <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
might not ſo remember her ſelf to be a Mother, that ſhe ſhould forget ſhe was
a Woman; nor ſo look upon him as a Son, that ſhe ſhould not regard him as
a God. He was ſo obedient to her as a Mother, that withall ſhe muſt obey
him as her God. That part which he took from her ſhall obſerve her; ſhe
muſt obſerve that nature which came from above, and made her both a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and a Mother. Matter of miracle concerned the Godhead only; Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
things were above the ſphere of fleſhly relation. If now the Bleſſed
Virgin will be preſcribing either time or form unto Divine acts, <hi>O woman, what
have I to doe with thee? my hour is not come.</hi> In all bodily actions his ſtyle was,
<hi>O Mother:</hi> in ſpirituall and heavenly, <hi>O Woman.</hi> Neither is it for us in the holy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
affairs of God to know any faces; yea, <hi>if we have known Chriſt heretofore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the fleſh, henceforth know we him ſo no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O Bleſſed Virgin, if in that heavenly glory wherein thou art thou canſt
take notice of theſe earthly things, with what indignation doſt thou look
upon the preſumptuous ſuperſtition of vain men, whoſe ſuits make thee
more then a ſolicitor of Divine favours? Thy Humanity is not loſt in thy
Motherhood, nor in thy Glory: The reſpects of Nature reach not ſo high
as Heaven. It is far from thee to abide that honour which is ſtolne from thy
Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>There is a Marriage whereto we are invited, yea wherein we are already <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
intereſſed, not as the Gueſts onely, but as the Bride; in which there ſhall be
no want of the wine of gladneſſe. It is marvel if in theſe earthly banquets there
be not ſome lack. <hi>In thy preſence,</hi> O Saviour, <hi>there is fulneſſe of joy, and at thy
right hand are pleaſures for evermore. Bleſſed are they that are called to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-ſupper
of the Lamb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Even in that rough anſwer doth the Bleſſed Virgin deſcry cauſe of hope.
If his hour were not yet come, it was therefore coming: when the exſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the gueſts and the neceſſity of the occaſion had made fit room for the
Miracle, it ſhall come forth and challenge their wonder. Faithfully therefore
and obſervantly doth ſhe turn her ſpeech from her Son to the Waiters, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he ſaith unto you, doe it.</hi> How well doth it beſeem the Mother of Chriſt
to agree with his Father in Heaven, whoſe voice from Heaven ſaid, <hi>This is my
well-beloved Son, hear him?</hi> She that ſaid of her ſelf, <hi>Be it unto me according to
thy word,</hi> ſaies unto others, <hi>Whatſoever he ſaith to you, doe it.</hi> This is the way to
have Miracles wrought in us, obedience to his Word. The power of Chriſt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> did not ſtand upon their officiouſneſſe: he could have wrought wonders in
ſpite of them; but their perverſe refuſall of his commands might have made
them uncapable of the favour of a miraculous action. He that can (when he
will) convince the obſtinate, will not grace the diſobedient. He that could work
without us, or againſt us, will not work for us, but by us.</p>
                  <p>This very poor houſe was furniſhed with many and large veſſels for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
purification; as if ſin had dwelt upon the skin, that ſuperſtitious people
ſought Holineſs in frequent waſhings. Even this rinſing fouled them with the
uncleanneſſe of a traditional will-worſhip. It is the Soul which needs ſcowring;
and nothing can waſh that but the blood which they deſperately wiſhed upon
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> themſelves and their children, for guilt, not for expiation. <hi>Purge thou</hi> us, O
Lord, <hi>with hyſſop, and</hi> we <hi>ſhall be clean; waſh</hi> us, <hi>and</hi> we <hi>ſhall be whiter then
ſnow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Waiters could not but think ſtrange of ſo unſeaſonable a command,
<hi>Fill the water pots.</hi> It is wine that we want, what do we goe to fetch water?
Doth this Holy man mean thus to quench our Feaſt, and cool our ſtomacks?
If there be no remedy, we could have ſought this ſupply unbidden. Yet ſo
far hath the charge of Chriſts Mother prevailed, that in ſtead of carrying
flagons of wine to the table, they goe to fetch pails-full of water from the
Ciſterns. It is no pleading of unlikelihoods againſt the command of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> power.</p>
                  <p>He that could have created wine immediately in thoſe veſſels, will rather
turn water into wine. In all the courſe of his Miracles, I do never finde him
making ought of nothing; all his great works are grounded upon former
exiſtences. He multiplied the bread, he changed the water, he reſtored the
withered limmes, he raiſed the dead, and ſtill wrought upon that which was,
and did not make that which was not. What doth he in the ordinary way of
nature, but turn the watery juice that ariſes up from the root into wine? He
will only do this now ſuddenly and at once, which he doth uſually by ſenſible
degrees. It is ever duly obſerved by the Son of God, not to doe more miracle
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> then he needs.</p>
                  <p>How liberal are the proviſions of Chriſt? If he had turned but one of
thoſe veſſels, it had been a juſt proof of his power, and perhaps that quantity
had ſerved the preſent neceſſity: now he furniſheth them with ſo much wine
as would have ſerved an hundred and fifty gueſts for an intire Feaſt. Even the
meaſure magnifies at once both his power and mercy. The munificent hand of
God regards not our need only, but our honeſt affluence. It is our ſin and our
ſhame, if we turn his favour into wantonneſs. There muſt be firſt a filling, ere
there be a drawing out. Thus in our veſſels, the firſt care muſt be of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit;
the next, of our expence. God would have us Ciſterns, not Channels.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Our Saviour would not be his own taſter, but he ſends the firſt draught to the
Governour of the Feaſt. He knew his own power, they did not: Neither
would he bear witneſs of himſelf, but fetch it out of others mouths. They that
knew not the original of that wine, yet praiſed the taſte; <hi>Every man at the
beginning doth ſet forth good wine, and when men have well drunk, then that
which is worſe: but thou haſt kept the good wine untill now.</hi> The ſame bounty
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44233:28"/>
that expreſſed it ſelf in the quantity of the Wine, ſhews it ſelf no leſſe in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
excellence. Nothing can fall from that Divine hand not exquiſite: That
liberality hated to provide crab-wine for his gueſts. It was fit that the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
effects of Chriſt (which came from his immediate hand) ſhould be
more perfect then the natural. O Bleſſed Saviour, how delicate is that new
Wine which we ſhall one day drink with thee in thy Fathers Kingdome!
Thou ſhalt turn this water of our earthly affliction into that Wine of gladneſſe,
wherewith our Souls ſhall be ſatiate for ever. <hi>Make haſte, O my Beloved, and be
thou like to a Roe, or to a young Hart upon the Mountain of Spices.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>Even the bloody trade of War yielded worthy Clients to Chriſt. This
Roman Captain had learned to believe in that <hi>Jeſus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> whom many Jews
deſpiſed. No Nation, no trade can ſhut out a good heart from God.
If he were a forreiner for birth, yet he was a domeſtick in heart.He
could not change his blood, he could over-rule his affections. He loved that
Nation which was choſen of God; and if he were not of the Synagogue, yet
he built a Synagogue; where he might not be a partie, he would be a Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Next to being good, is a favouring of goodneſſe. We could not love
Religion, if we utterly want it. How many true Jews were not ſo zealous?
Either will or ability lacked in them, whom duty more obliged. Good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
do many times more then ſupply Nature. Neither doth God regard
whence, but what we are. I do not ſee this Centurion come to Chriſt as the
<hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Captain came to <hi>Elias</hi> in <hi>Carmel,</hi> but with his Cap in his hand, with
much ſuit, much ſubmiſſion, by others, by himſelf: he ſends firſt the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Jews, whom he might hope that their Nation and place might
make gracious: then, left the imployment of others might argue neglect, he
ſeconds them in perſon. Cold and fruitleſſe are the motions of friends, where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
we do wilfully ſhut up our own lips. Importunity cannot but ſpeed well in both.
Could we but ſpeak for our ſelves, as this Captain did for his ſervant, what
could we poſſibly want? What marvel is it if God be not forward to give,
where we care not to ask, or ask as if we cared not to receive? Shall we yet
call this a ſuit, or a complaint? I hear no one word of entreaty. The leſſe is
ſaid, the more is concealed: it is enough to lay open his want. He knew well
that he had to deal with ſo wiſe and merciful a Phyſician, as that the opening
of the malady was a craving of cure. If our ſpiritual miſeries be but confeſſed,
they cannot fail of redreſs.</p>
                  <p>Great variety of Suitors reſorted to Chriſt; one comes to him for a Son,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
another for a Daughter, a third for himſelf: I ſee none come for his Servant,
but this one Centurion. Neither was he a better man then a Maſter. His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
is ſick: he doth not drive him out of doors, but laies him at home; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth he ſtand gazing by his beds-ſide, but ſeeks forth: He ſeeks forth,
not to Witches or Charmers, but to Chriſt: he ſeeks to Chriſt, not with a
faſhionable relation, but with a vehement aggravation of the diſeaſe. Had the
Maſter been ſick, the faithfulleſt Servant could have done no more. He is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to be well ſerved, that will not ſometimes wait upon his followers.
Conceits of inferiority may not breed in us a neglect of charitable offices. So
muſt we look down upon our Servants here on earth, as that we muſt ſtill look <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
up to our Maſter which is in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>But why didſt thou not, O Centurion, rather bring thy Servant to Chriſt
for cure, then ſue for him abſent? There was a Paralytick, whom Faith and
Charity brought to our Saviour, &amp; let down through the uncovered roof in his
Bed: why was not thine ſo carried, ſo preſented? Was it out of the ſtrength
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44233:28"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of thy faith, which aſſured thee thou neededſt not ſhew thy Servant to him
that ſaw all things? One and the ſame grace may yield contrary effects. They,
becauſe they believed, brought the Patient to Chriſt; thou broughteſt not
thine to him, becauſe thou believedſt. Their act argued no leſſe deſire, thine
more confidence. Thy labour was leſſe, becauſe thy Faith was more. Oh that
I could come thus to my Saviour, and make ſuch mone to him for my ſelf,
Lord, my ſoul is ſick of unbelief, ſick of ſelf-love, ſick of inordinate deſires;
I ſhould not need to ſay more. Thy mercy, O Saviour, would not then ſtay
by for my ſuit, but would prevent me (as here) with a gracious ingagement,
<hi>I will come and heal thee.</hi> I did not hear the Centurion ſay either, <hi>Come,</hi> or,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                     <hi>Heal him:</hi> The one he meant, though he ſaid not; the other he neither ſaid
nor meant. Chriſt over-gives both his words &amp; intentions. It is the manner of
that Divine munificence, where he meets with a faithful Suitor, to give more
then is requeſted; to give when he is not requeſted. The very inſinuations of
our neceſſities are no leſſe violent then ſucceſſefull. We think the meaſure of
humane bountie runs over, when we obtain but what we ask with impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity:
that infinite Goodneſſe keeps within bounds, when it overflows the
deſires of our hearts.</p>
                  <p>As he ſaid, ſo he did. The Word of Chriſt either is his act, or concurs with
it. He did not ſtand ſtill when he ſaid, <hi>I will come,</hi> but he went as he ſpake.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> When the Ruler intreated him for his ſon, <hi>Come down ere he dye,</hi> our Saviour
ſtir'd not a foot: the Centurion did but complain of the ſickneſſe of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
and Chriſt unasked ſayes, <hi>I will come and heal him.</hi> That he might be
farre from ſo much as ſeeming to honour wealth and deſpiſe meanneſſe, he
that came in the ſhape of a Servant, would goe down to the ſick Servants
pallet, would not goe to the Bed of the rich Rulers Son. It is the baſeſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of reſpect, that ariſeth merely from outward Greatneſſe. Either more
Grace or more Need may juſtly challenge our favourable regards, no leſſe then
private Obligations.</p>
                  <p>Even ſo, O Saviour, that which thou offeredſt to doe for the Centurion's
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Servant, haſt thou done for us. We were ſick unto death; ſo farre had the
dead palſie of ſin overtaken us, that there was no life of Grace left in us:
when thou wert not content to ſit ſtill in Heaven, and ſay, <hi>I will cure them;</hi> but
addedſt alſo, <hi>I will come and cure them.</hi> Thy ſelf cameſt down accordingly to
this miſerable World, and haſt perſonally healed us; ſo as now we ſhall not
die but live, and declare thy works, O Lord. And oh that we could enough
praiſe that love and mercy which hath ſo graciouſly abaſed thee, and could be
but ſo low dejected before thee, as thou haſt ſtooped low unto us; that we
could be but as lowly ſubjects of thy goodneſſe, as we are unworthy.</p>
                  <p>O admirable return of Humility! Chriſt will goe down to viſit the ſick
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Servant. The Maſter of that Servant ſaies, <hi>Lord, I am not worthy that thou
ſhouldeſt come under my roof:</hi> the Jewiſh Elders, that went before to mediate
for him, could ſay, <hi>He is worthy that thou ſhouldeſt doe this for him;</hi> but the
Centurion, when he comes to ſpeak for himſelf, <hi>I am not worthy.</hi> They ſaid,
He was worthy of Chriſt's Miracle; he ſayes he is unworthy of Chriſt's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.
There is great difference betwixt others valuations and our own. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the world under-rates him that findes reaſon to ſet an high price upon
himſelf. Sometimes again, it overvalues a man that knows juſt cauſe of his
own humiliation. If others miſtake us, this can be no warrant for our errour.
We cannot be wiſe, unleſſe we receive the knowledge of our ſelves by direct
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> beams, not by reflection; unleſſe we have learned to contemn unjuſt applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and ſcorning the flattery of the World, to frown upon our own vileneſſe:
<hi>Lord, I am not worthy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many a one, if he had been in the Centurion's coate, would have thought
well of it; a Captain, a man of good ability and command, a founder of a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue,
a Patron of Religion: yet he overlooks all theſe, and when he caſts
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44233:29"/>
his eye upon the Divine worth of Chriſt and his own weakneſſe, he ſaies,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                     <hi>I am not worthy: Alas, Lord, I am a Gentile, an Alien, a man of blood; thou art
holy, thou art omnipotent.</hi> True Humility will teach us to finde out the beſt of
another, and the worſt piece of our ſelves: Pride contrarily ſhews us nothing
but matter of admiration in our ſelves, in others of contempt. Whiles he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
himſelf unworthy of any favour, he approved himſelf worthy of all. Had
not Chriſt been before in his heart, he could not have thought himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to entertain that Gueſt within his houſe. Under the low roof of an
humble breaſt doth God ever delight to dwell: The ſtate of his Palace may
not be meaſured by the height, but by the depth. Brags and bold faces do oft-times
carry it away with men: nothing prevails with God but our voluntary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
dejections.</p>
                  <p>It is fit the foundations ſhould be layd deep, where the building is high. The
Centurion's Humility was not more low then his Faith was lofty: that reaches
up into Heaven, and in the face of humane weakneſſe deſcries Omnipotence:
<hi>Onely ſay the word, and my Servant ſhall be whole.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had the Centurion's roof been Heaven it ſelf, it could not have been worthy
to be come under of him whoſe Word was Almighty, and who was the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Word of his Father. Such is Chriſt confeſſed by him that ſaies, <hi>Onely
ſay the word.</hi> None but a Divine Power is unlimited: neither hath Faith any
other bounds then God himſelf. There needs no footing to remove Mountains <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
or Devils, but a word. Do but ſay the word, O Saviour, my ſin ſhall be remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
my Soul ſhall be healed, my body ſhall be raiſed from duſt, both Soul and
body ſhall be glorious.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon then was the ſteddy confidence of the good Centurion? He
ſaw how powerful his own word was with thoſe that were under his command,
(though himſelf were under the command of another) the force whereof ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
even to abſent performances; well therefore might he argue, that a free
and unbounded power might give infallible commands, and that the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate
Diſeaſe muſt therefore needs yield to the beck of the God of Nature.
Weakneſſe may ſhew us what is in ſtrength; by one drop of water we may ſee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
what is in the main Ocean. I marvell not if the Centurion were kinde to his
Servants, for they were dutifull to him; he can but ſay, <hi>Doe this,</hi> and it is done:
theſe mutuall reſpects draw on each other; chearfull and diligent ſervice in the
one calls for a due and favourable care in the other: they that neglect to pleaſe,
cannot complain to be neglected. Oh that I could be but ſuch a Servant to
mine heavenly Maſter! Alas! every of his commands ſaies, <hi>Doe this,</hi> and I
doe it not: every of his inhibitions ſaies, <hi>Doe it not,</hi> and I doe it. He ſaies,
Goe from the World; I run to it: he ſaies, <hi>Come to me;</hi> I run from him.
Woe is me! this is not ſervice, but enmity. How can I look for favour, while
I return Rebellion? It is a gracious Maſter whom we ſerve; there can be no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
duty of ours that he ſees not, that he acknowledges not, that he crowns not.
We could not but be happy, if we could be officious.</p>
                  <p>What can be more marvellous then to ſee Chriſt marvell? All marvelling
ſuppoſes an ignorance going before, and a knowledge following ſome accident
unexpected: now who wrought this Faith in the Centurion, but he that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
at it? He knew well what he wrought, becauſe he wrought what he
would; yet he wondred at what he both wrought and knew, to teach us, much
more to admire that which he at once knows and holds admirable.</p>
                  <p>He wrought this Faith as God, he wondred at it as man: God wrought, and
man admired: he that was both, did both, to teach us where to beſtow our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
wonder. I never finde Chriſt wondring at gold or ſilver, at the coſtly and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
works of humane skill or induſtry: yea, when the Diſciples wondred
at the magnificence of the Temple, he rebuked them rather. I finde him not
wondring at the frame of Heaven and earth, nor at the orderly diſpoſition of
all creatures and events; the familiarity of theſe things intercepts the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44233:29"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> But when he ſees the grace or acts of Faith, he ſo approves them, that he
is raviſhed with wonder. He that rejoyced in the view of his Creation, to ſee
that of Nothing he had made all things good, rejoyces no leſſe in the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Creature, to ſee that he had made good of evil. <hi>Behold, thou art
faire, my Love, behold, thou art faire, and there is no ſpot in thee. My Siſter,
my Spouſe, thou haſt wounded my heart, thou haſt wounded my heart with one of
thine eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Wealth, Beauty, Wit, Learning, Honour, may make us accepted of
men, but it is our Faith onely that ſhall make God in love with us. And why
are we of any other ſave God's Diet, to be more affected with the leaſt meaſure
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of Grace in any man, then with all the outward glories of the World? There
are great men whom we juſtly pity; we can admire none but the gracious.</p>
                  <p>Neither was that plant more worth of wonder in it ſelf, then that it grew
in ſuch a ſoile, with ſo little help of Rain and Sun. The weakneſſe of means
addes to the praiſe and acceptation of our proficiency. To doe good upon a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
is the commendation of thriſt: it is ſmall thank to be full-handed in a large
eſtate: As contrarily, the ſtrength of means doubles the revenge of our neglect.
It is not more the ſhame of <hi>Iſrael</hi> then the glory of the Centurion, that our
Saviour ſaies, <hi>I have not found ſo great faith in Iſrael.</hi> Had <hi>Iſrael</hi> yielded any
equall Faith, it could not have been uneſpied of theſe All-ſeeing eyes: yet
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> were their helps ſo much greater as their Faith was leſſe; and God never gives
more then he requires. Where we have laid our Tillage and Compoſt and
Seed, who would not look for a Crop? but if the uncultured fallow yield more,
how juſtly is that unanſwerable ground near to a curſe?</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour did not mutter this cenſorious teſtimony to himſelf, not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper
it to his Diſciples, but he turned him about to the people, and ſpake it
in their eares, that he might at once work their ſhame and emulation. In
all other things, except ſpirituall, our ſelf-love makes us impatient of equals;
much leſſe can we endure to be out-ſtripped by thoſe who are our profeſſed
inferiours. It is well if any thing can kindle in us holy ambitions. Dull and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> baſe are the ſpirits of that man, that can abide to ſee another overtake him in
the way and out-run him to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>He that both wrought this Faith and wondred at it, doth now reward it;
<hi>Goe thy waies, and as thou haſt believed, ſo be it unto thee.</hi> Never was any Faith
unſeen of Chriſt, never was any ſeen without allowance, never was any allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without remuneration. The meaſure of our receits in the matter of favour,
is the proportion of our belief. The infinite Mercy of God (which is ever
like it ſelf) follows but one Rule in his gift to us, the Faith that he gives us.
Give us, O God, to believe, and be it to us as thou wilt, it ſhall be to us above
that we will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> The Centurion ſues for his Servant, and Chriſt ſaies, <hi>So be it unto thee.</hi> The
Servants health is the benefit of the Maſter, and the Maſters Faith is the health
of the Servant. And if the Prayers of an earthly Maſter prevailed ſo much
with the Son of God for the recovery of a Servant, how ſhall the interceſſion
of the Son of God prevail with his Father in Heaven for us that are his impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Children &amp; Servants upon Earth? What can we want, O Saviour, whiles
thou ſueſt for us? He that hath given thee for us, can deny thee nothing for
us, can deny us nothing for thee. In thee we are happy, and ſhall be glorious.
To thee, O thou mightie Redeemer of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with thine eternal Father, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with thy Bleſſed Spirit, one God infinite and incomprehenſible, be

with a large train; ſo entering into the gate of that walled City, as
if he meant to beſiege their Faith by his Power, and to take it. His Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
hath ſo contrived his journey, that he meets with the ſad pomp of a
Funeral. A woful Widow attended with her weeping neighbours is follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her onely Son to the grave. There was nothing in this ſpectacle that did
not command compaſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> A young man in the flower, in the ſtrength of his age, ſwallowed up by
death. Our decrepit age both exſpects death and ſolicits it; but vigorous
youth looks ſtrangely upon that grim Serjeant of God. Thoſe mellow apples
that fall alone from the tree, we gather up with contentment: we chide to
have the unripe unſeaſonably beaten down with cudgels.</p>
                  <p>But more, a young man, the onely Son, the onely childe of his mother.
No condition can make it other then grievous for a well-natur'd mother to
part with her own bowels: yet ſurely ſtore is ſome mitigation of loſs.
Amongſt many children one may be more eaſily miſſed; for ſtill we hope
the ſurviving may ſupply the comforts of the dead: But when all our hopes
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and joyes muſt either live or dy in one, the loſs of that one admits of no
conſolation.</p>
                  <p>When God would deſcribe the moſt paſſionate expreſſion of ſorrow that can
fall into the miſerable, he can but ſay, <hi>oh daughter of my people, gird thee with
ſackcloth, and wallow thy ſelf in the aſhes, make lamentation and bitter mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as for thine onely Son.</hi> Such was the loſs, ſuch was the ſorrow of this
diſconſolate mother; neither words nor tears can ſuffice to diſcover it.</p>
                  <p>Yet more, had ſhe been aided by the counſel and ſupportation of a loving
yoke-fellow, this burden might have ſeemed leſs intolerable. A good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
may make amends for the loſs of a Son; had the root been left to her
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> intire, ſhe might better have ſpared the branch: now both are cut up, all the
ſtay of her life is gone; and ſhe ſeems abandoned to a perfect miſery. And
now when ſhe gave her ſelf up for a forlorn mourner, paſt all capacity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs,
the God of comfort meets her, pities her, relieves her. Here was
no ſolicitor but his own compaſſion. In other occaſions he was ſought and
ſued to. The Centurion comes to him for a Servant, the Ruler for a Son, <hi>Jai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
for a Daughter, the neighbours for the Paralytick; here he ſeeks up the
Patient, and offers the cure unrequeſted. Whiles we have to doe with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Mercies, our afflictions are the moſt powerful ſuitors. No teares, no
prayers can move him ſo much as his own commiſeration. O God, none of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> our ſecret ſorrows can be either hid from thine eyes or kept from thine heart:
and when we are paſt all our hopes, all poſſibilities of help, then art thou
neareſt to us for deliverance.</p>
                  <p>Here was a conſpiration of all parts to mercy. The Heart had compaſſion; the
Mouth ſaid, <hi>Weep not;</hi> the Feet went to the Bier; the Hand touched the coffin;
the Power of the Deity raiſed the dead. What the Heart felt was ſecret to it
ſelf: the Tongue therefore expreſſes it in words of comfort, <hi>Weep not.</hi> Alas!
what are words to ſo ſtrong and juſt paſſions? To bid her not to weep that
had loſt her only Son, was to perſwade her to be miſerable, and not feel it; to
feel, and not regard it; to regard, and yet to ſmother it. Concealment doth not
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> remedy, but aggravate ſorrow. That with the counſel of not weeping therefore
ſhe might ſee cauſe of not weeping, his Hand ſeconds his Tongue. He ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
the Coffin, and frees the Priſoner; <hi>Young man, I ſay unto thee, Ariſe.</hi> The
Lord of life and death ſpeaks with command. No finite power could have
ſaid ſo without preſumption, or with ſucceſs. That is the voice that ſhall one
day call up our vaniſhed bodies from thoſe Elements into which they are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44233:31"/>
and raiſe them out of their duſt. Neither ſea, nor death, nor hell can of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
to detain their dead, when he charges them to be delivered. Incredulous
nature! what doſt thou ſhrink at the poſſibility of a Reſurrection, when
the God of Nature undertakes it? It is no more hard for that almighty
Word which gave being unto all things, to ſay, <hi>Let them be repaired,</hi> then, <hi>Let
them be made.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not ſee our Saviour ſtretching himſelf upon the dead corps, as <hi>Elias</hi>
and <hi>Eliſha</hi> upon the ſons of the <hi>Sunamite</hi> and <hi>Sareptan,</hi> nor kneeling down and
praying by the Bier, as <hi>Peter</hi> did to <hi>Dorcas;</hi> but I hear him ſo ſpeaking to the
dead as if he were alive, and ſo ſpeaking to the dead, that by the word he
makes him alive, <hi>I ſay unto thee, Ariſe.</hi> Death hath no power to bid that man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
lye ſtill, whom the Son of God bids <hi>Ariſe.</hi> Immediatly he that was dead ſate up.
So at the ſound of the laſt Trumpet, by the power of the ſame voice we ſhall
ariſe out of the duſt, and ſtand up glorious: <hi>This mortall ſhall put on immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
this corruptible, incorruption.</hi> This body ſhall not be buried, but ſown;
and at our day ſhall therefore ſpring up with a plentiful increaſe of glory. How
comfortleſs, how deſperate ſhould be our lying down, if it were not for this
aſſurance of riſing? And now, behold, leſt our weak faith ſhould ſtagger at the
aſſent to ſo great a difficulty, he hath already, by what he hath done, given us
taſtes of what he will do. The power that can raiſe one man, can raiſe a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,
a million, a world: no power can raiſe one man, but that which is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
and that which is infinite admits of no limitation. Under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
God raiſed one by <hi>Elias,</hi> another by <hi>Eliſha</hi> living, a third by <hi>Eliſha</hi> dead:
By the hand of the Mediator of the New Teſtament he raiſed here the ſon of
the Widow, the daughter of <hi>Jairus, Lazarus,</hi> and, in attendance of his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
he made a gaol-delivery of holy priſoners at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> He raiſes
the daughter of <hi>Jairus</hi> from her bed, this Widows ſon from his Coffin, <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
from his grave, the dead Saints of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from their rottenneſs; that it
might appear no degree of death can hinder the efficacie of his overruling com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
He that keeps the keys of Death cannot onely make way for himſelf
through the common Hall and outer-rooms, but through the inwardeſt and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
moſt reſerved cloſets of darkneſs.</p>
                  <p>Methinks I ſee this young man, who was thus miraculouſly awaked from his
deadly ſleep, wiping and rubbing thoſe eyes that had been ſhut up in death;
and deſcending from the Bier, wrapping his winding-ſheet about his loyns,
caſt himſelf down in a paſſionate thankfulneſs at the feet of his Almighty
reſtorer, adoring that Divine power which had commanded his Soul back
again to her forſaken lodging: and though I hear not what he ſaid, yet I dare
ſay they were words of praiſe and wonder which his returned Soul firſt uttered.
It was the mother whom our Saviour pittied in this act, not the ſon;
(who now forced from his quiet reſt, muſt twice paſs through the gates of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
death.) As for her ſake therefore he was raiſed, ſo to her hands was he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
that ſhe might acknowledge that ſoul given to her, not to the poſſeſſor.
Who cannot feel the amazement and ecſtaſie of joy that was in this revived
mother, when her ſon now ſalutes her from out of another world, and
both receives and gives gratulations of his new life? How ſuddenly were all the
tears of that mournful train dried up with a joyful aſtoniſhment? How
ſoon is that funeral banquet turned into a new Birth-day feaſt? What
ſtriving was here to ſalute the late carcaſe of their returned neighbour? What
awful and admiring looks were caſt upon that Lord of life, who ſeeming
homely, was approved Omnipotent? How gladly did every tongue celebrate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
both the work and the Author? <hi>A great Prophet is raiſed up amongſt us, and God
hath viſited his people.</hi> A Prophet was the higheſt name they could find for him,
whom they ſaw like themſelves in ſhape, above themſelves in power. They
were not yet acquainted with God manifeſted in the fleſh. This Miracle
might well have aſſured them of more then a Prophet: but he that raiſed the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44233:31"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> dead man from the Bier, would not ſuddenly raiſe theſe dead hearts from the
grave of Infidelity. They ſhall ſee reaſon enough to know that the Prophet
who was raiſed up to them was the God that now viſited them, and at laſt
ſhould doe as much for them as he had done for the young man, raiſe them
from death to life, from duſt to glory.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>We do not finde Chriſt oft attended with Nobilitie: here he is. It was
ſome great Peer, or ſome noted Courtier that was now a ſuitor to him for his
dying ſon. Earthly Greatneſs is no defence againſt Afflictions. We men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
the Mightie: Diſeaſe and Death know no faces of Lords or Monarchs.
Could theſe be bribed, they would be too rich. Why ſhould we grudge not to
be privileged, when we ſee there is no ſpare of the greateſt?</p>
                  <p>This Noble Ruler liſtens after Chriſt's return into <hi>Galilee.</hi> The moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
amongſt men will be glad to hearken after Chriſt in their neceſſity. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
was it for him that his ſon was ſick; he had not elſe been acquainted
with his Saviour, his Soul had continued ſick of ignorance and unbelief.
Why elſe doth our good God ſend us pain, loſſes, oppoſition, but that
he may be ſought to? Are we afflicted? whither ſhould we goe but to
<hi>Cana</hi> to ſeek Chriſt? whither but to the <hi>Cana</hi> of Heaven, where our water
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of ſorrow is turned to the wine of gladneſs, to that omnipotent Phyſician
who healeth all our infirmities; that we may once ſay, <hi>It is good for me
that I was afflicted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was about a dayes journey from <hi>Capernaum</hi> to <hi>Cana:</hi> Thence hither did
this Courtier come for the cure of his ſons Fever. What pains even the greateſt
can be content to take for bodily health? No way is long, no labour tedious
to the deſirous. Our Souls are ſick of a ſpiritual Fever, labouring under the
cold fit of Infidelity, and the hot fit of Self-love; and we ſit ſtill at home,
and ſee them languiſh unto death.</p>
                  <p>This Ruler was neither faithleſs nor faithful. Had he been quite faithleſs,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> he had not taken ſuch pains to come to Chriſt. Had he been faithful, he had
not made this ſuit to Chriſt when he was come, <hi>Come down, and heal my

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Come down?</hi> as if Chriſt could not have cured him abſent. <hi>Ere he die?</hi>
as if that power could not have raiſed him being dead. How much difference
was here betwixt the Centurion and the Ruler? That came for his Servant,
this for his Son. This ſon was not more above the ſervant, then the Faith which
ſued for the ſervant ſurpaſſed that which ſued for the ſon. The one can ſay,
<hi>Maſter, come not under my roof, for I am not worthy; onely ſpeak the word, and
my ſervant ſhall be whole.</hi> The other can ſay, Maſter, either come under my roof,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> or my ſon cannot be whole. <hi>Heal my ſon</hi> had been a good ſuit; for Chriſt is
the onely Phyſician for all diſeaſes: but, <hi>Come down and heal him,</hi> was to teach
God how to work.</p>
                  <p>It is good reaſon that he ſhould challenge the right of preſcribing to us, who
are every way his own: it is preſumption in us to ſtint him unto our forms.
An expert workman cannot abide to be taught by a novice; how much
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44233:32"/>
leſs ſhall the all-wiſe God endure to be directed by his creature? This is more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
then if the Patient ſhould take upon him to give a <hi>Recipe</hi> to the Phyſician.
That God would give us grace is a beſeeming ſuit: but to ſay, Give it me
by proſperitie, is a ſawcy motion.</p>
                  <p>As there is faithfulneſs in deſiring the End; ſo modeſty and patience in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
the Means to the author. In ſpiritual things God hath acquainted us
with the means whereby he will work, even his own Sacred Ordinances.
Upon theſe, becauſe they have his own promiſe, we may call abſolutely for a
Bleſſing: In all others there is no reaſon that beggers ſhould be chuſers. He
who doth whatſoever he will, muſt doe it how he will. It is for us to receive,

ye ſee ſignes and wonders, ye will not believe.</hi> This Nobleman was (as is like)
of <hi>Capernaum:</hi> There had Chriſt often preached; there was one of his
chief reſidencies. Either this man had heard our Saviour oft, or might have
done: yet becauſe Chriſt's Miracles came to him onely by hear-ſay (for as yet
we finde none at all wrought where he preached moſt) therefore the man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
not enough; but ſo ſpeaks to Chriſt as to ſome ordinary Phyſician,
<hi>Come down and heal.</hi> It was the common diſeaſe of the Jews, Incredulity;
which no receit could heal but Wonders. <hi>A wicked and adulterous gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
ſeeks ſignes.</hi> Had they not been wilfully graceleſs, there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
proof enough of the <hi>Meſsias:</hi> the miraculous conception and life of
the Fore-runner, <hi>Zacharie</hi>'s dumbneſs, the atteſtation of Angels, the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition
of the Star, the journey of the Sages, the viſion of the Shepherds,
the teſtimonies of <hi>Anna</hi> and <hi>Simeon,</hi> the Prophecies fulfilled, the Voice
from Heaven at his Baptiſme, the Divine words that he ſpake; and yet
they muſt have all made up with Miracles: which though he be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to give at his own times, yet he thinks much to be tied
unto at theirs. Not to believe without ſignes, was a ſigne of ſtubborn
hearts.</p>
                  <p>It was a foul fault and a dangerous one, <hi>Ye will not believe.</hi> What is it that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
ſhall condemn the world but unbelief? What can condemn us without it? No
ſin can condemn the repentant. Repentance is a fruit of Faith: where true
Faith is then, there can be no condemnation; as there can be nothing but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
without it. How much more foul in a noble <hi>Capernaite,</hi> that had
heard the Sermons of ſo Divine a Teacher? The greater light we have, the
more ſhame it is for us to ſtumble.</p>
                  <p>Oh what ſhall become of us that reel and fall in the cleareſt Sun-ſhine that
ever looked forth upon any Church? Be merciful to our ſins, O God, and ſay
any thing of us rather then, <hi>Ye will not believe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Saviour tels him of his unbelief. He feels not himſelf ſick of that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
diſeaſe: All his minde is on his dying ſon. As eaſily do we complain of
bodily griefs, as we are hardly affected with ſpiritual. Oh the meekneſs
and mercy of this Lamb of God! When we would have look'd that he ſhould
have puniſhed this ſuitor for not believing, he condeſcends to him that
he may believe: <hi>Go thy way, thy ſon liveth.</hi> If we ſhould meaſure our
hopes by our own worthineſs, there were no exſpectation of bleſſings:
but if we ſhall meaſure them by his bounty and compaſſion, there can
be no doubt of prevailing. As ſome tender mother that gives the breaſt
to her unquiet childe in ſtead of the rod, ſo deals he with our perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>How God differences men according to no other conditions then of their
Faith! The Centurion's ſervant was ſick, the Ruler's ſon. The Centurion
doth not ſue unto Chriſt to come; onely ſayes, <hi>My ſervant is ſick of a Palſie:</hi>
Chriſt anſwers him, <hi>I will come and heal him.</hi> The Ruler ſues unto Chriſt that
he would come and heal his ſon: Chriſt will not goe; onely ſayes, <hi>Goe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44233:32"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> thy way, thy Son lives.</hi> Outward things carrie no reſpect with God. The
Image of that Divine Majeſty ſhining inwardly in the Graces of the Soul is that
which wins love from him in the meaneſt eſtate. The Centurion's Faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could doe more then the Ruler's Greatneſs; and that faithful mans ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
hath more regard then this great mans ſon.</p>
                  <p>The Ruler's requeſt was, <hi>Come and heale:</hi> Chriſt's anſwer was, <hi>Goe thy way,
thy Son lives.</hi> Our merciful Saviour meets thoſe in the end whom he croſſes in
the way. How ſweetly doth he correct our prayers, and whiles he doth not
give us what we ask, gives us better then we asked!</p>
                  <p>Juſtly doth he forbear to goe down with this Ruler, leſt he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> him in an opinion of meaſuring his power by conceits of locality and
diſtance: but he doth that in abſence for which his preſence was required
with a repulſe, <hi>Thy Son liveth;</hi> giving a greater demonſtration of his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie
then was craved. How oft doth he not hear to our will, that he may
hear us to our advantage? The choſen Veſſel would be rid of Tentations, he
heares of a ſupply of Grace: The ſick man asks Releaſe, receives Patience;
Life, and receives Glory. Let us ask what we think beſt: let him give what
he knows beſt.</p>
                  <p>With one word doth Chriſt heal two Patients, the ſon and the father;
the ſons Fever, the fathers Unbelief. That operative word of our Saviour
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> was not without the intention of a tryal. Had not the Ruler gone home ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with that intimation of his ſons life and recovery, neither of them had
been bleſſed with ſucceſs. Now the news of performance meets him one
half of the way: and he that believed ſomewhat ere he came, and more when
he went, grew to more faith in the way; and when he came home, inlarged
his faith to all the skirts of his family. A weak faith may be true; but a true
faith is growing. He that boaſts of a full ſtature in the firſt moment of his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
may preſume, but doth not believe.</p>
                  <p>Great men cannot want Clients; their Example ſwaies ſome, their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
more: they cannot goe to either of the other worlds alone. In vain

Devil which poſſeſſed him: and now the action is attributed to the ſpirit which
was ſubjectively in the man. <hi>It is not you that ſpeak,</hi> faith our Saviour, <hi>but the
spirit of your Father that ſpeaketh in you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As it is in bodily Diſeaſes, that they do not infect us alike; ſome ſeize upon
the humours, others upon the ſpirits; ſome aſſalt the brain, others the
heart or lungs: ſo in bodily and ſpiritual poſſeſſions; in ſome the evil ſpirit
takes away their ſenſes, in ſome their lims, in ſome their inward faculties;
like as ſpiritually they affect to move us unto ſeveral ſins, one to luſt, another
to covetouſneſs, or ambition, another to cruelty: and their names have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
them according to theſe various effects. This was a dumb Devil:
which yet had poſſeſſed not the tongue only of this man, but his ear; not that
only, but (as it ſeems) his eyes too.</p>
                  <p>O ſubtile and tyrannous ſpirit, that obſtructs all wayes to the Soul, that
keeps out all means of Grace both from the door and windows of the heart;
yea that ſtops up all paſſages whether of ingreſs or egreſs: of ingreſs at the
eye or eare, of egreſs at the mouth, that there might be no capacity of
redreſs!</p>
                  <p>What holy uſe is there of our tongue but to praiſe our Maker, to confeſs
our ſins, to inform our brethren? How rife is this Dumb Devil every where,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
whiles he ſtops the mouths of Chriſtians from theſe uſeful and neceſſary
duties?</p>
                  <p>For what end hath man thoſe two privileges above his fellow-creatures,
Reaſon and Speech, but that as by the one he may conceive of the great
works of his Maker, which the reſt cannot, ſo by the other he may expreſs
what he conceives to the honour of the Creator both of them and himſelf?
And why are all other creatures ſaid to praiſe God, and bidden to praiſe
him, but becauſe they do it by the apprehenſion, by the expreſſion of man?
<hi>If the Heavens declare the glory of God,</hi> how doe they it but to the eyes, and by
the tongue of that man for whom they were made? It is no ſmall honour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
whereof the envious ſpirit ſhall rob his Maker, if he can cloſe up the
mouth of his onely rational and vocal creature, and turn the beſt of his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip
into a dumb Idol, that hath a mouth and ſpeaks not. <hi>Lord, open thou
my lips, and my mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Praiſe is not more neceſſary then complaint; praiſe of God, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44233:33"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of our ſelves, whether to God or men. The onely amends we can make
to God, when we have not had the grace to avoid ſinne, is to confeſs the
ſinne we have not avoided. This is the ſponge that wipes out all the blots and
blurs of our lives. <hi>If we confeſs our ſinnes, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us
our ſins,</hi> and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>That cunning man-ſlayer knows there is no way to purge the ſick ſoul but
upward, by caſting out the vicious humour wherewith it is clogged; and
therefore holds the lips cloſe, that the heart may not disburden it ſelf by ſo
wholeſome evacuation. <hi>When I kept ſilence, my bones conſumed: For day and
night thy hand, O Lord, was heavy upon me; my moiſture is turned into the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> drought of summer. O let me confeſs againſt my ſelf my wickedneſs unto thee, that
thou maiſt forgive the puniſhment of my ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have a tongue for God, when we praiſe him; for our ſelves, when we
pray and confeſs; for our brethren, when we ſpeak the truth for their infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
which if we hold back in unrighteouſneſs, we yield unto that
dumb Devil. Where do we not ſee that accurſed ſpirit? He is on the
Bench, when the mute or partial Judge ſpeaks not for truth and innocence.
He is in the Pulpit, when the Prophets of God ſmother, or halve, or adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the meſſage of their Maſter. He is at the Barre, when irreligious Jurours
dare lend an oath to fear, to hope, to gain. He is in the Market, when god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> chapmen for their peny ſell the truth and their ſoul. He is in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
converſation of men, when the tongue belies the heart, flatters the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
balketh reproofs even in the fouleſt crimes. O thou who onely art ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then that ſtrong one, caſt him out of the hearts and mouths of men. <hi>It is
time for thee, Lord, to work, for they have deſtroyed thy Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That it might well appear this impediment was not natural; ſo ſoon as
the man is freed from the ſpirit, his tongue is free to his ſpeech. The effects
of ſpirits as they are wrought, ſo they ceaſe at once. If the Son of God do
but remove our ſpiritual poſſeſſion, we ſhall preſently break forth into
the praiſe of God, into the confeſſion of our vileneſs, into the profeſſion
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of truth.</p>
                  <p>But what ſtrange variety do I ſee in the ſpectators of his Miracle, ſome won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring,
others cenſuring, a third ſort tempting, a fourth applauding? There
was never man or action but was ſubject to variety of conſtructions. What
man could be ſo holy as he that was God? What act could be more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
then the diſpoſſeſſing of an evil ſpirit? Yet this man, this act paſſeth
theſe differences of interpretation. What can we doe to undergoe but one
opinion? If we give almes and faſt, ſome will magnifie our charity and
devotion, others will tax our hypocriſie: If we give not, ſome will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
our hard-heartedneſs, others will allow our care of juſtice. If we
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> preach plainly, to ſome it will favour of a careleſs ſlubbering, to others
oft a mortified ſincerity; elaborately, ſome will tax our affectation, others
will applaud our diligence in dreſſing the delicate viands of God. What
marvel is it if it be thus with our imperfection, when it fared not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
with him that was Purity and Righteouſneſs it ſelf? The auſtere
forerunner of Chriſt <hi>came neither eating nor drinking;</hi> they ſay, <hi>He hath a
Devil:</hi> The Son of man came <hi>eating and drinking;</hi> they ſay, <hi>This man is a
glutton, a friend of Publicans and ſinners:</hi> and here one of his holy acts carries
away at once wonder, cenſure, doubt, celebration. There is no way ſafe
for a man but to ſquare his actions by the right rule of juſtice, of charity; and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> then let the world have leave to ſpend their gloſſes at pleaſure. It was
an heroical reſolution of the choſen veſſel, <hi>I paſs very little to be judged of
you, or of mans day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I marvel not if the people marvelled; for here were four wonders in
one: the blind ſaw, the deaf heard, the dumb ſpake, the Demoniack
is delivered. Wonder was due to ſo rare and powerful a work, and if
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44233:34"/>
not this, nothing. We can caſt away admiration upon the poor devices <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
or activities of men; how much more upon the extraordinary works of
Omnipotency? Whoſo knows the frame of Heaven and earth, ſhall not much
be affected with the imperfect effects of frail Humanity; but ſhall with no
leſs Raviſhment of ſoul acknowledge the miraculous works of the ſame
Almighty hand. Neither is the ſpiritual ejection worthy of any meaner
entertainment. Rarity and difficulty are wont to cauſe wonder. There
are many things which have wonder in their worth, and loſe it in their
frequence; there are ſome which have it in their ſtrangeneſs, and loſe it
in their facilitie: Both meet in this. To ſee men haunted, yea poſſeſſed
with a dumb Devil, is ſo frequent, that it is a juſt wonder to finde a man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
free: but to finde the dumb ſpirit caſt out of a man, and to hear him
praiſing God, confeſſing his ſins, teaching others the ſweet experiments
of mercy, deſerves juſt admiration. If the Cynick ſought in the market
for a man amongſt men, well may we ſeek amongſt men for a Convert. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the difficulty leſs then the rareneſs. The ſtrong man hath the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
all paſſages are block'd up, all helps barred, by the treachery of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
If any ſoul be reſcued from theſe ſpiritual wickedneſſes, it is the praiſe
of him that doth wonders alone.</p>
                  <p>But whom do I ſee wondring? The multitude. The unlearned beholders
follow that act with wonder, which the learned Scribes entertain with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
obloquy. God hath revealed thoſe things to babes which he hath hid
from the wiſe and prudent. With what ſcorn did thoſe great Rabbins
ſpeak of theſe ſons of the earth, <hi>This people that knows not the Law is accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?</hi>
Yet the Mercy of God makes an advantage of their ſimplicity; in that
they are therefore leſs ſubject to cavillation and incredulitie: as contrarily,
his Juſtice cauſes the proud knowledge of others to lie as a block in their way
to the ready aſſent unto the Divine power of the <hi>Meſsias.</hi> Let the pride of
glorious adverſaries diſdain the povertie of the clients of the Goſpel: it ſhall
not repent us to go to Heaven with the vulgar, whiles their great ones go in
ſtate to perdition.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>The multitude wondered. Who cenſured but Scribes, great Doctors of
the Law, of the divinitie of the Jews? What Scribes but thoſe of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
the moſt eminent Academie of <hi>Judaea?</hi> Theſe were the men who
out of their deep reputed judgement caſt theſe foul aſperſions upon Chriſt.
Great wits ofttimes miſlead both the owners and followers. How many ſhall
once wiſh they had been born dullards, yea idiots, when they ſhall finde
their wit to have barred them out of Heaven? <hi>Where is the Scribe? where is
the diſputer of this world?</hi> Hath not God <hi>made the wiſdome of the world
fooliſhneſs?</hi> Say the world what it will, a dram of holineſs is worth a pound
of wit. Let others cenſure with the Scribes: let me wonder with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>What could malice ſay worſe? <hi>He caſteth out Devils through Beelzebub the
Prince of Devils.</hi> The Jewes well knew that the Gods of the heathen were
no other then Devils; amongſt whom for that the <hi>Lord of Flies</hi> (ſo called,
whether for the concourſe of flies to the abundance of his ſacrifices,
or for his aid implored againſt the infeſtation of thoſe ſwarms) was held
the chief, therefore they ſtile him <hi>The Prince of Devils.</hi> There is a ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
of ſpirits, ſome higher in degree, ſome inferiour to others. Our
Saviour himſelf tells us of the Devil and his Angels. Meſſengers are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to thoſe that ſend them. The ſeven Devils that entered into the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
ſwept and garniſhed houſe, were worſe then the former. Neither can Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities,
and Powers, and Governours, and Princes of the darkneſs of
this World, deſign others then ſeveral ranks of evil Angels. There can
be no being without ſome kind of order; there can be no order in parity.
If we look up into Heaven, there is <hi>The King of Gods, The Lord of Lords;</hi>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:44233:34"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> higher then the higheſt. If to the earth, there are Monarchs, Kings, Princes,
Peeres, people. If we look down to Hell, there is <hi>the Prince of Devils.</hi> They
labour for Confuſion that call for Parity. What ſhould the Church doe with
ſuch a for me as is not exempliied in Heaven, in Earth, in Hell?</p>
                  <p>One Devil (according to their ſuppoſition) may be uſed to caſt out an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
How far the command of one ſpirit over another may extend, it is a
ſecret of infernal ſtate, too deep for the inquiry of men. The thing it ſelf is
apparent; upon compact and precontracted compoſition, one gives way
to other for the common advantage. As we ſee in the Common-wealth
of Cheaters and Cut-purſes, one doth the fact, another is feed to bring it
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> out and to procure reſtitution: both are of the trade, both conſpire to the
fraud; the actor falls not out with the revealer, but divides with him that cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſpoil.</p>
                  <p>One malicious miſcreant ſets the Devil on work to the inflicting of diſeaſe
or death; another upon agreement, for a further ſpiritual gain, takes him
off: There is a Devil in both. And if there ſeem more bodily favour, there
is no leſs ſpiritual danger in the latter: In the one Satan wins the agent,
the ſuitor in the other. It will be no cauſe of diſcord in Hell, that one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
gives eaſe to the body which another tormented, that both may triumph
in the gain of a Soul. Oh God, that any creature which bears thine Image
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſhould not abhorre to be beholding to the powers of Hell for aid, for advice!
<hi>Is is not becauſe there is not a God in Iſrael, that men goe to inquire of the
God of Ekron?</hi> Can men be ſo ſottiſh to think that the vowed enemie of their
Souls can offer them a bait without an hook? What <hi>evil is there in the City
which the Lord hath not done?</hi> what is there which he cannot as eaſily redreſs?
He wounds, he heals again. And if he will not, <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe
what ſeems good in his eyes.</hi> If he do not deliver us, he will crown our faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
in a patient perſeverance. The wounds of God are better then the ſalves
of Satan.</p>
                  <p>Was it poſſible that the wit of Envy could deviſe ſo high a ſlander? <hi>Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> was a God of the heathen, therefore herein they accuſe him for an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
<hi>Beelzebub</hi> was a Devil to the Jewes, therefore they accuſe him for a
conjurer: <hi>Beelzebub</hi> was the chief of Devils, therefore they accuſe him for
on Arch-exorciſt, for the worſt kinde of Magician. Some profeſſors of this
black Art, though their work be deviliſh, yet they pretend to doe it in
the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and will preſumptuouſly ſeem to doe that by command
which is ſecretly tranſacted by agreement. The Scribes accuſe Chriſt of a
direct compact with the Devil, and ſuppoſe both a league and familiarity,
which by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> (in the very hand of a <hi>Saul</hi>) was no other then
deadly. Yea ſo deep doth this wound reach, that our Saviour ſearching it
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to the bottome, findes no leſs in it then the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
hereupon that dreadful ſentence of the irremiſſibleneſs of that ſin unto
death. And if this horrible crimination were caſt upon thee, O Saviour, in
whom the Prince of this world found nothing, what wonder is it if we thy ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſervants be branded on all ſides with evil tongues?</p>
                  <p>Yea (which is yet more) how plain is it that theſe men forced their tongue
to ſpeak this ſlander againſt their own heart? Elſe this Blaſphemy had been
onely againſt the Son of man, not againſt the Holy Ghoſt: but now that
the ſearcher of hearts findes it to be no leſs then againſt the Bleſſed Spirit
of God, the ſpight muſt needs be obſtinate; their malice doth wilfully croſs
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> their conſcience. Envie never regards how true, but how miſchievous: So it
may gall or kill, it cares little whether with truth or falſhood. For us, <hi>Bleſſed
are we when men revile us, and ſay all manner of evil of us, for the name of
Chirſt.</hi> For them, <hi>What reward ſhall be given to thee, thou falſe tongue?
Even ſharp arrows with hot burning coales;</hi> yea thoſe very coales of hell from
which thou wert inkindled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:44233:35"/>
There was yet a third ſort that went a mid-way betwixt wonder and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
Theſe were not ſo malicious as to impute the miracle to a Satanical
operation; they confeſs it good, but not enough; and therefore urge
Chriſt to a further proof: <hi>Though thou haſt caſt out this dumb Devil, yet
this is no ſufficient argument of thy Divine power. We have yet ſeen nothing
from thee like thoſe antient Miracles of the times of our fore-fathers. Joſhuah
cauſed the Sun to ſtand ſtill; Elias brought fire down from heaven; Samuel aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
the people with thunder and rain in the midſt of harveſt: If thou wouldſt
command our belief, doe ſomewhat like to theſe. The caſting out of a Devil
ſhews thee to have ſome power over Hell; ſhew us now that thou haſt no leſs
power over Heaven.</hi> There is a kinde of unreaſonableneſs of deſire and inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiableneſs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
in infidelity; it never knows when it hath evidence enough. This
which the Jews overlooked, was a more irrefragable demonſtration of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
then that which they deſired. A Devil was more then a Meteor, or a parcel
of an element; to caſt out a Devil by command, more then to command fire
from Heaven. Infidelity ever loves to be her own carver.</p>
                  <p>No ſon can be more like a father then theſe Jews to their progenitours
in the deſart: that there might be no fear of degenerating into good, they
alſo of old tempted God in the Wilderneſs. Firſt, they are weary of the
<hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, and are ready to fall out with God and <hi>Moſes</hi> for their
ſtay in thoſe fornaces. By ten miraculous Plagues they are freed: and going <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
out of thoſe confines, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> follow them; the Sea is before them:
now they are more afflicted with their liberty then their ſervitude. The
Sea yields way, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> are drowned: and now that they are ſafe
on the other ſhore, they tempt the Providence of God for water. The
Rock yields it them: then, no leſs for bread and meat. God ſends them Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
and Quailes: they cry out of the food of Angels. Their preſent ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in the way are vanquiſhed: they whine at the men of meaſures in the
heart of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Nothing from God but Mercy; nothing from them but
Temptations.</p>
                  <p>Their true brood both in nature and in ſin had abundant proofs of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah;</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
if curing the blinde, lame, diſeaſed, deaf, dumb, ejecting Devils, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
the elements, raiſing the dead, could have been ſufficient: yet ſtill
they muſt have a ſigne from Heaven, and ſhut up in the ſtile of the Tempter,
<hi>If thou be the Chriſt.</hi> The gracious heart is credulous: Even where it ſees
not, it believes; and where it ſees but a little, it believes a great deal. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth it preſume to preſcribe unto God what and how he ſhall work, but
takes what it finds, and unmovably reſts in what it takes. Any miracle, no
miracle ſerves enough for their aſſent who have built their Faith upon the
Goſpel of the Lord <hi>Jeſus.</hi>

                  <p>It was not a more buſie then gainful trade that <hi>Matthew</hi> abandoned to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44233:36"/>
Chriſt into poverty: and now he caſt away his Counters, and ſtruck <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
his Tallies, and croſſed his books, and contemned his heaps of caſh in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of that better treaſure which he foreſaw lye open in that happy
attendance. If any commodity be valued of us too dear to be parted with
for Chriſt, we are more fit to be Publicans then Diſciples. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
invites <hi>Matthew</hi> to a Diſcipleſhip; <hi>Matthew</hi> invites him to a Feaſt.
The joy of his call makes him begin his abdication of the world in a
banquet.</p>
                  <p>Here was not a more chearful thankfulneſs in the inviter, then a gracious
humility in the gueſt. The new ſervant bids his Maſter, the Publican his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
and is honoured with ſo bleſſed a preſence. I do not finde where <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
was ever bidden to any table and refuſed. If a Phariſee, if a Publican in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
him, he made not dainty to goe. Not for the pleaſure of the diſhes;
what was that to him, who began his work in a whole Lent of dayes? But
(as it was his meat and drink to doe the will of his Father) for the benefit of
ſo winning a converſation. If he ſate with ſinners, he converted them; if
with converts, he confirmed and inſtructed them; if with the poor, he fed
them; if with the rich in ſubſtance, he made them richer in grace. At whoſe
board did he ever ſit, and left not his hoſt a gainer? The poor Bridegroom
entertains him, and hath his water-pots fill'd with Wine. <hi>Simon</hi> the Phariſee
entertains him, and hath his table honoured with the publick remiſſion of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
a penitent ſinner, with the heavenly doctrine of remiſſion. <hi>Zachaeus</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
him; Salvation came that day to his houſe, with the Author of it. That
preſence made the Publican a Son of <hi>Abraham. Matthew</hi> is recompenſed for
his feaſt with an Apoſtleſhip. <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> entertain him, and beſides Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
inſtruction receive their Brother from the dead. O Saviour, whether
thou feaſt us or we feaſt thee, in both of them is Bleſſedneſs.</p>
                  <p>Where a Publican is the Feaſt-maſter, it is no marvel if the gueſts be
Publicans and ſinners. Whether they came alone out of the hope of that
mercy which they ſaw their fellow had found; or whether <hi>Matthew</hi> invited
them to be partners of that plentiful grace whereof he had taſted, I inquire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
not. Publicans and ſinners will flock together; the one hateful for their
trade, the other for their vicious life. Common contempt hath wrought
them to an unanimity, and ſends them to ſeek mutual comfort in that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
which all others held loathſome and contagious. Moderate corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
humbleth and ſhameth the offender: whereas a cruel ſeverity makes
men deſperate, and drives them to thoſe courſes whereby they are more
dangerouſly infected. How many have gone into the priſon faulty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
flagitious? If Publicans were not ſinners, they were no whit behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to their neighbours.</p>
                  <p>What a table-full was here? The Son of God beſet with Publicans and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
O happy Publicans and ſinners, that had found out their Saviour! O
merciful Saviour, that diſdained not Publicans and ſinners!</p>
                  <p>What ſinner can fear to kneel before thee, when he ſees Publicans
and ſinners ſit with thee? Who can fear to be deſpiſed of thy meekneſs
and mercy, which didſt not abhorre to converſe with the outcaſts of men?
Thou didſt not deſpiſe the Thief confeſſing upon the Croſs, nor the
ſinner weeping upon thy feet, nor the Canaanite crying to thee in the way,
nor the bluſhing Adultereſs, nor the odious Publican, nor the forſwearing
Diſciple, nor the perſecutor of Diſciples, nor thine own executioners:
how can we be unwelcome to thee, if we come with tears in our eyes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
faith in our hearts, reſtitution in our hands? O Saviour, our breaſts are
too oft ſhut upon thee; thy boſome is ever open to us. We are as great
ſinners as the conſorts of theſe Publicans; why ſhould we deſpair of a room
at thy Table?</p>
                  <p>The ſquint-eyed Phariſees look a-croſs at all the actions of Chriſt: where
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44233:36"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they ſhould have admired his Mercy, they cavil at his Holineſle; <hi>They ſaid to his
Diſciples, Why eateth your Maſter with Publicans and ſinners?</hi> They durſt not
ſay thus to the Maſter, whoſe anſwer (they knew) would ſoon have convinced
them: This winde (they hoped) might ſhake the weak faith of the Diſciples.
They ſpeak where they may be moſt likely to hurt. All the crue of Satanical
inſtruments have learnt this craft of their old Tutor in Paradiſe. We cannot
reverence that man whom we think unholy. Chriſt had loſt the hearts of
his followers, if they had entertained the leaſt ſuſpicion of his impurity;
which the murmure of theſe envious Phariſees. would fain inſinuate: <hi>He
cannot be worthy to be followed that is unclean; He cannot but be unclean that</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                     <hi>eateth with Publicans and ſinners.</hi> Proud and fooliſh Phariſees! ye faſt whiles
Chriſt eateth; ye faſt in your houſes whiles Chriſt eateth in other mens;
ye faſt with your own whiles Chriſt feaſts with ſinners: but if ye faſt in pride,
while Chriſt eats in humility; if ye faſt at home for merit or popularity,
while Chriſt feaſts with ſinners for compaſſion, for edification, for converſion,
your faſt is unclean, his feaſt is holy: ye ſhall have your portion with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
when thoſe Publicans and ſinners ſhall be glorious.</p>
                  <p>When theſe cenſurers thought the Diſciples had offended, they ſpeak not
to them but to their Maſter, <hi>Why doe thy Diſciples that which is not lawfull?</hi>
now, when they thought Chriſt offended, they ſpeak not to him, but to the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Diſciples. Thus, like true make-bates, they goe about to make a breach in the
family of Chriſt, by ſetting off the one from the other. The quick eye of
our Saviour hath ſoon eſpied the pack of their fraud, and therefore he takes
the words out of the mouthes of his Diſciples, into his own. They had ſpoke
of Chriſt to the Diſciples: Chriſt anſwers for the Diſciples concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<hi>The whole need not the Phyſician, but the ſick.</hi> According to the two
qualities of pride, ſcorn and over-weening, theſe inſolent Phariſees over-rated
their own holineſſe, contemned the noted unholineſſe of others: As if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
were not tainted with ſecret ſins, as if others could not be cleanſed by
repentance. The ſearcher of hearts meets with their arrogance, and findes
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> thoſe juſticiaries ſinfull, thoſe ſinners juſt. The ſpiritual Phyſician findes
the ſickneſſe of thoſe ſinners wholſome, the health of thoſe Phariſees deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate:
that wholſome, becauſe it calls for the help of the Phyſician; this
deſperate, becauſe it needs not. Every ſoul is ſick; thoſe moſt that feel it
not. Thoſe that feel it, complain; thoſe that complain, have cure: thoſe
that feel it not, ſhall finde themſelves dying ere they can wiſh to recover. O
bleſſed Phyſician, <hi>by</hi> Whoſe <hi>ſtripes we are healed,</hi> by whoſe death we live, happy
are they that are under thy hands, ſick, as of ſin, ſo of ſorrow for ſin. It is as
unpoſſible they ſhould die, as it is unpoſſible for thee to want either skill,
or power, or mercy. Sin hath made us ſick unto death: make thou us but as
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſick of our ſins, we are as ſafe as thou art gracious.</p>

in the ſame violence he caught him not. It was no thank to that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant

his malice; but to the mercifull over-ruling of God, who in a gracious reſpect
to the weakneſs of his poor creatures, limits the ſpightfull attempts of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44233:37"/>
enemy, and takes off this Maſtive, whiles we may take breath. He who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
in his juſtice gives way to ſome onſets of Satan, in his mercy reſtrains them:
ſo regarding our deſervings, that withall he regards our ſtrength. If way ſhould
be given to that malicious ſpirit, we could not ſubſiſt: no violent thing can
endure; and if Satan might have his will, we ſhould no moment be free. He
can be no more weary of doing evil to us, then God is of doing good. Are we
therefore preſerved from the malignity of theſe powers of darkneſs? <hi>Bleſſed be
our ſtrong Helper, that hath not given us over to be a prey unto their teeth.</hi> Or if
ſome ſcope have been given to that envious one to afflict us, hath it been with
favourable limitations, it is thine only mercy, O God, that hath chained and
muzled up this band-dog, ſo as that he may ſcratch us with his paws, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
pierce us with his fangs. Far, far is this from our deſerts, who had too well
merited a juſt abdication from thy favour and protection, and an interminable
ſeiſure by Satan both in ſoul and body.</p>
                  <p>Neither do I here ſee more matter of thanks to our God, for our immunity
from the external injuries of Satan, then occaſion of ſerious inquiry into his
power over us for the ſpiritual. I ſee ſome that think themſelves ſafe from
this ghoſtly tyranny, becauſe they ſometimes finde themſelves in good moods,
free from the ſuggeſtions of groſs ſins, much more from the commiſſion. Vain
men, that feed themſelves with ſo falſe and frivolous comforts! will they not
ſee Satan, through the juſt permiſſion of God, the ſame to the Soul in mental <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
poſſeſſions, that he is to the body in corporal? The worſt Demoniack hath his
lightſome reſpites; not ever tortured, not ever furious: betwixt whiles he
might look ſoberly, talk ſenſibly, move regularly. It is a wofull comfort that
we ſin not alwaies. There is no Maſter ſo barbarous as to require of his Slave a
perpetual unintermitted toyle; yet, though he ſometimes eat, ſleep, reſt, he
is a vaſſal ſtill. If that Wicked one have drawn us to a cuſtomary perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of evil, and have wrought us to a frequent iteration of the ſame ſin, this is
gage enough for our ſervitude, matter enough for his tyranny and inſultation.
He that would be our Tormenter alwaies, cares onely to be ſometimes our
Tempter.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>The poſſeſſed is bound, as with the inviſible fetters of Satan, ſo with the
material chains of the inhabitants. What can bodily forces prevail againſt
a ſpirit? Yet they endeavour this reſtraint of the man, whether out of charity
or juſtice: Charity, that he might not hurt himſelf; Juſtice, that he might
not hurt others. None do ſo much befriend the Demoniack as thoſe that binde
him. Neither may the ſpiritually poſſeſſed be otherwiſe handled: for though
this act of the enemy be plauſible, and to appearance pleaſant, yet there is
more danger in this dear and ſmiling tyranny. Two ſorts of chains are fit for
outragious ſinners; good laws, unpartiall executions; That they may not
hurt, that they may not be hurt to eternal death.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe iron chains are no ſooner faſt then broken. There was more then an
humane power in this diſruption. It is not hard to conceive the utmoſt of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in this kinde of actions. <hi>Sampſon</hi> doth not break the cords and ropes like
a threed of towe, but God by <hi>Sampſon.</hi> The man doth not break theſe chains,
but the Spirit. How ſtrong is the arm of theſe evil angels! how far tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the ordinary courſe of Nature! They are not called Powers for nothing.
What fleſh &amp; blood could but tremble at the palpable inequality of this match!
if herein the mercifull protection of our God did not the rather magnifie it ſelf,
that ſo much ſtrength met with ſo much malice hath not prevailed againſt us.
In ſpight of both we are in ſafe hands. He that ſo eaſily brake the iron fetters,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
can never break the adamantine chain of our Faith. In vain do the chafing bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
of Hell beat upon that Rock whereon we are built. And though theſe
brittle chains of earthly metall be eaſily broken by him, yet the ſure-tempered
chain of God's eternal Decree he can never break: that Almighty Arbiter
of Heaven and Earth and Hell hath chained him up in the bottomleſſe pit,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44233:37"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and hath ſo reſtrained his malice, that (but for our good) we cannot be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted;
we cannot be foiled, but for a glorious victory.</p>
                  <p>Alas! it is no otherwiſe with the ſpiritually poſſeſſed. The chains of reſtraint
are commonly broken by the fury of wickedneſs. What are the reſpects of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
fear of God, fear of men, wholſome laws, carefull executions, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately
licentious, but as cobwebs to an hornet? Let theſe wilde Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacks
know that God hath provided chains for them that will hold, even
<hi>everlaſting chains under darkneſs.</hi> Theſe are ſuch as muſt hold the Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
(their maſters) unto the judgment of the great Day; how much more
thoſe impotent vaſſals? Oh that men would ſuffer themſelves to be bound to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their good behaviour, by the ſweet and eaſie recognizances of their duty to
their God, and the care of their own Souls, that ſo they might rather be bound
up in the bundle of life.</p>
                  <p>It was not for reſt that theſe chains were torn off, but for more motion. This
priſoner runs away from his friends, he cannot run away from his Jaylor. He is
now carried into the Wilderneſſe; not by mere external force, but by internal
impulſion: carried by the ſame power that unbound him, for the opportunity
of his Tyranny, for the horrour of the place, for the affamiſhment of his body,
for the avoidance of all means of reſiſtance. Solitary Deſarts are the delights
of Satan. It is an unwiſe zeal that moves us to doe that to our ſelves in an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of merit and holineſſe, which the Devil wiſhes to doe to us for a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and conveniency of tentation. The evil Spirit is for ſolitarineſſe: God is
for ſociety; <hi>He dwels in the aſſembly of his Saints, yea there he hath a delight to
dwell.</hi> Why ſhould not we account it our happineſſe that we may have leave
to dwell where the Author of all Happineſſe loves to dwell?</p>
                  <p>There cannot be any miſery incident unto us, whereof our gracious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
is not both conſcious and ſenſible. Without any intreaty therefore of
the miſerable Demoniack, or ſuit of any friend, the <hi>God of ſpirits</hi> takes pity of
his diſtreſſe; and from no motion but his own, commands the evil Spirit to
come out of the man. Oh admirable precedent of mercy, preventing our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> exceeding our thoughts, forcing favours upon our impotence, doing
that for us which we ſhould, and yet cannot deſire! If men upon our inſtant ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations
would give us their beſt aide, it were a juſt praiſe of their bounty:
but it well became thee, O God of mercy, to goe without force, to give with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſuit. And do we think thy goodneſs is impaired by thy glory? If thou
wert thus commiſerative upon earth, art thou leſſe in Heaven? How doſt thou
now take notice of all our complaints, of all our infirmities? How doth thine
infinite pity take order to redreſs them? What evil can befall us which thou
knoweſt not, feeleſt not, relieveſt not? How ſafe are we that have ſuch a
Guardian, ſuch a Mediator in Heaven?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Not long before had our Saviour commanded the windes and waters, and
they could not but obey him: now he ſpeaks in the ſame language to the evil
Spirit: he intreats not, he perſwades not; he commands. Command argues
Superiority. He only is infinitely ſtronger then the ſtrong one in poſſeſſion.
Elſe, where powers are matcht, though with ſome inequality, they tugge for
the victory, and without reſiſtance yield nothing. There are no fewer ſorts of

old <hi>Satanian</hi> hereticks, and the preſent <hi>Indian</hi> Savages, ſacrificing to him that
he hurt not: Others by covenant, conditioning their ſervice upon his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
as Witches and Magicians: Others by inſinuation of implicite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> as Charmers and Figure-caſters: Others by adjuration, as the ſons of
<hi>Scaeva</hi> and modern Exorciſts, unwarrantably charging him by an higher name
then their own. None ever offered to deal with Satan by a direct and primary
command but the God of Spirits. The great Archangel, when the ſtrife was
about the body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> commanded not, but imprecated rather, <hi>The Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
thee, Satan.</hi> It is only the God that made this Spirit an Angel of light,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44233:38"/>
that can command him now that he hath made himſelf the Prince of darkneſs.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
If any created power dare to uſurp a word of command, he laughs at their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption;
and knows them his vaſſals, whom he diſſembles to fear as his
Lords. It is thou only, O Saviour, at whoſe beck thoſe ſtubborn Principalities
of Hell yield and tremble. No wicked man can be ſo much a ſlave to Satan, as
Satan is to thee. The interpoſition of thy grace may defeat that dominion of
Satan: thy rule is abſolute, and capable of no lett. What need we to fear,
whiles we are under ſo omnipotent a Commander? The waves of the deep
rage horribly; yet the Lord is ſtronger then they. Let thoſe Principalities and
Powers doe their worſt: Thoſe mighty adverſaries are under the command of
him who loved us ſo well as to bleed for us. What can we now doubt of? His <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
power, or his will? How can we profeſſe him a God, and doubt of his power?
How can we profeſſe him a Saviour, and doubt of his will? He both can and
will command thoſe Infernal powers. We are no leſſe ſafe then they are
malicious.</p>
                  <p>The Devil ſaw <hi>Jeſus</hi> by the eyes of the Demoniack: for the ſame ſaw that
ſpake: but it was the ill ſpirit that ſaid, <hi>I beſecch thee torment me not.</hi> It was
ſore againſt his will that he ſaw ſo dreadfull an object. The over-ruling power
of Chriſt dragged the ſoul ſpirit into his preſence. Guiltineſs would fain keep
out of ſight. The limmes of ſo wofull an head ſhall once call on the Hills
and Rocks to hide them from the face of the Lamb: ſuch Lion-like terrour is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
in that milde face, when it looks upon wickedneſs. Neither ſhall it be one day
the leaſt part of the torment of the damned, to ſee the moſt lovely ſpectacle
that Heaven can afford. He from whom they fled in his offers of Grace, ſhall
be ſo much more terrible, as he was and is more gracious. I marvel not
therefore that the Devil, when he ſaw <hi>Jeſus,</hi> cried out. I could marvell that
he fell down, that he worſhipped him. That which the proud ſpirit would
have had Chriſt to have done to him in his great Duell, the ſame he now doth
unto Chriſt, fearfully, ſervilely, forcedly. Who ſhall henceforth brag of the
external homage he performs to the Son of God, when he ſees Satan himſelf
fall down and worſhip? What comfort can there be in that which is common <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
to us with Devils; who as they believe and tremble, ſo they tremble and
worſhip? The outward bowing is the body of the action; the diſpoſition of
the Soul is the ſoul of it: therein lies the difference from the counterfeit ſtoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings
of wicked men and ſpirits. The religious heart <hi>ſerves the Lord in fear,
and rejoices in him with trembling.</hi> What it doth is in way of ſervice: In ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to his Lord, whoſe Soveraignty is his comfort and protection: in the fear
of a ſon, not of a ſlave; in fear tempered with joy; in a joy, but allayed with
trembling: whereas the proſtration of wicked men and Devils is only an act
of form, or of force; as to their Judge, as to their tormentor, not as to their
Lord; in mere ſervility, not in reverence; in an uncomfortable dulneſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
all delight; in a perfect horror, without capacity of joy. Theſe worſhip
without thanks, becauſe they fall down without the true affections of worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Whoſo marvels to ſee the Devil upon his knees, would much more marvel
to hear what came from his mouth, <hi>Jeſu, the Son of the moſt high God.</hi> A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
which if we ſhould hear without the name of the Author, we ſhould
ask from what Saint it came. Behold the ſame name given to Chriſt by the
Devil, which was formerly given him by the Angel, <hi>Thou ſhalt call his name
Jeſus.</hi> That awfull name whereat every knee ſhall bow, in Heaven, in earth
and under the earth, is called upon by this proſtrate Devil. And leſt that
ſhould not import enough, (ſince others have been honoured by this name in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
Type,) he addes for full diſtinction, <hi>The Son of the moſt high God.</hi> The good
<hi>Syrophenician</hi> and blind <hi>Bartimaeus</hi> could ſay, <hi>The Son of David.</hi> It was well
to acknowledge the true deſcent of his pedigree according to the fleſh: but this
infernall Spirit looks aloft, and fetcheth his line out of the higheſt Heavens,
<hi>The Son of the moſt high God.</hi> The famous confeſſion of the prime Apoſtle
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44233:38"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>(which honoured him with a new name to immortality,) was no other then,
<hi>Thou art the Chriſt, the Son of the living God:</hi> and what other do I hear from
the lips of a fiend? None more Divine words could fall from the higheſt Saint.
Nothing hinders but that the verieſt miſcreant on earth, yea the fouleſt Devil
in Hell, may ſpeak holily. It is no paſſing of judgment upon looſe ſentences.
So <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould have been caſt for a Satan, in denying, forſwearing, curſing; and
the Devil ſhould have been ſet up for a Saint, in confeſſing <hi>Jeſus the Son of
the moſt high God.</hi> Fond hypocrite, that pleaſeſt thy ſelf in talking well, heare
this Devil; and when thou canſt ſpeak better then he, look to fare better:
but in the mean time know, that a ſmooth tongue and a foul heart carries away
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> double judgments.</p>
                  <p>Let curious heads diſpute whether the Devil knew Chriſt to be God. In this
I dare believe himſelf, though in nothing elſe: he knew what he believed, what
he believed that he confeſſed, <hi>Jeſus the Son of the moſt high God.</hi> To the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
of thoſe ſemi-Chriſtians, that have either held doubtfully, or ignorantly
miſ-known, or blaſphemouſly denied what the very Devils have profeſſed.
How little can a bare ſpeculation avail us in theſe caſes of Divinity? So far this
Devil hath attained, to no eaſe, no comfort. <hi>Knowledge</hi> alone doth but <hi>puffe
up;</hi> it is our <hi>love</hi> that <hi>edifies.</hi> If there be not a ſenſe of our ſure intereſt in
this <hi>Jeſus,</hi> a power to apply his merits and obedience, we are no whit the ſafer,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> no whit the better; only we are ſo much the wiſer, to underſtand who ſhall
condemn us.</p>
                  <p>This piece of the clauſe was ſpoken like a Saint, <hi>Jeſus, the Son of the moſt
high God:</hi> the other piece like a Devil, <hi>What have I to doe with thee?</hi> If the
diſclamation were univerſall, the latter words would impugne the former: for
whiles he confeſſes <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be the Son of the moſt high God, he withall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes
his own inevitable ſubjection. Wherefore would he beſeech, if he were
not obnoxious? He cannot, he dare not ſay, <hi>What haſt thou to doe with me?</hi> but,
<hi>What have I to doe with thee?</hi> Others indeed I have vexed, thee I fear. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
then of any violence, of any perſonal provocation, <hi>What have I to doe with</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                     <hi>thee?</hi> And doſt thou ask, O thou evil ſpirit? what haſt thou to doe with
Chriſt, whiles thou vexeſt a ſervant of Chriſt? Haſt thou thy name from
knowledge, and yet ſo miſtakeſt him whom thou confeſſeſt, as if nothing could
be done to him but what immediately concerns his own perſon? Hear that
great and juſt Judge ſentencing upon his dreadfull Tribunal; <hi>Inaſmuch as thou
didſt it unto one of theſe little ones, thou didſt it unto me.</hi> It is an idle miſpriſion
to ſever the ſenſe of an injury done to any of the Members from the Head.</p>
                  <p>He that had humility enough to kneel to the Son of God, hath boldneſſe
enough to expoſtulate, <hi>Art thou come to torment us before our time?</hi> Whether
it were that Satan, who uſeth to enjoy the torment of ſinners, whoſe muſick
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> it is to hear our ſhrieks and gnaſhings, held it no ſmall piece of his torment
to be reſtrained in the exerciſe of his tyranny: or whether the very preſence
of Chriſt were his rack; for the guilty ſpirit projecteth terrible things, and
cannot behold the Judge or the executioner without a renovation of horrour:
or whether that (as himſelf profeſſeth) he were now in a fearfull expectation
of being commanded down into the deep, for a further degree of actual tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which he thus deprecates.</p>
                  <p>There are tortures appointed to the very ſpiritual natures of evil Angels.
Men that are led by Senſe, have eaſily granted the body ſubject to torment,
who yet have not ſo readily conceived this incident to a ſpiritual ſubſtance.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> The Holy Ghoſt hath not thought it fit to acquaint us with the particular
manner of theſe inviſible acts, rather willing that we ſhould herein fear then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
But as all matters of Faith, though they cannot be proved by Reaſon,
(for that they are in a higher ſphere) yet afford an anſwer able to ſtop the
mouth of all Reaſon that dares bark againſt them, (ſince truth cannot be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to it ſelf;) ſo this of the ſufferings of Spirits. There is therefore both an
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44233:39"/>
intentional torment incident to Spirits, and a reall. For, as in Bleſſedneſs the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
good Spirits finde themſelves joyned unto the chief good; and hereupon feel
a perfect love of God, and unſpeakable joy in him, and reſt in themſelves: ſo
contrarily, the evil Spirits perceive themſelves eternally excluded from the
preſence of God, and ſee themſelves ſetled in a wofull darkneſs; and from the
ſenſe of this ſeparation ariſes an horrour not to be expreſſed, not to be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
How many men have we known to torment themſelves with their own
thoughts? There needs no other gibbet then that which their troubled ſpirit
hath erected in their own heart. And if ſome pains begin at the Body, and
from thence afflict the Soul in a copartnerſhip of grief; yet others ariſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from the Soul, and draw the Body into a participation of miſery.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
Why may we not therefore conceive mere and ſeparate Spirits capable of ſuch
an inward excruciation?</p>
                  <p>Beſides which, I hear the Judge of men and Angels ſay, <hi>Goe ye curſed into
everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels:</hi> I hear the Prophet ſay,
<hi>Tophet is prepared of old.</hi> If with fear and without curioſity we may look upon
thoſe flames, why may we not attribute a ſpiritual nature to that more then
natural fire? In the end of the world the Elements ſhall be diſſolved by fire:
and if the pure quinteſſential matter of the skie, and the element of fire it ſelf
ſhall be diſſolved by fire, then that laſt fire ſhall be of another nature then that
which it conſumeth. What hinders then but that the Omnipotent God hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
from eternity created a fire of another nature proportionable even to Spiritual
eſſences? Or why may we not diſtinguiſh of fire, as it is it ſelf, a bodily crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and as it is an inſtrument of Gods juſtice, ſo working not by any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
virtue or power of its own, but by a certain height of ſupernatural effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,
to which it is exalted by the Omnipotence of that ſupreme and righteous
Judge? Or laſtly, why may we not conceive that though Spirits have nothing
material in their nature which that fire ſhould work upon, yet by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Almighty Arbiter of the world, juſtly willing their torment, they
may be made moſt ſenſible of pain, and, by the obedible ſubmiſſion of their
created nature, wrought upon immediately by their appointed tortures; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
the very horrour which ariſeth from the place whereto they are ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly
confined? For if the incorporeal Spirits of living men may be held
in a lothed or painful body, and conceive ſorrow to be ſo impriſoned; why
may we not as eaſily yield that the evil ſpirits of Angels or men may be held
in thoſe direfull flames, and much more abhor therein to continue for ever?
Tremble rather, O my Soul, at the thought of this wofull condition of the
evil Angels; who, for one onely act of Apoſtaſie from God, are thus perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
tormented: whereas we ſinfull wretches multiply many and preſumptuous
offences againſt the Majeſty of our God. And withall admire and magnifie that
infinite Mercy to the miſerable generation of man, which after this holy ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
of juſtice to the revolted Angels, ſo graciouſly forbears our hainous ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,
and both ſuffers us to be free for the time from theſe helliſh torments,
and gives us opportunity of a perfect freedome from them for ever. <hi>Praiſe the
Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within me praiſe his holy Name, who forgiveth all
thy ſins, and healeth all thine infirmities; who redeemeth thy life from deſtruction,
and crowneth thee with mercy and compaſsions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no time wherein the evil ſpirits are not tormented: there is a time
wherein they exſpect to be tormented yet more. <hi>Art thou come to torment us
before our time?</hi> They knew that the laſt Aſſiſes are the prefixed terme of their
full execution; which they alſo underſtood to be not yet come. For though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
they knew not when the Day of Judgement ſhould be; (a point concealed from
the glorious Angels of Heaven) yet they knew when it ſhould not be: and
therefore they ſay, <hi>Before the time.</hi> Even the very evil ſpirits confeſſe, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
attend a ſet day of univerſal Seſſions. They believe leſſe then Devils, that
either doubt of or deny that day of finall retribution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:44233:39"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Oh the wonderfull mercy of our God, that both to wicked men and ſpirits
reſpites the utmoſt of their torment! He might upon the firſt inſtant of the
fall of Angels have inflicted on them the higheſt extremity of his vengeance:
He might upon the firſt ſins of our youth (yea of our nature) have ſwept us
away, and given us our portion in that fierie lake. He ſtaies a time for both:
though with this difference of mercy to us men, that here not onely is a delay,
but may be an utter prevention of puniſhment, which to the evil ſpirits is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
impoſſible. They do ſuffer, they muſt ſuffer: and though they have
now deſerved to ſuffer all they muſt, yet they muſt once ſuffer more then
they do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Yet ſo doth this evil ſpirit expoſtulate, that he ſues, <hi>I beſeech thee, torment me
not.</hi> The world is well changed ſince Satan's firſt onſet upon Chriſt. Then
he could ſay, <hi>If thou be the Son of God;</hi> now, <hi>Jeſu, the Son of the moſt high
God:</hi> then, <hi>All theſe will I give thee if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me;</hi> now,
<hi>I beſeech thee, torment me not.</hi> The ſame power, when he liſts, can change the
note of the Tempter to us. How happy are we that have ſuch a Redeemer as
can command the Devils to their chains? Oh conſider this, ye lawleſſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
that have ſaid, <hi>Let us break his bonds, and caſt his cords from us.</hi> However
the Almighty ſuffers you for a judgement to have free ſcope to evil, and ye can
now impotently reſiſt the revealed will of your Creator, yet the time ſhall
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> come when ye ſhall ſee the very maſters whom ye have ſerved (the powers of
darkneſs) unable to avoid the revenges of God. How much leſſe ſhall man
ſtrive with his Maker? man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, whoſe houſe is
clay, whoſe foundation is the duſt?</p>
                  <p>Nature teaches every creature to wiſh a freedome from pain. The fouleſt
ſpirits cannot but love themſelves; and this love muſt needs produce a depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of evil. Yet what a thing is this, to hear the Devil at his prayers? <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
thee, torment me not.</hi> Devotion is not guilty of this, but fear. There is no
grace in the ſuit of Devils, but nature; no reſpect of Glory to their Creator,
but their own eaſe. They cannot pray againſt ſin, but againſt torment for ſin.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> What news is it now to hear the profaneſt mouth in extremity imploring the
Sacred Name of God, when the Devils do ſo? The worſt of all creatures hates
puniſhment, and can ſay, <hi>Lead me not into pain:</hi> onely the good heart can ſay,
<hi>Lead me not into temptation.</hi> If we can as heartily pray againſt ſin, for the avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of diſpleaſure, as againſt puniſhment, when we have diſpleaſed, there is
true Grace in the Soul. Indeed, if we could fervently pray againſt Sin, we
ſhould not need to pray againſt Puniſhment, which is no other then the inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
ſhadow of that body: but if we have not laboured againſt our Sins, in
vain do we pray againſt Puniſhment. God muſt be juſt; and <hi>the wages of ſin is
death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> It pleaſed our Holy Saviour, not only to let fall words of command upon
this ſpirit, but to interchange ſome ſpeeches with him. All Chriſt's actions
are not for example. It was the errour of our Grandmother to hold chat with
Satan. That God, who knows the craft of that old Serpent and our weak ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
hath charged us not to enquire of an evil ſpirit. Surely if the Diſciples
returning to <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Well wondred to ſee Chriſt talk with a woman, well
may we wonder to ſee him talking with an unclean Spirit. Let it be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
O Saviour, to ask upon what grounds thou didſt this wherein we
may not follow thee. We know that ſin was excepted in thy conformity of
thy ſelf to us: we know there was no guile found in thy mouth, no poſſibility
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of taint in thy nature, in thine actions: neither is it hard to conceive how the
ſame thing may be done by thee without ſin, which we cannot but ſin in doing.
There is a vaſt difference in the intention, in the Agent. For on the one ſide,
thou didſt not ask the name of the ſpirit as one that knew not, and would learn
by inquiring; but that by the confeſſion of that miſchief which thou pleaſedſt
to ſuffer, the grace of the Cure might be the more conſpicuous, the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44233:40"/>
So on the other, God and man might doe that ſafely which mere man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
cannot doe without danger. Thou mighteſt touch the Leproſie, and not be
legally unclean, becauſe thou touchedſt it to heal it, didſt not touch it with poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of infection. So mighteſt thou, who, by reaſon of the perfection of thy
Divine nature, wert uncapable of any ſtain by the interlocution with Satan,
ſafely conferre with him, whom corrupt man, pre-diſpoſed to the danger of
ſuch a parlee, may not meddle with without ſin, becauſe not without perill.
It is for none but God to hold diſcourſe with Satan. Our ſureſt way is to have
as little to doe with that Evil one as we may; and if he ſhall offer to maintain
conference with us by his ſecret Tentations, to turn our ſpeech unto our God,
with the Archangel, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee, Satan.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was the preſuppoſition of him that knew it, that not onely men but ſpirits
have names. This then he asks, not out of an ignorance or curioſity; nothing
could be hid from him who calleth the Stars and all the hoaſts of Heaven by
their names: but out of a juſt reſpect to the glory of the Miracle he was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
whereto the notice of the name would not a little avail. For if without
inquiry or confeſſion our Saviour had ejected this evil ſpirit, it had paſſed for
the ſingle diſpoſſeſſion of one onely Devil; whereas now it appears there was
a combination and helliſh champertie in theſe powers of darkneſſe, which were
all forced to vaile unto that Almighty command.</p>
                  <p>Before, the Devil had ſpoken ſingularly of himſelf, <hi>What have I to doe with</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                     <hi>thee?</hi> and, <hi>I beſeech thee torment me not.</hi> Our Saviour yet, knowing that there
was a multitude of Devils lurking in that breaſt, who diſſembled their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
wreſts it out of the Spirit by this interrogation, <hi>What is thy name?</hi> Now
can thoſe wicked ones no longer hide themſelves: He that asked the queſtion,
forced the anſwer. <hi>My name is Legion.</hi> The author of diſcord hath borrowed
a name of war: from that military order of diſcipline by which the Jews were
ſubdued doth the Devil fetch his denomination, They were many, yet they
ſay, <hi>My name,</hi> not, <hi>Our name;</hi> though many, they ſpeak as one, they act as
one, in this poſſeſſion. There is a marvellous accordance even betwixt evil
ſpirits. That Kingdome is not divided, for then it could not ſtand. I wonder <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
not that wicked men do ſo conſpire in evil, that there is ſuch unanimity in the
broachers and abettors of errors, when I ſee thoſe Devils, which are many in
ſubſtance, are one in name, action, habitation. Who can too much brag of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
when it is incident unto wicked ſpirits? All the praiſe of concord is in the
ſubject: if that be holy, the conſent is Angelical; if ſinfull, deviliſh.</p>
                  <p>What a fearfull advantage have our ſpiritual enemies againſt us? If armed
troops come againſt ſingle ſtraglers, what hope is there of life, of victory?
How much doth it concern us to band our hearts together in a communion
of Saints? Our enemies come upon us like a torrent: Oh let us not run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder
like drops in the duſt. All our united forces will be little enough to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
make head againſt this league of deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Legion</hi> imports Order, number, conflict. Order, in that there is a diſtinction
of regiment, a ſubordination of Officers. Though in Hell there be confuſion of
faces, yet not confuſion of degrees. Number: Thoſe that have reckoned a
Legion at the loweſt, have counted it ſix thouſand: others have more then
doubled it. Though here it is not ſtrict, but figurative, yet the letter of it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
multitude. How fearfull is the conſideration of the number of Apoſtate
Angels? And if a Legion can attend one man, how many muſt we needs think
are they, who all the world over are at hand to the puniſhment of the wicked,
the exerciſe of the good, the tentation of both? It cannot be hoped there can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
be any place or time wherein we may be ſecure from the onſets of theſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Be ſure, ye lewd men, ye ſhall want no furtherance to evil, no torment
for evil. Be ſure, ye godly, ye ſhall not want combatants to trie your ſtrength
and skill. Awaken your courages to reſiſt, and ſtir up your hearts, make ſure
the means of your ſafety. There are more with us then againſt us. The God
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44233:40"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of Heaven is with us, if we be with him: and our Angels behold the face of
God. If every Devil were a Legion, we are ſafe. <hi>Though we walk through the
valley of the ſhadow of death, we ſhall fear no evil.</hi> Thou, O Lord, ſhalt ſtretch
forth thine hand againſt the wrath of our enemies, and thy right hand ſhall
ſave us.</p>
                  <p>Conflict. All this number is not for ſight, for reſt; but for motion, for acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Neither was there ever hour ſince the firſt blow given to our firſt Parents,
wherein there was ſo much as a truce betwixt theſe adverſaries. As therefore
ſtrong frontier Towns, when there is a peace concluded on both parts, break
up their garriſon, open their gates, neglect their Bulwarks; but when they hear
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of the enemy muſtering his forces in great and unequal numbers, then they dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
their guard, keep Sentinell, repair their Sconces: ſo muſt we, upon the
certain knowledge of our numerous and deadly enemies in continual aray againſt
us, addreſſe our ſelves alwaies to a wary and ſtrong reſiſtance. I do not obſerve
the moſt to think of this ghoſtly hoſtility. Either they do not find there are Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
or thoſe Tentations hurtful; they ſee no worſe then themſelves: and
if they feel motions of evil ariſing in them, they impute it to fancy, or unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
appetite, to no power but Nature's; and thoſe motions they follow
without ſenſible hurt, neither ſee they what harm it is to ſin. Is it any marvell
that carnal eyes cannot diſcern ſpiritual Objects? that the World, who is the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> friend, the vaſſal of Satan, is in no war with him? <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s ſervant, when his
eyes were opened, ſaw troops of ſpiritual ſouldiers, which before he diſcerned
not. If the eyes of our Souls be once enlightned by ſupernatural knowledge and
the clear beams of Faith, we ſhall as plainly deſcry the inviſible powers of
wickedneſſe, as now our bodily eyes ſee Heaven and Earth. They are, though
we ſee them not: we cannot be ſafe from them, if we do not acknowledge, not
oppoſe them.</p>
                  <p>The Devils are now become great ſuitors to Chriſt; That he would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them into the deep; that he would permit their entrance into the ſwine.
What is this deep but hell, both for the utter ſeparation from the face of God,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and for the impoſſibility of paſſage to the region of Reſt and Glory? The very
evil ſpirits then fear and expect a further degree of torment; they know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
reſerved in thoſe chains of darkneſſe for the judgment of the great Day.
There is the ſame wages due to their ſins &amp; to ours; neither are the wages paid
till the work be done. They tempting men to ſin, muſt needs ſin grievouſly in
tempting; as with us men thoſe that miſlead into ſin offend more then the
actors. Not till the upſhot therefore of their wickedneſſe ſhall they receive
the full meaſure of their condemnation. This <hi>day,</hi> this <hi>deep</hi> they tremble at:
what ſhall I ſay of thoſe men that fear it not? It is hard for men to believe
their own unbelief. If they were perſwaded of this fiery dungeon, this bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> deep, wherein every ſin ſhall receive an horrible portion with the damned,
durſt they ſtretch forth their hands to wickedneſſe? No man will put his hand
into a fiery Crucible to fetch gold thence, becauſe he knows it will burn him.
Did we as truly believe the everlaſting burning of that infernal fire, we durſt
not offer to fetch Pleaſures or Profits out of the midſt of thoſe flames.</p>
                  <p>This degree of torment they grant in Chriſt's power to command; they
knew his power unreſiſtible: had he therefore but ſaid, <hi>Back to hell whence ye
came,</hi> they could no more have ſtai'd upon earth, then they can now climbe into
Heaven. O the wonderfull diſpenſation of the Almighty, who though he
could command all the evil ſpirits down to their dungeons in an inſtant, ſo as
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> they ſhould have no more opportunity of Temptation, yet thinks fit to retain
them upon earth! It is not out of weakneſſe, or improvidence of that Divine
hand, that wicked ſpirits tyrannize here upon earth; but out of the moſt wiſe
and moſt holy ordination of God, who knows how to turn evil into good, how
to fetch good out of evil, and by the worſt inſtruments to bring about his moſt
juſt decrees. Oh that we could adore that awfull and infinite power, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44233:41"/>
chearfully caſt our ſelves upon that Providence which keeps the Keyes even <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
of Hell it ſelf, and either lets out, or returns the Devils to their places.</p>
                  <p>Their other ſuit hath ſome marvell in moving it, more in the grant; <hi>That
they might be ſuffered to enter into the Herd of Swine.</hi> It was their ambition
of ſome miſchief that brought forth this deſire: that ſince they might not
vex the body of man, they might yet afflict men in their goods. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of theſe envious ſpirits reacheth from us to ours: It is ſore againſt their
wills if we be not every way miſerable. If the Swine were Legally unclean for
the uſe of the table, yet they were naturally good. Had not Satan known them
uſefull for man, he had never deſired their ruine. But as Fencers will ſeem to
fetch a blow at the leg, when they intend it at the head; ſo doth this Devil,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
whiles he drives at the Swine, he aimes at the Souls of theſe <hi>Gadarens:</hi> by
this means he hoped well (and his hope was not vain) to work in theſe <hi>Gerge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens</hi>
a diſcontentment at Chriſt, an unwillingneſſe to entertain him, a deſire
of his abſence; he meant to turn them into Swine by the loſſe of their Swine.
It was not the rafters or ſtones of the houſe of <hi>Job</hi>'s children that he bore the
grudge to, but to the owners; nor to the lives of the children ſo much, as the
Soul of their Father. There is no Affliction wherein he doth not ſtrike at the
heart; which whiles it holds free, all other damages are light: but <hi>a wounded
ſpirit</hi> (whether with ſin or ſorrow) <hi>who can bear?</hi> Whatever becomes of
goods or limmes, happy are we if (like wiſe ſouldiers) we guard the vital <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
parts. Whiles the Soul is kept ſound from impatience, from diſtruſt, our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
may afflict us, he cannot hurt us.</p>
                  <p>They ſue for a ſufferance; not daring other then to grant that without the
permiſſion of Chriſt they could not hurt a very Swine. If it be fearfull to think
how great things evil ſpirits can doe with permiſſion; it is comfortable to
think how nothing they can doe without permiſſion. We know they want
not malice to deſtroy the whole frame of God's work; but of all, man; of all
men, Chriſtians: but if without leave they cannot ſet upon an Hog, what
can they doe to the living Images of their Creator? They cannot offer us
ſo much as a ſuggeſtion without the permiſſion of our Saviour. And can he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
that would give his own moſt precious blood for us, to ſave us from evil, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
give us over to evil?</p>
                  <p>It is no news that wicked ſpirits wiſh to do miſchief: it is news that they
are allowed it. If the owner of all things ſhould ſtand upon his abſolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
who can challenge him for what he thinks fit to doe with his creature?
The firſt Fole of the Aſſe is commanded under the Law to have his neck bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
What is that to us? The creatures doe that they were made for, if they
may ſerve any way to the glory of their Maker. But ſeldome ever doth God
leave his actions unfurniſhed with ſuch reaſons as our weakneſſe may reach
unto. There were Sects amongſt theſe Jews that denied Spirits. They could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
not be more evidently, more powerfully convinced then by this event. Now
ſhall the <hi>Gadarens</hi> ſee from what a multitude of Devils they were delivered;
and how eaſie it had been for the ſame power to have allowed theſe Spirits
to ſeize upon their Perſons as well as their Swine. Neither did God this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a juſt purpoſe of their caſtigation. His Judgements are righteous, where
they are moſt ſecret. Though we cannot accuſe theſe inhabitants of ought,
yet he could; and thought good thus to mulct them. And if they had not
wanted Grace to acknowledge it, it was no ſmall favour of God that he
would puniſh them in their Swine, for that which he might have avenged
upon their Bodies and Souls. Our Goods are furtheſt off us: If but in theſe we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
ſmart, we muſt confeſſe to finde mercy.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it pleaſeth God to grant the ſuits of wicked men and ſpirits, in
no favour to the ſuitors. He grants an ill ſuit, and withholds a good: He
grants an ill ſuit in Judgement, and holds back a good one in Mercy. The
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> ask meat; he gives Quailes to their mouths, and leanneſſe to their
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44233:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Souls. The choſen veſſel wiſhes Satan taken off, and hears only, <hi>My grace is
ſufficient for thee.</hi> We may not evermore meaſure favours by condeſcent.
Theſe Devils doubtleſs receive more puniſhment for that harmfull act where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are heard. If we ask what is either unfit to receive or unlawfull to
beg, it is a great favour of our God to be denied.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe ſpirits which would go into the Swine by permiſſion, go out of the
man by command: they had ſtaied long, and are ejected ſuddenly. The imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
works of God are perfect in an inſtant, and do not require the aid of time
for their maturation.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner are they caſt out of the man, then they are in the Swine. They
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> will loſe no time, but paſſe without intermiſſion from one miſchief to another.
If they hold it a pain not to be doing evil; why is it not our delight to be ever
doing good? The impetuouſneſſe was no leſſe then the ſpeed. <hi>The Herd was
carried with violence from a ſteep-down place into the lake, and was choaked.</hi>
It is no ſmall force that could doe this: but if the Swine had been ſo many
Mountains, theſe ſpirits, upon God's permiſſion, had thus tranſported them.
How eaſily can they carry thoſe Souls which are under their power to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
Unclean beaſts that wallow in the mire of ſenſuality, brutiſh Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards
transforming themſelves by exceſſe, even they are the Swine whom the
Legion carries headlong to the pit of perdition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> The wicked ſpirits have their wiſh; the Swine are choked in the waves.
What eaſe is this to them? Good God, that there ſhould be any creature that
ſeeks contentment in deſtroying, in tormenting the good creatures of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker!
This is the diet of Hell. Thoſe Fiends feed upon ſpight towards man,
ſo much more as he doth more reſemble his Creator; towards all other living
ſubſtances, ſo much more as they may be more uſefull to man. The Swine ran
down violently; what marvell is it if their Keepers fled? That miraculous
work which ſhould have drawn them to Chriſt, drives them from him. They
run with the news; the Country comes in with clamour: <hi>The whole multitude
of the Country about beſought him to depart.</hi> The multitude is a beaſt of many
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> heads; every head hath a ſeveral mouth, and every mouth a ſeveral tongue, and
every tongue a ſeveral accent; every head hath a ſeveral brain, and every brain
thoughts of their own: ſo as it is hard to find a multitude without ſome diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
At leaſt ſeldome ever hath a good motion found a perfect accordance: it is
not ſo infrequent for a multitude to conſpire in evil. Generality of aſſent is no
warrant for any act. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Errour carries away many, who inquire not into the
reaſon of ought, but the practice. The way to Hell is a beaten road through the
many feet that tread it. When Vice grows into faſhion, Singularity is a Vertue.</p>
                  <p>There was not a <hi>Gadarene</hi> found that either dehorted his fellows, or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the motion. It is a ſign of people given up to judgment, when no man makes
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> head againſt projects of evil. Alas! what can one ſtrong man do againſt a
whole throng of wickedneſſe? Yet this good comes of an unprevailing reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
that God forbears to plague, where he findes but a ſprinkling of Faith.
Happy are they who (like unto the celeſtial bodies, which being carried about
with the ſway of the higheſt ſphere, yet creep on their own waies) keep on the
courſes of their own Holineſs, againſt the ſwinge of common corruptions: they
ſhall both deliver their own Souls, and help to withhold judgment from others.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Gadarenes</hi> ſue to Chriſt for his departure. It is too much favour
to attribute this to their modeſty, as if they held themſelves unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of ſo Divine a Gueſt. Why then did they fall upon this ſuit in a time
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of their loſſe? Why did they not taxe themſelves, and intimate a ſecret
deſire of that which they durſt not beg? It is too much rigour to attribute
it to the love of their Hogs, and an anger at their loſſe: then they had not
intreated, but expelled him. It was their fear that moved this harſh ſuit: a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
fear of danger to their perſons, to their goods; leſt he that could ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
command the Devils, ſhould have ſet theſe tormentors upon them; leſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44233:42"/>
their other Demoniacks ſhould be diſpoſſeſſed with like loſſe. I cannot blame <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
theſe <hi>Gadarenes</hi> that they feared. This power was worthy of trembling at.
Their fear was unjuſt: They ſhould have argued, <hi>This man hath power over
men, beaſts, devils, it is good having him to our friend; his preſence is our ſafety
and protection.</hi> Now they contrarily miſ-infer, <hi>Thus powerfull is he, it is good
he were further off.</hi> What miſerable and pernicious miſconſtructions do men
make of God, of Divine Attributes and actions? God is omnipotent, able
to take infinite vengeance of ſin; Oh that he were not: He is provident; I
may be careleſſe: He is merciful; I may ſin: He is holy; Let him depart
from me, for I am a ſinful man. How witty Sophiſters are natural men to deceive
their own Souls, to rob themſelves of a God? O Saviour, how worthy are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
they to want thee, that wiſh to be rid of thee? Thou haſt juſt cauſe to be
weary of us, even whiles we ſue to hold thee: but when once our wretched
unthankfulneſſe grows weary of thee, who can pity us to be puniſhed with thy
departure? Who can ſay it is other then righteous, that thou ſhouldſt regeſt
one day upon us, <hi>Depart from me, ye wicked.</hi>

wherein thy glorified eſtate exceeds thine humbled, as far as Heaven is above

no readier way to loſe Chriſt then to clog him with humane ordinances, then to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
ſpurn at his heavenly inſtructions. He doth not alwaies ſubduce his Spirit with
his viſible preſence; but his very outward withdrawing is worthy of our ſighs,
worthy of our tears. Many a one may ſay, <hi>Lord, if thou hadſt been here, my</hi>
Soul <hi>had not died.</hi> Thou art now with us, O Saviour, thou art with us in a free
and plentifull faſhion; how long, thou knoweſt: we know our deſervings and

No angle is too obſcure for the Goſpel: <hi>the land of Zabulon and the land of

ſtrayed from many. If there be but one <hi>Syrophoenician</hi> ſoul to be gained to
the Church, Chriſt goes to the coaſts of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> to fetch her. Why are
we weary to doe good, when our Saviour underwent this perpetuall toyle in
healing bodies and winning Souls? There is no life happy but that which is

our oblivion; that he may magnifie his mercies by continuing them to thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of the generations of the juſt, and by renewing favours upon the unjuſt.
No Nation carried ſuch brands and ſcars of a Curſe as <hi>Canaan.</hi> To the ſhame of
thoſe careleſſe Jews, even a faithfull <hi>Canaanite</hi> is a ſuppliant to Chriſt, whiles
they neglect ſo great Salvation. She doth not ſpeak, but cry. Need and deſire
have raiſed her voice to an importunate clamour. The God of mercy is light of
hearing; yet he loves a loud and vehement ſolicitation; not to make himſelf <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
inclinable to graunt, but to make us capable to receive bleſſings. They are
words, and not prayers, which fall from careleſſe lips. If we felt our want, or
wanted not deſire, we could ſpeak to God in no tune but cries. If we would
prevail with God, we muſt wreſtle; and if we would wreſtle happily with
God, we muſt wreſtle firſt with our own dulneſſe. Nothing but cries can
pierce Heaven. Neither doth her vehemence ſo much argue her Faith, as doth

poſſeſſed childe was ſenſeleſs of her miſery: the parent feels both her ſorrow
and her own. As ſhe was a good woman, ſo a good mother. Grace and good
nature have taught her to appropriate the afflictions of this divided part of her
own fleſh. It is not in the power of another skin, to ſever the intereſt of our
own loyns or womb. We finde ſome fouls that burn themſelves, whiles they
endeavour to blow out the fire from their young. And even Serpents can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their brood into their mouth to ſhield them from danger. No creature is
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſo unnatural, as the reaſonable that hath put off affection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>On me</hi> therefore in mine; <hi>for my Daughter is grievouſly vexed with a Devil.</hi>
It was this that ſent her to Chriſt: It was this that muſt incline Chriſt to her.
I doubt whether ſhe had inquired after Chriſt, if ſhe had not been vexed with
her daughters ſpirit. Our Afflictions are as <hi>Benhadad</hi>'s beſt counſellors, that
ſent him with a cord about his neck to the mercifull King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Theſe are
the files &amp; whetſtones that ſet an edge on our Devotions; without which they
grow dull and ineffectual: neither are they ſtronger motives to our ſuit then
to Chriſt's mercy. We cannot have a better ſpokes-man unto God then our
own miſery. That alone ſues and pleads and importunes for us. This which
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſets off men, whoſe compaſſion is finite, attracts God to us. Who can plead
diſcouragements in his acceſſe to the throne of Grace, when our wants are our
forcible advocates? All our worthineſs is in a capable miſery.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not example the Faith of this <hi>Canaanite;</hi> yet ſhe was thus
tormented in her daughter. It is not the truth or ſtrength of our Faith that
can ſecure us from the outward and bodily vexations of Satan: againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and ſpiritual that can and will prevail: it is no more antidote againſt the
other then againſt feavers and dropſies. How ſhould it, whenas it may fall out
that theſe ſufferings may be profitable? and why ſhould we exſpect that the
love of our God ſhall yield to forelay any benefit to the Soul? He is an ill pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that cannot diſtinguiſh betwixt an affliction and the evil of affliction.
When the meſſenger of Satan buffets us, it is enough that God hath ſaid, <hi>My
grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Millions were in <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> whoſe perſons, whoſe children were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched
with that tormenting hand. I hear none but this faithfull Woman
ſay, <hi>My daughter is grievouſly vexed of the Devil.</hi> The worſt of bodily afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are an inſufficient proof of Divine diſpleaſure. She that hath moſt Grace,
complains of moſt diſcomfort.</p>
                  <p>Who would now expect any other then a kinde anſwer to ſo pious and
faithfull a petition? <hi>And behold, he anſwered her not a word.</hi> O holy Saviour,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> we have oft found cauſe to wonder at thy words, never till now at thy ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
A miſerable ſuppliant cries and ſues, whiles the God of mercies is ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.
He that comforts the afflicted, addes affliction to the comfortleſſe by
a willing diſreſpect. What ſhall we ſay then? Is the fountain of Mercy
dried up? O Saviour, couldſt thou but hear? ſhe did not murmur, not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper,
but cry out; couldſt thou but pity, but regard her that was as good as ſhe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44233:44"/>
was miſerable? If thy ears were open, could thy bowels be ſhut? Certainly it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
was thou that didſt put it into the heart, into the mouth of this woman to ask,
and to ask thus of thy ſelf. She could never have ſaid, <hi>O Lord, thou ſon of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
but from thee, but by thee. <hi>None calleth Jeſus the Lord but by the holy
Ghoſt.</hi> Much more therefore didſt thou hear the words of thine own making;
and well wert thou pleaſed to hear what thou thoughteſt good to forbear to
anſwer. It was thine own grace that ſealed up thy lips.</p>
                  <p>Whether for the triall of her patience and perſeverance, for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſilence carried
a ſemblance of neglect; and a willing neglect laies ſtrong ſiege to the beſt fort
of the Soul. Even calm tempers when they have been ſtirred have bewrayed
impetuouſneſs of Paſſion. If there be any dregs in the bottom of the glaſſe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
when the water is ſhaken they will be ſoon ſeen. Or whether for the more
ſharpning of her deſires, and raiſing of her zealous importunity. Our holy lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings
are increaſed with delaies: it whets our appetite to be held faſting. Or
whether for the more ſweetning of the bleſſing by the difficulty or ſtay of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining.
The benefit that comes with eaſe is eaſily contemned. Long and
eager purſuit endears any favour. Or whether for the ingaging of his Diſciples
in ſo charitable a ſuit. Or whether for the wiſe avoidance of exception from the
captious Jews: or laſtly, for the drawing on of an holy and imitable pattern of
faithfull perſeverance; and to teach us not to meaſure God's hearing of our ſuit
by his preſent anſwer, or his preſent anſwer by our own ſenſe. Whiles our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
weakneſs exſpects thy words, thy wiſdome reſolves upon thy ſilence. Never
wert thou better pleaſed to hear the acclamation of Angels, then to hear this
woman ſay, <hi>O Lord, thou ſon of David:</hi> yet ſilence is thy anſwer. When we
have made our prayers, it is an happy thing to hear the report of them back
from Heaven: but if we alwaies do not ſo, it is not for us to be dejected, and
to accuſe either our infidelity or thy neglect; ſince we finde here a faithfull
ſuitor met with a gracious Saviour, and yet he anſwered her not a word. If we
be poor in ſpirit, God is rich in mercy; he cannot ſend us away empty: yet he
will not alwaies let us feel his condeſcent, croſſing us in our will, that he may
advance our benefit.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was no ſmall fruit of Chriſt's ſilence that the Diſciples were hereupon
moved to pray for her: not for a mere diſmiſſion; it had been no favour to
have required this, but a puniſhment; (for if to be held in ſuſpenſe be miſerable,
to be ſent away with a repulſe is more but for a mercifull grant. They ſaw
much paſſion in the woman, much cauſe of paſſion: they ſaw great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on Chriſt's part, great conſtancy on hers. Upon all theſe, they feel her
miſery, and become ſuitors for her unrequeſted. It is our duty in caſe of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
to intercede for each other; and by how much more familiar we are with
Chriſt, ſo much more to improve our intereſt for the relief of the diſtreſſed.
We are bidden to ſay, <hi>Our Father,</hi> not <hi>mine:</hi> yea, being members of one body,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
we pray for our ſelves in others. If the foot be prickt, the back bends, the head
bows down, the eyes look, the hands ſtir, the tongue calls for aide, the whole
man is in pain and labours for redreſſe. He cannot pray or be heard for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that is no mans friend but his own. No prayer without faith, no faith
without charity, no charity without mutual interceſſion.</p>
                  <p>That which urged them to ſpeak for her, is urged to Chriſt by them for her
obtaining; <hi>She cries after us.</hi> Prayer is as an arrow: if it be drawn up but a
little, it goes not far; but if it be pull'd up to the head, it flies ſtrongly, and
pierces deep. If it be but dribbled forth of careleſſe lips, it falls down at our
foot; the ſtrength of our ejaculation ſends it up into Heaven, and fetches down <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
a bleſſing. The childe hath eſcaped many a ſtripe by his loud crying; and the
very unjuſt Judge cannot indure the widows clamour. Heartleſs motions do but
teach us to deny; ſervent ſuits offer violence both to earth and Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt would not anſwer the woman, but doth anſwer the Diſciples. Thoſe
that have a familiarity with God ſhall receive anſwers, when ſtrangers ſhall
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44233:44"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſtand out. Yea even of domeſticks ſome are more intire: He that lay in <hi>Jeſus</hi>
his boſome could receive that intelligence which was concealed from the reſt.
But who can tell whether that ſilence or this anſwer be more grievous? <hi>I am
not ſent but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> What is this anſwer but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of that ſilence and ſeeming neglect? Whiles he ſaid nothing, his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
might have been ſuppoſed to proceed from the neceſſity of ſome
greater thoughts: but now, his anſwer profeſſeth that ſilence to have procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from a willing reſolution not to anſwer: and therefore he doth not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
ſo much as to give to her the anſwer, but to her ſolicitors; that they might
return his deniall from him to her, who had undertaken to derive her ſuit to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> him; <hi>I am not ſent but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Like a faithfull Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour,
Chriſt hath an eye to his commiſſion. That may not be violated,
though to an apparant advantage: whither he is not ſent, he may not goe. As
he, ſo all his have their fixed marks ſet: at theſe they aime, and think it not
ſafe to ſhoot at rovers. In matter of morality it is not for us to ſtand onely
upon inhibitions, avoiding what is forbidden, but upon commands, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
only what is injoyned. We need no other rule of our life then the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our ſeveral ſtations. And if he that was God, would take no further
ſcope to himſelf then the limits of his commiſſion, how much doth it concern
us frail men to keep within compaſs? or what ſhall become of our lawleſneſs,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that live in a direct contrariety to the will of him that ſent us?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iſrael</hi> was <hi>Jacob</hi>'s name; from him derived to his poſterity: till the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Tribes under <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> all that nation was <hi>Iſrael:</hi> then the Father's
name went to the moſt (which were ten Tribes,) the name of the Son <hi>Juda</hi> to
the beſt, which were two. Chriſt takes no notice of this unhappy diviſion: he
remembers the antient name which he gave to that faithfull wreſtler. It was
this Chriſt with whom <hi>Jacob</hi> ſtrove; it was he that wrencht his hip, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his name, and diſmiſt him with a bleſſing; and now he cannot forget his old
mercy to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> To that only doth he profeſs himſelf ſent. Their
firſt brood were ſhepherds, now they are ſheep; and thoſe not garded, not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſtured,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but ſtrayed and loſt. O Saviour, we ſee thy charge; the houſe of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> not of <hi>Eſau;</hi> ſheep, not goats, not wolves; loſt ſheep, not ſecurely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paled
in the confidence of their ſafe condition. Woe were to us if thou wert
not ſent to us. He is not a Jew which is one without. Every <hi>Iſraelite</hi> is not a
true one. We are not of thy fold, if we be not ſheep: thou wilt not reduce us
to thy fold, if we be not loſt in our own apprehenſions. O Lord, thou haſt put
a fleece upon our backs, we have loſt our ſelves enough: make us ſo ſenſible
of our own wandrings, that we may finde thee ſent unto us, and may be happily
found of thee.</p>
                  <p>Hath not this poor woman yet done? Can neither the ſilence of Chriſt nor
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his deniall ſilence her? Is it poſſible ſhe ſhould have any glimpſe of hope after
ſo reſolute repulſes? yet ſtill, as if ſhe ſaw no argument of diſcouragement,
ſhe comes, and worſhips, and cries, <hi>Lord, help me.</hi> She which could not in
the houſe get a word of Chriſt, ſhe that ſaw her ſolicitors (though Chriſt's own
Diſciples) repelled, yet ſhe comes. Before ſhe followed, now ſhe overtakes
him; before ſhe ſued aloof, now ſhe comes cloſe to him: no contempt can
caſt her off. Faith is an undaunted Grace; it hath a ſtrong heart, and a bold
forehead: even very denials cannot diſmay it, much leſſe delaies. She came
not to face, not to expoſtulate, but to proſtrate her ſelf at his feet: Her tongue
worſhipt him before, now her knee. The eye of her Faith ſaw that Divinity in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Chriſt which bowed her to his Earth. There cannot be a fitter geſture of man
to God then adoration.</p>
                  <p>Her firſt ſuit was for mercy, now for help. There is no uſe of mercy but in
helpfulneſs. To be pitied without aide, is but an addition to miſery. Who can
blame us, if we care not for an unprofitable compaſſion?</p>
                  <p>The very ſuit was gracious. She ſaith not, <hi>Lord, if thou canſt, help me,</hi>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:44233:45"/>
as the father of the Lunatick; but profeſſes the power whiles ſhe beggs the act,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
and gives glory where ſhe would have relief.</p>
                  <p>Who now can expect other then a faire and yielding anſwer to ſo humble, ſo
faithfull, ſo patient a ſuppliant? What can ſpeed well, if a prayer of Faith from
the knees of Humility ſucceeds not? And yet behold, the further ſhe goes, the
worſe ſhe fares: her diſcouragement is doubled with her ſuit. <hi>It is not good to
take the childrens bread and to caſt it to dogs.</hi> Firſt, his ſilence implied a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;
then his anſwer defended his ſilence; now his ſpeech expreſſes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
his contempt. Lo, he hath turned her from a woman to a dog, and (as
it were) ſpurns her from his feet with an harſh repulſe. What ſhall we ſay? is
the Lamb of God turned Lion? Doth that clear fountain of mercy run blood?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
O Saviour, did ever ſo hard a word fall from thoſe milde lips? Thou called'ſt
<hi>Herod</hi> ſox; moſt worthily, he was crafty and wicked: the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees
a generation of Vipers; they were venemous and cruell: <hi>Judas</hi> a Devil;
he was both covetous and treacherous. But here was a woman in diſtreſſe, and
diſtreſſe challenges mercy: a good woman, a faithfull ſuppliant, a <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi>
Diſciple, a Chriſtian <hi>Canaanite;</hi> yet rated and whipt out for a dog by thee who
wert all goodneſſe and mercy? How different are thy wayes from ours? Even
thy ſeverity argues favour. The Triall had not been ſo ſharp, if thou hadſt
not found the Faith ſo ſtrong, if thou hadſt not meant the iſſue ſo happy.
Thou hadſt not driven her away as a dog, if thou hadſt not intended to admit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
her for a Saint; and to advance her as much for a pattern of Faith, as thou
depreſſedſt her for a ſpectacle of contempt.</p>
                  <p>The time was when the Jews were children, and the Gentiles dogs: now
the caſe is happily altered; the Jews are the dogs, (ſo their dear and Divine
country-man calls the Conciſion) we Gentiles are the children. What certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is there in an external profeſſion, that gives us only to ſeem, not to be; at
leaſt the being that it gives is doubtfull and temporary? We may be children
to day, and dogs to morrow. The true aſſurance of our condition is in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
and covenant of God on his part, in our Faith and Obedience on ours. How
they of children became dogs, it is not hard to ſay; their preſumption, their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
unbelief transformed them; and (to perfect their brutiſhneſſe) they ſet their
fangs upon the Lord of life. How we of dogs become children I know no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
But,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>O the depth!</hi> That which at the firſt ſingled them out from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the world, hath at laſt ſingled us out from the world and them. <hi>It is not
in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that hath mercy.</hi> Lord,
how ſhould we bleſſe thy Goodneſſe, that we of dogs are Children? how
ſhould we feare thy Juſtice, ſince they of Children are dogs? Oh let not us be
high-minded, but tremble. If they were cut off who crucified thee in thine
humbled eſtate, what may we expect who crucifie thee daily in thy glory?</p>
                  <p>Now what ordinary patience would not have been over-ſtrained with ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
a repulſe? How few but would have faln into intemperate paſſions,
into paſſionate expoſtulations? Art thou the Prophet of God that ſo diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
entertaineſt poor ſuppliants? Is this the comfort that thou dealeſt to the
diſtreſſed? Is this the fruit of my humble adoration, of my faithfull profeſſion?
Did I ſnarl or bark at thee, when I called thee the <hi>Son of David?</hi> Did I flie
upon thee otherwiſe then with my prayers and tears? And if this terme were
fit for my vileneſs, yet doth it become thy lips? Is it not ſorrow enough to me
that I am afflicted with my daughters miſery, but that thou (of whom I hoped
for relief) muſt adde to mine affliction in an unkinde reproach? But here is none
of all this. Contrarily, her Humility grants all, her patience overcomes all,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
and ſhe meekly anſwers, <hi>Truth, Lord, yet the dogs eat of the crums which fall
from their maſters Table.</hi> The reply is not more witty then faithfull. O Lord,
thou art Truth it ſelf; thy words can be no other then truth: thou haſt call'd
me a dog, and a dog I am: give me therefore the favour and priviledge of a
dog, that I may gather up ſome crums of mercy from under that table whereat
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44233:45"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> thy children ſit. This bleſſing (though great to me) yet to the infiniteneſſe
of thy power and mercy is but as a crum to a Feaſt. I preſume not to preſſe to
the board, but to creep under it. Deny me not thoſe ſmall offalls which elſe
would be ſwept away in the duſt. After this ſtripe, give me but a crum, and I
ſhall fawn upon thee, and depart ſatisfied. O woman (ſay I) great is thine Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
great is thy Patience: but, <hi>O woman</hi> (ſaith my Saviour) <hi>great is thy Faith.</hi>
He ſees the root, we the ſtock. Nothing but Faith could thus temper the
heart, thus ſtrengthen the Soul, thus charm the tongue. O precious Faith!
O acceptable perſeverance! It is no marvel if that chiding end in favour: <hi>Be
it to thee even as thou wilt.</hi> Never did ſuch Grace goe away uncrowned. The
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> beneficence had been ſtreight, if thou hadſt not carried away more then thou
ſuedſt for. Lo, thou that cameſt a dog, goeſt away a child; thou that wouldſt
but creep under the childrens feet, art ſet at their elbow; thou that wouldſt
have taken up a crum, art feaſted with full diſhes. The way to ſpeed well at
God's hand is, to be humbled in his eyes and in our own. It is quite otherwiſe
with God, and with men. With men we are ſo accounted of as we account of
our ſelves. He ſhall be ſure to be vile in the ſight of others, which is vile in his
own. With God nothing is got by vain oſtentation, nothing is loſt by abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
O God, when we look down to our own weakneſſe, and caſt up our eyes
to thine infiniteneſs, thine omnipotence, what poor things we are? but when
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> we look down upon our ſins and wickedneſs, how ſhall we expreſſe our ſhame?
None of all thy creatures (except Devils) are capable of ſo ſoul a quality. As
we have thus made our ſelves worſe then beaſts, ſo let us in a ſincere humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of minde acknowledge it to thee, who canſt pity, forgive, redreſſe it. So
ſetting our ſelves down at the lower end of the table of thy creatures, thou the
great Maſter of the Feaſt mayſt be pleaſed to advance us to the height of Glory.</p>

is both the largeſt improvement of our love, and moſt effectual. No di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
can hinder this fruit of our Devotion. Thus we may oblige thoſe that
we ſhall never ſee, thoſe that can never thank us. This beneficence cannot
impoveriſh us: the more we give, we have ſtill the more. It is a ſafe and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
ſtore that cannot be impaired by our bounty. What was their ſuit, but that
Chriſt would put his hand upon the Patient? Not that they would preſcribe
the means, or imply a neceſſity of his touch; but for that they ſaw this was the
ordinary courſe both of Chriſt and his Diſciples, by touching to heal. Our
prayers muſt be directed to the uſual proceedings of God. His actions muſt
be the rule of our prayers; our payers may not preſcribe his actions.</p>
                  <p>That gracious Saviour who is wont to exceed our deſires, does more then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
they ſue for. Not only doth he touch the party, but takes him by the hand, and
leads him from the multitude.</p>
                  <p>He that would be healed of his ſpiritual infirmities, muſt be ſequeſtred
from the throng of the world. There is a good uſe, in due times, of Solitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
That Soul can never injoy God that is not ſometimes retired. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
Bridegroom of the Church will not impart himſelf to his Spouſe before
company. Or perhaps this ſeceſſion was for our example of a willing and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
avoidance of vain-glory in our actions. Whence alſo it is that our Saviour
gives an after-charge of ſecrecy. He that could ſay, <hi>He that doth evil hateth
the light,</hi> eſchueth the light even in good. To ſeek our own glory is not glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
Although beſides this baſhfull deſire of obſcurity, here is a meet regard of
opportunity in the carriage of our actions. The envy of the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees
might trouble the paſſage of his Divine miniſtery: their exaſperation is
wiſely declined by this retiring. He in whoſe hands time is, knows how to
make his beſt choice of ſeaſons. Neither was it our Saviours meaning to have
this Miracle buried, but hid. Wiſdome hath no better improvement then in
diſtinguiſhing times, and diſcreetly marſhalling the circumſtances of our actions:
which whoſoever neglects, ſhall be ſure to ſhame his work, and mar his hopes.</p>
                  <p>Is there a ſpiritual Patient to be cured? Aſide with him. To undertake him
before the face of the multitude, is to wound, not to heal him.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reproof and good counſel muſt be like our Alms, in ſecret, ſo as (if poſſible)
one eare or hand might not be conſcious to the other. As in ſome caſes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
ſo our Reprehenſion muſt be auricular. The diſcreet Chirurgion that
would cure a modeſt Patient, whoſe ſecret complaint hath in it more ſhame then
pain, ſhuts out all eyes ſave his own. It is enough for the God of Juſtice to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44233:46"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſay, <hi>Thou didſt it ſecretly, but I will doe it before all Iſrael, and before this Sun.</hi>
Our limited and imperfect wiſedome muſt teach us to apply private redreſſes
to private maladies. It is the beſt remedy that is leaſt ſeen, and moſt felt.</p>
                  <p>What means this variety of ceremony? O Saviour, how many parts of thee
are here active? Thy finger is put into the eare, thy ſpittle touche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h the tongue,
thine eyes look up, thy lungs ſigh, thy lips move to an <hi>Ephphatha.</hi> Thy word
alone, thy beck alone, thy wiſh alone, yea the leaſt act of velleity from thee
might have wrought this cure. Why wouldſt thou imploy ſo much of thy
ſelf in this work? Was it to ſhew thy liberty in not alwaies equally exerciſing
the power of thy Deity? in that one-while thine onely command ſhall raiſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the dead, and eject Devils; another while thou wouldeſt accommodate thy
ſelf to the mean and homely faſhions of natural agents, and condeſcending to
our ſenſes and cuſtomes, take thoſe waies which may carry ſome more near
reſpect to the cure intended? Or was it to teach us how well thou likeſt that
there ſhould be a ceremonious carriage of thy ſolemn actions, which thou
pleaſeſt to produce cloathed with ſuch circumſtantial formes?</p>
                  <p>It did not content thee to put one finger into one eare; but into either eare
wouldſt thou put a finger: Both ears equally needed cure, thou wouldeſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the means of cure to both. The Spirit of God is the finger of God. Then
doſt thou, O Saviour, put thy finger into our eare, when thy Spirit inables us to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hear effectually. If we thruſt our own fingers into our eares, uſing ſuch humane
perſwaſions to our ſelves as ariſe from worldly grounds, we labour in vain: yea
theſe ſtoppels muſt needs hinder our hearing the voice of God. Hence the great
Philoſophers of the antient world, the learned Rabbins of the Synagogue, the
great Doctors of a falſe faith are deaf to ſpiritual things. It is only that finger
of thy Spirit, O bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> that can open our eares, and make paſſage through
our eares into our hearts. Let that finger of thine be put into our eares, ſo ſhall
our deafneſſe be removed, and we ſhall hear not the loud thunders of the Law,
but the gentle whiſperings of thy gracious motions to our Souls.</p>
                  <p>We hear for our ſelves, but we ſpeak for others. Our Saviour was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to open the eares only, but to untie the tongue. With the eare we hear,
with the mouth we confeſſe. The ſame hand is applied to the tongue, not with
a drie touch, but with ſpittle: in alluſion doubtleſſe to the removal of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
impediment of ſpeech. Moiſture, we know, glibs the tongue, and makes
it apt to motion; how much more from that Sacred mouth?</p>
                  <p>There are thoſe whoſe ears are open, but their mouths are ſtill ſhut to God:
they underſtand, but do not utter the wonderfull things of God. There is but
half a Cure wrought upon theſe men: their eare is but open to hear their own
judgment, except their mouth be open to confeſſe their Maker and Redeemer.
O God, do thou ſo moiſten my tongue with thy Graces, that it may run ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>(<hi>as the pen of a ready writer</hi>) to the praiſe of thy Name. Whiles the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of our Saviour was on the tongue, in the eare of the Patient, his eye was in
Heaven. Never man had ſo much cauſe to look up to Heaven as he: there
was his home, there was his throne. He onely was <hi>from Heaven, heavenly.</hi>
Each of us hath a good minde homeward, though we meet with better ſights
abroad: how much more when our home is ſo glorious above the region of
our peregrination? But thou, O Saviour, hadſt not onely thy dwelling there,
but thy ſeat of Majeſty. There the greateſt Angels adored thee: it is a wonder
that thine eye could be ever any where but there. What doth thine eye in this
but teach ours where to be fixed? Every good gift and every perfect gift
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> coming down from above, how can we look off from that place whence we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
all good? Thou didſt not teach us to ſay, O infinite God which art every
where; but, <hi>O our father which art in Heaven.</hi> There let us look up to thee.
Oh let not our eyes or hearts grovell upon this earth; but let us faſten them
above <hi>the hills, whence cometh our ſalvation.</hi> Thence let us acknowledge all the
good we receive; thence let us expect all the good we want.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:44233:47"/>
Why our Saviour look'd up to Heaven (though he had Heaven in himſelf)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
we can ſee reaſon enough. But why did he ſigh? Surely not for need: The
leaſt motion of a thought was in him impetratory. How could he chuſe but be
heard of his Father, who was one with the Father? Not for any fear of diſtruſt;
but partly for compaſſion, partly for example. For compaſſion of thoſe manifold
infirmities into which ſin had plunged mankinde; a pitiful inſtance whereof was
here preſented unto him. For example, to fetch ſighs from us for the miſeries
of others; ſighs of ſorrow for them, ſighs of deſire for their redreſſe. This
is not the firſt time that our Saviour ſpent ſighs, yea tears, upon humane diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
We are not bone of his bone and fleſh of his fleſh, if we ſo feel not the
ſmart of our brethren, that the fire of our paſſion break forth into the ſmoak of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
ſighs. <hi>Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt was not ſilent whiles he cured the dumb; his <hi>Ephphatha</hi> gave life to
all theſe his other actions. His ſighing, his ſpitting, his looking up to Heaven
were the acts of a man: But his command of the eare and mouth to open was the
act of God. He could not command that which he made not. His word is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative,
ours ſupplicatory. He doth what he will with us; we doe by him
what he thinks good to impart. In this mouth the word cannot be ſevered from
the ſucceſs. Our Saviour's lips are no ſooner opened in his <hi>Ephphatha,</hi> then the
mouth of the dumb and the ears of the deaf are opened. At once behold here
celerity and perfection. Natural agents work by leaſure, by degrees; nothing is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
done in an inſtant: by many ſteps is every thing carried from the entrance to
the conſummation. Omnipotency knows no Rules. No imperfect work can
proceed from a cauſe abſolutely perfect. The man hears now more lightly then
if he had never been deaf; and ſpeaks more plainly then if he had never been
tongue-tyed. And can we blame him if he beſtowed the handſel of his ſpeech
upon the power that reſtored it? if the firſt improvement of his tongue were
the praiſe of the giver, of the maker of it? Or can we expect other then that
our Saviour ſhould ſay, Thy tongue is free, uſe it to the praiſe of him that made
it ſo; thy ears are open, hear him that bids thee proclaim thy cure upon the
houſe-top? But now behold contrarily, he that opens this mans mouth by his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
powerfull word, by the ſame word ſhuts it again; charging ſilence by the ſame
breath wherewith he gave ſpeech; <hi>Tell no man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe tongues which interceded for his cure, are charmed for the conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it. O Saviour, thou knoweſt the grounds of thine own commands. It is
not for us to inquire, but to obey: we may not honour thee with a forbidden
celebration. Good meanings have oft-times proved injurious. Thoſe men
whoſe charity imployed their tongues to ſpeak for the dumb man, do now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
the ſame tongues to ſpeak of his cure, when they ſhould have been dumb.
This charge, they imagine, proceeds from an humble modeſty in Chriſt;
which the reſpect to his Honour bids them violate. I know not how we itch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
after thoſe forbidden acts, which if left to our liberty we willingly neglect. This
prohibition increaſeth the rumor: every tongue is buſied about this one. What
can we make of this but a well-meant diſobedience? O God, I ſhould more
gladly publiſh thy Name at thy command. I know thou canſt not bid me to
dishonour thee; there is no danger of ſuch an injunction: but if thou ſhouldeſt
bid me to hide the profeſſion of thy Name and wondrous works, I ſhould fulfill
thy words, and not examine thine intentions. Thou knoweſt how to win more
honour by our ſilence then by our promulgation. A forbidden good differs
little from evil. What makes our actions to be ſin but thy prohibitions? Our
judgement avails nothing. If thou forbid us that which we think good, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
as faulty to thee-ward as that which is originally evil. Take thou charge
of thy Glory; give me grace to take charge of thy Precepts.</p>

                  <p>NOW was our Saviour walking towards his Paſſion: his laſt journey
had moſt wonders. <hi>Jericho</hi> was in his way from <hi>Galilec</hi> to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi>
he balks it not though it were outwardly curſed; but as the
firſt <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaved a <hi>Rahab</hi> there, ſo there the ſecond ſaves a <hi>Zacheus;</hi>
that an Harlot, this a Publican. The traveller was wounded as he was going
from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Jericho:</hi> this man was taken from his <hi>Jericho</hi> to the true
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and was healed. Not as a paſſenger did Chriſt walk this way, but
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> as a viſitor; not to puniſh, but to heal. With us, the ſick man is glad to ſend
far for the Phyſician; here the Phyſician comes to ſeek patients, and calls at
our door for work. Had not this good Shepherd left the ninety nine, and
ſearched the deſart, the loſt Sheep had never recovered the fold; had not his
gracious frugality ſought the loſt Groat, it had been ſwept up with the ruſhes,
and thrown out in the duſt. Still, O Saviour, doſt thou walk through our <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo:</hi>
what would become of us, if thou ſhouldſt ſtay till we ſeek thee alone?
Even when thou haſt found us, how hardly do we follow thee? The work
muſt be all thine: we ſhall not ſeek thee, if thou finde us not; we ſhall not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
thee, if thou draw us not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Never didſt thou, O Saviour, ſet one ſtep in vain: whereſoever thou art
walking, there is ſome <hi>Zacheus</hi> to be won. As in a drought, when we ſee ſome
weighty cloud hovering over us, we ſay there is rain for ſome grounds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
it falls. The Ordinances of God bode good to ſome Souls; and happy
are they on whom it lights.</p>
                  <p>How juſtly is <hi>Zacheus</hi> brought in with a note of wonder? It is both great
and good news to hear of a Convert. To ſee men perverted from God to the
world, from truth to hereſie, from piety to prophaneneſs, is as common as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable;
every night ſuch ſtars fall: but to ſee a ſinner come home to God,
is both happy and wondrous, to men and Angels. I cannot blame that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> who undertaking to write of the hidden miracles of Nature, ſpends
moſt of his diſcourſe upon the generation and formation of man. Surely we are
<hi>fearfully and wonderfully made.</hi> But how much greater is the Miracle of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
regeneration; that a ſon of wrath, a childe of Satan, ſhould be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into the Son and heire of the ever-living God? O God, thou workeſt
both; but in the one our ſpirit animates us, in the other thine own.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſome things which have wonder in them for their worth, loſe it for
their frequence; this hath no leſſe rarity in it then excellence. How many
painfull <hi>Peters</hi> have complained to fiſh all night, and catch nothing? Many
Profeſſors and few Converts hath been ever the lot of the Goſpel. God's
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> houſe, as the ſtreets of <hi>Jericho,</hi> may be thronged, and yet but one <hi>Zacheus.</hi> As
therefore in the Lottery, when the great prize comes, the trumpet ſounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it; ſo the news of a Convert is proclaimed with, <hi>Behold Zacheus.</hi> Any
Penitent had been worthy of a ſhout; but this man by an eminence; a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,
a chief of the Publicans, rich.</p>
                  <p>No name under Heaven was ſo odious as this of a Publican; eſpecially to
this Nation, that ſtood ſo high upon their freedome, that every impeachment
of it ſeemed no leſſe then damnable: inſomuch as they ask not, Is it fit, or
needfull, but, <hi>Is it lawfull to pay tribute unto Caeſar?</hi> Any office of exaction muſt
needs be hainous to a people ſo impatient of the yoke. And yet not ſo much
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the trade as the extortion drew hatred upon this profeſſion; out of both they
are deeply infamous: one while they are matched with Heathens, another
while with Harlots, alwaies with Sinners. <hi>And behold, Zacheus a Publican.</hi> We
are all naturally ſtrangers from God; the beſt is indiſpoſed to Grace: yet ſome
there are whoſe very Calling gives them better advantages. But this catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole-ſhip
of <hi>Zacheus</hi> carried extortion in the face, and in a ſort bade defiance
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44233:48"/>
to his Converſion: yet behold, from this Toll-booth is called both <hi>Zacheus</hi> to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
be a Diſciple, and <hi>Matthew</hi> to be an Apoſtle. We are in the hand of a cunning
workman, that of the knottieſt and crookedſt timber can make rafters and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for his own houſe; that can ſquare the marble or flint as well as the freeſt
ſtone. Who can now plead the diſadvantage of his place, when he ſees a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
come to Chriſt? No Calling can prejudice God's gracious election.</p>
                  <p>To excell in evil muſt needs be worſe. If to be a Publican be ill, ſurely to be
an Arch-publican is more. What talk we of the chief of Publicans, when he
that profeſſed himſelf the chief of Sinners is now among the chief of Saints?
Who can deſpair of mercy, when he ſees one <hi>Jericho</hi> ſend both an Harlot and
a Publican to Heaven?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>The trade of <hi>Zacheus</hi> was not a greater rub in his way then his wealth. He
that ſent word to <hi>John</hi> for great news, that <hi>the poor receive the Goſpel,</hi> ſaid
alſo, <hi>How hard is it for a rich man to enter into Heaven?</hi> This bunch of the
Camel keeps him from paſſing the needles eye; although not by any maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that is in the creature it ſelf (Riches are the gift of God) but by reaſon of
thoſe three pernicious hang-byes, Cares, Pleaſures, Pride, which too commonly
attend upon Wealth. Separate theſe, Riches are a bleſſing. If we can ſo poſſeſs
them that they poſſeſs not us, there can be no danger, much benefit in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
All the good or ill of wealth or poverty is in the minde, in the uſe. He
that hath a free and lowly heart in riches, is poor; he that hath a proud heart <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
under rags, is rich. If the rich man doe good and diſtribute, and the poor man
ſteal, the rich hath put off his woe to the poor. <hi>Zacheus</hi> had never been
ſo famous a Convert, if he had been poor; nor ſo liberal a Convert, if he had
not been rich. If more difficulty, yet more glory was in the converſion of rich
<hi>Zacheus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is well that wealthy <hi>Zacheus</hi> was deſirous to ſee Chriſt. Little do too
many rich men care to ſee that ſight: the face of <hi>Caeſar</hi> in their coin is more
pleaſing. This man leaves his bags, to bleſſe his eyes with this proſpect. Yet
can I not praiſe him for this too much; it was not (I fear) out of Faith, but Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity.
He that had heard great ſame of the man, of his Miracles, would gladly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
ſee his face. Even an <hi>Herod</hi> longed for this, and was never the better. Onely
this I finde, that this Curioſity of the eye, through the mercy of God, gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to the Belief of the heart. He that deſires to ſee <hi>Jeſus,</hi> is in the way to
enjoy him: there is not ſo much as a remote poſſibility in the man that cares
not to behold him. The eye were ill beſtowed, if it were onely to betray our
Souls: there are no leſſe beneficial glances of it. We are not worthy of this
uſefull caſement of the heart, if we do not thence ſend forth beams of holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
and thereby re-conveigh profitable and ſaving Objects.</p>
                  <p>I cannot marvel if <hi>Zacheus</hi> were deſirous to ſee <hi>Jeſus.</hi> All the world was
not worth this ſight. Old <hi>Simeon</hi> thought it beſt to have his eyes cloſed up <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
with this ſpectacle, as if he held it pity and diſparagement to ſee ought after it.
The Father of the faithfull rejoiced to ſee him, though at nineteen hundred
years diſtance; and the great Doctor of the Gentiles ſtands upon this as his
higheſt ſtair, <hi>Have I not ſeen the Lord Jeſus?</hi> And yet, O Saviour, many a one
ſaw thee here, that ſhall never ſee thy face above; yea, that ſhall call to the hills
to hide them from thy ſight. And <hi>if we had once known thee according to the fleſh,
henceforth know we thee ſo no more.</hi> What an happineſs ſhall it be ſo to ſee thee
glorious, that in ſeeing thee we ſhall partake of thy glory? Oh bleſſed viſion,
to which all others are but penal and deſpicable! Let me goe into the mint-houſe,
and ſee heaps of gold, I am never the richer; let me goe to the picturers,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
I ſee goodly faces, and am never the fairer; let me goe to the Court, I ſee ſtate
and magnificence, and am never the greater: but, O Saviour, I cannot ſee thee,
and not be bleſſed. I can ſee thee here, though in a glaſſe. If the eye of my
Faith be dim, yet it is ſure. Oh let me be unquiet till I do now ſee thee through
the vaile of Heaven, ere I ſhall ſee thee as I am ſeen.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Fain would <hi>Zacheus</hi> ſee <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but he could not. It were ſtrange if a man

betwixt us and Chriſt. Here are two hinderances met; the one internal, the other
external; the ſtature of the man, the preaſe of the multitude; the greatneſs of

Chriſt could not want clients: now amongſt all theſe wonderers, there is but
one <hi>Zacheus.</hi> In vain ſhould we boaſt of our forwardneſs to ſee and hear Chriſt
in our ſtreets, if we receive him not into our hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> This croud hides Chriſt from <hi>Zacheus.</hi> Alas! how common a thing it is, by
the interpoſition of the throng of the world to be kept from the ſight of our

let me doe as the moſt. The throng keeps this man from Chriſt. There a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
misbeliever ſayes, What tell you me of an handful of reformed? the
whole world is ours. This man is kept from Chriſt by the throng. The cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Mammoniſt ſayes, Let them that have leaſure be devout; my imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are many, my affairs great. This man cannot ſee Chriſt for the throng.
There is no perfect view of Chriſt but in an holy ſeceſſion. The Spouſe found
not her Beloved till ſhe was paſt the company; then ſhe found him whom her
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Soul loved. Whoſo never ſeeks Chriſt but in the croud, ſhall never finde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in finding him. The benefit of our publick view muſt be enjoyed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiredneſs.
If in a preaſe we ſee a mans face, that is all; when we have him alone,
every limme may be viewed. O Saviour, I would be loath not to ſee thee in
thine Aſſemblies; but I would be more loath not to ſee thee in my Cloſet. Yet
had <hi>Zacheus</hi> been but of the common pitch, he might perhaps have ſeen Chriſts
face over his fellows ſhoulders: now his ſtature adds to the diſadvantage; his
Body did not anſwer to his Minde; his deſires were high, whiles his body was
low. The beſt is, however ſmalneſs of ſtature was diſadvantageous in a level,
yet it is not ſo at height. A little man, if his eye be clear, may look as high
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>(though not as farre) as the talleſt. The leaſt <hi>Pygmee</hi> may from the loweſt
valley ſee the Sun or Stars as fully as a Giant upon the higheſt mountain. O
Saviour, thou art now in Heaven: the ſmalneſs of our perſon or of our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
cannot lett us from beholding thee. The Soul hath no ſtature; neither is
Heaven to be had with reaching: onely clear thou the eyes of my Faith, and I
am high enough.</p>
                  <p>I regard not the Body: the Soul is the man. It is to ſmall purpoſe that the
body is a Giant, if the Soul be a dwarf. We have to doe with a God that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
us by our deſires, not by our ſtatures. All the ſtreets of <hi>Jericho</hi> (however
he ſeemed to the eye) had not ſo tall a man as <hi>Zacheus.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> The witty Publican eaſily finds both his hindrances, and the waies of their
redreſs. His remedy for the preaſe, is to run before the multitude; his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
for his ſtature, is to climb up into the Sycomore: he imployes his feet
in the one, his hands and feet in the other. In vain ſhall he hope to ſee Chriſt,
that doth not out-go the common throng of the world. The multitude is
cluſtred together, and moves too cloſe to move faſt: we muſt be nimbler then
they, if ever we deſire or exſpect to ſee Chriſt. It is the charge of God, <hi>Thou
ſhalt not follow a multitude to doe evil:</hi> we doe evil if we lagge in good. It is
held commonly both wit and ſtate for a man to keep his pace: and that man
eſcapes not cenſure, who would be forwarder then his fellows. Indeed for a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> man to run alone in wayes of indifferency, or to ſet an hypocritical face of out-running
all others in a zealous profeſſion, when the heart lingers behinde, both
theſe are juſtly hateful: but in an holy emulation to ſtrive truly and really to
out ſtrip others in degrees of Grace, and a conſcionable care of obedience, this
is truly Chriſtian, and worthy of him that would hope to be bleſſed with the
ſight of a Saviour.</p>

                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:44233:49"/>
Tell me, ye faſhionable Chriſtians, that ſtand upon terms of equality, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
will not go a foot before your neighbours in holy zeal and aidful charity, in
conſcionable ſincerity; tell me, who hath made other mens progreſs a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
for yours? Which of you ſaies, I will be no richer, no greater, no fairer,
no wiſer, no happier then my fellows? Why ſhould you then ſay, I will be no
holier? Our life is but a race; every good End that a man propoſes to himſelf
is a ſeveral goal. Did ever any man that ran for a prize, ſay, I will keep up with
the reſt? Doth he not know that if he be not foremoſt, he loſeth? We had as
good to have ſate ſtill, as not <hi>ſo</hi> to <hi>run that we may obtain.</hi> We obtain not, if we
out-run not the multitude.</p>
                  <p>So farre did <hi>Zacheus</hi> over-run the ſtream of the people, that he might have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
ſpace to climb the Sycomore ere <hi>Jeſus</hi> could paſs by. I examine not the kinde,
the nature, the quality of this Plant; what Tree ſoever it had been, <hi>Zacheus</hi>
would have tried to ſcale it, for the advantage of this proſpect. He hath found
out this help for his ſtature, and takes pains to uſe it. It is the beſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our wit, to ſeek out the apteſt furtherances for our Souls. Do you ſee
a weak and ſtudious Chriſtian, that being unable to inform himſelf in the
matters of God, goes to the cabinet of Heaven, <hi>the Prieſts lips,</hi> which <hi>ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
knowledge?</hi> there is <hi>Zacheus</hi> in the Sycomore. It is the trueſt wiſdome
that helps forward our Salvation. How witty we are to ſupply all the deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Nature? If we be low, we can adde cubits to our ſtature; if ill-coloured,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
we can borrow complexion; if hairleſs, perukes; if dim-ſighted, glaſſes; if
lame, crutches: and ſhall we be conſcious of our ſpiritual wants, and be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
regardleſs of the remedy? Surely, had <hi>Zacheus</hi> ſtood ſtill on the ground,
he had never ſeen Chriſt; had he not climbed the Sycomore, he had never
climbed into Heaven. O Saviour, I have not height enough of my own to ſee
thee: give me what Sycomore thou wilt; give me grace to uſe it, give me an
happy uſe of that grace.</p>
                  <p>The more I look at the mercy of Chriſt, the more cauſe I ſee of aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>Zacheus</hi> climbs up into the Sycomore to ſee <hi>Jeſus: Jeſus</hi> firſt ſees him,
preventing his eyes with a former view. Little did <hi>Zacheus</hi> look that <hi>Jeſus</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
would have caſt up his eyes to him. Well might he think the boys in the
ſtreet would ſpy him out, and ſhout at his ſtature, trade, ambition: but that
<hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould throw up his eyes into the Sycomore, and take notice of that
ſmall deſpiſed morſel of fleſh, ere <hi>Zacheus</hi> could finde ſpace to diſtinguiſh his
face from the reſt, was utterly beyond his thought or exſpectation. All his hope
is to ſee, and now he is ſeen. To be ſeen and acknowledged is much more then
to ſee. Upon any ſolemn occaſion many thouſands ſee the Prince, whom he ſees
not; and if he pleaſe to ſingle out any one whether by his eye or by his
tongue, amongſt the preaſe, it paſſes for an high favour. <hi>Zacheus</hi> would have
thought it too much boldneſs to have asked what was given him. As <hi>Jonathan</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
did to <hi>David,</hi> ſo doth God to us, he ſhoots beyond us. Did he not prevent
us with mercy, we might climb into the Sycomore in vain. If he give Grace
to him that doth his beſt, it is the praiſe of the giver, not the earning of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.
How can we doe or will without him? If he ſee us firſt, we live; and
if we deſire to ſee him, we ſhall be ſeen of him. Whoever took pains to
climb the Sycomore, and came down diſappointed? O Lord, what was there
in <hi>Zacheus,</hi> that thou ſhouldſt look up at him? a Publican, a ſinner, an arch-extortioner;
a dwarf in ſtature, but a Giant in oppreſſion; a little man, but
a great Sycophant; if rich in coin, more rich in ſins and treaſures of wrath.
Yet it is enough that he deſires to ſee thee: all theſe diſadvantages cannot hide <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
him from thee. Be we never ſo ſinful, if our deſires towards thee be hearty
and ſervent, all the broad leaves of the Sycomore cannot keep off thine eye
from us. If we look at thee with the eye of Faith, thou wilt look at us with
the eye of mercy. <hi>The eye of the Lord is upon the juſt;</hi> and he is juſt that
would be ſo; if not in himſelf, yet in thee. O Saviour, when <hi>Zacheus</hi> was
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44233:49"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> above, and thou wert below, thou didſt look up at him: now thou art above,
and we below, thou lookeſt down upon us; thy mercy turns thine eyes every
way towards our neceſſities. Look down upon us that are not worthy to look
up unto thee; and finde us out, that we may ſeek thee.</p>
                  <p>It was much to note <hi>Zacheus,</hi> it was more to name him. Methinks I ſee how
<hi>Zacheus</hi> ſtartled at this, to hear the ſound of his own name from the mouth
of Chriſt: neither can he but think, Doth <hi>Jeſus</hi> know me? Is it his voice, or
ſome others in the throng? Lo, this is the firſt blink that ever I had of him.
I have heard the fame of his wonderful works, and held it happineſs enough
for me to have ſeen his face; and doth he take notice of my perſon, of my name?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Surely the more that <hi>Zacheus</hi> knew himſelf, the more doth he wonder that
Chriſt ſhould know him. It was ſlander enough for a man to be a friend to a
Publican; yet Chriſt gives this friendly compellation to the chief of Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,
and honours him with this argument of a ſudden intireneſs. The favour
is great, but not ſingular: Every elect of God is thus graced. The Father knows
the childes name: as he calls the ſtars of Heaven by their names, ſo doth he his
Saints, the ſtars on earth; and it is his own rule to his <hi>Iſrael, I have called thee
by thy name, thou art mine.</hi> As God's children do not content themſelves with
a confuſed knowledge of him, but aſpire to a particular apprehenſion and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
application; ſo doth God again to them: it is not enough that he knows
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them, as in the croud, wherein we ſee many perſons, none diſtinctly; but he
takes ſingle and ſeveral knowledge of their qualities, conditions, motions,
events. What care we that our names are obſcure or contemned amongſt men,
whiles they are regarded by God; that they are raked up in the duſt of earth,
whiles they are recorded in Heaven?</p>
                  <p>Had our Saviour ſaid no more but, <hi>Zacheus, come down,</hi> the poor man
would have thought himſelf taxed for his boldneſs and curioſity: it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be unknown, then noted for miſcarriage. But now the next words com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
him; <hi>For I muſt this day abide at thine houſe.</hi> What a ſweet familiarity
was here? as if Chriſt had been many years acquainted with <hi>Zacheus,</hi> whom
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> he now firſt ſaw. Beſides our uſe, the Hoſt is invited by the Gueſt, and called
to an inexſpected entertainment. Well did our Saviour hear <hi>Zacheus</hi> his heart
inviting him, though his mouth did not. Deſires are the language of the Soul;
thoſe are heard by him that is the God of ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>We dare not doe thus to each other, ſave where we have eaten much ſalt;
we ſcarce go where we are invited: though the face be friendly, and the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
great, yet the heart may be hollow. But here, he that ſaw the heart,
and foreknew his welcome, can boldly ſay, <hi>I muſt this day abide at thine houſe.</hi>
What a pleaſant kinde of entire familiarity there is betwixt Chriſt and a good
heart? <hi>If any man open, I will come in, and ſup with him.</hi> It is much for the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> King of Glory to come into a cottage, and ſup there; yet thus he may doe,
and take ſome ſtate upon him in ſitting alone. No, <hi>I will ſo ſup with him,</hi> that
<hi>he ſhall ſup with me.</hi> Earthly ſtate conſiſts in ſtrangeneſs, and affects a ſtern
kinde of majeſty aloof. Betwixt God and us though there be infinite more
diſtance, yet there is a gracious affability and familiar intireneſs of converſation.
O Saviour, what doſt thou elſe every day but invite thy ſelf to us in thy Word,
in thy Sacraments? who are we that we ſhould entertain thee, or thou us?
dwarfs in Grace, great in nothing but unworthineſs. Thy praiſe is worthy to
be ſo much the more, as our worth is leſs. Thou that biddeſt thy ſelf to us, bid
us be fit to receive thee, and in receiving thee, happy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> How graciouſly doth <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſtill prevent the Publican, as in his ſight, notice,

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tion, ſo in his invitation too? That other Publican, <hi>Levi,</hi> bad Chriſt
to his houſe, but it was after Chriſt had bidden him to his Diſcipleſhip: Chriſt
had never been called to his feaſt, if <hi>Levi</hi> had not been called into his family.
He loved us firſt, he muſt firſt call us; for he calls us out of love. As in the
general calling of Chriſtianity, if he did not ſay, <hi>Seek ye my face,</hi> we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44233:50"/>
ſay, <hi>Thy face, Lord, will I ſeek:</hi> ſo in the ſpecialties of our main benefits <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
or imployments, Chriſt muſt begin to us. If we invite our ſelves to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he invite himſelf to us, the undertaking is preſumptuous, the ſucceſs
unhappy.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Nathanael,</hi> when Chriſt named him, and gave him the memorial token of
his being under the fig-tree, could ſay, <hi>Thou art the Son of God;</hi> how could
<hi>Zacheus</hi> do leſs in hearing himſelf upon this wilde fig-tree named by the ſame
lips? How muſt he needs think, If he knew not all things, he could not know
me; and if he knew not the hearts of men, he could not have known my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
deſires to entertain him? He is a God that knows me, and a merciful God
that invites himſelf to me. No marvel therefore, if upon this thought <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
come down in haſt. Our Saviour ſaid not, Take thy leiſure, <hi>Zacheus;</hi> but,
<hi>I will abide at thine houſe to day.</hi> Neither did <hi>Zacheus</hi> upon this intimation
ſit ſtill and ſay, When the preaſe is over, when I have done ſome errands of my
office; but he haſts down to receive <hi>Jeſus.</hi> The notice of ſuch a gueſt would
have quickned his ſpeed without a command. God loves not ſlack and lazy
executions. The Angels of God are deſcribed with wings: and we pray to doe
his will with their forwardneſs. Yea even to <hi>Judas</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>What thou
doeſt, doe quickly.</hi> O Saviour, there is no day wherein thou doſt not call us by
the voice of thy Goſpel: what do we ſtill lingring in the Sycomore? How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindely
muſt thou needs take the delaies of our Converſion? Certainly, had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                     <hi>Zacheus</hi> ſtaid ſtill in the Tree, thou hadſt balked his houſe as unworthy of
thee. What conſtruction canſt thou make of our wilful dilations, but as a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
contempt? How canſt thou but come to us in vengeance, if we come not
down to entertain thee in a thankful obedience?</p>
                  <p>Yet do I not hear thee ſay, <hi>Zacheus,</hi> caſt thy ſelf down for haſt; this was
the counſel of the Tempter to thee; but, <hi>Come down in haſt.</hi> And he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.
There muſt be no more haſt then good ſpeed in our performances:
we may offend as well in our heady acceleration, as in our delay. <hi>Moſes</hi> ran ſo
faſt down the hill that he ſtumbled ſpiritually, and brake the Tables of God. We
may ſo faſt follow after Juſtice, that we out-run Charity. It is an unſafe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
that is not diſcreetly and leiſurely ſpeedful.</p>
                  <p>The ſpeed of his deſcent was not more then the alacrity of his entertainment.
<hi>He made haſt, and came down, and received him joyfully.</hi> The life of hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
is chearfulneſs. Let our chear be never ſo great, if we do not read
our welcome in our friends face as well as in his diſhes, we take no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in it.</p>
                  <p>Can we marvel that <hi>Zacheus</hi> received Chriſt joyfully? Who would not
have been glad to have his houſe, yea himſelf, made happy with ſuch a gueſt?
Had we been in the ſtead of this Publican, how would our hearts have
leapt within us for joy of ſuch a preſence? How many thouſand miles are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
meaſured by ſome devout Chriſtians, onely to ſee the place where his feet
ſtood? How much happier muſt he needs think himſelf that owns the roof
that receives him? But oh the incomparable happineſs then, of that man whoſe
heart receives him, not for a day, not for years of dayes, not for millions of
years, but for eternity! This may be our condition, if we be not ſtreightned
in our own bowels. O Saviour, do thou welcome thy ſelf to theſe houſes
of clay, that we may receive a joyful welcome to thee in thoſe everlaſting ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zacheus</hi> was not more glad of Chriſt then the Jews were diſcontented. Four
vices met here at once, Envy, Scrupulouſneſs, Ignorance, Pride. Their eye was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
evil becauſe Chriſt's was good. I do not hear any of them invite Chriſt to his
home; yet they ſnarl at the honour of this unworthy Hoſt: they thought it too
much happineſs for a Sinner, which themſelves willingly neglected to ſue for.
Wretched men! they cannot ſee the Mercy of Chriſt, for being bleared with
the happineſs of <hi>Zacheus:</hi> yea that very Mercy which they ſee, torments them.

eye-ſore. They that might not go in to a Sinner, cared not what ſins entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
themſelves: the true cozens of thoſe Hypocrites, who held it a pollution to
go into the Judgment-hall, no pollution to murder the Lord of life. There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a greater argument of a falſe heart, then to ſtumble at theſe ſtraws, and
to leap over the blocks of groſs impiety. Well did our Saviour know how hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly
offenſive it would be to turn in to this Publican: he knows, and regards
it not. A Soul is to be won, what cares he for idle miſconſtruction? Morally
good actions muſt not be ſuſpended upon danger of cauſeleſs ſcandal. In
things indifferent and arbitrary, it is fit to be overruled by fear of offence: but
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> if men will ſtumble in the plain ground of good, let them fall without our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
not without their own peril. I know not if it were not <hi>David</hi>'s weakneſs
to <hi>abſtain from good words whiles the wicked were in place.</hi> Let Juſtice be done
in ſpite of the world; and in ſpite of Hell, Mercy.</p>
                  <p>Ignorance was in part guilty of theſe ſcruples: they thought Chriſt either
too holy to go to a Sinner, or in going made unholy. Fooliſh men! to whom
came he? To you righteous? Let himſelf ſpeak: <hi>I came not to call the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
but ſinners to repentance.</hi> Whither ſhould the Phyſician go but to the ſick?

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> O Saviour, the glittering palaces of proud Juſticiaries are not for thee; thou
loveſt the lowly and ragged cottage of a contrite heart. Neither could here be
any danger of thy pollution. Thy Sun could caſt his beams upon the impureſt
dunghil, and not be tainted. It was free and ſafe for the Leper and Bloody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxed
to touch thee; thou couldſt heal them, they could not infect thee.
Neither is it otherwiſe in this moral contagion. We who are obnoxious to evil,
may be inſenſibly defiled: thy Purity was enough to remedy that which might
marre a world. Thou canſt help us, we cannot hurt thee. Oh let thy preſence
ever bleſs us; and let us ever bleſs thee for thy preſence.</p>
                  <p>Pride was an attendant of this Ignorance: ſo did they note <hi>Zacheus</hi> for a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> as if themſelves had been none. His ſins were written in his forehead, theirs
in their breaſt. The preſumption of their ſecrecy makes them inſult upon his
notoriouſneſs. The ſmoke of pride flies ſtill upward, and in the mounting va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth;
Contrition beats it down, and fetcheth tears from the tender eyes.
There are ſtage-ſins, and there are cloſet-ſins. Theſe may not upbraid the other:
they may be more hainous, though leſs manifeſt. It is a dangerous vanity to
look outward at other mens ſins with ſcorn, when we have more need to caſt
our eyes inward to ſee our own with humiliation.</p>
                  <p>Thus they ſtumbled, and fell; but <hi>Zacheus</hi> ſtood. All their malicious murmur
could not diſhearten his Piety and Joy in the entertaining of Chriſt. Before
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                     <hi>Zacheus</hi> lay down as a Sinner, now he ſtands up as a Convert: ſinning is falling,
continuance in ſin is lying down, Repentance is riſing and ſtanding up. Yet
perhaps this ſtanding was not ſo much the ſite of his Conſtancy or of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
as of his Reverence. Chriſt's affability hath not made him unmannerly;
<hi>Zacheus ſtood.</hi> And what if the deſire of more audibleneſs raiſed him to his
feet? In that ſmalneſs of ſtature it was not fit he ſhould loſe ought of his

height. It was meet ſo noble a proclamation ſhould want no advantage of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
Never was our Saviour better welcomed. The penitent Publican makes
his Will, and makes Chriſt his Superviſor. His Will conſiſts of Legacies given,
of Debts paid: gifts to the poor, payments to the injuried. There is Liberality
in the former, in the latter Juſtice; in both the proportions are large: <hi>Half to
the poor; fourfold to the wronged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This hand ſowed not ſparingly. Here muſt needs be much of his own that was
well gotten, whether left by patrimony, or ſaved by parſimony, or gained by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
improvement. For when he had reſtored fourfold to every one whom he
had oppreſſed, yet there remained a whole half for pious uſes: and this he ſo
diſtributes, that every word commends his bounty. <hi>I give;</hi> and what is more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
free then giſt? In alms we may neither ſell, nor return, nor caſt away. We ſell,
if we part with them for importunity, for vain-glory, for retribution: we return
them, if we give with reſpect to former offices; this is to pay, not to beſtow:
we caſt away, if in our beneficence we neither regard order nor diſcretion. <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi>
did neither caſt away, nor return, nor ſell, but give. <hi>I do give;</hi> not, I will.
The prorogation of good makes it thankleſs. The alms that ſmell of the hand,
loſe the praiſe. It is twice given that is given quickly. Thoſe that deferre their
gifts till their death-bed, do as good as ſay, Lord, I will give thee ſomething
when I can keep it no longer. Happy is the man that is his own executor. <hi>I
give my goods;</hi> not anothers. It is a thankleſs vanity to be liberal of another <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
mans purſe. Whoſo gives of that which he hath taken away from the owner,
doth more wrong in giving then in ſtealing. God exſpects our gifts, not our
ſpoils. I fear there is too many a School and Hoſpital, every ſtone whereof may
be challenged. Had <hi>Zacheus</hi> meant to give of his extortions, he had not been
ſo careful of his reſtitution: now he reſtores to others, that he may give of his
own; <hi>I give half my goods.</hi> The Publicans heart was as large as his eſtate; he
was not more rich in goods then in bounty. Were this example binding, who
ſhould be rich to give? who ſhould be poor to receive? In the ſtreight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of the Church thoſe beneficences were requiſite, which afterwards in
the larger elbow-room thereof would have cauſed much confuſion. If the firſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
Chriſtians laid down all at the Apoſtles feet, yet ere long, it was enough for the
believing <hi>Corinthians,</hi> every firſt day of the week to lay aſide ſome pittance for
charitable purpoſes. We are no Diſciples, if we do not imitate <hi>Zacheus</hi> ſo far as
to give liberally, according to the proportion of our eſtate.</p>
                  <p>Giving is ſowing: the larger ſeeding, the greater crop. Giving to the poor is
foeneration to God: the greater bank, the more intereſt. Who can fear to be
too wealthy? Time was when men faulted in exceſs: Proclamations were fain
to reſtrain the Jews; Statutes were fain to reſtrain our Anceſtors. Now there
needs none of this: Men know how to ſhut their hands alone. Charity is in
more danger of freezing then of burning. How happy were it for the Church,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
if men were onely cloſe-handed to hold, and not lime-fingered to take. <hi>To the
poor;</hi> not to rich heirs. God gives to him that hath; we to him that wants.
Some want becauſe they would, whether out of prodigality or idleneſs;
ſome want becauſe they muſt: theſe are the fit Subjects of our beneficence,
not thoſe other. A poverty of our own making deſerves no pity. He that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains
the lewd, feeds not his belly but his vice. So then this living Legacy of
<hi>Zacheus</hi> is free, <hi>I give;</hi> preſent, <hi>I do give;</hi> juſt, <hi>my goods,</hi> large, <hi>half my goods;</hi>
fit, <hi>to the poor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither is he more bountiful in his gift, then juſt in his reſtitution: <hi>If I have
take nought from any man by falſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> accuſation, I reſtore, it fourfold.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was proper for a Publican to pill and pole the ſubject, by deviſing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
and raiſing cauſleſs vexations, that his mouth might be ſtopt with fees,
either for ſilence or compoſition. This had <hi>Zacheus</hi> often done. Neither is this
<hi>If</hi> a note of doubt, but of aſſertion. He is ſure of the fact, he is not ſure of
the perſons: their challenge muſt help to further his juſtice. The true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44233:51"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of this holy Convert expreſſes it ſelf in Confeſſion, in Satisfaction. His
Confeſſion is free, full, open. What cares he to ſhame himſelf, that he may
give glory to God? Woe be to that baſhfulneſs that ends in confuſion of face.
O God, let me bluſh before men, rather then be confounded before Thee, thy
Saints and Angels.</p>
                  <p>His Satisfaction is no leſs liberal then his gift. Had not <hi>Zacheus</hi> been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to pay the debts of his fraud, all had gone to the poor. He would have
done that voluntarily, which the Young man in the Goſpel was bidden to doe,
and refuſing went away ſorrowful. Now he knew that his miſgotten gain
was not for God's Corban; therefore he ſpares half, not to keep, but to reſtore.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> This was the beſt diſh in <hi>Zacheus</hi> his good chear. In vain had he feaſted
Chriſt, given to the poor, confeſſed his extortions, if he had not made reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Woe is me for the paucity of true Converts. There is much ſtoln goods;
little brought home. Mens hands are like the fiſhers Flew, yea like Hell it ſelf,
which admits of no return. O God, we can never ſatisfie thee; our ſcore is too
great, our abilities too little: but if we make not even with men, in vain ſhall
we look for mercy from thee. To each his own had been well; but four for
one was munificent. In our tranſactions of commerce we doe well to beat the
bargain to the loweſt; but in caſes of moral or ſpiritual payments to God or
men, now there muſt be a meaſure, preſſed, ſhaken, running over. In good
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> offices and due retributions we may not be pinching and niggardly. It argues an
earthly and ignoble minde, where we have apparently wronged, to higgle and
dodge in the amends.</p>
                  <p>Oh mercy and juſtice well repaid! <hi>This day is Salvation come to thine houſe.</hi>
Lo, <hi>Zacheus,</hi> that which thou giveſt to the poor, is nothing to that which thy
Saviour gives to thee. If thou reſtoreſt four for one, here is more then thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of millions for nothing: were every of thy pence a world, they could
hold no compariſon with this bounty. It is but droſs that thou giveſt, it is
Salvation that thou receiveſt. Thou gaveſt in preſent, thou doſt not receive in
hope; but, <hi>This day is Salvation come to thine houſe.</hi> Thine ill-gotten metalls
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> were a ſtrong barre to bolt Heaven gates againſt thee; now that they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
by a ſeaſonable beneficence and reſtitution, thoſe gates of glory fly open
to thy Soul. Where is that man that can challenge God to be in his debt?
Who can ever ſay, Lord, this favour I did to the leaſt of thine unrequited?
Thrice happy Publican, that haſt climbed from thy Sycomore to Heaven; and
by a few worthleſs baggs of unrighteous Mammon, haſt purchaſed to thy ſelf
a Kingdome uncorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away.</p>

                  <p>THree of the Evangeliſts have (with one pen) recorded the death of the
great harbinger of Chriſt, as moſt remarkable and uſeful. He was
the fore-runner of Chriſt, as into the world, ſo out of it: yea, he
that made way for Chriſt into the world, made way for the name of
Chriſt into the Court of <hi>Herod. This Herod Antipas</hi> was ſon to that <hi>Herod</hi>
who was, and is ever infamous for the maſſacre at <hi>Bethle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a blood. The murderer of <hi>John</hi> the fore-runner of Chriſt is well deſcended
of him who would have murdered Chriſt, and, for his ſake, murdered the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> It was late ere this <hi>Herod</hi> heard the fame of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> not till he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off the head of <hi>John Baptiſt.</hi> The father of this <hi>Herod</hi> inquired for Chriſt
too ſoon; this too late. Great men ſhould have the beſt intelligence. If they
improve it to all other uſes of either frivolous or civil affaires, with neglect of
ſpirituall, their judgment ſhall be ſo much more as their helps and means
were greater. Whether this <hi>Herod</hi> were taken up with his <hi>Arabian</hi> warrs
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44233:52"/>
againſt <hi>Arethas</hi> his father in law, or whether he were imployed in his journey <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
to <hi>Rome,</hi> I inquire not: but if he were at home, I muſt wonder how he could
be ſo long without the noiſe of Chriſt. Certainly, it was a ſign he had a very
irreligious Court, that none of his Followers did ſo much as report to him
the Miracles of our Saviour; who doubtleſs told him many a vain tale the
while. One tells him of his brother <hi>Philip</hi>'s diſcontentment; another relates
the news of the Roman Court; another, the angry threats of <hi>Arethas;</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
flatters him with the admiration of his new miſtreſſe, and diſparagement
of the old: no man ſo much as ſayes, Sir, there is a Prophet in your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
that doeth wonders. There was not a man in his countrey that had not
been aſtoniſhed with the fame of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> yea all <hi>Syria</hi> and the adjoining regions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
rung of it: only <hi>Herod</hi>'s Court heares nothing. Miſerable is that Greatneſs
which keeps men from the notice of Chriſt. How plain is it from hence, that
our Saviour kept aloof from the Court? The auſtere and eremitical harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Chriſt, it ſeems, preacht there oft, and was heard gladly, though at
laſt, to his coſt; whiles our Saviour, who was more ſociable, came not
there. He ſent a meſſage to that Fox, whoſe den he would not approch. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were that he purpoſely forbore, leſt he ſhould give that Tyrant occaſion
to revive and peroſe his fathers ſuſpicion; or whether for that he would not
ſo much honour a place ſo infamouſly graceleſs and diſorder'd; or whether by his
example to teach us the avoidance of outward pomp and glory. Surely <hi>Herod</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
ſaw him not till his death; heard not of him till the death of <hi>John Baptiſt.</hi> And
now his un-intelligence was not more ſtrange then his miſconſtruction; <hi>This
is John Baptiſt, whom I beheaded.</hi> Firſt he doubted, then he reſolved: he
doubted upon others ſuggeſtions; upon his own apprehenſions he reſolved
thus. And though he thought good to ſet a face on it to ſtrangers, unto whom
is was not ſafe to bewray his fear; yet to his domeſticks he freely diſcovered
his thoughts; <hi>This is John Baptiſt.</hi> The troubled Conſcience will many a time
open that to familiars, which it hides from the eyes of others. Shame and fear
meet together in guiltineſs. How could he imagine this to be <hi>John?</hi> That com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
conceit of tranſanimation could have no place here; there could be no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
tranſmigration of Souls into a grown and well-ſtatur'd body. That received
fancy of the Jewes held only in the caſe of conception and birth, not of full age.
What need we ſcan this point, when <hi>Herod</hi> himſelf profeſſes, <hi>He is riſen from
the dead?</hi> He that was a Jew by profeſſion, and knew the ſtory of <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s
bones, of the <hi>Sareptan</hi>'s and <hi>Shunamite</hi>'s ſon, and in all likelihood had now
heard of our Saviours miraculous reſuſcitation of others, might think this
power reflected upon himſelf. Even <hi>Herod,</hi> as bad as he was, believed a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.
Leudneſs of life and practice may ſtand with orthodoxy in ſome
main points of Religion. Who can doubt of this, when <hi>the Devils believe and
tremble?</hi> Where ſhall thoſe men appear whoſe faces are Chriſtian, but their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
hearts Sadducees?</p>
                  <p>Oh the terrors and tortures of a guilty heart! <hi>Herod</hi>'s Conſcience told him
he had offered an unjuſt and cruel violence to an innocent; and now he thinks
that <hi>John</hi>'s ghoſt haunts him. Had it not been for this guilt of his boſome, why
might he not as well have thought that the ſame God whoſe hand is not
ſhortned, had conferred this power of Miracles upon ſome other? Now it
could be no body but <hi>John</hi> that doth theſe wonders: and how can it be
(thinks he) but that this revived Prophet, who doth theſe ſtrange things, will
be revenged on me for his head? He that could give himſelf life, can more
eaſily take mine: how can I eſcape the hands of a now-immortal and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
avenger?</p>
                  <p>A wicked man needs no other tormentor (eſpecially for the ſins of blood)
then his own heart. Revel, O <hi>Herod,</hi> and feaſt, and frolick; and pleaſe thy
ſelf with dances, and triumphs, and paſtimes: thy ſin ſhall be as ſome Fury
that ſhall inviſibly follow thee, and ſcourge thy guilty heart with ſecret la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44233:52"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and upon all occaſions ſhall begin thine Hell within thee. He wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not other ſins, that yet cryed, <hi>Deliver me from blood-guiltineſs, O God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What an honour was done to <hi>John</hi> in this miſpriſion? While that man lived,
the world was apt to think that <hi>John</hi> was the Chriſt: now that <hi>John</hi> is dead,
<hi>Herod</hi> thinks Chriſt to be <hi>John.</hi> God gives to his poor conſcionable ſervants
a kinde of reverence and high reſpect, even from thoſe men that malign
them moſt; ſo as they cannot but venerate whom they hate. Contrarily, no
wit or power can ſhield a leud man from contempt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> did no Miracle in his life, yet now <hi>Herod</hi> thinks he did miracles in
his Reſurrection; as ſuppoſing that a new ſupernatural life brought with it a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſupernatural power. Who can but wonder at the ſtupid partiality of <hi>Herod</hi>
and theſe Jews? They can imagine and yield <hi>John</hi> riſen fron the dead, that
never did miracle, and roſe not; whereas Chriſt, who did infinite miracles,
and roſe from the dead by his almighty power, is not yielded by them to
have riſen. Their over-bountiful miſconceit of the ſervant, is not ſo inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
as their niggardly infidelity to the Maſter. Both of them ſhall convince
and confound them before the face of God. But, oh yet more blockiſh <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod!</hi>
Thy conſcience affrights thee with <hi>John</hi>'s reſurrection, and flies in thy
face for the cruel murder of ſo great a Saint; yet where is thy repentance for
ſo foul a fact? Who would not have exſpected that thou ſhouldeſt hereupon
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> have humbled thy ſelf for thy ſin, and have laboured to make thy peace with
God and him? The greater the fame and power was of him whom thou ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedſt
recovered from thy ſlaughter, the more ſhould have been thy penitence.
Impiety is wont to beſot men, and turn them ſenſeleſs of their own ſafety and
welfare. One would have thought that our firſt Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire <hi>Adam,</hi> when he
found his heart to ſtrike him for his diſobedience, ſhould have run to meet God
upon his knees, and have ſued for pardon of his offence: In ſtead of that, he
runs to hide his head among the buſhes. The caſe is ſtill ours; we inherit
both his ſin and his ſenſleſneſs. Beſides the infinite diſpleaſure of God, wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
makes the heart uncapable of Grace, and impregnable of the means of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Converſion.</p>
                  <p>Even the very firſt act of <hi>Herod</hi>'s cruelty was hainous. He was foul enough
with other ſins; <hi>he added this above all, that he ſhut up John in priſon.</hi> The
violence offered to God's meſſengers is branded for notorious. The Sanctity
and auſtere carriage of the man won him honour juſtly from the multitude,
and aggravated the ſin: but whatever his perſon had been, his miſſion was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
(<hi>he ſhall ſend his meſſenger;</hi> the wrong redounds to the God that ſent him.
It is the charge of God, <hi>Touch not mine anointed, nor doe my Prophets any harm.</hi>
The precept is perhaps one, for even Prophets were anointed; but at leaſt
next to violation of Majeſty, is the wrong to a Prophet. But what? do I not
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hear the Evangeliſt ſay that <hi>Herod heard John gladly?</hi> How is it then? Did
<hi>John</hi> take the ear and heart of <hi>Herod,</hi> and doth <hi>Herod</hi> binde the hands and feet
of <hi>John?</hi> Doth he wilfully impriſon whom he gladly heard? How inconſtant
is a carnal heart to good reſolutions? How little truſt is to be given to the
good motions of unregenerate perſons? We have known when even mad dogs
have fawned upon their maſter, yet he hath been too wiſe to truſt them but in
chains. As a true friend loves alwaies, ſo a gracious heart alwaies affects good:
neither can be altered with change of occurrences. But the carnal man, like
an hollow Paraſite or a fawning Spaniel, flatters onely for his own turn; if
that be once either ſerved or croſſed, like a churliſh curre, he is ready to ſnatch
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> us by the fingers. Is there a worldly-minded man that lives in ſome known
ſin, yet makes much of the Preacher, frequents the Church, talks godly, looks
demurely, carries fair? truſt him not; he will prove, after his pious fits, like
ſome reſty horſe, which goes on ſome paces readily and eagerly, but anon either
ſtands ſtill, or falls to flinging and plunging, and never leaves till he have caſt
his rider.</p>

is leſs impetuous. Indeed thoſe that have determined to love their ſins
more then their Soules, whom can they care for? Though <hi>Herod</hi> was

                  <p>Yet ſtill is this Dame called the wife of <hi>Philip.</hi> She had utterly left his bed,
and was ſolemnly coupled to <hi>Herod;</hi> but all the ritual ceremonies of her new

That rough-hewn Preacher was for a Wilderneſs, not for a Court: <hi>Herod</hi>'s
invitation drew him thither, his reverence and reſpects incouraged him there.
Now the love of his Luſt hath carried him into an hate of Gods Meſſenger.
That man can have no hold of himſelf or care of others, who hath given the

fact: neither could he but ſee how odious it would ſeem to perſecute a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

brands <hi>John</hi> with Sedition: theſe preſumptuous taxations are a diſgrace and

if they might but appear in their true ſhape.</p>
                  <p>The fact of <hi>Herod</hi> was horrible and prodigious; to rob his own Brother of
the partner of his bed; to teare away part of his fleſh, yea his body from his
head. So as here was at once in one act, Adultery, Inceſt, Violence. Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
that he took anothers wife; Inceſt, that he took his Brother's; Violence,
that he thus took her, in ſpight of her Husband. Juſtly therefore might <hi>John</hi>
ſay, <hi>It is not lawful for thee.</hi> He balked not one of <hi>Herod</hi>'s ſins, but reproved
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> him of all the evils that he had done; though more eminently of this, as that
which more filled the eye of the world. It was not the Crown or awful Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> What an abſurd and ſottiſh thing is Hypocriſy? <hi>Herod</hi> feares the people, he
feares not God. Tell me then, <hi>Herod,</hi> what could the people doe at the worſt?
Perhaps, mutiny againſt thee, raiſe arms and tumults, diſturb the Government,
it may be, ſhake it off.</p>
                  <p>What could God doe? yea, what not? ſtirre up all his creatures to plague
thee, and when he hath done, tumble thee down to Hell, and there torment thee
everlaſtingly. O fond <hi>Herod,</hi> that feareſt where no fear was, and feareſt not
where there is nothing but terrour!</p>
                  <p>How God fits lewd men with reſtraints? If they be ſo godleſs as to regard
his creature above himſelf, he hath external buggs to affright them withall;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> if baſhful, he hath ſhame; if covetous, loſſes; if proud, diſgrace: and by this
meanes the moſt wiſe Providence keeps the world in order. We cannot better
judge of our hearts, then by what we moſt fear.</p>
                  <p>No man is ſo great as to be utterly exempted from fear. The Jews feared
<hi>Herod; Herod</hi> feared the Jews: the healthful fear ſickneſs; the free ſervitude:
the people fear a Tyrants oppreſſion and cruelty; the Tyrant fears the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

mutiny and inſurrection. If there have been ſome ſo great as to be above <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
the reach of the power and machinations of inferiours, yet never any that have
been free from their fears and ſuſpicions. Happy is he that fears nothing but
what he ſhould, God.</p>
                  <p>Why did <hi>Herod</hi> fear the people? <hi>They held John for a Prophet.</hi> And this
opinion was both common and conſtant: even the Scribes and Phariſees durſt
not ſay, his Baptiſme was from men. It is the wiſdome and goodneſs of God,
ever to give his children favour ſomewhere. If <hi>Jezebel</hi> hate <hi>Elias, Ahab</hi> ſhall
for the time honour him: and if <hi>Herod</hi> hate the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and would kill him, yet
the people reverence him. <hi>Herod</hi>'s malice would make him away; the peoples
reputation keeps him alive. As wiſe Princes have been content to maintain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
a faction in their Court or State for their own purpoſes; ſo here did the God
of Heaven contrive and order differences of judgment and affection betwixt
<hi>Herod</hi> and his ſubjects for his own holy ends. Elſe certainly, if all wicked men
ſhould conſpire in evil, there could be no being upon earth; as contrarily, if
evil ſpirits did not accord, Hell could not ſtand. Oh the unjuſt and fond par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
of this people! They all generally applaud <hi>John</hi> for a Prophet, yet they
receive not his meſſage. Whoſe Prophet was <hi>John,</hi> but of the Higheſt? what
was his errand, but to be the way-maker unto Chriſt? what was he but the
Voice of that Eternal Word of his Father? what was the found of that
Voice but, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God: He that comes after me is greater then I,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
whoſe ſhoe-latchet I am not worthy to unloſe?</hi> Yet they honour the ſervant, and

How could they but argue, <hi>John</hi> is a Prophet; he ſpeaks from God; his words
muſt be true; he tells us this is the Lamb of God, the <hi>Meſsias</hi> that ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to redeem the World: this muſt then needs be he; we will look for no other?
Yet this perverſe people receives <hi>John,</hi> and rejects <hi>Jeſus.</hi> There is ever an
abſurdity in unbelief, whiles it ſeparates thoſe relations and reſpects which
can never in Nature be disjoyned. Thus it readily apprehends God as merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in pardoning, not as juſt in puniſhing; Chriſt as a Saviour, not as a Judge.
Thus we ordinarily (in a contrariety to theſe Jews) profeſſe to receive the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
and contemn the ſervants: whiles he hath ſaid that will make it good,
<hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which <hi>Herod</hi> in policie durſt not, in wine he dares doe: And that which
God had reſtrained till his own time, now in his own time he permits to be
done. The day was, as one of the Evangeliſts ſtyles it, <hi>convenient:</hi> if for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of <hi>Herodias,</hi> I am ſure for God's; who having determined to glorifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by <hi>John</hi>'s martyrdom, will caſt it upon a time when it may be moſt notified,
<hi>Herod</hi>'s <hi>birth-day.</hi> All the Peers of the Country, perhaps of the neighbour Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
are now aſſembled. <hi>Herodias</hi> could not have found out a time more fit to
blazon her own ſhame and cruelty then in ſuch a confluence. The wiſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
of God many times pays us with our own choice; ſo as when we think
to have brought about our own Ends to our beſt content, we bring about his
purpoſes to our own confuſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Herod</hi>'s birth-day is kept; and ſo was <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s: both of them with blood.
Theſe perſonal ſtains cannot make the practice unlawful. Where the man is
good, the Birth is memorable.</p>
                  <p>What bleſſing have we, if life be none? and if our life be a bleſſing, why ſhould
it not be celebrated? Exceſs and diſorder may blemiſh any Solemnity; but that
cleaves to the act, not to the inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Herod</hi>'s birth-day was kept with a feaſt, and this Feaſt was a Supper. It was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
fit to be a night-work: this Feſtivity was ſpent in works of darkneſs, not of the
light; it was a childe of darkneſs that was then born, not of the day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thoſe that are drunken, are drunk in the night.</hi> There is a kinde of ſhame in
Sin, even where it is committed with the ſtiffeſt reſolution, at leaſt there was
wont to be: if now Sin be grown impudent, and Juſtice baſhful, woe be to us.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> That there might be perfect revels at <hi>Herod</hi>'s Birth-day, beſides the Feaſt,
there is muſick and dancing, and that by <hi>Salome</hi> the daughter of <hi>Herodias.</hi> A
meet Daughter for ſuch a Mother, bred according to the diſpoſition of ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt
a Parent. Dancing in it ſelf, as it is a ſet, regular, harmonious motion of
the body, cannot be unlawful, more then walking or running; Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
may make it ſinful. The wanton geſticulations of a Virgin in a wild aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
of Gallants warmed with wine, could be no other then riggiſh and
unmaidenly. It is not ſo frequently ſeen that the child follows the good
Qualities of the Parent; it is ſeldom ſeen that it follows not the evil. Nature
is the ſoyle; good and ill Qualities are the herbs and weeds: the ſoyle bears
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the weeds naturally, the herbs not without culture. What with traduction, what
with education, it were ſtrange if we ſhould miſs any of our Parents miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Herodias</hi> and <hi>Salome</hi> have what they deſired. The dance pleaſed <hi>Herod</hi> well:
thoſe indecent motions that would have diſpleaſed any modeſt eye, (though
what ſhould a modeſt eye doe at <hi>Herod</hi>'s Feaſt?) over-pleaſed <hi>Herod.</hi> Well did
<hi>Herodias</hi> know how to fit the tooth of her Paramour, and had therefore pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
ſo compoſed the carriage and geſture of her Daughter, as it might take
beſt: although doubtleſs the ſame action could not have ſo pleaſed from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>Herod</hi> ſaw in <hi>Salome</hi>'s face and faſhion, the image of her whom he doted
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> on; ſo did ſhe look, ſo did ſhe move: beſides that his laviſh cups had prediſpoſed
him to wantonneſs: and now he cannot but like well that which ſo pleaſingly
ſuted his inordinate deſire. All humours love to be fed; eſpecially the vicious,
ſo much more, as they are more eager and ſtirring. There cannot be a better
glaſs wherein to diſcern the face of our hearts, then our Pleaſures: ſuch as they
are, ſuch are we, whether vain, or holy.</p>
                  <p>What a ſtrange tranſportation was this? <hi>Whatſoever thou ſhalt ask:</hi> half a
Kingdom for a dance? <hi>Herod,</hi> this paſtime is over-pay'd for; there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
in this remuneration; this is not bounty, it is prodigence. Neither
doth this paſs under a bare Promiſe onely, but under an Oath, and that ſolemn
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and (as it might be in wine) ſerious. How largely do ſenſual men both profer
and give for a little momentany and vain contentment? How many cenſure
<hi>Herod</hi>'s groſs impotence, and yet ſecond it with a worſe giving away their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Souls for a ſhort pleaſure of ſin? What is half a Kingdom, yea a whole
World, to a Soul? So much therefore is their madneſs greater, as their loſs
is more.</p>
                  <p>So large a boon was worthy of a deliberation. <hi>Salome</hi> conſults with her
Mother upon ſo ample and ratified a promiſe. Yet ſo much good nature and
filial reſpect was in this wanton Damſel, that ſhe would not carve her ſelf of
her option, but takes her Mother with her. If <hi>Herodias</hi> were infamouſly
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> lewd, yet ſhe was her Parent, and muſt direct her choice. Children ſhould have
no will of their own; as their fleſh is their Parents, ſo ſhould their will be.
They do juſtly unchild themſelves, that in main elections diſpoſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
without the conſent of thoſe which gave them being. It is both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly
and unnatural in the Child to run before, without, againſt the will of
the Parent.</p>
                  <p>Oh that we could be ſo officious to our good and Heavenly Father, as ſhe
was to an earthly and wicked Mother; not to ask, not to undertake ought
without his allowance, without his directions: that when the world ſhall
offer us whatſoever our heart deſires, we could run to the Oracles of God
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> for our reſolution; not daring to accept what he doth not both licenſe and
warrant.</p>
                  <p>Oh the wonderful ſtrength of malice! <hi>Salome</hi> was offered no leſs then
half the Kingdom of <hi>Herod,</hi> yet chuſes to ask the head of a poor Preacher.
Nothing is ſo ſweet to a corrupt heart as revenge; eſpecially when it may
bring with it a full ſcope to a dear ſin. All worldlings are of this diet:
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:44233:55"/>
they had rather ſin freely for a while and dye, then refrain and live happily,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
eternally.</p>
                  <p>What a ſuit was this? <hi>Give me here in a Charger the head of John Baptiſt.</hi> It is
not enough for her to ſay, Let <hi>John</hi>'s head be cut off; but, <hi>Give me it in a
Charger.</hi> What a ſervice was here to be brought into a Feaſt, eſpecially to a
Woman? a dead mans head ſwimming in blood. How cruel is a wicked heart,
that can take pleaſure in thoſe things which have moſt horrour?</p>
                  <p>Oh the importunity of a galled conſcience! <hi>Herodias</hi> could never think her
ſelf ſafe till <hi>John</hi> was dead; ſhe could never think him dead till his head were
off; ſhe could not think his head was off, till ſhe had it brought her in a platter:
a guilty heart never thinks it hath made ſure enough. Yea, even after the head <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
was thus brought, they thought him alive again. Guiltineſs and Security could
never lodge together in one boſome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Herod</hi> was ſorry, and no doubt in earneſt; in the midſt of his cups and
pleaſance. I ſhould rather think his jollity counterfeited then his grief. It is
true, <hi>Herod</hi> was a fox; but that ſubtile beaſt diſſembles not always: when he
runs away from the dogs, he means as he does. And if he were formerly willing
to have killed <hi>John,</hi> yet he was unwillingly willing; and ſo farre as he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to kill him as a Prophet, as a juſt man, ſo farre was he ſorry that he
muſt be killed. Had <hi>Herod</hi> been wiſe, he had not been perplexed. Had he been
ſo wiſe as to have ingaged himſelf lawfully and within due limits, he had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
not now been ſo intangled as to have needed ſorrow. The folly of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
is guilty of their pain, and draws upon them a late and unprofitable
repentance.</p>
                  <p>But here the act was not paſt, though the word were paſt. It was his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceived
intanglement that cauſed this ſorrow; which might have been reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
by flying off. A threefold cord tyed him to the performance. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of his Oath, the reſpect to his gueſts, a loathneſs to diſcontent <hi>Herodias</hi>
and her daughter. <hi>Herod</hi> had ſo much religion as to make ſcruple of an Oath;
not ſo much as to make ſcruple of a Murder. No man caſts off all Juſtice and
Piety at once; but whiles he gives himſelf over to ſome ſins, he ſticks at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
others. It is no thank to lewd men that they are not univerſally vicious. All
God's ſeveral laws cannot be violated at once: there are Sins contrary to each
other; there are Sins diſagreeing from the lewdeſt diſpoſitions. There are
Oppreſſors that hate Drunkenneſs; there are Unclean perſons which abhorre
Murder; there are Drunkards which hate Cruelty. One ſin is enough to
damn the Soul, one leak to drown the Veſſel.</p>
                  <p>But, oh fond <hi>Herod!</hi> what needed this unjuſt ſcrupulouſneſs? Well and ſafely
mighteſt thou have ſhifted the bond of thine Oath with a double evaſion. One,
that this generality of thy promiſe was onely to be conſtrued of lawful acts and
motions: That onely can we doe, which we can juſtly doe; Unlawfulneſs is in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
the nature of Impoſſibility. The other, that had this ingagement been ſo meant,
yet might it be as lawfully reſcinded as it was unlawfully made. A ſinful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
is ill made, worſe performed. Thus thou mighteſt, thou ſhouldeſt have
come off fair; where now, holding thy ſelf by an irreligious religion tyed to
thy fooliſh and wicked Oath; thou onely goeſt away with this mitigation, that
thou art a ſcrupulous Murderer.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, if an <hi>Herod</hi> made ſuch conſcience of keeping an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Oath, how ſhall he in the day of judgement condemn thoſe Chriſtians
which make no conſcience of Oaths lawful, juſt, neceſſary? Wo is me, one
ſels an oath for a bribe, another lends an oath for favour, another caſts it away <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
for malice. I fear to think it may be a queſtion whether there be more oaths
broken, or kept. O God, I marvel not, if being implored as a witneſs, as an
avenger of falſhood, thou hold him not guiltleſs that thus dares take thy Name
in vain.</p>
                  <p>Next to his Oath is the reſpect to his Honour. His gueſts heard his deep en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44233:55"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and now he cannot fall off with reputation. It would argue levity
and raſhneſs to ſay and not to doe, and what would the world ſay? The miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceits
of the points of Honour have coſt millions of Souls. As many a one
doth good onely to be ſeen of men, ſo many a one doth evil onely to ſatisfie
the humour and opinion of others. It is a damnable plauſibility ſo to regard
the vain approbation or cenſure of the beholders, as in the mean time to
neglect the allowance or judgement of God. But how ill gueſts were theſe?
how well worthy of an <hi>Herod</hi>'s table? Had they had but common civility,
finding <hi>Herod</hi> perplexed, they had acquitted him by their diſſwaſions, and would
have diſclaimed the exſpectation of ſo bloody a performance: but they rather
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>(to gratifie <hi>Herodias</hi>) make way for ſo ſlight and eaſie a condeſcent. Even
godly Princes have complained of the iniquity of their heels: how much more
muſt they needs be ill attended, that give incouragements and examples of
leudneſs?</p>
                  <p>Neither was it the leaſt motive that he was loath to diſpleaſe his Miſtreſs.
The Damſel had pleaſed him in her dance; he would not diſcontent her in
breaking his word. He ſaw <hi>Herodias</hi> in <hi>Salome:</hi> the ſuit, he knew, was the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
though in the daughters lips: both would be diſpleaſed in falling off;
both would be gratified in yielding. Oh vain and wicked <hi>Herod!</hi> He cares not
to offend God, to offend his Conſcience; he cares to offend a wanton Miſtreſs.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> This is one means to fill Hell, loathneſs to diſpleaſe.</p>
                  <p>A good heart will rather fall out with all the world then with God, then with
his Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>The miſgrounded ſorrow of worldly hearts doth not withhold them from
their intended ſins. It is enough to vex, not enough to reſtrain them. <hi>Herod</hi>
was ſorry, but he ſends the executioner for <hi>John</hi>'s head. One act hath made
<hi>Herod</hi> a Tyrant, and <hi>John</hi> a Martyr. <hi>Herod</hi> a Tyrant, in that without all legal
proceedings, without ſo much as falſe witneſſes, he takes off the head of a man,
of a Propher. It was Luſt that carried <hi>Herod</hi> into Murder. The proceedings of
ſin are more hardly avoided then the entrance. Whoſo gives himſelf leave to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be wicked, knows not where he ſhall ſtay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> a Martyr, in dying for bearing witneſs to the Truth; Truth in Life,
in Judgement, in Doctrine. It was the holy purpoſe of God, that he which had
baptized with water ſhould now be baptized with blood. Never did God
mean that his beſt Children ſhould dwell alwayes upon earth: ſhould they
ſtay here, wherefore hath he provided Glory above? Now would God
have <hi>John</hi> delivered from a double priſon; of his own, of <hi>Herod</hi>'s; and
placed in the glorious liberty of his ſons. His head ſhall be taken off, that it
may be crowned with glory. <hi>Precious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of
his Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Oh happy birth-day (not of <hi>Herod,</hi> but) of the <hi>Baptiſt!</hi> Now doth <hi>John</hi> enter

indeed, and now grown ſhorter by the head; but he is not ſo much decreaſed in
ſtature, as increaſed in glory. For one minutes pain he is poſſeſſed of endleſs
joy; and as he came before his Saviour into the world, ſo is he gone before him
into Heaven.</p>
                  <p>The head is brought in a Charger. What a diſh was here for a Feaſt? How

                  <p>WHat flocking there was after Chriſt which way ſoever he went? How
did the Kingdome of Heaven ſuffer an holy violence in theſe his
followers? Their importunity drave him from the land to the ſea.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
When he was upon the ſea of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> they followed him with their
eyes; and when they ſaw which way he bent, they followed him ſo faſt on
foot, that they prevented his landing. Whether it were that our Saviour ſtai'd
ſomewhile upon the water (as that which yielded him more quietneſs, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of reſpiration;) or whether the foot-paſſage (as it oft falls out) were the
ſhorter cut, by reaſon of the compaſſes of the water and the many elbows of
the land, I enquire not: ſure I am, the wind did not ſo ſwiftly drive on the ſhip,
as deſire and zeal drave on theſe eager clients. Well did Chriſt ſee them all the
way; well did he know their ſteps, and guided them: and now he purpoſely
goes to meet them, whom he ſeemed to flee. Nothing can pleaſe God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
more then our importunity in ſeeking him: when he withdraws himſelf, it
is that he may be more earneſtly inquired for. Now then he comes to finde
them whom he made ſhew to decline: and ſeeing a great multitude, he paſſes
from the ſhip to the ſhore. That which brought him from Heaven to earth,
brought him alſo from the ſea to land; his compaſſion on their Souls, that
he might teach them; compaſſion on their Bodies, that he might heal and
feed them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Judaea</hi> was not large, but populous: it could not be but there muſt be
amongſt ſo many men many diſeaſed: it is no marvel if the report of ſo mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
and univerſal ſanations drew cuſtomers. They found three advantages <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
of cure above the power and performance of any earthly Phyſician, Certainty,
Bounty, Eaſe. Certainty, in that all comers were cured without fail: Bounty,
in that they were cured without charge: Eaſe, in that they were cured
without pain. Farre be it from us, O Saviour, to think that thy Glory hath
abated of thy Mercy: ſtill and ever thou art our aſſured, bountiful, and perfect
Phyſician, who healeſt all our diſeaſes, and takeſt away all our infirmities. Oh
that we could have our faithful recourſe to thee in all our ſpiritual maladies: it
were as impoſſible we ſhould want help, as that thou ſhouldeſt want power and
mercy.</p>
                  <p>That our Saviour might approve himſelf every way beneficent, he that had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
filled the Souls of his Auditors with ſpiritual repaſt, will now fill their Bodies
with temporal: and he that had approved himſelf the univerſal Phyſician of his
Church, will now be known to be the great houſholder of the world, by whoſe
liberal proviſion mankinde is maintained. He did not more miraculouſly heal,
then he feeds miraculouſly.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> The Diſciples having well noted the diligent and importune attendance of
the multitude, now towards evening come to their Maſter in a care of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt
and diſcharge. <hi>This is a deſart place, and the time is now paſt: Send the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
away, that they may goe into the villages and buy themſelves victuals.</hi> How
well it becomes even ſpiritual guides to regard the bodily neceſſities of God's
people? This is not directly in our charge, neither may we leave our ſacred
miniſtration to ſerve Tables. But yet, as the bodily father muſt take care for
the Soul of his childe; ſo muſt the ſpiritual have reſpect to the Body. This is
all that the world commonly looks after; meaſuring their Paſtors more by
their diſhes then by their doctrine or converſation: as if they had the charge
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of their Bellies, not of their Souls: if they have open Cellars, it matters not
whether their Mouths be open. If they be ſociable in their carriage, favourable
and indulgent to their recreations, full in their chear, how eaſily doth the world
diſpenſe with either their negligence or enormities? As if the Souls of theſe
men lay in their weaſand, in their gut. But ſurely they have reaſon to exſpect
from their Teachers a due proportion of Hoſpitality. An unmeet parſimony is
here not more odious then ſinful: And where ability wants, yet care may not
be wanting. Thoſe Preachers which are ſo intent upon their ſpiritual work,
that in the mean time they over-ſtrain the weakneſſes of their people, holding
them in their Devotions longer then humane frailty will permit, forget not
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> themſelves more then their pattern: and muſt be ſent to ſchool to theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate
Diſciples, who when evening was come, ſue to Chriſt for the peoples
diſmiſſion.</p>
                  <p>The place was deſart; the time, evening. Doubtleſs our Saviour made
choice of both theſe, that there might be both more uſe and more note of his
Miracle. Had it been in the morning, their ſtomack had not been up; their
feeding had been unneceſſary. Had it been in the Village, proviſion either
might have been made, or at leaſt would have ſeemed made by themſelves.
But now that it was both deſart and evening, there was good ground for the
Diſciples to move, and for Chriſt to work their ſuſtentation. Then onely may
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> we exſpect and crave help from God, when we finde our need. Superfluous
aid can neither be heartily deſired, nor earneſtly lookt for, nor thankfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the hands of mercy. <hi>Caſt thy burden upon the Lord, and he ſhall
ſuſtain thee.</hi> If it be not a burden, it is no caſting it upon God. Hence it is
that Divine aid comes ever in the very upſhot and exigence of our trials; when
we have been exerciſed, and almoſt tired with long hopes, yea with deſpairs of
ſucceſs: that it may be both more longed for ere it come, and when it comes
more welcome.</p>
                  <p>Oh the Faith and Zeal of theſe clients of Chriſt! They not only follow him
from the City into the Deſart, from delicacy to want, from frequence to ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> but forget their bodies in purſuit of the food of their Souls.</p>
                  <p>Nothing is more hard for an healthful man to forget then his belly; within
few hours this will be ſure to ſolicit him, and will take no denials. Yet ſuch
ſweetneſs did theſe hearers finde in the ſpiritual repaſt, that they thought not
on the bodily: the Diſciples pitied them, they had no mercy on themſelves.
By how much more a mans minde is taken up with Heavenly things, ſo much
leſs ſhall he care for earthly. What ſhall earth be to us, when we are all Spirit?
And in the mean time, according to the degrees of our intellectual elevations,
ſhall be our neglect of bodily contentments.</p>
                  <p>The Diſciples think they move well: <hi>Send them away, that they may buy
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> victuals.</hi> Here was a ſtrong Charity, but a weak Faith. A ſtrong Charity, in that
they would have the people relieved; a weak Faith, in that they ſuppoſed
they could not otherwiſe be ſo well relieved. As a man when he ſees many
wayes lie before him, takes that which he thinks both faireſt and neareſt;
ſo doe they: this way of relief lay openeſt to their view, and promiſed moſt.
Well might they have thought, It is as eaſie for our Maſter to feed them, as to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44233:57"/>
heal them; there is an equal facility in all things to a ſupernatural power:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
yet they ſay, <hi>Send them away.</hi> In all our projects and ſuits we are ſtill ready to
move for that which is moſt obvious, moſt likely, when ſometimes that is leſs
agreeable to the will of God.</p>
                  <p>The All-wiſe and Almighty arbiter of all things hath a thouſand ſecret
means to honour himſelf in his proceedings with us. It is not for us to carve
boldly for our ſelves; but we muſt humbly depend on the diſpoſal of his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Mercy.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviours anſwer gives a ſtrange check to their motion; <hi>They need not
depart.</hi> Not need? They had no victuals; they muſt have; there was none to
be had. What more need could be? He knew the ſupply which he intended,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
though they knew it not. His command was therefore more ſtrange then his
aſſertion, <hi>Give ye them to eat.</hi> Nothing gives what it hath not. Had they had
victuals, they had not called for a diſmiſſion; and not having, how ſhould they
give? It was thy wiſdom, O Saviour, thus to prepare thy Diſciples for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Miracle: Thou wouldſt not doe it abruptly, without an intimation both
of the purpoſe of it, and the neceſſity. And how modeſtly doſt thou undertake
it, without noiſe, without oſtentation? I hear thee not ſay, I will give them
to eate; but, <hi>Give ye:</hi> as if it ſhould be their act, not thine. Thus ſometimes it
pleaſeth thee to require of us what we are not able to perform; either that
thou maieſt ſhew us what we cannot doe, and ſo humble us; or that thou majeſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
erect us to a dependence upon thee, which canſt doe it for us. As when the
Mother bids the Infant come to her, which hath not yet the ſteddy uſe of
his leggs, it is that he may cling the faſter to her hand or coat for ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>Thou bidſt us, impotent wretches, to keep thy royal Law. Alas! what can
we Sinners doe? there is not one letter of thoſe thy Ten words that we are able
to keep. This charge of thine intends to ſhew us not our ſtrength, but our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Thus thou wouldeſt turn our eyes both back to what we might have
done, to what we could have done; and upwards to thee in whom we have
done it, in whom we can doe it. He wrongs thy Goodneſs and Juſtice that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
miſconſtrues theſe thy commands, as if they were of the ſame nature with
thoſe of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> task-maſters, requiring the brick, and not giving the
ſtraw. But in bidding us doe what we cannot, thou inableſt us to doe what thou
biddeſt. Thy Precepts under the Goſpel have not onely an intimation of our
duty, but an habilitation of thy power: as here, when thou badeſt the Diſciples
to give to the multitude, thou meanteſt to ſupply unto them what thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandedſt to give.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour hath what he would; an acknowledgement of their inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency:
<hi>We have here but five loaves and two fiſhes.</hi> A poor proviſion for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of the Lord of the whole earth: Five loaves, and thoſe barley; two fiſhes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
and thoſe little ones. We well know, O Saviour, that the beaſts were thine on
a thouſand mountains, all the corn thine that covered the whole ſurface of
the earth, all the fouls of the aire thine; it was thou that providedſt thoſe
drifts of Quails that fell among the tents of thy rebellious <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that
rainedſt down thoſe ſhowrs of Manna round about their camp: and doſt thou
take up (for thy ſelf and thy meiny) with <hi>five barly loaves, and two little fiſhes?</hi>
Certainly this was thy will, not thy need: to teach us, that this body muſt be
fed, not pampered. Our <hi>belly</hi> may not be our maſter, much leſs our <hi>God;</hi> or
if it be, the next word is, <hi>whoſe glory is their ſhame, whoſe end damnation.</hi>
It is noted as the crime of the rich glutton, that <hi>he fared deliciouſly every day.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
I never finde that Chriſt entertained any gueſts but twice; and that was
onely with loaves and fiſhes. I finde him ſometimes feaſted by others more
liberally. But his domeſtical fare how ſimple, how homely it is? The end of
food is to ſuſtain Nature. Meat was ordained for the belly, the belly for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
the body for the Soul, the Soul for God: we muſt ſtill look through the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44233:57"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſubordinate Ends to the higheſt. To reſt in the pleaſure of the meat, is for
thoſe creatures which have no Soules. Oh the extreme delicacy of theſe
times! What conquiſition is here of all ſorts of curious diſhes from the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt
ſeas and lands, to make up one hours meal? what broken cookery?
what deviſed mixtures? what nice ſauces? what feaſting not of the taſt only, but
of the ſent? Are we the Diſciples of him that took up with the loaves and
fiſhes; or the Scholars of a <hi>Philoxenus,</hi> or an <hi>Apitius,</hi> or <hi>Vitellius,</hi> or thoſe other
monſters of the palate? the true ſons of thoſe firſt Parents that killed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with their teeth?</p>
                  <p>Neither was the quality of theſe victuals more courſe then the quantity
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſmall. They make a <hi>But</hi> of five loaves and two fiſhes; and well might, in reſpect
of ſo many thouſand mouths. A little food to an hungry ſtomack, doth rather
ſtir up appetite then ſatisfie it: as a little rain upon a droughty ſoil doth
rather help to ſcorch then refreſh it. When we look with the eye of Senſe or
Reaſon upon any Object, we ſhall ſee an impoſſibility of thoſe effects which
Faith can eaſily apprehend, and Divine power more eaſily produce. Carnal
mindes are ready to meaſure all our hopes by humane poſſibilities; and when
they fail, to deſpair of ſucceſs: where true Faith meaſures them by Divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and therefore can never be diſheartned. This Grace is for things not ſeen,
and whether beyond hope, or againſt it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> The virtue is not in the means, but in the agent. <hi>Bring them hither to me.</hi>
How much more eaſie had it been for our Saviour to fetch the loaves to him,
then to multiply them? The hands of the Diſciples ſhall bring them, that they
might more fully witneſs both the Author, and manner of the inſtant Miracle.
Had the loaves and fiſhes been multiplied without this bringing, perhaps they
might have ſeemed to have come by the ſecret proviſion of the gueſts;
now there can be no queſtion either of the act, or of the agent. As God takes
pleaſure in doing wonders for men, ſo he loves to be acknowledged in the
great works that he doth. He hath no reaſon to part with his own glory; that
is too pretious for him to loſe, or for his creature to embezel. And how juſtly
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> didſt thou, O Saviour, in this mean to teach thy Diſciples, that it was thou
only who feedeſt the world; and upon whom both themſelves and all their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures
muſt depend for their nouriſhment and proviſion; and that if it
came not through thy hands, it could not come to theirs?</p>
                  <p>There need no more words. I do not hear the Diſciples ſtand upon the
terms of their own neceſſity; Alas! Sir, it is too little for our ſelves; whence
ſhall we then relieve our own hunger? Give leave to our Charity to begin at
home. But they willingly yield to the command of their Maſter; and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon his Providence for the ſequel. When we have a charge from God,
it is not for us to ſtand upon ſelf-reſpects; in this caſe there is no ſuch ſure
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> liberty as in a ſelf-contempt. O God, when thou calleſt to us for our five
loaves, we muſt forget our own intereſt: otherwiſe if we be more thriſty then
obedient, our good turns evil; and much better had it been for us to have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that which we withhold from the owner.</p>
                  <p>He that is the Maſter of the Feaſt marſhals the gueſts; <hi>He commanded the
multitude to ſit down on the graſs.</hi> They obey, and exſpect. Oh marvelous
Faith! So many thouſands ſit down, and addreſs themſelves to a meal, when
they ſaw nothing but five poor barly loaves and two ſmall fiſhes. None of
them ſay, Sit down? to what? Here are the mouths, but where is the meat?
We can ſoon be ſet, but whence ſhall we be ſerved? Ere we draw our knives,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> let us ſee our chear. But they meekly and obediently diſpoſe themſelves to
their places, and look up to Chriſt for a miraculous purveyance. It is for all
that would be Chriſts followers, to lead the life of Faith; and, even where
means appear not, to wait upon that merciful hand. Nothing is more eaſy
then to truſt God when our barns and coffers are full; and to ſay, <hi>Give us our
daily bread,</hi> when we have it in our cupbord. But when we have nothing,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44233:58"/>
when we know not how or whence to get any thing, then to depend upon an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
inviſible bounty, this is a true and noble act of Faith. To caſt away our own
that we may immediately live upon Divine Providence, I know no warrant.
But when the neceſſity is of God's making, we ſee our refuge; and happy are
we if our confidence can fly to it, and reſt in it. Yea fulneſs ſhould be a Curſe,
if it ſhould debarre us from this dependence: at our beſt we muſt look up to
this great houſholder of the world, and cannot but need his proviſion. If we
have meat, perhaps not appetite; if appetite, it may be not digeſtion; or if that,
not health, and freedome from pain; or if that, (perhaps from other occurrents)
not life.</p>
                  <p>The gueſts are ſet full of expectation. He that could have multiplied the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
bread in abſence, in ſilence takes it and bleſſes it; that he might at once ſhew
them the Author and the means of this increaſe. It is thy bleſſing, O God,
that maketh rich. What a difference do we ſee in mens eſtates? Some lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
under great means, and injoy not either their ſubſtance or themſelves;
others are chearful and happy in a little. Second cauſes may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
their work; but the over-ruling power is above. The ſubordinateneſs
of the creature doth not take away from the right, from the thank of the
firſt mover.</p>
                  <p>He could as well have multiplied the loaves whole; why would he rather do
it in the breaking? Was it to teach us that in the diſtribution of our goods we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
ſhould exſpect his bleſſing, not in their intireneſs and reſervation? <hi>There is that
ſcattereth, and yet increaſeth,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon:</hi> Yea there is no man but increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
by ſcattering. It is the grain thrown into the ſeverall furrows of the
earth, which yields the rich intereſt unto the Husbandman: that which is
tyed up in his ſack, or heaped in his granary, decreaſeth by keeping. <hi>He that
ſoweth liberally ſhall reap liberally.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Away with our weak diſtruſt. If Wealth came by us, giving were the way
to want: now that God gives to the giver, nothing can ſo ſure inrich us as
our beneficence. He multiplied the bread not to keep, but to give; <hi>He gave
it to the Diſciples.</hi> And why not rather by his own hand to the multitude, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
ſo the Miracle and thank might have been more immediate? Wherefore was
this, O Saviour, but that thou mighteſt win reſpect to thy Diſciples from the
people? As great Princes, when they would ingratiate a Favorite, paſs no ſuits
but through his hands. What an honour was this to thy ſervants, that as thou
wert Mediatour betwixt thy Father and man, ſo thou wouldeſt have them in
ſome beneficial occaſion mediate betwixt men and thee? How fit a type is
this of thy ſpiritual proviſion, that thou who couldeſt have fed the world by
thine immediate word, wouldſt by the hands of thy Miniſters divide the bread
of life to all hearers? Like as it was with the Law; well did the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſee
and hear that thou couldſt deliver that dreadful meſſage with thine own mouth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
yet in favour of their weakneſs thou wouldſt treat with them by a <hi>Moſes.</hi> Uſe
of means derogates nothing from the efficacy of the principal Agent, yea adds
to it. It is a ſtrange weakneſs of our ſpiritual eyes, if we can look but to the
next hand. How abſurd had theſe gueſts been, if they had termined the
thanks in the ſervitours, and had ſaid, We have it from you, whence ye had
it is no part of our care: we owe this favour to you; if you owe it to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
acknowledge your obligations to him, as we do unto you. But ſince they
well knew that the Diſciples might have handled this bread long enough ere
any ſuch effect could have followed, they eaſily finde to whom they are behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
Our Chriſtian wiſdome muſt teach us, whoſoever be the meanes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
our main thanks for the Author of our good.</p>
                  <p>He gave the bread then to his Diſciples, not to eat, not to keep, but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute.
It was not their particular benefit he regarded in this gift, but the
good of many.</p>
                  <p>In every Feaſt each ſervitour takes up his diſh, not to carry it aſide into a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44233:58"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> corner for his own private repaſt; but to ſet it before the gueſts, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his Maſter: when they have done, his chear begins. What ſhall we
ſay to thoſe injurious waiters, who fatten themſelves with thoſe concealed
meſſes which are meant to others? Their table is made their ſnare; and theſe
ſtoln morſels cannot but end in bitterneſs.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly the Diſciples ſet this fare before the gueſts. I do not ſee ſo
much as <hi>Judas</hi> reſerve a ſhare to himſelf, whether out of hunger or diſtruſt.
Had not our Saviour commanded ſo free a diſtribution, their ſelf-love would
eaſily have taught them where to begin. Nature ſaies, Firſt thy ſelf, then thy
friends: either extremity or particular charge gives Grace occaſion to alter the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> caſe. Far be it from us to think we have any claim in that which the owner
gives us merely to beſtow.</p>
                  <p>I know not now whether more to wonder at the miraculous eating, or the
miraculous leaving. Here were a whole hoſt of gueſts, five thouſand men;
and in all likelihood no fewer women and children. Perhaps ſome of theſe only
look'd on. Nay, <hi>they did all eate.</hi> Perhaps every man a crum, or a bit. Nay,
they did eat to ſatiety; <hi>all were ſatisfied.</hi> So many muſt needs make clean
work; of ſo little there could be left nothing. Yea, there were <hi>fragments</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining.
Perhaps ſome crums or cruſts, hardly to be diſcerned, much leſs ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.
Nay, <hi>twelve baskets full:</hi> more remained then was firſt ſet down.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Had they eaten nothing, it was a juſt Miracle that ſo much ſhould be left;
had nothing remained, it was no leſs Miracle that ſo many had eaten, and ſo
many ſatisfied: but now that ſo many bellies and ſo many baskets were filled,
the Miracle was doubled. Oh work of a boundleſs Omnipotency! Whether
this were done by creation or by converſion, uſes to be queſtioned; but needs
not. Whiles Chriſt multiplies the bread, it is not for us to multiply his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.
To make ought of nothing, is more then to adde much unto ſomething.
It was therefore rather by turning of a former matter into theſe ſubſtances, then
by making theſe ſubſtances of nothing.</p>
                  <p>Howſoever, here is a marvelous proviſion made, a marvelous bounty of that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> proviſion, a no leſs marvelous extent of that bounty.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that depend upon God, and buſy themſelves in his work, ſhall not
want a due purveyance in the very deſart. Our ſtreight and confined bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
reaches ſo farre as to provide for our own: thoſe of our Domeſticks
which labour in our ſervice do but juſtly expect and challenge their diet;
whereas day-labourers are oft-times at their own finding. How much more
will that God who is infinite in mercy and power, take order for the liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of thoſe that attend him? We ſee the birds of the aire provided for
by him; how rarely have we found any of them dead of hunger? yet what
doe they but what they are carried unto by natural inſtinct? How much more
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> where, beſides propriety, there is a rational and willing ſervice? Shall the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
be fed with Manna, <hi>Eliah</hi> by the Ravens, the Widow by her mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied
meal and oyle, Chriſts clients in the wilderneſs with loaves and fiſhes?
O God, whiles thou doſt thus promerit us by thy Providence, let not us
wrong thee by diſtruſt.</p>
                  <p>God's undertakings cannot but be exquiſite; thoſe whom he profeſſes to feed
muſt needs have enough. The meaſure of his bounty cannot but run over.
Doth he take upon him to prepare a table for his <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the deſart? the bread
ſhall be the food of Angels, the fleſh ſhall be the delicates of Princes, Manna
and Quails. Doth he take upon him to make wine for the marriage-feaſt of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                     <hi>Cana?</hi> there ſhall be both ſtore and choice; the vintage yields poor ſtuff to
this. Will he feaſt his Auditors in the wilderneſs? if they have not dainties,
they ſhall have plenty; <hi>They were all ſatisfied.</hi> Neither yet, O Saviour, is thy
hand cloſed. What abundance of heavenly doctrine doſt thou ſet before us?
how are we feaſted, yea pampered with thy celeſtial delicacies? Not according
to our meanneſs, but according to thy ſtate, are we fed. Thrifty and niggard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44233:59"/>
collations are not for Princes. We are full of thy goodneſs; oh, let our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
hearts run over with thanks.</p>
                  <p>I do gladly wonder at this Miracle of thine, O Saviour, yet ſo as that I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
not mine own condition. Whence is it that we have our continual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion?
One and the ſame munificent hand doth all. If the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were fed
with Manna in the deſart, and with corn in <hi>Canaan,</hi> both were done by the
ſame power and bounty. If the Diſciples were fed by the loaves multiplied,
and we by the grain multiplied, both are the act of one Omnipotence. What
is this but a perpetual miracle, O God, which thou workeſt for our preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Without thee, there is no more power in the grain to multiply then
in the loaf: it is thou that <hi>giveſt it a body at thy pleaſure, even to every <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
ſeed his own body;</hi> it is thou that <hi>giveſt fulneſs of bread and cleanneſs of
teeth.</hi> It is no reaſon thy goodneſs ſhould be leſs magnified becauſe it is
univerſal.</p>
                  <p>One or two baskets could have held the five loaves and two fiſhes; not
leſs then twelve can hold the remainders. The Divine munificence provides
not for our neceſſity only, but for our abundance, yea ſuperfluity. Envy and
ignorance, whiles they make God the author of enough, are ready to impute
the ſurpluſſage to another cauſe; as we commonly ſay of wine, that the liquor
is God's, the exceſs Satan's.</p>
                  <p>Thy table, O Saviour, convinces them, which had more taken away then ſet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
on: thy Bleſſing makes an eſtate not competent only, but rich. I hear of barns
full of plenty, and preſſes burſting out with new wine, as the rewards of thoſe
that honour thee with their ſubſtance. I hear of heads anointed with oyle, and
cups running over. O God, as thou haſt a free hand to give, ſo let us have a free
heart to return thee the praiſe of thy Bounty.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe fragments were left behind. I do not ſee the people, when they had
filled their bellies, cramming their pockets, or ſtuffing their wallets; yet the
place was deſart, and ſome of them doubtleſs had farre home.</p>
                  <p>It becomes true Diſciples to be content with the preſent, not too ſolicitous
for the future. O Saviour, thou didſt not bid us beg bread for to morrow,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
but for to day: not that we ſhould refuſe thy bounty when thou pleaſeſt to
give; but that we ſhould not diſtruſt thy Providence for the need we may
have.</p>
                  <p>Even theſe fragments (though but of barley loaves and fiſh-bones) may not
be left in the deſart, for the compoſt of that earth whereon they were increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
but by our Saviours holy and juſt command are gathered up. The liberal
houſekeeper of the world will not allow the loſs of his orts: the childrens
bread may not be given to dogs: and if the crums fall to their ſhare, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their ſmalneſs admits not of a collection. If thoſe who out of obedience
or due thrift have thought to gather up crums, have found them pearls, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
not: Surely both are alike the good creatures of the ſame Maker; and
both of them may prove equally coſtly to us in their wilful miſpence. But
oh, what ſhall we ſay, that not cruſts and crums, not loaves and diſhes and
cups, but whole patrimonies are idly laviſht away; not merely loſt, (this were
more eaſie) but ill ſpent in a wicked riot upon dice, drabs, drunkards? Oh the
fearful account of theſe unthrifty Bailifs, which ſhall once be given in to our
great Lord and Maſter, when he ſhall call us to a ſtrict reckoning of all our ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents!
He was condemned that increaſed not the ſum concredited to him; what
ſhall become of him that lawleſly impairs it?</p>
                  <p>Who gathered up theſe fragments but the twelve Apoſtles, every one his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>

of Chriſt, they waited on the Tables, they took away.</p>
                  <p>It was our Saviours juſt care that thoſe offals ſhould not periſh: but he
well knew that a greater loſs depended upon thoſe ſcraps; a loſs of glory to
the omnipotent worker of that Miracle. The feeding of the multitude was but

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the one half of the work, the other half was in the remnant. Of all other it
moſt concerns the ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles to take care that the marvelous
works of their God and Saviour may be improved to the beſt; they may
not ſuffer a cruſt or crum to be loſt that may yield any glory to that Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
agent.</p>
                  <p>Here was not any morſel or bone that was not worthy to be a relick; every
the leaſt parcel whereof was no other then miraculous. All the antient monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Gods ſupernatural power and mercy were in the keeping of <hi>Aaron</hi>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> with this overſight. Wo be to us if we care only to gather up our own

went. There was never errand whereon they went unwillingly: only now
he conſtrained them to depart. We may eaſily conceive how loth they were
to leave him; whether out of love, or of common civility. <hi>Peter</hi>'s tongue did
but (when it was) ſpeak the heart of the reſt; <hi>Maſter, thou knoweſt that I love</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                     <hi>thee.</hi> Who could chuſe but be in love with ſuch a Maſter? and who can
willingly part from what he loves? But had the reſpects been only common
and ordinary, how unfit might it ſeem to leave a Maſter now towards night,
in a wild place, amongſt ſtrangers, unprovided of the means of his paſſage?
Where otherwiſe therefore he needed but to bid, now he conſtrains. O Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
it was ever thy manner to call all men unto thee; <hi>Come to me, all that
labour and are heavy laden.</hi> When didſt thou ever drive any one from thee?
Neither had it been ſo now, but to draw them cloſer unto thee, whom thou ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medſt
for the time to abdicate. In the mean while, I know not whether more
to excuſe their unwillingneſs, or to applaud their obedience. As it ſhall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> above, ſo it was proportionally here below; <hi>In thy preſence</hi> (O Saviour) <hi>is
the fulneſs of joy.</hi> Once, when thou askedſt theſe thy Domeſticks whether they
alſo would depart, it was anſwered thee by one tongue for all, <hi>Maſter, whither
ſhould we goe from thee? thou haſt the words of eternal life.</hi> What a death was
it then to them to be compelled to leave thee? Sometimes it pleaſeth the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
goodneſs to lay upon his ſervants ſuch commands as ſavour of harſhneſs
and diſcomfort; which yet both in his intention and in the event are no other
then gracious and ſoveraign. The more difficulty was in the charge, the more
praiſe was in the obedience. I do not hear them ſtand upon the terms of capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation
with their Maſter, nor pleading importunately for their ſtay; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> upon the command they yield and goe. We are never perfect Diſciples
till we can depart from our reaſon, from our will; yea (O Saviour) when thou
biddeſt us, from thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Neither will the multitude be gone without a diſmiſſion. They had follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him whiles they were hungry, they will not leave him now they are fed.
Fain would they put that honour upon him, which to avoid he is fain to avoid
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44233:60"/>
them: gladly would they pay a Kingdome to him as their ſhot for their late <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
banquet; he ſhuns both it and them. O Saviour, when the hour of thy Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
was now come, thou couldſt offer thy ſelf readily to thine apprehenders;
and now when the glory of the world preſſes upon thee, thou runneſt away
from a Crown. Was it to teach us that there is leſs danger in ſuffering then in
outward proſperity? What do we dote upon that worldly honour, which thou
heldeſt worthy of avoidance and contempt?</p>
                  <p>Beſides this reſervedneſs, it was devotion that drew <hi>Jeſus</hi> aſide. He went
alone up to the mountain to pray. Lo, thou, to whom the greateſt throng was
a ſolitude in reſpect of the fruition of thy Father, thou who wert uncapable
of diſtraction from him with whom thou wert one, wouldſt yet ſo much act <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
man as to retire for the opportunity of prayer: to teach us, who are nothing
but wilde thoughts and giddy diſtractedneſs, to goe aſide when we would
ſpeak with God. How happy is it for us that thou prayedſt? O Saviour, thou
prayedſt for us, who have not Grace enough to pray for our ſelves; not worth
enough to be accepted when we do pray. Thy prayers which were moſt perfect
and impetrative, are they by which our weak and unworthy prayers receive
both life and favour. And now how aſſiduous ſhould we be in our ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
who are empty of grace, full of wants; when thou, who wert a God of all
power, praiedſt for that which thou couldſt command? Therefore do we pray,
becauſe thou praiedſt: therefore do we exſpect to be graciouſly anſwered in our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
prayers, becauſe thou didſt pray for us here on earth, and now intercedeſt for us
in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>The evening was come; the Diſciples look'd long for their Maſter, and
loath they were to have ſtirred without him: but his command is more then
the ſtrongeſt wind to fill their ſailes, and they are now gone. Their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
made not the evening ſeem ſo long as our Saviours devotion made
it ſeem ſhort to him. He is on the mount, they on the ſea: yet whiles he
was in the mount praying, and lifting up his eyes to his Father, he failes not
to caſt them about upon his Diſciples toſſed on the waves. Thoſe all-ſeeing
eyes admit of no limits. At once he ſees the higheſt Heavens, and the midſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
of the ſea; the glory of his Father, and the miſery of his Diſciples. Whatever
proſpects preſent themſelves to his view, the diſtreſs of his Followers is ever
moſt noted.</p>
                  <p>How much more doſt thou now, O Saviour, from the height of thy glorious
advancement behold us thy wretched ſervants toſſed on the unquiet ſea of this
World, and beaten with the troubleſome and threatning billows of Affliction?
Thou foreſaweſt their toil and danger are thou diſmiſſedſt them, and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
ſendeſt them away that they might be toſſed. Thou that couldeſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
our ſufferings by thy power, wilt permit them in thy wiſdome, that thou
maiſt glorifie thy mercy in our deliverance, and confirm our Faith by the iſſue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
of our diſtreſſes.</p>
                  <p>How do all things now ſeem to conſpire to the vexing of thy poor Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples?
The night was ſullen and dark, their Maſter was abſent, the ſea was
boiſtrous, the windes were high and contrary. Had their Maſter been with
them, howſoever the elements had raged, they had been ſecure. Had their
Maſter been away, yet if the ſea had been quiet or the winds fair, the paſſage
might have been indured. Now both ſeaſon, and ſea, and winde, and their
Maſter's deſertion had agreed to render them perfectly miſerable. Sometimes
the Providence of God hath thought good ſo to order it, that to his beſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
there appeareth no glimpſe of comfort; but ſo abſolute vexation, as if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
Heaven and earth had plotted their full affliction. Yea, O Saviour, what a dead
night, what a fearful tempeſt, what an aſtoniſhing dereliction was that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thou thy ſelf cryedſt out in the bitterneſs of thine anguiſhed Soul, <hi>My God,
my God, why haſt thou for ſaken me?</hi> Yet in all theſe extremities of miſery, our
gracious God intends nothing but his greater glory and ours; the Triumph of
our Faith, the crown of our Victory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:44233:60"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> All that longſome and tempeſtuous night muſt the Diſciples wear out in
danger and horror, as given over to the windes and waves; but in the fourth
watch of the night, when they were wearied out with toils and fears, comes
deliverance.</p>
                  <p>At their entrance into the ſhip, at the ariſing of the tempeſt, at the ſhutting
in of the evening, there was no news of Chriſt: but when they have been all
the night long beaten not ſo much with ſtorms and waves as with their own
thoughts, now in the fourth watch, (which was near to the morning) <hi>Jeſus</hi>
came unto them, and purpoſely not till then; that he might exerciſe their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;
that he might inure them to wait upon Divine Providence in caſes of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> extremity; that their Devotions might be more whetted by delay; that they
might give gladder welcome to their deliverance. O God, thus thou thinkeſt
fit to doe ſtill. We are by turns in our ſea, the windes bluſter, the billows
ſwell, the night and thy abſence heighten our diſcomfort, thy time and ours is
ſet; as yet it is but midnight with us; can we but hold out patiently till the
fourth watch, thou wilt ſurely come and reſcue us. Oh let us not faint under
our ſorrows, but wear out our three watches of tribulation with undaunted
patience and holy reſolution.</p>
                  <p>O Saviour, our extremities are the ſeaſons of thine aide. Thou cameſt at
laſt; but yet ſo, as that there was more dread then joy in thy preſence. Thy
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> coming was both miraculous and frightfull.</p>
                  <p>Thou God of Elements paſſedſt through the aire, walkedſt upon the waters.
Whether thou meanteſt to terminate this Miracle in thy body, or in the waves
which thou trodeſt upon; whether ſo lightning the one, that it ſhould make no
impreſſion in the liquid waters, or whether ſo conſolidating the other, that the
pavemented waves yielded a firm cauſey to thy ſacred feet to walk on, I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
determine nor inquire: thy ſilence ruleth mine; thy power was in either
miraculous; neither know I in whether to adore it more. But withall give me
leave to wonder more at thy paſſage then at thy coming. Wherefore cameſt
thou but to comfort them? and wherefore then wouldeſt thou paſſe by them,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as if thou hadſt intended nothing but their diſmay? Thine abſence could not
be ſo grievous as thy preterition: that might ſeem juſtly occaſioned, this
could not but ſeem willingly neglective. Our laſt conflicts have wont ever to
be the ſoreſt: as when after ſome dreeping rain it powrs down moſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently,
we think the weather is changing to ſerenity.</p>
                  <p>O Saviour, we may not alwaies meaſure thy meaning by thy ſemblance:
ſometimes what thou moſt intendeſt, thou ſheweſt leaſt. In our Afflictions
thou turneſt thy back upon us, and hideſt thy face from us, when thou moſt
mindeſt our diſtreſſes. So <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſhot the arrows beyond <hi>David,</hi> when he
meant them to him. So <hi>Joſeph</hi> calls for <hi>Benjamin</hi> into bonds, when his heart
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> was bound to him in the ſtrongeſt affection. So the tender mother makes as
if ſhe would give away her crying childe, whom ſhe hugs ſo much cloſer in her
boſome.</p>
                  <p>If thou paſſe by us whiles we are ſtrugling with the tempeſt, we know it is
not for want of mercy. Thou canſt not neglect us; Oh let not us diſtruſt thee.</p>
                  <p>What Object ſhould have been ſo pleaſing to the eyes of the Diſciples as
their Maſter; and ſo much the more as he ſhewed his Divine power in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
walk? But lo, contrarily, <hi>they are troubled:</hi> not with his preſence, but
with this form of preſence.</p>
                  <p>The ſupernatural works of God, when we look upon them with our own
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> eyes, are ſubject to a dangerous miſpriſion. The very Sun-beams to whom we
are beholden for our ſight, if we eye them directly, blinde us. Miſerable men!
we are ready to ſuſpect Truths, to run away from our ſafety, to be afraid of our
comforts, to miſ-know our beſt friends.</p>
                  <p>And why are they thus troubled? <hi>They had thought they had ſeen a Spirit.</hi>
That there have been ſuch apparitions of Spirits, both good and evil, hath ever
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44233:61"/>
been a Truth undoubtedly received of Pagans, Jews, Chriſtians; although <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
in the blinde times of Superſtition there was much colluſion mixed with ſome
verities: Crafty men and lying ſpirits agreed to abuſe the credulous world.
But even where there was not Truth, yet there was Horror. The very Good
Angels were not ſeen without much fear; their ſight was conſtrued to bode
Death: how much more the Evil, which in their very nature are harmfull and
pernicious? We ſee not a Snake or a Toad without ſome recoiling of blood &amp;
ſenſible reluctation, although thoſe creatures run away from us: how much
more muſt our hairs ſtand upright and our ſenſes boggle at the ſight of a Spirit,
whoſe both nature &amp; will is contrary to ours, and proteſſedly bent to our hurt?</p>
                  <p>But ſay it had been what they miſtook it for, a Spirit; why ſhould they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
fear? Had they well conſidered, they had ſoon found that evil ſpirits are
nevertheleſſe preſent, when they are not ſeen; and nevertheleſſe harmfull or
malicious, when they are preſent unſeen. Viſibility addes nothing to their
ſpight or miſchief. And could their eyes have been opened, they had, with
<hi>Eliſha</hi>'s ſervant, ſeen <hi>more with</hi> them <hi>then againſt</hi> them; a ſure, though invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
guard of more powerfull Spirits, and themſelves under the protection of
the God of Spirits: ſo as they might have bidden a bold defiance to all the
powers of Darkneſs. But, partly their Faith was yet but in the bud; and partly
the preſentation of this dreadfull Object was ſuddain, and without the reſpite
of a recollection and ſettlement of their thoughts.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh the weakneſs of our frail Nature, who in the want of Faith, are affrighted
with the viſible appearance of thoſe adverſaries whom we profeſſe daily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
and vanquiſh, and with whom we know the Decree of God hath matched
us in an everlaſting conflict! Are not theſe they that ejected Devils by their
command? Are not theſe of them that could ſay, <hi>Maſter, the evil ſpirits are
ſubdued to us?</hi> Yet now when they ſee but an imagined ſpirit, they fear. What
power there is in the eye to betray the heart!</p>
                  <p>Whiles <hi>Goliah</hi> was mingled with the reſt of the <hi>Philiſtin</hi> hoaſt, <hi>Iſrael</hi> cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
boldly againſt them; but when that Giant ſtalks out ſingle between the
two armies, and fills and amaſes their eyes with his hideous ſtature, now they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
run away for fear. Behold, we are committed with Legions of Evil ſpirits, and
complain not: Let but one of them give us ſome viſible token of his preſence,
we ſhreek and tremble, and are not our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Neither is our weakneſs more conſpicuous then thy mercy, O God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining
theſe ſpiritual enemies from theſe dreadfull and ghaſtly repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of themſelves to our eyes. Might thoſe infernal Spirits have liberty to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
how and when and to whom they would, certainly not many would be left
in their wits, or in their lives. It is thy power and goodneſs to frail mankinde
that they are kept in their chains, and reſerved in the darkneſs of their own
ſpiritual being, that we may both oppugn and ſubdue them unſeen.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>But oh the deplorable condition of reprobate ſouls! If but the imagined
ſight of one of theſe Spirits of darkneſs can ſo daunt the heart of thoſe which
are free from their power, what a terror ſhall it be to live perpetually in the
ſight, yea under the torture, of thouſands, of legions, of millions of Devils?
Oh the madneſs of wilfull ſinners, that will needs run themſelves headily into
ſo dreadfull a damnation!</p>
                  <p>It was high time for our Saviour to ſpeak: What with the Tempeſt, what
with the Apparition, the Diſciples were almoſt loſt with fear. How ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
are his gracious redreſſes? Till they were thus affrighted, he would not
ſpeak; when they were thus affrighted, he would not hold his peace. If his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
preſence were fearfull, yet his word was comfortable; <hi>Be of good chear, it is I:</hi>
yea it is his word only which muſt make his preſence both known and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.

                     <hi>It is I,</hi> O Saviour, and let evils doe their worſt; thou needeſt not ſay any
more. Thy voice was evidence enough; ſo well were thy Diſciples acquainted
with the tongue of thee their Maſter, that, <hi>It is I,</hi> was as much as an hundred
names. Thou art the good Shepherd; we are not of thy Flock, if we know thee
not by thy voice from a thouſand. Even this one is a great word, yea an ample

                  <p>No ſooner hath <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſaid, <hi>I;</hi> then <hi>Peter</hi> anſwers, <hi>Maſter.</hi> He can inſtantly
name him that did not name himſelf. Every little hint is enough to Faith. The
Church ſees her Beloved as well through the Lattice, as through the open
Window. Which of all the Followers of Chriſt gave ſo pregnant teſtimonies
upon all occaſions of his Faith, of his Love to his Maſter, as <hi>Peter?</hi> The reſt
were ſilent, whiles he both owned his Maſter, and craved acceſſe to him in that
liquid way. Yet what a ſenſible mixture is here of Faith &amp; Diſtruſt? It is Faith

as well enable as command) it was Faith that durſt ſtep down upon that watery
pavement: it was Diſtruſt that upon the ſight of a mighty winde feared. It
was Faith, that he walked; it was Diſtruſt, that he ſunk; it was Faith that
ſaid, <hi>Lord, ſave me.</hi> Oh the imperfect compoſition of the beſt Saint upon earth;
as far from pure Faith, as from mere Infidelity! If there be pure earth in the
center, all upward is mixed with the other elements: contrarily, pure Grace
is above in the glorified Spirits; all below is mixed with infirmity, with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
Our beſt is but as the Aire; which never was, never can be at once
fully enlightned: neither is there in the ſame Region one conſtant ſtate of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> light. It ſhall once be noon with us, when we ſhall have nothing but bright
beams of Glory; now it is but the dawning, wherein it is hard to ſay whether
there be more light then darkneſs. We are now fair as the Moon, which hath
ſome ſpots in her greateſt beauty; we ſhall be pure as the Sun, whoſe face is
all bright and glorious. Ever ſince the time that <hi>Adam</hi> ſet his tooth in the
Apple, till our mouth be full of mould, it never was, it never can be other with
us. Far be it from us to ſettle willingly upon the dregs of our Infidelity; far
be it from us to be diſheartened with the ſenſe of our defects and imperfections:

ſuch is his deſire to be near his Maſter, that he ſaies, <hi>Bid me come to

                  </p>
                  <p>It was a bold ſpirit that could wiſh it, more bold that could act it. No ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44233:62"/>
hath our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Come,</hi> then he ſets his foot upon the unquiet Sea; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
not fearing either the ſoftneſs or the roughneſs of that uncouth paſſage. We are
wont to wonder at the courage of that daring man who firſt committed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the Sea in a frail Bark, though he had the ſtrength of an oaken planck
to ſecure him: how valiant muſt we needs grant him to be, that durſt ſet
his foot upon the bare ſea and ſhift his paces? Well did <hi>Peter</hi> know that he who
bade him, could uphold him; and therefore he both ſues to be bidden, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to be upholden. True Faith tasks it ſelf with difficulties, neither can be
diſmaied with the conceits of ordinary impoſſibilities? It is not the ſcattering
of ſtraws or caſting of mole-hills, whereby the virtue of it is deſcribed, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
of mountain. Like ſome courageous Leader, it deſires the honour of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
a danger, and ſues for the firſt onſet: whereas the worldly heart freezes in a
lazie or cowardly fear, and only caſts for ſafety and eaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> ſues, <hi>Jeſus</hi> bids. Rather will he work Miracles, then diſappoint the
ſuit of a faithful man. How eaſily might our Saviour have turned over this
ſtrange requeſt of his bold Diſiple, and have ſaid, What my Omnipotence can
doe is no rule for thy weakneſs? It is no leſſe then preſumption in a mere
man, to hope to imitate the miraculous works of God and man. Stay thou in
the ſhip, and wonder; contenting thy ſelf in this, that thou haſt a Maſter to
whom the land and water is alike. Yet I hear not a check, but a Call; <hi>Come.</hi>
The ſuit of Ambition is ſuddainly quaſhed in the Mother of the <hi>Zebedees.</hi> The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
ſuits of Revenge prove no better in the mouth of the two fiery Diſciples. But
a ſuit of Faith, though high and ſeemingly unfit for us, he hath no power to
deny. How much leſſe, O Saviour, wilt thou ſtick at thoſe things which lie in
the very road of our Chriſtianity? Never man ſaid, Bid me to come to thee
in the way of thy commandements, whom thou didſt not both bid and inable
to come.</p>
                  <p>True Faith reſts not in great and good deſires, but acts and executes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.

out of the ſhip of our Nature to walk unto Chriſt, are but the faint motions
of vain Hypocriſie. It will be long enough ere the gale of good wiſhes can
carry us to our Haven. <hi>Eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh.</hi> O Saviour, we have thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to come to thee out of the ſhip of our natural corruption: Let no Sea af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray
us, let no tempeſt of Temptation withhold us. No way can be but ſafe,
when thou art the End.</p>
                  <p>Lo, <hi>Peter</hi> is walking upon the waves: two hands uphold him; the hand of
Chriſt's Power, the hand of his own Faith; neither of them would doe it alone.
The hand of Chriſt's Power laid hold on him; the hand of his Faith laid hold <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
on the Power of Chriſt commanding. Had not Chriſt's hand been powerfull,
that Faith had been in vain: Had not that Faith of his ſtrongly fixed upon
Chriſt, that Power had not been effectual to his preſervation. Whiles we are
here in the world, we walk upon the waters; ſtill the ſame hands bear us up.
If he let goe his hold of us, we drown; if we let goe our hold of him, we ſink
and ſhreek as <hi>Peter</hi> did here, who when he ſaw the winde boiſtrous, was afraid,
and <hi>beginning to ſink, cried, ſaying, Lord, ſave me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he wiſht to be bidden to walk unto Chriſt, he thought of the waters;
<hi>Bid me to come to thee on the waters:</hi> he thought not of the windes which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
on thoſe waters; or if he thought of a ſtiffe gale, yet that tempeſtuous and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
ſudden guſt was out of his account and exſpectation. Thoſe evils that we are
prepared for, have not ſuch power over us as thoſe that ſurpriſe us. A good
water-man ſees a dangerous billow coming towards him, and cuts it, and
mounts over it with eaſe; the unheedy is overwhelmed. O Saviour, let my
haſte to thee be zealous, but not improvident; ere I ſet my foot out of the ſhip,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44233:62"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> let me foreſee the Tempeſt: when I have caſt the worſt, I cannot either miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry
or complain.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as he began to fear, he began to ſink: whiles he believed, the Sea
was braſs; when once he began to diſtruſt, thoſe waves were water. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſink, whiles he truſts the power of his Maſter; he cannot but ſink when he
miſdoubts it. Our Faith gives us as courage and boldneſs, ſo ſucceſs too: our
infidelity laies us open to all dangers, to all miſchiefs.</p>
                  <p>It was <hi>Peter</hi>'s improvidence not to foreſee, it was his weakneſs to fear, it
was the effect of his fear to ſink; it was his Faith that recollects it ſelf, and
breaks through his infidelity, and in ſinking could ſay, <hi>Lord, ſave me.</hi> His foot
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> could not be ſo ſwift in ſinking, as his heart in imploring: he knew who could
uphold him from ſinking, and being ſunk deliver him; and therefore he ſaies,
<hi>Lord, ſave me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a notable both ſign and effect of true Faith, in ſuddain extremities to
ejaculate holy deſires; and with the wings of our firſt thoughts to flie up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
to the throne of Grace for preſent ſuccour. Upon deliberation it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for a man that hath been careleſſe and profane, by good means to be
drawn to holy diſpoſitions: but on the ſuddain a man will appear as he is;
whatever is moſt rife in the heart will come forth at the mouth. It is good
to obſerve how our ſurpriſals finde us: the reſt is but forced; this is natural.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                     <hi>Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi> O Saviour, no evil can
be ſwifter then my thought: my thought ſhall be upon thee, ere I can be ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
upon by the ſpeedieſt miſchief: at leaſt, if I over-run not evils, I ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
them.</p>
                  <p>It was Chriſt his Lord whom <hi>Peter</hi> had offended in diſtruſting; it is Chriſt
his Lord to whom he ſues for deliverance. His weakneſs doth not diſcourage
him from his refuge. O God, when we have diſpleaſed thee, when we have
ſunk in thy diſpleaſure, whither ſhould we flie for aide but to thee whom we
have provoked? Againſt thee only is our ſin; in thee only is our help. In
vain ſhall all the powers of Heaven and earth conſpire to relieve us, if thou
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> withhold from our ſuccour. As we offend thy Juſtice daily by our ſins, ſo let us
continually relie upon thy Mercy by the ſtrength of our Faith; <hi>Lord, ſave us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The mercy of Chriſt is at once ſought and found; <hi>Immediately Jeſus ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
forth his hand, and caught him.</hi> He doth not ſay, Hadſt thou truſted me, I
would have ſafely preſerved thee, but ſince thou wilt needs wrong my power
and care with a cowardly diffidence, ſink and drown: but rather, as pitying
the infirmity of his fearful Diſciple, he puts out the hand for his relief. That
hand hath been ſtretch'd forth for the aide of many a one that hath never ask'd
it; never any ask'd it, to whoſe ſuccour it hath not been ſtretched. With what
ſpeed, with what confidence ſhould we flie to that ſoveraign bounty, from
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which never any ſuitor was ſent away empty?</p>
                  <p>Jeſus gave <hi>Peter</hi> his hand; but withall he gave him a check: <hi>O thou of little
faith, why doubtedſt thou?</hi> As <hi>Peter</hi>'s Faith was not pure, but mixed with ſome
diſtruſt; ſo our Saviours help was not clear and abſolute, but mixed with ſome
reproof. A reproof, wherein there was both a cenſure and an expoſtulation; a
cenſure of his Faith, an expoſtulation for his Doubt: both of them ſore &amp; heavy.</p>
                  <p>By how much more excellent and uſefull a grace Faith is, by ſo much more
ſhamefull is the defect of it; and by how much more reaſon here was of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
by ſo much more blame-worthy was the Doubt. Now <hi>Peter</hi> had a
double reaſon of his confidence; the command of Chriſt, the power of Chriſt:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the one in bidding him to come; the other in ſuſtaining him whiles he came.
To miſdoubt him whoſe will he knew, whoſe power he felt, was well worth a
reprehenſion.</p>
                  <p>When I ſaw <hi>Peter</hi> ſtepping forth upon the waters, I could not but wonder
at his great Faith; yet behold, ere he can have meaſured many paces, the Judge
of hearts taxes him for little Faith. Our mountains are but moats to God.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44233:63"/>
Would my heart have ſerved me to dare the doing of this that <hi>Peter</hi> did? Durſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
I have ſet my foot where he did? O Saviour, if thou foundeſt cauſe to cenſure
the weakneſſe and poverty of his Faith, what maiſt thou well ſay to mine?
They miſtake that think thou wilt take up with any thing. Thou lookeſt for
firmitude and vigour in thoſe Graces which thou wilt allow in thy beſt Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
no leſſe then truth.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſteps were confident, there was fear in the next. Oh the ſudden
alteration of our affections, of our diſpoſitions! One pace varies our ſpiritual
condition. What hold is there of ſo fickle creatures, if we be left never ſo little
to our ſelves? As this lower world wherein we are is the region of mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
ſo are we (the living pieces of it) ſubject to a perpetual change. It is for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
the bleſſed Saints and Angels above to be fixed in good: Whiles we are here,
there can be no conſtancy expected from us, but in variableneſſe.</p>
                  <p>As well as our Saviour loves <hi>Peter,</hi> yet he chides him. It is the fruit of his
favour and mercy that we eſcape judgment, not that we eſcape reproof. Had
not <hi>Peter</hi> found grace with his Maſter, he had been ſuffered to ſink in ſilence;
now he is ſaved with a check. There may be more love in frowns then in
ſmiles: <hi>whom he loves he chaſtiſes.</hi> What is chiding but a verbal caſtigation?
and what is chaſtiſement but a reall chiding? <hi>Correct me, O Lord,</hi> yet <hi>in thy
judgment, not in thy fury. Oh let the righteous</hi> God <hi>ſmite me</hi> (when I offend)
with his gracious reproofs; theſe <hi>ſhall be a precious oyle that ſhall not break my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

                  <p>THE time was, O Saviour, when a worthy woman offered to touch thee,
and was forbidden: now a meaner touches thee with approbation and
incouragement. Yet as there was much difference in that Body of
thine which was the Object of that touch, (being now mortal and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,

                     <hi>Jairus</hi> needs now think? He who by the virtue of his garment can pull this
woman out of the paws of death which hath been twelve years dying; can as
well by the power of his word pull my daughter (who hath been twelve years
living) out of the jaws of death which hath newly ſeiſed on her. It was fit the

                  <p>The Patient laboured of an Iſſue of blood; a Diſeaſe that had not more pain
then ſhame, nor more natural infirmity then Legal impurity. Time added
to her grief; twelve long years had ſhe languiſhed under this wofull complaint.
Beſides the tediouſneſs, diſeaſes muſt needs get head by continuance; and ſo
much more both weaken Nature and ſtrengthen themſelves, by how much
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44233:63"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> longer they afflict us. So it is in the Soul, ſo in the State; Vices, which are the
Sickneſſes of both, when they grow inveterate, have a ſtrong plea for their

                  <p>Yet more, to mend the matter, Poverty (which is another diſeaſe) was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded
to her ſickneſſe: <hi>She had ſpent all ſhe had upon Phyſicians.</hi> Whiles
ſhe had wherewith to make much of her ſelf, and to procure good tendance,
choice diet, and all the ſuccours of a diſtreſſed languiſhment, ſhe could not but
finde ſome mitigation of her ſorrow: but now want began to pinch her no leſſe

                  <p>Yet could ſhe have parted from her ſubſtance with eaſe, her complaint had
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> been the leſſe. Could the Phyſicians have given her, if not health, yet relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and painleſneſſe, her means had not been miſ-beſtowed: but now, <hi>ſhe
ſuffered many things from them;</hi> many an unpleaſing potion, many tormenting
inciſions and divulſions did ſhe endure from their hands: the Remedy was
equal in trouble to the Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Yet had the coſt and pain been never ſo great, could ſhe have hereby pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
health, the match had been happy; all the world were no price for this
commodity: but alas! her eſtate was the worſe, her body not the better; her
money was waſted, not her diſeaſe. Art could give her neither cure nor hope.
It were injurious to blame that noble Science, for that it alwaies ſpeeds not.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> This woman was a ſtranger to Chriſt; it ſeems ſhe had never ſeen him.
The report of his Miracles had lifted her up to ſuch a confidence of his power
and mercy, as that ſhe ſaid in her ſelf, <hi>If I may but touch the hem of his garment,
I ſhall be whole.</hi> The ſhame of her diſeaſe ſtopt her mouth from any verbal ſuit.
Had ſhe been acknown of her infirmity, ſhe had been ſhunned and abhorred,
and diſdainfully put back of all the beholders (as doubtleſſe where ſhe was
known, the Law forced her to live apart.) Now ſhe conceals both her grief,
and her deſire, and her faith; and only ſpeaks (where ſhe may be bold) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
her ſelf, <hi>If I may but touch the hem of his garment, I ſhall be whole.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſeek not myſteries in the virtue of the hem rather then of the garment.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Indeed it was God's command to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they ſhould be marked, not only
in their skin, but in their cloths too: thoſe fringes and ribands upon the borders
of their garments were for holy memorials of their duty, and Gods Law. But
that hence ſhe ſuppoſed to finde more virtue and ſanctity in the touch of the
hem then of the coat, I neither diſpute nor believe. It was the ſite, not the
ſignification that ſhe intimated; not as of the beſt part, but the utmoſt. In
all likelihood, if there could have been virtue in the garment, the nearer to the
body, the more. Here was then the praiſe of this womans Faith, that ſhe
promiſeth her ſelf cure by the touch of the utmoſt hem. Whoſoever would
look to receive any benefit from Chriſt, muſt come in Faith: It is that only
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> which makes us capable of any favour. Satan, the common ape of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
imitates him alſo in this point: All his charms and ſpells are ineffectual
without the Faith of the uſer, of the receiver.</p>
                  <p>Yea the endeavour and iſſue of all both humane and ſpiritual things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon our Faith. Who would commit a plant or ſeed to the earth, if he
did not believe to have it nurſed in that kindely boſome? What Merchant
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44233:64"/>
would put himſelf upon the guard of an inch-board in a furious Sea, if he did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
not truſt to the faithfull cuſtody of that planck? Who would trade, or travell,
or war, or marry, if he did not therein ſurely truſt he ſhould ſpeed well? What
benefit can we look to carry from a Divine exhortation, if we do not believe
it will edifie us? from a Sacramental banquet (the food of Angels) if we do
not believe it will nouriſh our Souls? from our beſt Devotions, if we do not
perſwade our ſelves they will fetch down bleſſings? Oh our vain and heartleſſe
ſervices! if we do not ſay, May I drink but one drop of that heavenly Nectar,
may I taſte but one crum of that bread of life, may I hear but one word from
the mouth of Chriſt, may I ſend up but one hearty ſigh or ejaculation of an holy
deſire to may God, I ſhall be whole.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>According to her reſolution is her practice. She touched, but <hi>ſhe came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind</hi>
to <hi>touch;</hi> whether for humility, or her ſecrecy rather, as deſiring to ſteal
a cure unſeen, unnoted. She was a Jeweſſe, and therefore well knew that her
touch was (in this caſe) no better then a pollution; as hers, perhaps, but not
of him. For on the one ſide, Neceſſity is under no poſitive law; on the other,
the Son of God was not capable of impurity. Thoſe may be defiled with a
touch that cannot heal with a touch: he that was above Law is not compriſed
in the Law. Be we never ſo unclean, he may heal us; we cannot infect him. O
Saviour, my Soul is ſick and foul enough with the Spiritual impurities of ſin:
let me by the hand of Faith lay hold but upon the hem of thy garment, (thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Righteouſneſs is thy garment) it ſhall be both-clean and whole.</p>
                  <p>Who would not think but a man might lade up a diſh of water out of the
Sea unmiſſed? Yet that water (though much) is finite; thoſe drops are within
number: that Art which hath reckoned how many corns of ſand would make
up a World, could more eaſily compute how many drops of water would make
up an Ocean; whereas the mercies of God are abſolutely infinite, and beyond
all poſſibility of proportion: And yet this baſhfull ſoul cannot ſteal one drop
of mercy from this endleſſe, boundleſſe, bottomleſſe Sea of Divine bounty, but
it is felt and queſtioned; <hi>And Jeſus ſaid, Who touched me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who can now ſay that he is a poor man that reckons his ſtore, when that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
God, who is rich in mercy, doth ſo? He knows all his own Bleſſings, and
keeps juſt tallies of our receits; Delivered ſo much Honour to this man, to that
ſo much Wealth; ſo much Knowledge to one, to another ſo much Strength.
How carefully frugal ſhould we be in the notice, account, uſage of Gods ſeveral
favours, ſince his bounty ſets all his gifts upon the file? Even the worſt ſervant
in the Goſpel confeſt his Talents, though he imployed them not. We are worſe
then the worſt, if either we miſ-know, or diſſemble, or forget them.</p>
                  <p>Who now can forbear the Diſciples reply? Who touched thee, O Lord? the
multitude. Doſt thou ask of one, when thou art preaſed by many? In the
midſt of a throng, doſt thou ask, <hi>Who touched me?</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea but yet <hi>ſome one touched me:</hi> All thronged me; but one touched me.
How riddle-like ſoever it may ſeem to ſound, they that thronged me touch'd
me not; ſhe onely touched me that thronged me not, yea that touched me not.
Even ſo, O Saviour, others touch'd thy body with theirs; ſhe touched thy
hem with her hand, thy Divine power with her Soul.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe two parts whereof we conſiſt (the bodily, the ſpiritual) do in a ſort
partake of each other. The Soul is the man, and hath thoſe parts, ſenſes, actions
which are challenged as proper to the Body. This ſpiritual part hath both an
hand, and a touch; it is by the hand of Faith that the Soul toucheth: yea this
alone both is, and acts all the ſpiritual ſenſes of that immaterial and Divine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
part; this ſees, hears, taſteth, toucheth God; and without this the Soul doth
none of theſe. All the multitude then preaſed Chriſt: he took not that for a
touch, ſince Faith was away; onely ſhe touched him that believed to receive
virtue by his touch. Outward faſhionableneſſe comes into no account with
God; that is onely done which the Soul doth. It is no hoping that virtue
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44233:64"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſhould goe forth from Chriſt to us, when no hearty deſires go forth from us to
him. He that is a Spirit, looks to the deportment of that part which reſembleth
himſelf: as without it the body is dead, ſo without the actions thereof bodily
Devotions are but carcaſſes.</p>
                  <p>What reaſon had our Saviour to challenge this touch? <hi>Some body touch'd me.</hi>
The multitude (in one extreme) denied any touch at all: <hi>Peter</hi> (in another
extreme) affirmed an over-touching of the multitude. Betwixt both, he who
felt it can ſay, <hi>Some body touched me.</hi> Not <hi>all,</hi> as <hi>Peter;</hi> not <hi>none,</hi> as the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
but <hi>ſome body.</hi> How then, O Saviour, how doth it appear that ſome body
touched thee? <hi>For I perceive virtue is gone out from me.</hi> The effect proves
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the act; virtue gone out evinces the touch. Theſe two are in thee converti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
virtue cannot goe out of thee but by a touch; and no touch can be of thee
without virtue going out from thee. That which is a Rule in Nature, That
every Agent works by a contact, holds ſpiritually too: Then doſt thou, O God,
work upon our Souls, when thou toucheſt our hearts by thy Spirit; then do
we re-act upon thee, when we touch thee by the hand of our Faith and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in thee: and in both theſe virtue goes out from thee to us. Yet goes not ſo
out, as that there is leſſe in thee. In all bodily emanations, whoſe powers are but
finite, it muſt needs follow, that the more is ſent forth the leſſe is reſerved:
but as it is in the Sun, which gives us light, yet loſeth none ever the more (the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> luminoſity of it being no whit impaired by that perpetual emiſſion of light-ſome
beams;) ſo much more is it in thee, the Father of lights. Virtue could
not goe out of thee without thy knowledge, without thy ſending. Neither was
it in a diſlike, or in a grudging exprobration, that thou ſaidſt, <hi>Virtue is gone
out from me.</hi> Nothing could pleaſe thee better, then to feel virtue fetch'd out
from thee by the Faith of the receiver. It is the nature and praiſe of good to
be communicative: none of us would be other then liberal of our little, if we
did not fear it would be leſſened by imparting. Thou that knoweſt thy ſtore
ſo infinite, that participation doth only glorifie and not diminiſh it, canſt not
but be more willing to give then we to receive. If we take but one drop of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> water from the Sea, or one corn of ſand from the ſhore, there is ſo much
(though inſenſibly) leſſe: but were we capable of Worlds of virtue and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
from that munificent hand, our inriching could no whit impoveriſh
thee. Thou which wert wont to hold it much <hi>better to give then to receive,</hi>
canſt not but give gladly. Fear not, O my Soul, to lade plentifully at this Well,
this Ocean of Mercy, which, the more thou takeſt, over flows the more.</p>
                  <p>But why then, O Saviour, why didſt thou thus inquire, thus expoſtulate?
Was it for thy own ſake; that the glory of the Miracle might thus come to
light, which otherwiſe had been ſmothered in ſilence? Was it for <hi>Jairus</hi> his
ſake; that his depreſſed heart might be raiſed to a confidence in thee, whoſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> mighty Power he ſaw proved by this Cure, whoſe Omniſcience he ſaw proved
by the knowledge of the Cure? Or was it chiefly for the Womans ſake; for
the praiſe of her Faith, for the ſecuring of her Conſcience?</p>
                  <p>It was within her ſelf that ſhe ſaid, <hi>If I may but touch:</hi> none could hear this
voice of the heart, but he that made it. It was within her ſelf that the Cure
was wrought: none of the beholders knew her complaint, much leſſe her reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;
none noted her touch, none knew the occaſion of her touch. What a
pattern of powerfull Faith had we loſt, if our Saviour had not called this act to
triall? As her modeſty hid her diſeaſe, ſo it would have hid her vertue. Chriſt
will not ſuffer this ſecrecy. Oh the marvelous, but free, diſpenſation of Chriſt!
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> One while he injoyns a ſilence to his re-cured Patients, and is troubled with
their divulgation of his favour; another while (as here) he will not loſe the
honour of a ſecret mercy, but fetches it out by his Inquiſition, by his profeſſion;
<hi>Who hath touched me? for I perceive virtue is gone out from me.</hi> As we ſee in the
great work of his Creation, he hath placed ſome Stars in the midſt of Heaven,
where they may be moſt conſpicuous; others he hath ſet in the Southern ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44233:65"/>
obvious to but few eyes: in the Earth, he hath planted ſome flowers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
and trees in the famous gardens of the World; others, no leſſe beautiful, in
untracked Woods or wild Deſarts, where they are either not ſeen, or not
regarded.</p>
                  <p>O God, if thou have intended to glorifie thy ſelf by thy Graces in us, thou
wilt finde means to fetch them forth into the notice of the World; otherwiſe
our very privacy ſhall content us, and praiſe thee.</p>
                  <p>Yet even this great Faith wanted not ſome weakneſſe. It was a poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
in this Woman, that ſhe thought ſhe might receive ſo ſoveraign a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
from Chriſt without his heed, without his knowledge. Now that ſhe might
ſee ſhe had truſted to a power which was not more bountifull then ſenſible,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
and whoſe goodneſſe did not exceed his apprehenſion, but one that knew what
he parted with, and willingly parted with that which he knew beneficial to
ſo faithfull a receiver, he can ſay, <hi>Some body hath touched me, for I perceive vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is gone out from me.</hi> As there was an error in her thought, ſo in our Saviours
words there was a correction. His mercy will not let her run away with that
ſecret offence. It is a great favour of God to take us in the manner, and to
ſhame our cloſeneſſe. We ſcour off the ruſt from a Weapon that we eſteem,
and prune the Vine we care for. O God, do thou ever finde me out in my
Sin; and do not paſſe over my leaſt infirmities without a feeling controlment.</p>
                  <p>Neither doubt I but that herein, O Saviour, thou didſt graciouſly forecaſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
the ſecuring of the Conſcience of this faithfull (though over-ſeen) Patient;
which might well have afterwards raiſed ſome juſt ſcruples, for the filching
of a Cure, for Unthankfulneſs to the Author of her Cure; the continuance
whereof ſhe might have good reaſon to miſdoubt, being ſurreptitiouſly gotten,
ingratefully concealed. For prevention of all theſe dangers, and the full quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of her troubled heart, how fitly, how mercifully didſt thou bring forth
this cloſe buſineſſe to the light, and clear it to the bottome? It is thy great
mercy to foreſee our perils, and to remove them ere we can apprehend the fear
of them: as ſome skilfull Phyſician, who perceiving a Fever or Phrenſy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which the diſtempered Patient little miſdoubts, by ſeaſonable applications <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
anticipates that grievous malady; ſo as the ſick man knows his ſafety ere he
can ſuſpect his danger.</p>
                  <p>Well might the Woman think, He who can thus cure, and thus know his
cure, can as well know my name, and deſcry my perſon, and ſhame and puniſh
my ingratitude. With a pale face therefore and a trembling foot ſhe comes,
and falls down before him, and humbly acknowledges what ſhe had done,
what ſhe had obtained; <hi>But the Woman finding ſhe was not hid,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Could ſhe have perceived that ſhe might have ſlily gone away with the
Cure, ſhe had not confeſſed it: So had ſhe made God a loſer of Glory, and her
ſelf an unthankfull receiver of ſo great a Benefit.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Might we have our own wills, we ſhould be injurious both to God and
our ſelves. Nature laies ſuch plots as would be ſure to befool us; and is witty
in nothing but deceiving her ſelf. The only way to bring us home, is to finde
we are found, and to be convinced of the diſcovery of all our evaſions: As ſome
unskilfull Thief that findes the owners eye was upon him in his pilfring,
laies down his ſtollen commodity with ſhame. Contrarily, when a man is
poſſeſſed with a conceit of ſecrecy and cleanly eſcape, he is emboldened in his
leudneſſe. The Adulterer chuſes the twilight, and ſaies, <hi>No eye ſhall ſee me;</hi> and
joyes in the ſweetneſſe of his ſtoln waters. O God, in the deepeſt darkneſſe,
in my moſt inward retiredneſſe, when none ſees me, when I ſee not my ſelf,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
yet let me then ſee thine all-ſeeing eye upon me: and if ever mine eyes ſhall
be ſhut, or held with a prevailing Temptation, check me with a ſpeedy reproof,
that with this abaſhed Patient, I may come in, and confeſſe my errour, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
thy mercy.</p>
                  <p>It is no unuſall thing for kindneſſe to look ſternly for the time, that it may
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44233:65"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> indear it ſelf more when it liſts to be diſcovered. With a ſevere countenance
did our Saviour look about him, and ask, <hi>Who touched me?</hi> When the woman
comes in trembling, and confeſſing both her act and ſucceſſe, he clears up his
brows, and ſpeaks comfortably to her; <hi>Daughter, be of good chear, thy faith
hath made thee whole; goe in peace.</hi> O ſweet and ſeaſonable word, fit for thoſe
mercifull and Divine lips; able to ſecure any heart, to diſpell any fears!
Still, O Saviour, thou doeſt thus to us: when we fall down before thee in an
awfull dejectedneſſe, thou reareſt us up with a chearfull and compaſſionate
incouragement; when thou findeſt us bold and preſumptuous, thou loveſt to
take us down; when humbled, it is enough to have proſtrated us. Like as
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that Lion of <hi>Bethel</hi> worries the diſobedient Prophet, guards the poor Aſſe that
ſtood quaking before him: Or like ſome mighty winde, that bears over a
tall Elme or Cedar with the ſame breath that it raiſeth a ſtooping Reed: Or
like ſome good Phyſician, who finding the body obſtructed and ſurcharged
with ill humors, evacuates it, and when it is ſufficiently pulled down, raiſes it
up with ſoveraign Cordials.</p>
                  <p>And ſtill doe thou ſo to my Soul; if at any time thou perceiveſt me ſtiffe
and rebellious, ready to face out my ſin againſt thee, ſpare me not; let me
ſmart, till I relent. But <hi>a broken and contrite heart, thou wilt not, O Lord,</hi> O
Lord, do not <hi>reject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> It is only thy Word which gives what it requires, comfort and confidence.
Had any other ſhaken her by the ſhoulder, and cheared her up againſt thoſe
oppreſſive paſſions, it had been but waſt winde. No voice but his who hath
power to remit ſin, can ſecure the heart from the conſcience of ſin, from the
pangs of Conſcience. <hi>In the midſt of the ſorrows of my heart, thy comforts,
O Lord,</hi> thy comforts only have power to <hi>refreſh my ſoul.</hi> Her cure was Chriſts
act, yet he gives the praiſe of it to her; <hi>Thy faith hath made thee whole.</hi> He
had ſaid before, <hi>Virtue is gone out from me;</hi> now he acknowledges a virtue
inherent in her. It was his virtue that cured her, yet he graciouſly caſts this
work upon her Faith. Not that her Faith did it by way of merit, by way of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> efficiency, but by way of impetration. So much did our Saviour regard that
Faith which he had wrought in her, that he will honour it with the ſucceſſe of
her Cure. Such and the ſame is ſtill the remedy of our ſpirituall diſeaſes, our
ſins: <hi>By faith we are juſtified, by faith we are ſaved.</hi> Thou only, O Saviour,
canſt heal us; thou wilt not heal us but by our Faith: not as it iſſues from us,
but as it appropriates thee. The ſickneſſe is ours, the remedy is ours: the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is our own by nature, the remedy ours by thy grace, both working and
accepting it. Our Faith is no leſſe from thee then thy Cure is from our Faith.</p>
                  <p>Oh happy diſmiſſion, <hi>Goe in peace!</hi> How unquiet had this poor ſoul for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been? She had no outward peace with her Neighbours; they ſhunned
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and abhorred her preſence in this condition; yea they muſt doe ſo. She had no
peace in Body; that was pained and vexed with ſo long and foul a diſeaſe.
Much leſſe had ſhe peace in her Minde, which was grievouſly diſquieted with
ſorrow for her ſickneſſe, with anger and diſcontentment at her torturing Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
with fear of the continuance of ſo bad a gueſt. Her Soul (for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent)
had no peace, from the ſenſe of her guiltineſſe in the carriage of this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
from the conceived diſpleaſure of him to whom ſhe came for comfort
and redreſſe. At once now doth our Saviour calm all theſe ſtorms; and in
one word and act reſtores to her peace with her Neighbours, peace in her Self;
peace in Body, in Minde, in Soul. <hi>Goe in peace.</hi> Even ſo, Lord, it was for thee
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> only, who art the Prince of Peace, to beſtow thy peace where thou pleaſeſt.
Our body, minde, Soul, eſtate is thine, whether to afflict, or eaſe. It is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if all of us doe not aile ſomewhat. In vain ſhall we ſpeak peace to our ſelves,
in vain ſhall the world ſpeak peace to us, except thou ſay to us, as thou didſt
to this diſtreſſed ſoul, <hi>Goe in peace.</hi>

O Saviour, if thou didſt not command us ſomewhat beyond Nature, it
were no thank to us to obey thee. While the childe was alive, to believe that

Daughter alive, though weak and ſickly? Now thou ſhalt receive her not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
only, but ſound and vigorous. Thou doſt not, O Saviour, meaſure thy
gifts by our petitions, but by our wants and thine own mercies.</p>
                  <p>This work might have been as eaſily done by an abſent command; the
Power of Chriſt was there whiles himſelf was away: but he will goe perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to the place, that he might be confeſſed the Author of ſo great a Miracle.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> O Saviour, thou loveſt to goe to the houſe of mourning; thy chief pleaſure is
the comfort of the afflicted. What a confuſion there is in worldly ſorrow? The
mother ſhreeks, the ſervants crie out, the people make lamentation, the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrels
howl and ſtrike dolefully; ſo as the eare might queſtion whether the
Ditty or the Inſtrument were more heavy. If ever expreſſions of ſorrow ſound
well, it is when Death leads the quire. Soon doth our Saviour charm this
noiſe, and turns theſe unſeaſonable mourners (whether formal or ſerious) out
of doors. Not that he diſlikes Muſick, whether to condole or comfort; but
that he had life in his eye, and would have them know that he held theſe Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
ceremonies to be too early and long before their time. <hi>Give place, for the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> maid is not dead, but ſleepeth.</hi> Had ſhe been dead, ſhe had but ſlept; now ſhe
was not dead, but aſleep, becauſe he meant this nap of death ſhould be ſo ſhort,
and her awakening ſo ſpeedy. Death and Sleep are alike to him, who can caſt
whom he will into the ſleep of Death, and awake when and whom he pleaſeth
out of that deadly ſleep.</p>
                  <p>Before the people and domeſticks of <hi>Jairus</hi> held <hi>Jeſus</hi> for a Prophet; now
they took him for a Dreamer. <hi>Not dead, but aſleep?</hi> They that came to mourn
cannot now forbear to laugh. Have we piped at ſo many Funerals, and ſeen
and lamented ſo many Corpſes, and cannot we diſtinguiſh betwixt Sleep and
Death? The eyes are ſet, the breath is gone, the limmes are ſtiffe and cold.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Who ever died, if ſhe do but ſleep? How eaſily may our Reaſon or Senſe
befool us in Divine matters? Thoſe that are competent Judges in natural
things, are ready to laugh God to ſcorn when he ſpeaks beyond their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe;
and are by him juſtly laughed to ſcorn for their unbelief. Vain and
faithleſſe men! as if that unlimited power of the Almighty could not make
good his own word; and turn either Sleep into Death, or Death into Sleep,
at pleaſure. Ere many minutes they ſhall be aſhamed of their errour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity.</p>
                  <p>There were witneſſes enough of her death, there ſhall not be many of her
reſtoring. Three choice Diſciples and the two Parents are only admitted to the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> view and teſtimony of this miraculous work. The eyes of thoſe incredulous
ſcoffers were not worthy of this honour. Our infidelity makes us incapable of
the ſecret favours and the higheſt counſels of the Almighty.</p>
                  <p>What did theſe ſcorners think and ſay, when they ſaw him putting the
minſtrels and people out of doors? Doubtleſſe the maid is but aſleep; the
man fears leſt the noiſe ſhall awake her; we muſt ſpeak and tread ſoftly
that we diſquiet her not: What will he and his Diſciples doe the while? Is
it not to be feared they will ſtartle her out of her reſt? Thoſe that are ſhut
out from the participation of God's counſels, think all his words and projects
no better then fooliſhneſſe. But art thou, O Saviour, ever the more diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> by the deriſion and cenſure of theſe ſcornfull unbelievers? Becauſe fools
jear thee, doſt thou forbear thy work? Surely I do not perceive that thou
heedeſt them, ſave for contempt; or careſt more for their words then their
ſilence. It is enough that thine act ſhall ſoon honour thee, and convince them.
<hi>He took her by the hand, and called, ſaying, Maid, ariſe: and her ſpirit came

How could that touch, that Call be other then effectual? He who made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
that hand, touched it; and he who ſhall once ſay, <hi>Ariſe ye dead,</hi> ſaid now,
<hi>Maid, ariſe.</hi> Death cannot but obey him who is the Lord of life. The Soul is
ever equally in his hand who is the God of Spirits: it cannot but goe and come
at his command. When he ſaies, <hi>Maid, ariſe,</hi> the now-diſſolved ſpirit knows
his office, his place, and inſtantly reaſſumes that room which by his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it had left.</p>
                  <p>O Saviour, if thou do but bid my Soul to ariſe from the death of Sin, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lie ſtill; if thou bid my Body to ariſe from the grave, my Soul cannot but
glance down from her Heaven, and animate it. In vain ſhall my ſin or my grave
offer to withhold me from thee.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Maid revives: not now to languiſh for a time upon her ſick-bed, and
by ſome faint degrees to gather an inſenſible ſtrength; but at once ſhe ariſes
from her death and from her couch, at once ſhe puts off her fever with her
diſſolution, ſhe findes her life and her feet at once, at once ſhe findes her feet
and her ſtomack. <hi>He commanded to give her meat.</hi> Omnipotency doth not uſe
to goe the pace of Nature. All God's immediate works are (like himſelf) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
He that raiſed her ſupernaturally, could have ſo fed her. It was never
the purpoſe of his Power, to put ordinary Means out of office.</p>

                  <p>The ſtrongeſt receit againſt Death is the happy eſtate that follows it; next

his face to goe to Hieruſalem: Hieruſalem</hi> the neſt of his enemies, the Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theater
of his conflicts, the fatall place of his death. Well did he know the
plots and ambuſhes that were there laid for him, and the bloody iſſue of thoſe
deſigns: yet he will goe, and goes reſolved for the worſt. It is a ſure and wiſe
way to ſend our thoughts before us, to grapple with thoſe evils which we know
muſt be incountred. The enemy is half overcome that is well prepared for.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
The ſtrongeſt miſchief may be outfaced with a ſeaſonable fore-reſolution.
There can be no greater diſadvantage then the ſuddenneſſe of a ſurpriſal.
O God, what I have not the power to avoid, let me have the wiſdome to

                  <p>The way from <hi>Galilee</hi> to <hi>Judaea</hi> lay through the Region of <hi>Samaria,</hi> if not
the City. Chriſt now towards the end of his Preaching could not but be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with a multitude of followers: It was neceſſary there ſhould be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors
and harbingers to procure lodgings and proviſion for ſo large a troup.
Some of his own retinue are addreſſed to this ſervice: they ſeek not for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces
and delicates, but for houſe-room and victuals. It was he whoſe the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
earth was and the fulneſſe thereof, whoſe the Heavens are and the manſions
therein; yet he, who could have commanded Angels, ſues to <hi>Samaritanes:</hi>
He that filled and comprehended Heaven, ſends for ſhelter in a <hi>Samaritane</hi>
Cottage. It was thy choice, O Saviour, to take upon thee the ſhape, not of a
Prince, but of a Servant. How can we either neglect means, or deſpiſe home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:44233:67"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> when thou the God of all the World wouldſt ſtoop to the ſuit of ſo
poor a proviſion?</p>
                  <p>We know well in what terms the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> ſtood with the Jews; ſo
much more hoſtile as they did more ſymbolize in matter of Religion: no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were mutually ſo hatefull to each other. A <hi>Samaritane</hi>'s bread was no
better then Swines-fleſh; their very fire and water was not more grudged then
infectious. The looking towards <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was here cauſe enough of repulſe.
No enmity is ſo deſperate as that which ariſes from matter of Religion. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
in ſome points, when there are differences in the main, doth but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
hatred the more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> It is not more ſtrange to hear the Son of God ſue for a lodging, then to hear
him repelled. Upon ſo churliſh a denial, the two angry Diſciples return to
their Maſter on a fiery errand; <hi>Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come
down from Heaven and conſume them, as Elias did?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sons of Thunder</hi> would be <hi>lightning</hi> ſtraight; their zeal, whether as
kinſmen or Diſciples, could not brook ſo harſh a refuſal. As they were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
more hot then their fellows, ſo now they thought their Piety bade them
be impatient.</p>
                  <p>Yet they dare not but begin with leave, <hi>Maſter, wilt thou?</hi> His will muſt
lead theirs; their choler cannot drive their wills before his: all their motion
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is from him onely. True Diſciples are like thoſe artificial engines which goe
no otherwiſe then they are ſet; or like little Children, that ſpeak nothing but
what they are taught. O Saviour, if we have wills of our own, we are not thine.
Do thou ſet me as thou wouldſt have me goe; do thou teach me what thou
wouldſt have me ſay or doe.</p>
                  <p>A mannerly preface leads in a faulty ſuit; <hi>Maſter, wilt thou that we command
fire to come down from Heaven and conſume them?</hi> Faulty, both in preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and in deſire of private revenge. I do not hear them ſay, Maſter, will it
pleaſe thee, who art the ſole Lord of the Heavens and the Elements, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
fire from Heaven upon theſe men? but, <hi>Wilt thou that we command?</hi> As if,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> becauſe they had power given them over diſeaſes and unclean ſpirits, therefore
Heaven and earth were in their managing. How eaſily might they be miſtaken?
Their large commiſſion had the juſt limits. Subjects that have munificent
grants from their Princes can challenge nothing beyond the words of their
Patent. And if the fetching down fire from Heaven were leſſe then the diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing
of Devils, (ſince the Devil ſhall inable the Beaſt to doe thus much) yet
how poſſible is it to doe the greater and ſtick at the leſſe, where both depend
upon a delegated power? The Magicians of <hi>Egypt</hi> could bring forth Frogs and
Blood; they could not bring Lice: ordinary Corruption can doe that which
they could not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> It is the faſhion of our bold Nature, upon an inch given, to challenge an ell;
and where we finde our ſelves graced with ſome abilities, to flatter our ſelves
with the faculty of more.</p>
                  <p>I grant, Faith hath done as great things as ever Preſumption undertook;
but there is great difference in the enterpriſes of both. The one hath a warrant,
either by inſtinct or expreſſe command; the other none at all. Indeed, had
theſe two Diſciples either meant, or ſaid, Maſter, if it be thy pleaſure to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
us to call down fire from Heaven, we know thy word ſhall enable us to
doe what thou requireſt; if the words be ours, the power ſhall be thine; this
had been but holy, modeſt, faithfull: but if they ſuppoſed there needed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſave a leave only, and that (might they be but let looſe) they could goe
alone, they preſumed, they offended.</p>
                  <p>Yet had they thus overſhot themſelves in ſome pious and charitable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the fault had been the leſſe: now the act had in it both cruelty, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
revenge. Their zeal was not worthy of more praiſe, then their fury of
cenſure. That fire ſhould fall down from Heaven upon men, is a fearfull thing
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44233:68"/>
to think of, and that which hath not been often done. It was done in the caſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
of <hi>Sodome,</hi> when thoſe five unclean Cities burned with the unnatural fire of
helliſh Luſt: it was done two ſeveral times at the ſuit of <hi>Elijah:</hi> it was done
(in an height of triall) to that great pattern of Patience. I finde it no more, and
tremble at theſe I finde.</p>
                  <p>But beſides the dreadfulneſs of the judgment it ſelf, who can but quake at
the thought of the ſuddainneſſe of this deſtruction, which ſweeps away both
Body and Soul in a ſtate of unpreparation, of unrepentance; ſo as this fire
ſhould but begin a worſe, this Heavenly flame ſhould but kindle that of Hell?</p>
                  <p>Thus unconceivably heavy was the revenge: but what was the offence? We
have learned not to think any indignity light that is offered to the Son of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
God; but we know theſe ſpiritual affronts are capable of degrees. Had theſe
<hi>Samaritans</hi> reviled Chriſt and his train, had they violently aſſaulted him, had
they followed him with ſtones in their hands and blaſphemies in their mouths,
it had been a juſt provocation of ſo horrible a vengeance: Now the wrong
was on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly negative, <hi>they received him not:</hi> And that, not out of any particular
quarrell or diſlike of his Perſon, but of his Nation onely; the men had been
welcome, had not their Country diſtaſted. All the charge that I hear our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
give to his Diſciples in caſe of their rejection, is, <hi>If they receive you not,
ſhake off the duſt of your feet.</hi> Yet this was amongſt their own, and when they
went on that ſacred errand of publiſhing the Goſpel of Peace. Theſe were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
ſtrangers from the commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> This meaſure was not to Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
but to Travellers; only a mere inhoſpitality to miſliked gueſts. Yet no
leſſe revenge will ſerve them then fire from Heaven.</p>
                  <p>I dare ſay for you, ye holy ſons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> it was not your ſpleen, but your
zeal, that was guilty of ſo bloody a ſuggeſtion: your indignation could not
but be ſtirred to ſee the great Prophet and Saviour of the world ſo unkindly
repelled: yet all this will not excuſe you from a raſh Cruelty, from an inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
Rage.</p>
                  <p>Even the beſt heart may eaſily be miſcarried with a well-meant Zeal. No
affection is either more neceſſary or better accepted. Love to any Object can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
be ſevered from hatred of the contrary: whence it is that all creatures
which have the concupiſcible part, have alſo the iraſcible adjoined unto it. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and diſpleaſure is not ſo much an enemy, as a guardian and champion of
Love. Whoever therefore is rightly affected to his Saviour, cannot but finde
much regret at his wrongs. O gracious and divine Zeal, the kindely warmth
and vitall temper of Piety, whither haſt thou withdrawn thy ſelf from the cold
hearts of men? Or is this according to the juſt conſtitution of the old and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit
age of the world, into which we are fallen? How many are there that
think there is no wiſdome but in a dull indifferency; and chuſe rather to
freeze then burn? How quick and apprehenſive are men in caſes of their own <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
indignities? how inſenſible of their Saviour's?</p>
                  <p>But there is nothing ſo ill as the corruption of the beſt. Rectified zeal is not
more commendable and uſefull, then inordinate and miſguided is hatefull and
dangerous. Fire is a neceſſary and beneficial element; but if it be once miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed,
and have caught upon the beams of our houſes or ſtacks of our corn,
nothing can be more direfull.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſometimes Zeal turns Murder, (<hi>They that kill you ſhall think they
doe God ſervice</hi>) ſometimes Phrenſie, ſometimes rude Indiſcretion. Whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and bleſſed is that zeal that is well grounded and well governed: groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the word of Truth, not upon unſtable fancies; governed by wiſdome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
and charity: Wiſdome, to avoid raſhneſſe and exceſſe; Charity, to avoid juſt
offence.</p>
                  <p>No motion can want a pretence. <hi>Elias did</hi> ſo; why not we? He was an
holy Prophet: the occaſion, the place abludes not much: there wrong was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to a ſervant, here to his Maſter; there to a man, here to a God and man.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44233:68"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> If <hi>Elias</hi> then did it, why not we? There is nothing more perillous then to
draw all the actions of Holy men into examples: For as the beſt men have their
weakneſſes; ſo they are not priviledged from letting fall unjuſtifiable actions,
Beſides that, they may have had perhaps peculiar warrants ſigned from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
whether by inſtict, or ſpeciall command, which we ſhall expect in vain.
There muſt be much caution uſed in our imitation of the beſt patterns, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in reſpect of the perſons, or things;) elſe we ſhall make our ſelves Apes,
and our acts ſinfull abſurdities.</p>
                  <p>It is a rare thing for our Saviour to finde fault with the errous of zeal, even
where have appeared ſenſible weakneſſes. If <hi>Moſes</hi> in a ſacred rage and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> brake the Tables written with Gods own hand, I finde him not checked.
Here our meek Saviour turns back, and frowns upon his furious ſuitors,
and takes them up roundly; <hi>Ye know not of what ſpirit ye are.</hi> The faults
of uncharitableneſſe cannot be ſwallowed up in zeal. If there were any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
to hide the blemiſhes of this miſdiſpoſition, it ſhould be this crimſon die.
But he that needs not our Lie, will let us know he needs not our Injury, and
hates to have a good cauſe ſupported by the violation of our Charity. We have
no reaſon to diſclaim our Paſſions: Even the Son of God chides ſometimes,
yea where he loves. It offends not that our Affections are moved: but that they
are inordinate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> It was a ſharp word, <hi>Ye know not of what ſpirit ye are.</hi> Another man would
not perhaps have felt it; a Diſciple doth. Tender hearts are galled with that
which the carnal minde ſlighteth. The ſpirit of <hi>Elias</hi> was that which they
meant to aſſume and imitate: they ſhall now know their mark was miſtaken.
How would they have hated to think that any other but God's Spirit had ſtirred
them up to this paſſionate motion? now they ſhall know it was wrought by
that ill ſpirit whom they profeſſed to hate.</p>
                  <p>It is far from the good Spirit of God to ſtir up any man to private revenge
or thirſt of blood. Not an Eagle, but a Dove, was the ſhape wherein he
choſe to appear. Neither wouldſt thou, O God, be in the whirlwinde, or in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the fire, but in the ſoft voice. O Saviour, what do we ſeek for any precedent
but thine, whoſe name we challenge? Thou <hi>cameſt to thine own,</hi> thine <hi>own
received</hi> thee <hi>not.</hi> Didſt thou call for fire from Heaven upon them? didſt
thou not rather ſend down water from thy compaſſionate eyes, and weep for
them by whom thou muſt bleed? Better had it been for us never to have had
any ſpirit, then any but thine. We can be no other then wicked, if our mercies
be cruelty.</p>
                  <p>But is it the name of <hi>Elias</hi> (O ye Zelots) which ye pretend for a colour
of your impotent deſire? Ye do not conſider the difference betwixt his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and yours. His was extraordinary and heroical, beſides the inſtinct or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> command of God for this act of his; far otherwiſe is it with you, who
by a carnal diſtemper are moved to this furious ſuggeſtion. Thoſe that would
imitate Gods Saints in ſingular actions, muſt ſee they goe upon the ſame
grounds. Without the ſame Spirit and the ſame warrant it is either a mockery
or a ſin to make them our Copies. <hi>Elias</hi> is no fit pattern for Diſciples, but
their Maſter. <hi>The Son of Man came not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then are our actions and intentions warrantable and praiſe-worthy, when
they accord with his. O Saviour, when we look into thoſe ſacred Acts and
monuments of thine, we finde many a life which thou preſervedſt from peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing,
ſome that had periſhed by thee recalled; never any by thee deſtroyed.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Only one poor fig-tree (as the reall Emblem of thy ſeverity to the unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full)
was blaſted and withered by thy curſe. But to man, how ever favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and indulgent wert thou? So repelled as thou wert, ſo reviled, ſo perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
laid for, ſold, betrayed, apprehended, arraigned, condemned, crucified; yet
what one man didſt thou ſtrike dead for theſe hainous indignities? Yea when
one of thine enemies loſt but an eare in that ill quarrell, thou gaveſt that eare
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44233:69"/>
to him who came to take life from thee. I finde ſome whom thou didſt ſcourge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
and correct, as the ſacrilegious money-changers; none whom thou killedſt.
Not that thou either loveſt not, or requireſt not the duly-ſevere execution of
juſtice. Whoſe ſword is it that Princes bear but thine? Offenders muſt ſmart
and bleed. This is a juſt ſequel, but not the intention of thy coming; thy will,
not thy drift.</p>
                  <p>Good Princes make wholeſome Laws for the well-ordering of their people:
there is no authority without due coercion. The violation of theſe good Laws
is followed with death, whoſe end was preſervation, life, order: and this not
ſo much for revenge of an offence paſt, as for prevention of future miſchief.</p>
                  <p>How can we then enough love and praiſe thy mercy, O thou preſerver of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
men? How ſhould we imitate thy ſaving and beneficent diſpoſition towards
mankinde? as knowing, the more we can help to ſave, the nearer we come
to thee that cameſt to ſave all; and the more deſtructive we are, the more we

                  <head>The Ten Lepers.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Samaritanes</hi> were tainted, not with Schiſm, but Hereſie, but Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
our Saviour yet blaks them not, but makes uſe of the way as it
lies, and beſtows upon them the curteſie of ſome Miracles. Some kind
of commerce is lawfull even with thoſe without. Terms of intireneſſe
and leagues of inward amity are here unfit, unwarrantable, dangerous; but
civil reſpects, and wiſe uſes of them for our convenience or neceſſity, need not,
muſt not be forborn.</p>
                  <p>Ten Lepers are here met: thoſe that are excluded from all other ſociety,
ſeek the company of each other. Fellowſhip is that we all naturally affct,
though even in Leproſie. Ever Lepers will flock to their fellows: where ſhall
we finde one ſpiritual Leper alone? Drunkards, profane perſons, Hereticks <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
will be ſure to conſort with their matches. Why ſhould not Gods Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in an holy communion? Why is it not our chief joy to aſſemble in good?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritanes</hi> could not abide one another, yet here in Leproſie
they accord; here was one <hi>Samaritane</hi> Leper with the <hi>Jewiſh:</hi> community of
paſſion hath made them friends, whom even Religion disjoyned. What virtue
there is in miſery, that can unite even the moſt eſtranged hearts!</p>
                  <p>I ſeek not myſtery in the number. Theſe Ten are met together, and all
meet Chriſt: not caſually, but upon due deliberation; they purpoſely waited
for this opportunity. No marvell if they thought no attendance long to be
delivered from ſo loathſome and miſerable a diſeaſe. Great <hi>Naaman</hi> could be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
glad to come from <hi>Syria</hi> to <hi>Judaea,</hi> in hope of leaving that hatefull gueſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
him. We are all ſenſible enough of our bodily infirmities. Oh that we
could be equally weary of the ſickneſſes and deformities of our better part.
Surely our ſpiritual maladies are no leſſe then mortal, if they be not healed;
neither can they heal alone. Theſe men had died Lepers if they had not met
with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Oh Saviour, give us grace to ſeek thee, and patience to wait for thee; and
then we know thou wilt finde us, and we remedy.</p>
                  <p>Where do theſe Lepers attend for Chriſt, but in a village? and that, not
in the ſtreet of it, but in the entrance, in the paſſage to it. The Cities, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
Towns were not for them; the Law of God had ſhut them out from all fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
from all converſation. Care of ſafety and fear of infection was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
enough to make their neighbours obſervant of this piece of the Law. It is
not the body only that is herein reſpected by the God of Spirits. Thoſe that
are ſpiritually contagious muſt be ſtill and ever avoided; they muſt be ſeparated
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44233:69"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> from us, we muſt be ſeparated from them: they from us, by juſt cenſures; or
(if that be neglected) we from them, by a voluntary declination of their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
converſation.) Beſides the benefit of our ſafety, wickedneſſe would ſoon
be aſhamed of it ſelf if it were not for the incouragement of companions. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarineſſe
is the fitteſt antidote for ſpiritual infection. It were happy for the
wicked man, if he could be ſeparated from himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Lepers that came to ſeek Chriſt, yet finding him, they ſtand afar off;
whether for reverence, or for ſecurity. God had enacted this diſtance. It was
their charge, if they were occaſioned to paſſe through the ſtreets, to cry out,
<hi>I am unclean.</hi> It was no leſſe then their duty to proclaim their own infectiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> there was not danger only, but ſin in their approach.</p>
                  <p>How happy were it, if in thoſe wherein there is more peril, there were more
remoteneſſe, leſſe ſilence? O God, we are all Lepers to thee, overſpred with
the loathſome ſcurf of our own corruptions: It becomes us well, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of our ſhame and vileneſs, to ſtand afar off. We cannot be too awfull
of thee, too much aſhamed of our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Yet theſe men, though they be far off in the diſtance of place, yet they are
near in reſpect of the acceptance of their Prayer. <hi>The Lord is near unto all that
call upon him in truth.</hi> O Saviour, whiles we are far off from thee, thou art near
unto us. Never doſt thou come ſo cloſe to us, as when in an holy baſhfulneſſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> we ſtand furtheſt off. Juſtly doſt thou exſpect we ſhould be at once bold and
baſhfull. How boldly ſhould we come to the throne of Grace, in reſpect of the
grace of that throne? how fearfully, in reſpect of the awfulneſs of the Majeſty
of that throne, and that unworthineſs which we bring with us into that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
preſence?</p>
                  <p>He that ſtands near may whiſper; but he that ſtands afar off muſt cry aloud:
ſo did theſe Lepers. Yet not ſo much diſtance as paſſion ſtrained their throats.
That which can give voice to the Dumb, can much more give loudneſs to the
Vocal.</p>
                  <p>All cried together: theſe ten voices were united in one ſound; that their
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> conjoined forces might expugn that Gracious eare. Had every man ſpoken
ſingly for himſelf, this had made no noiſe, neither yet any ſhew of a ſervent
importunity: Now as they were all affected with one common diſeaſe, ſo they
all ſet out their throats together, and (though <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritanes</hi>) agree
in one joynt ſupplication. Even where there are ten tongues, the word is but
one; that the condeſcent may be univerſal. When we would obtain common
favours, we may not content our ſelves with private and ſolitary Devotions,
but muſt joyn our ſpiritual forces together, and ſet upon God by troups. <hi>Two
are better then one; becauſe they have a good reward for their labour.</hi> No faithfull
Prayer goes away unrecompenſed: but where many good hearts meet, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> muſt be needs anſwerable to the number of the petitioners. Oh holy
and happy violence that is thus offered to Heaven! How can we want Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
when ſo many cords draw them down upon our heads?</p>
                  <p>It was not the ſound, but the matter, that carried it with Chriſt: if the ſound
were ſhrill, the matter was faithfull; <hi>Jeſu Maſter, have mercy upon us.</hi> No word
can better become the mouth of the miſerable. I ſee not where we can meet
with fitter patterns. Surely, they were not verier Lepers then we: why do
we not imitate them in their actions, who are too like them in our condition?
Whither ſhould we ſeek but to our <hi>Jeſus?</hi> How ſhould we ſtand aloof in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of our own wretchedneſs? how ſhould we lift up our voice in the fervour
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of our ſupplications? what ſhould we rather ſue for then mercy? <hi>Jeſu Maſter,
have mercy upon us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh gracious prevention of mercy, both had and given ere it can be asked!
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> when he ſaw them, ſaid, <hi>Goe ſhew your ſelves to the Prieſts.</hi> Their diſeaſe
is cured ere it can be complained of; their ſhewing to the Prieſt preſuppoſes
them whole; whole in his grant, though not in their own apprehenſion.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44233:70"/>
That ſingle Leper that came to Chriſt before, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 8. <hi>Luke</hi> 5.) was firſt cured <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
in his own ſenſe; and then was bid to goe to the Prieſt for approbation of the
Cure. It was not ſo with theſe; who are ſent to the Judges of Leproſie, with an
intention they ſhall in the way finde themſelves healed. There was a different
purpoſe in both theſe: In the one, that the perfection of the Cure might be
convinced, and ſeconded with a due ſacrifice; in the other, that the Faith of the
Patients might be tried in the way; which if it had not held as ſtrong in the
proſecution of their ſuit as in the beginning, had (I doubt) failed of the effect.
How eaſily might theſe Lepers think, <q>Alas, to what purpoſe is this? Shew our
ſelves to the Prieſts? What can their eyes doe? They can judge whether it be
cured, (which we ſee yet it is not) they cannot cure it. This is not now to doe:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
We have been ſeen enough, and loathed. What can their eyes ſee more then
our own? We had well hoped that <hi>Jeſus</hi> would have vouchſafed to call us to
him, and to lay his hands upon us, and to have healed us.</q> Theſe thoughts
had kept them Lepers ſtill. Now ſhall their Faith and Obedience be proved
by their ſubmiſſion both to this ſuddain command, and that Divine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>That former Leper was charged to ſhew himſelf to the chief Prieſt, theſe
to the Prieſts; either would ſerve: the original command runs, either to <hi>Aaron</hi>
or to one of his Sons. But why to them? Leproſie was a bodily ſickneſs; what
is this to ſpiritual perſons? Wherefore ſerve Phyſicians, if the Prieſts muſt
meddle with diſeaſes? We never ſhall finde thoſe Sacred perſons to paſſe their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
judgment upon Fevers, Dropſies, Palſies, or any other bodily diſtemper: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhould they on this, were it not that this affection of the body is joyned
with a Legal uncleanneſs. Not as a ſickneſs, but as an impurity muſt it come
under their cogniſance: neither this, without a further implication. Who but
the ſucceſſors of the Legal Prieſthood are proper to judge of the uncleanneſſes
of the Soul? Whether an act be ſinfull, or in what degree it is ſuch; what
grounds are ſufficient for the comfortable aſſurance of Repentance, of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe;
what courſes are fitteſt to avoid the danger of relapſes, who is ſo
like to know, ſo meet to judge, as our Teachers? Would we in theſe caſes
conſult ofter with our ſpiritual Guides, and depend upon their faithfull adviſes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
and well-grounded abſolutions, it were ſafer, it were happier for us. Oh the
dangerous extremity of our wiſdome! Our hood-wink'd Progenitors would
have no eyes but in the heads of their ghoſtly Fathers: We think our ſelves ſo
quick-ſighted, that we pity the blindneſs of our able Teachers; none but our
ſelves are fit to judge of our own Leproſie.</p>
                  <p>Neither was it onely the peculiar judgment of the Prieſt that was here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
but the thankfulneſs of the Patient: that by the ſacrifice which he
ſhould bring with him, he might give God the glory of his ſanation. O God,
whomſoever thou cureſt of this ſpiritual Leproſie, it is reaſon he ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
thee with the true Evangelical ſacrifices, not of his praiſes onely, but of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
himſelf, which are <hi>reaſonable</hi> and <hi>living.</hi> We are ſtill leprous if we do not firſt
ſee our ſelves foul, and then finde our ſelves thankfully ſerviceable.</p>
                  <p>The Lepers did not, would not goe of themſelves, but are ſent by Chriſt;
<hi>Goe and ſhew your ſelves.</hi> And why ſent by him? Was it in obedience to the
Law? was it out of reſpect to the Prieſthood? was it for prevention of cavils?
was it for conviction of gainſayers? or was it for confirmation of the Miracle?
Chriſt that was above the Law would not tranſgreſſe it; he knew this was his
charge by <hi>Moſes.</hi> How juſtly might he have diſpenſed with his own? but he
will not: though the Law doth not binde the Maker, he will voluntarily binde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
himſelf. He was within the ken of his <hi>Conſummatum eſt;</hi> yet would not antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
that approaching end, but holds the Law on foot till his laſt pace. This
was but a branch of the Ceremonial; yet would he not ſlight it, but in his
own perſon gives example of a ſtudious obſervation.</p>
                  <p>How carefully ſhould we ſubmit our ſelves to the Royal laws of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44233:70"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to the wholſome lawes of our Superiours, whiles the Son of God would
not but be ſo punctuall in a Ceremony?</p>
                  <p>Whiles I look to the Perſons of thoſe Prieſts, I ſee nothing but corruption,
nothing but profeſſed hoſtility to the true <hi>Meſsiah.</hi> All this cannot make thee,
O Saviour, to remit any point of the obſervance due to their Places. Their
Function was ſacred, whatever their Perſons were: though they have not the
grace to give thee thy due, thou wilt not faile to give them theirs. How juſtly
doſt thou expect all due regard to thine Evangelicall Prieſthood, who gaveſt
ſo curious reſpect to the Legall? It were ſhame the Synagogue ſhould be above
the Church; or that Prieſthood which thou meanteſt ſpeedily to abrogate,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſhould have more honour then that which thou meanteſt to eſtabliſh and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate.</p>
                  <p>Had this duty been neglected, what clamours had been raiſed by his emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
adverſaries? What ſcandalls? though the fault had been the Patients,
not the Phyſicians. But they that watched Chriſt ſo narrowly, and were apt
to take ſo poor exceptions at his Sabbath-cures, at the unwaſhen hands of his
Diſciples, how much more would they have calumniated him if by his neglect
the Law of Leproſie had been palpably tranſgreſſed? Not only evil muſt be
avoided, but offence; and that not on our parts, but on others. That offence
is ours, which we might have remedied.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> What a noble and irrefragable teſtimony was this to the power, to the
truth of the <hi>Meſsiah?</hi> How can theſe Jewes but either believe, or be made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable
in not believing? When they ſhall ſee ſo many Lepers come at once
to the Temple, all cured by a ſecret will, without word or touch, how can
they chuſe but ſay, This work is ſupernaturall; no limited power could doe
this? How is he not God, if his power be infinite? Their own eyes ſhall be
witneſſes and Judges of their own conviction.</p>
                  <p>The Cure is done by Chriſt more exquiſitely then by Art or Nature; yet
it is not publickly aſſured and acknowledged, till according to the <hi>Moſaicall</hi>
Law certain ſubſequent rites be performed. There is no admittance into the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Congregation, but by ſprinkling of blood. O Saviour, we can never be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
of our cleanſing from that ſpirituall Leproſie wherewith our Souls are
tainted, but by the ſprinkling of thy moſt precious blood: <hi>waſh us</hi> with that,
<hi>and we ſhall be whiter then ſnow.</hi> This act of ſhewing to the Prieſt was not
more required by the Law then pre-required of theſe Lepers by our Saviour,
for the tryall of their Obedience. Had they now ſtood upon terms with Chriſt,
and ſaid, <q>We will firſt ſee what cauſe there will be to ſhew our ſelves to the
Prieſts; they need not ſee our leprie, we ſhall be glad they ſhould ſee our
Cure: do thou work that which we ſhall ſhew, and bid us ſhew what thou
haſt wrought: till then excuſe us:</q> it is our grief and ſhame to be ſeen too
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> much; they had been ſtill Lepers.</p>
                  <p>It hath been ever God's wont by ſmall Precepts to prove mens diſpoſitions.
Obedience is as well tried in a trifle, as in the moſt important charge; yea
ſo much more, as the thing required is leſſe: for oft-times thoſe who would
be carefull in main affairs, think they may neglect the ſmalleſt. What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ſoever we receive from God or our Superiors, we muſt not ſcan the
weight of the thing, but the authority of the commander. Either difficulty or
ſlightneſſe are vain pretences for Diſobedience.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Lepers are wiſer; they obeyed, and went. What was the iſſue? <hi>As
they went, they were healed.</hi> Lo, had they ſtood ſtill, they had been Lepers;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> now they went, they are whole. What haſte the Bleſſing makes to overtake
their Obedience? This walk was required by the very Law, if they ſhould have
found themſelves healed: what was it to prevent the time a little, and to doe
that ſooner upon hopes which upon ſenſe they muſt doe after? The horror of
the Diſeaſe adds to the grace of the Cure; and that is ſo much more gracious as
the task is eaſier: It ſhall coſt them but a walk. It is the bounty of that God
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44233:71"/>
whom we ſerve, to reward our worthleſſe endeavours with infinite requitals.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
He would not have any proportion betwixt our acts and his remunerations.</p>
                  <p>Yet beſides this recompence of Obedience, O Saviour, thou wouldſt herein
have reſpect to thine own juſt Glory. Had not theſe Lepers been cured in the
way, but in the end of their walk, upon their ſhewing to the Prieſts, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
had loſt much light: perhaps the Prieſts would have challenged it to
themſelves, and have attributed it to their prayers; perhaps the Lepers might
have thought it was thy purpoſe to honour the Prieſts as the inſtruments of
that marvellous Cure. Now there can be no colour of any others participation,
ſince the Leproſie vaniſhes in the way. As thy Power, ſo thy Praiſe admits of
no partners.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, methinks, I ſee what an amazed joy there was amongſt theſe
Lepers, when they ſaw themſelves thus ſuddainly cured: each tells other what
a change he feels in himſelf; each comforts other with the aſſurance of his
outward clearneſs; each congratulates others happineſſe, and thinks, and ſaies
how joyfull this news will be to their friends and families. Their ſociety now
ſerves them well to applaud and heighten their new felicity.</p>
                  <p>The Miracle indifferently wrought upon all, is differently taken. All went
forward (according to the appointment) toward the Prieſts, all were obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
one only was thankfull. All were cured, all ſaw themſelves cured: their
ſenſe was alike, their hearts were not alike. What could make the difference <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
but Grace? and who could make the difference of Grace but he that gave it?
He that wrought the Cure in all, wrought the Grace not in all, but in one. The
ſame act, the ſame motives, are not equally powerfull to all: where the Oxe
findes graſſe, the Viper poyſon. We all pray, all hear; one goes away bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
another cavils. Will makes the difference; but who makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of wills but he that made them? He that creates the new Heart, leaves
a ſtone in one boſome, puts fleſh into another. <hi>It is not in him that willeth
nor in him that runneth, but in God that hath mercy.</hi> O God, if we look not
up to thee, we may come, and not be healed; we may be healed, and not be
thankfull.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>This one man breaks away from his fellows to ſeek Chriſt. Whiles he was
a Leper, he conſorted with Lepers; now that he is healed, he will be free.
He ſaith not, I came with theſe men, with them I will goe; if they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
I will accompany them; if not, what ſhould I goe alone? as I am not
wiſer then they, ſo I have no more reaſon to be more thankfull. There are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
wherein Singularity is not lawfull only, but laudable. <hi>Thou ſhalt not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
a multitude to doe evil. I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord.</hi> It is a baſe and
unworthy thing for a man ſo to ſubject himſelf to others examples, as not
ſometimes to reſolve to be an example to others. When either evil is to be
done or good neglected, how much better is it to goe the right way alone, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
to erre with company?</p>
                  <p>Oh noble pattern of Thankfulneſſe! what ſpeed of retribution is here? No
ſooner doth he ſee his Cure, then he haſts to acknowledge it: the Benefit ſhall
not die, not ſleep in his hand. Late profeſſions of our obligations favour of
dulneſſe and ingratitude. What a laborious and diligent officiouſneſſe is here?
He ſtands not ſtill, but puts himſelf to the pains of a return. What an hearty
recognition of the bleſſing? His voice was not more loud in his ſuit then in his
thanks. What an humble reverence of his Benefactour? He falls down at his
feet: as acknowledging at once beneficence and unworthineſſe. It were happy
for all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if they could but learn of this <hi>Samaritane.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>This man is ſent with the reſt to the Prieſts. He well knew this duty a
branch of the Law of Ceremonies, which he meant not to neglect: but his heart
told him there was a Morall duty of profeſſing thankfulneſſe to his Benefactor,
which called for his firſt attendance. Firſt therefore he turns back, ere he will
ſtir forward. Reaſon taught this <hi>Samaritane</hi> (and us in him) that ceremony
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44233:71"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> muſt yield to ſubſtance, and that main points of Obedience muſt take place of
all Rituall complements.</p>
                  <p>It is not for nothing that note is made of the Countrey of this thankfull Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
<hi>He was a Samaritane:</hi> The place is known and branded with the infamy
of a Paganiſh miſ-religion. Outward diſadvantage of place or parentage can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
block up the way of God's Grace and free election; as contrarily the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of birth and nature availe us nothing in ſpirituall occaſions.</p>
                  <p>How ſenſible wert thou, O Saviour, of thine own beneficence? <hi>Were there
not ten cleanſed? but where are the nine?</hi> The trouping of theſe Lepers together
did not hinder thy reckoning. It is both juſtice and wiſdome in thee to keep
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a ſtrict account of thy favours. There is an wholeſome and uſefull art of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe
in us men, both of Benefits done, and of Wrongs offered. It is not
ſo with God. Our injuries indeed he ſoon puts over; making it no ſmall part
of his ſtyle, that he <hi>forgives iniquities:</hi> but for his mercies, there is no reaſon
he ſhould forget them; they are worthy of more then our memory. His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
are univerſall over all his works; there is no creature that taſts not of
his bounty; his Sun and Rain are for others beſides his friends: but none
of his good turns eſcapes either his knowledge or record. Why ſhould not we
(O God) keep a book of our receits from thee, which agreeing with thine may
declare thee bounteous, and us thankfull?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Our Saviour doth not ask this by way of doubt, but of exprobration? Full
well did he count the ſteps of thoſe abſent Lepers; he knew where they were;
he upbraids their ingratitude, that they were not where they ſhould have
been. It was thy juſt quarrell, O Saviour, that while one <hi>Samaritane</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
nine <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were healed and returned not. Had they been all <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes,</hi>
this had been faulty; but now they were <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> their ingratitude
was more foul then their Leproſie. The more we are bound to God, the more
ſhamefull is our unthankfulneſſe. There is ſcarce one in ten that is carefull to
give God his own: this neglect is not more generall then diſpleaſing. Chriſt
had never miſſed their preſence, if their abſence had not been hatefull and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> injurious.</p>

                     <p>O Therwhere ye may look long, and ſee no Miracle; but here behold two
Miracles in one view: the former, of the Angel curing Diſeaſes; the
later, of the God of Angels, Chriſt <hi>Jeſus,</hi> preventing the Angel in
his Cure. Even the firſt Chriſt wrought by the Angel; the ſecond
immediatly by himſelf. The firſt is incomparable, for (as <hi>Montanus</hi> truly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves)
there is no one <hi>miraculum perpetuum</hi> but this one, in the whole Book
of God. Be content to ſpend this hour with me in the porches of <hi>Betheſda,</hi>
and conſider with me the Topography, the Aitiology, the Chronography of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
this Miracle. Theſe three limit our ſpeech and your patient attention. The
Chronography (which is firſt in place and time) offers us two heads: 1. a Feaſt
of the Jewes; 2. Chriſt going up to the Feaſt. The Jews were full of Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,
both of God's inſtitution and the Churches. Of God's, both weekly,
monthly, anniverſary. Weekly, that one of ſeven, which I would to God we
had learned of them to keep better. In this regard it was that <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid, the
Jewes did <hi>Septimam aetatis partem perdere, loſe the ſeventh part of their life.</hi>
Monthly, the New moons, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. Anniverſary, Eaſter, Pentecoſt, and the
September-feaſts. The Churches, both the <hi>Purim</hi> by <hi>Mardocheus;</hi> and the
<hi>Encaenia</hi> by <hi>Judas Maccabaeus,</hi> which yet Chriſt honored by his ſolemnization,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                        <hi>John</hi> 10. Surely God did this for the chearfulneſſe of his people in his ſervice:
hence the Church hath laudably imitated this example. To have no Feaſts is
ſullen: to have too many is Paganiſh and Superſtitious. Neither would God
have caſt the Chriſtian Eaſter upon the juſt time of the Jewiſh Paſch, and their
Whitſontide upon the Jewiſh Pentecoſt; if he would not have had theſe Feaſts
continued. And why ſhould the Chriſtian Church have leſſe power then the
Jewiſh Synagogue? Here was not a mere Feriation, but a Feaſting; they muſt
appeare before God <hi>cum muneribus with gifts.</hi> The tenth part of their encreaſe
muſt be ſpent upon the three ſolemn Feaſts, beſides their former tithes to <hi>Levi,
Deut.</hi> 14. 23. There was no holy-day wherein they feaſted above ſix hours:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
and in ſome of them Tradition urged them to their quantities of drink: And
<hi>David,</hi> when he would keep holy-day to the Ark, allows every <hi>Iſraelite</hi> a
cake of bread, a piece of fleſh, a bottle of wine; not a dry dinner (<hi>prandium ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninum</hi>)
not a mere drinking, of wine without meat, but to make up a perfect
feaſt, Bread, Fleſh, Wine, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. The true Purims of this Iland are thoſe
two Feaſts of Auguſt and November. He is no true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> that keeps them
not, as the daies which the Lord hath made. When are joy and triumphs ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
if not at Feaſts? but not exceſſe. Pardon me, I know not how Feaſts
are kept at the Court: but, as <hi>Job,</hi> when he thought of the banquets of his
Sons, ſayes, <hi>It may be they have ſinned;</hi> ſo let me ſpeak at peradventures, If <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
ſenſuall immoderation ſhould have ſet her foot into theſe Chriſtian Feaſts, let
me at leaſt ſay with indulgent <hi>Ely, Non eſt bona fama, filii, It is no good report,
my ſons.</hi> Do ye think that S: <hi>Paul</hi>'s rule, <hi>Non in comeſſationibus &amp; ebrietate,
not in ſurfeiting and drunkenneſſe,</hi> was for work-days only? The Jewes had
a conceit, that on their Sabbath and. Feaſt-days the Devils fled from their
Cities <hi>ad montes umbroſos, to the ſhadie mountains.</hi> Let it not be ſaid, that on
our Chriſtian Feaſts they ſhould <hi>è montibus aulam petere:</hi> and that he ſeeks,
and finds not, <hi>loca arida,</hi> but <hi>madida.</hi> God forbid that Chriſtians ſhould ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to <hi>Bacchus</hi> in ſtead of the ever-living God: and that on the day when you
ſhould have been blown up by treacherous fire from earth to Heaven, you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
ſhould fetch down the fire of God's anger from Heaven upon you by ſwilling
and ſurfeits: God forbid. God's ſervice is <hi>unum neceſſarium one thing neceſſary,</hi>
ſaith Chriſt. <hi>Homo cbrius, ſuperflua creatura, A drunken man is a ſuperfluous
creature,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> How ill do thoſe two agree together? This I have
been bold to ſay out of caution, not of reproof.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Thus much, that there was a Feaſt of the Jewes. Now, what Feaſt it
was is queſtionable: whether the Paſch, as <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> with him, thinks,
upon the warrant of <hi>John</hi> 4. 35. where our Saviour had ſaid, <hi>Yet four months,
and then comes harveſt:</hi> or whether Pentecoſt, which was fifty dayes from
the ſhaking of the ſheaf (that was Eaſter Sunday) as <hi>Cyrill, Chryſoſtome, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophylact,
Euthymius,</hi> and ſome later: or whether one of the September Feaſts,
as ſome others. The excellencie of the Feaſt makes for Eaſter; the Feaſt

                     </gap>. the number of Interpreters for Pentecoſt; the number of Feaſts
for September. For as God delighted in the number of ſeven, the ſeventh
day was holy, the ſeventh year, the ſeventh ſeven year: ſo he ſhewed it in the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſeventh month, which reſerves his number ſtill, <hi>September;</hi> the firſt day
whereof was the Sabbath of Trumpets, the tenth <hi>dies expiationum,</hi> and on
the fifteenth began the Feaſt of Tabernacles for ſeven dayes. It is an idleneſs
to ſeek that which we are never the better when we have found. What if
Eaſter? what if Tabernacles? what if Pentecoſt? what loſs, what gain is
this? <hi>Magnâ nos moleſtiâ Johannes liberaſſet, ſi unum adjeciſſet verbum, John

learned ignorance of what God hath concealed; and know, that what he hath
concealed, will not avail us to know.</p>
                  <p>Rather let us inquire why Chriſt would go up to the Feaſt. I find two ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
cords that drew him up thither. 1 His Obedience. 2 His deſire of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting
his Glory.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It was a general law, All males muſt appear thrice a year before the
Lord. Behold, he was the God whom they went up to worſhip at the Feaſt;
yet he goes up to worſhip. He began his life in obedience, when he came in
his Mothers belly to <hi>Bethleem</hi> at the taxation of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and ſo he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> it. He knew his due. <hi>Of whom do the Kings of the earth receive tribute?
of their own, or of ſtrangers? Then their Sons are free.</hi> Yet he that would pay
tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> will alſo pay this tribute of Obedience to his Father. He
that was above the Law, yields to the Law: <hi>Legi ſatisfacere voluit, etſi non
ſub Lege, He would ſatisfie the Law, though he were not under the Law.</hi> The
Spirit of God ſayes, <hi>He learned Obedience in that he ſuffered.</hi> Surely alſo he
taught obedience in that he did. This was his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to <hi>John Baptiſt, It
becomes us to fulfill all Righteouſneſs.</hi> He will not abate his Father one Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
It was dangerous to goe up to that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which he had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for their malice: yet now he will up again. His Obedience drew him
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> up to that bloody Feaſt, wherein himſelf was ſacrificed; how much more now,
that he might ſacrifice? What can we plead to have learned of Chriſt, if not
his firſt Leſſon, Obedience? The ſame proclamation that <hi>Gedeon</hi> made to <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
he makes ſtill to us, <hi>As ye ſee me doe, ſo doe ye.</hi> Whatſoever therefore God
injoyns us, either immediately by himſelf, or mediately by his Deputies, if
we will be Chriſtians, we muſt ſo obſerve, as thoſe that know themſelves
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44233:73"/>
bound to tread in his ſteps that ſaid, <hi>In the volume of thy Book it is written of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
me, I deſired to doe thy will, O God,</hi> Pſal. 40. 6. <hi>I will have obedience</hi> (ſaith God)
<hi>and not ſacrifice.</hi> But where Sacrifice is Obedience, he will have Obedience in
ſacrificing. Therefore Chriſt went up to the Feaſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond motive was the manifeſtation of his Glory. If we be the
light of the world, which are ſo much ſnuffe, what is he that is <hi>the Father
of lights?</hi> It was not for him to be ſet under the buſhel of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> but
upon the table of <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> Thither and then was the confluence of all
the Tribes. Many a time had Chriſt paſſed by this man before, when the
ſtreets were empty; for there he lay many years; yet heales him not till
now. He that ſometimes modeſtly ſteals a Miracle with a <hi>Vide nè cui dixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
See thou tell no man,</hi> that no man might know it; at other times does
Wonders upon the Scaffold of the World, that no man might be ignorant,
and bids proclaim it on the houſe tops. It was fit the world ſhould be thus
publickly convinced, and either wone by belief, or loſt by inexcuſableneſs.
Good the more common it is, the better. <hi>I will praiſe thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, in
Eccleſia magna, in the great Congregation.</hi> Glory is not got in corners. <hi>No
man</hi> (ſay the envious kinſmen of Chriſt) <hi>keeps cloſe, and would be famous.</hi>
No, nor that would have God celebrated. The beſt opportunities muſt be
taken in glorifying him. He that would be Crucified at the Feaſt, that his
Death and Reſurrection might be more famous; will at the Feaſt doe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
that his Divine power might be approved openly. Chriſt is <hi>Flos cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,
non horti, the flower of the field,</hi> and <hi>not of the garden,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard.</hi> God
cannot abide to have his Graces ſmothered in us. <hi>I have not hid thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
within my heart,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt. <hi>Abſolon</hi> when he would be <hi>inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gniter
improbus notoriouſly wicked,</hi> does his villany publickly in the eyes of the
Sun, under no curtain but Heaven. He that would doe notable ſervice to
God, muſt doe it conſpicuouſly. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> gain'd well by Chriſt, but Chriſt
got nothing by him, ſo long as, like a night-bird, he never came to him but
with owles and bats. Then he began to be a profitable Diſciple, when he
durſt oppoſe the Phariſees in their condemnation of Chriſt, though indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
but moſt, when in the night of his death the light of his Faith brought
him openly to take down the Sacred Corps before all the gazing multitude,
and to embalm it. When we confeſs God's name, with the Pſalmiſt, before
Kings; when Kings, defenders of the Faith, profeſs their Religion in publick
and everlaſting monuments to all nations, to all times; this is glorious to God,
and in God to them. It is no matter how cloſe evils be, nor how publick
good is.</p>

not Curioſity. This Pool had <hi>five Porches.</hi> Neither will I run here with
S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> into Allegories; that this Pool was the people of the Jews, <hi>Aquae
multae, populus multus,</hi> and theſe five Porches the Law in the five books of
<hi>Moſes:</hi> nor ſtand to confute <hi>Adrichomius,</hi> which out of <hi>Joſephus</hi> would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
us that theſe five Porches were built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> and that this was <hi>ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
Solomonis,</hi> for the uſe of the Temple. The following words ſhew the uſe
of the Porches; for the receit of <hi>impotent, ſick, blinde, halt, withered, that

it from Cattel, and theſe five valuted entrances were made by ſome Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for the more convenience of attendance. Here was the Mercy of God
ſeconded by the Charity of men: if God will give Cure, they will give har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
Surely it is a good matter to put our hand to Gods; and to further good
works with convenience of injoying them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was grown a City of blood, to the perſecution of the Prophets,
to a wilful deſpight of what belonged to her peace, to a profanation of God's
Temple, to a mere formality in God's ſervices: and yet here were publick
works of Charity in the midſt of her ſtreets. We may not alwaies judge of
the truth of Piety by charitable actions. <hi>Judas</hi> disburſed the money for Chriſt;
there was no Traitor but he. The poor traveller that was robb'd and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> betwixt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Jericho,</hi> was paſſed over firſt by the Prieſt, then
the Levite; at laſt the <hi>Samaritan</hi> came and relieved him: His Religion was
naught, yet his act was good, the Prieſts and Levites Religion good, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charity
ill. <hi>Novatus</hi> himſelf was a Martyr, yet a Schiſmatick. Faith is the
ſoul, and good works are the breath, ſaith S. <hi>James:</hi> but as you ſee in a pair
of bellows there is a forced breath without life; ſo in thoſe that are puffed up
with the winde of oftentation, there may be charitable works without Faith.
The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> unto her four famous Orders of <hi>Jacobins, Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,
Auguſtines</hi> and <hi>Carmelites,</hi> hath added a fifth of <hi>Jeſuites;</hi> and, like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for thoſe five Leprous and lazarly Orders hath built five por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that if the water of any State be ſtirred, they may put in for a ſhare. How
many Cells and Convents hath ſhe raiſed for theſe miſerable Cripples? and now
ſhe thinks (though ſhe exalt her ſelf above all that is called God, though ſhe
diſpence with and againſt God, though ſhe fall down before every block and
wafer, though ſhe kill Kings and equivocate with Magiſtrates,) ſhe is the
onely City of God. <hi>Digna eſt, nam ſtruxit Synagogam, She is worthy, for
ſhe hath built a Synagogue.</hi> Are we more orthodox, and ſhall not we be as
charitable? I am aſhamed to think of rich Noblemen and Merchants that dye
and give nothing to our five porches of <hi>Betheſda.</hi> What ſhall we ſay? Have
they made their Mammon their God, in ſtead of making friends with their
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Mammon to God? Even when they dye will they not (like <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s good
Uſurers) part with that which they cannot hold, that they may get that which
they cannot loſe? Can they begin their will, <hi>In Dei nomine, Amen;</hi> and give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to God? Is he onely a Witneſs, and not a Legatee? Can we bequeath our
Souls to Chriſt in Heaven, and give nothing to his Lims on earth? And if they
will not give, yet will they not lend to God? He that gives to the poor, <hi>Foene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur
Deo, lends to God.</hi> Will they put out to any but God? and then, when in
ſtead of giving ſecurity, he receives with one hand and payes with another,
receives our bequeſt and gives us glory? Oh damnable niggardlineſs of vain
men, that ſhames the Goſpel, and loſes Heaven! Let me ſhew you a <hi>Betheſda</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This was the place, what was the uſe of it? All ſorts of Patients were at

ſick, blind, lame, withered,</hi> all that did either <hi>morbo laborare</hi> or <hi>vitio corporis,</hi>
complain of ſickneſs or impotency, were there. In natural courſe, one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
heales not all diſeaſes, no nor one Agent; one is an Oculiſt, another a
Bone-ſetter, another a Chirugion: But all diſeaſes are alike to the ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
power of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> though the Prince of Phyſicians, yet ſweares by <hi>Aeſculapius</hi>
he will never meddle with cutting of the Stone. There is no Diſeaſe that
Art will not meddle with: there are many that it cannot cure. The
poor <hi>Haemorrhoiſſa</hi> was eighteen yeares in the Phyſicians hands, and had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
away both her body and her ſubſtance. Yea ſome it kills in ſtead of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
healing: whence one Hebrew word ſignifies both <hi>Phyſicians</hi> and <hi>dead men.</hi>
But behold here all Sickneſſes cured by one hand, and by one water. O all
ye that are ſpiritually ſick and diſeaſed, come to the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> the blood
of Chriſt. Do ye complain of the Blindneſs of your Ignorance? here ye ſhall
receive clearneſs of Sight: of the diſtemper of Paſſions? here Eaſe: of the

Life and Vigor. Whatſoever your infirmity be, come to the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi>

                  <p>All theſe may be cured; yet ſhall be cured at leiſure; all muſt wait, all muſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
hope in waiting. Methinks I ſee how enviouſly theſe Cripples look one upon
another, each thinking other a lett, each watching to prevent other, each ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
to be next; like emulous Courtiers, that gape and vie for the next pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
and think it a pain to hope, and a torment to be prevented. But <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſda</hi>
muſt be waited on. He is worthy of his Crutches that will not ſtay God's
leiſure for his Cure. There is no virtue, no ſucceſs without patience. Waiting
is a familiar leſſon with Courtiers: and here we have all need of it. One is ſick
of an overflowing of the Gall, another of a Tumor of Pride, another of the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigo
of Luſt, another of the Vertigo of Inconſtancy, another of the choking
Squinancy of Curſes and Blaſphemies; one of the Boulimy of Gluttony, another <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
of the Pleuritical ſtitches of Envy; one of the contracting Cramp of Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
another of the Atrophy of Unproficiency; one is hide-bound with pride,
another is conſumed with Emulation, another rotten with Corrupt deſires: and
we are ſo much the ſicker, if we feel not theſe diſtempers. Oh that we could
wait at the <hi>Betheſda</hi> of God, attend diligently upon his Ordinances: we could

much for the Body. <hi>Quantis laboribus agitur ut longiore tempore laboretur! multi

the Sons of God. The Kingdome of heaven, the Crown of glory, the Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter

O let us not ſo far forget our ſelves, as in the Ordinances of God to contemn

imitation, had their hill-altars. On the Mount of Olives was Chriſt wont to
ſend up his Prayers, and ſent up himſelf. And here <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>he went up
to an high hill to pray;</hi> not for that God makes difference of places, to whoſe
immenſity Heaven it ſelf is a valley: (It was an heatheniſh conceit of thoſe
<hi>Aramites,</hi> that God is <hi>Deus montium, the God of the mountains</hi>) but becauſe
we are commonly more diſpoſed to good by either the freedom of our ſcope
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to Heaven, or the awfulneſs or ſolitary ſilence of places, which (as one ſaith)
ſtrikes a kinde of adoration into us, or by our local removal from this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
body of the earth: howſoever, when the body ſees it ſelf above the
earth, the eye of the Minde is more eaſily raiſed to her Heaven. It is good to
take all advantage of place (ſetting aſide ſuperſtition) to further our Devotion.
<hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> were in the mountain with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and held up his hands. <hi>Aaron</hi>
(ſay ſome Allegoriſts) is mountainous; <hi>Hur,</hi> fiery: Heavenly Meditation and
the fire of Charity muſt lift up our prayers to God. As Satan carried up Chriſt
to an high hill to tempt him, ſo he carries up himſelf to be freed from tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and diſtraction. If ever we would be transfigured in our diſpoſition, we
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> muſt leave the earth below, and abandon all worldly thoughts. <hi>Venite, aſcenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus;

                  <p>Wherefore then did Chriſt climb up this high hill? Not to look about
him, but, ſaith S. <hi>Luke,</hi>

                     <hi>to pray;</hi> not for proſpect, but for devotion;
that his thoughts might climb up yet nearer to Heaven. Behold how Chriſt
entred upon all his great works with Prayers in his mouth. When he was to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> enter into that great work of his Humiliation in his Paſſion, he went into the
Garden to pray; when he is to enter into this great work of his Exaltation in
his Transfiguring, he went up into the mountain to pray: he was taken up
from his knees to both. O noble example of Piety and Devotion to us! He was
God that prayed: the God that he prayed to, he might have commanded; yet
he prayed, that we men might learn of him to pray to him. What ſhould we
men dare to doe without prayers, when he that was God would doe nothing
without them? The very heathen Poet could ſay, <hi>A Jove principium:</hi> and
which of thoſe verſe-mongers ever durſt write a ballad without imploring of
ſome Deity? which of the heathens durſt attempt any great enterpriſe, <hi>inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutato
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> numine,</hi> without invocation and ſacrifice? <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf would play the
Prieſt, and offer a burnt-offering to the Lord, rather then the <hi>Philiſtins</hi>
ſhould fight with him unſupplicated; as thinking any devotion better then
none; and thinking it more ſafe to ſacrifice without a Prieſt, then to fight
without Prayers. <hi>Ungirt, unbleſt,</hi> was the old word; as not ready till they
were girded, ſo not till they had prayed. And how dare we ruſh into the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
of God or the State? how dare we thruſt our ſelves into actions either
perilous or important, without ever lifting up our eyes and hearts unto the
God of Heaven? Except we would ſay (as the deviliſh malice of <hi>Surius</hi> ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
that zealous <hi>Luther) Nec propter Deum haec res coepta eſt, nec propter Deum
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> finietur, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This buſineſs was neither begun for God, nor ſhall be ended for
him.</hi> How can God bleſs us if we implore him not? how can we proſper if
he bleſs us not? How can we hope ever to be transfigured from a lump of
corrupt fleſh, if we do not aſcend and pray? As the <hi>Samaritane</hi> woman ſaid

many Chriſtians, with whom it is a juſt exception againſt any witneſs by their
Law, that he hath not prayed ſix times in each natural day. Before the day
break, they pray for day; when it is day, they give God thanks for day;
at noon they thank God for half the day paſt; after that they pray for a good
Sun-ſet; after that they thank God for the day paſſed; and laſtly, pray for
a good night after their day. And we Chriſtians ſuffer ſo many Suns and
Moons to riſe and ſet upon our heads, and never lift up our hearts to their
Creatour and ours, either to ask his bleſſing, or to acknowledg it. Of all
men under Heaven, none had ſo much need to pray as Courtiers. That
which was done but once to Chriſt, is alwaies done to them. They are ſet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

it is ſeen of them as it is with ſome of the mariners, the more need, the leſs

                  <p>Ye have ſeen the Place, ſee the Attendants. He would not have many, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

becauſe he would not have it altogether unknown; and afterwards would have
it known to all. Three were a legal number; <hi>in ore duorum aut trium, in the

and after that two bodily, yet Heavenly, witneſſes were allowed, <hi>Enoch</hi> and
<hi>Elias.</hi> Now in his humanity he was inveſted with glory, he takes but three
witneſſes, and thoſe earthly and weak, <hi>Peter, James, John.</hi> And why theſe?
We may be too curious. <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe the eldeſt; <hi>John,</hi> becauſe the deareſt;

and was loved moſt. I had rather to have no reaſon, but, <hi>quia complacuit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it ſo pleaſed him.</hi> Why may we not as well ask why he choſe theſe
twelve from others, as why he choſe theſe three out of the twelve? If any

tolerable; this by day, yea in a light above day. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> would fain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
it to be an amazedneſs, not a ſleep; not conſidering that they ſlept both
at that Glory, and after in the Agonie. To ſee that Maſter praying, one would
have thought ſhould have fetcht them on their knees; eſpecially to ſee thoſe
Heavenly affections look out at his Eyes; to ſee his Soul lifted up in his
Hands in that tranſported faſhion to Heaven. But now the hill hath wearied

ſaw Divine viſions, they dreamed dreams; whiles he was in another world,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
raviſhed with the ſight of his Fathers Glory, yea of his own, they were in
another world, a world of fancies, ſurprized with the cozen of death, ſleep.

the ſleep of the Church, a waking ſleep; but the plain ſleep of the eyes: and

receit for ſleep. How prone are we to it, when we ſhould minde Divine things?
<hi>Adam</hi> ſlept in Paradiſe and loſt a Rib: but this ſleep was of God's giving, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> this Rib was of God's taking. The good husband ſlept, and found tares. <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
ſlept, and fell. While Satan lulls us aſleep (as he doth always rock the
cradle when we ſleep in our Devotions) he ever takes ſome good from us, or
puts ſome evil in us, or indangers us a deadly fall. Away with this ſpiritual
Lethargie. <hi>Bernard</hi> had wont to ſay that thoſe which ſleep are dead to men,
thoſe that are dead are aſleep to God. But I ſay, thoſe that ſleep at Church are
dead to God: ſo we preach their Funeral Sermons in ſtead of hortatory. And
as he was wont to ſay, he loſt no time ſo much as that wherein he ſlept; ſo let
me adde, there is no loſs of time ſo deſperate as of holy time. Think that
Chriſt ſaith to thee at every Sermon, as he did to <hi>Peter, Etiam Petre dormis?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Sleepeſt thou Peter? couldſt thou not wake with me one hour?</hi> A ſlumbring and
a drowſie heart do not become the buſineſs and preſence of him that keepeth
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſlumbers not.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the Attendants; ſee the Companions of Chriſt. As our glory is
not conſummate without Society; no more would Chriſt have his: therefore
his Transfiguration hath two Companions, <hi>Moſes, Elias.</hi> As S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies of
himſelf, <hi>Whether in the body or out of the body, I know not, God knows:</hi> ſo ſay I
of theſe two. Of <hi>Eliah</hi> there may ſeem leſs doubt, ſince we know that his
body was aſſumed to Heaven, and might as well come down for Chriſts glory
as go up for his own; although ſome grave Authors, as <hi>Calvin, Oecolampadius,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Bale, Fulk,</hi> have held his body with <hi>Enoch</hi>'s, reſolved into their elements:
<hi>ſed ego non credulus illis. Enoch tranſlatus eſt in carne, &amp; Elias carneus raptus
eſt in coelum, &amp;c. Enoch was tranſlated in the fleſh, and Elias being yet in the
fleſh was taken into Heaven,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hierome</hi> in his Epiſtle <hi>ad Pammachium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for <hi>Moſes;</hi> though it be rare and ſingular, and <hi>Auſtin</hi> makes much
ſcruple of it: yet why might not he after death return in his body to the glory
of Chriſt's Transfiguration, as well as afterwards many of the Saints did to the
glory of his Reſurrection? I cannot therefore with the Gloſs think, there is
any reaſon why <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould take another, a borrowed body, rather then his
own. Heaven could not give two fitter Companions, more admirable to the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Jews for their Miracles, more gracious with God for their Faith and Holineſs:
Both of them admitted to the conference with God in <hi>Horeb;</hi> both of them
Types of Chriſt; both of them faſted fourty days; both of them for the glory
of God ſuffered many perils; both divided the waters; both the Meſſengers
of God to Kings; both of them marvellous, as in their life, ſo in their end, A
Chariot of Angels took away <hi>Elias;</hi> he was ſought by the Prophets, and
not found: <hi>Michael</hi> ſtrove with the Devil for the body of <hi>Moſes;</hi> he was
ſought for by the Jews, and not found: and now both of them are found here
together on <hi>Tabor.</hi> This <hi>Elias</hi> ſhews himſelf to the Royal Prophet of his
Church; this <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhews himſelf to the true <hi>Michael: Moſes</hi> the publiſher
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of the Law, <hi>Elias</hi> the chief of the Prophets, ſhew themſelves to the God of

at as the Fore-runners of the ſecond coming of Chriſt, as now they were the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
Foretellers of his departure: neither doubt I that theſe are the Two Witneſſes
which are alluded to in the Apocalyps; howſoever divers of the Fathers have
thruſt <hi>Enoch</hi> into the place of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Look upon the place, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11. 5. Who
but <hi>Elias</hi> can be he of whom is ſaid, <hi>If any man will hurt him, fire proceedeth

<hi>Elias</hi> of whom is ſaid, <hi>He hath power to ſhut the Heaven, that it rain not in the

it is ſaid, <hi>He hath power to turn the waters into blood, and ſmite the earth with all
manner of plagues,</hi> alluding to <hi>Exod.</hi> 7, and 8? But take me aright; let me not
ſeem a friend to the Publicans of <hi>Rome,</hi> an abettor of thoſe Alcoran-like Fables <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
of our Popiſh Doctors, who (not ſeeing the wood for trees) do <hi>haerere in cortice,
ſtick in the bark,</hi> taking all concerning that Antichriſt according to the letter.
<hi>Odi, &amp; arceo.</hi> So ſhall <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> come again in thoſe Witneſſes, as <hi>Elias</hi>
is already come in <hi>John Baptiſt:</hi> their Spirits ſhall be in theſe Witneſſes, whoſe
Bodies and Spirits were witneſſes both of the preſent Glory and future Paſſion
of Chriſt. Doubtleſs many thouſand Angels ſaw this ſight, and were not ſeen;
theſe two both ſaw and were ſeen. O how great an Happineſs was it for theſe
two great Prophets, in their glorified fleſh to ſee their glorified Saviour, who
before his Incarnation had ſpoken to them? to ſpeak to that Man God of
whom they were glorified, and to become Prophets not to men, but to God?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
And if <hi>Moſes</hi> his face ſo ſhone before, when he ſpoke to him without a body in
Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> in the midſt of the flames and clouds; how did it ſhine now,
when himſelf glorified, ſpeaks to him a man, in <hi>Tabor,</hi> in light and majeſty?
<hi>Elias</hi> hid his face before with a mantle when he paſſed by him in the Rock:
now with open face he beholds him preſent, and in his own glory adores his.
Let that impudent <hi>Marcion,</hi> who aſcribes the Law and Prophets to another
God, and deviſes an hoſtility betwixt Chriſt and them, be aſhamed to ſee <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
and <hi>Elias</hi> not onely in <hi>colloquio,</hi> but <hi>in conſortio claritatis,</hi> not onely <hi>in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</hi>
but <hi>in a partnerſhip of brightneſs</hi> (as <hi>Tertull.</hi> ſpeaks) with Chriſt; whom
if he had miſliked, he had his choice of all the Quire of Heaven; and now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
chuſing them, why were they not <hi>in ſordibus &amp; tenebris, in rags and darkneſs?
Sic inalienos demonſtrat illos, dum ſecum habet; ſic relinquendos docet quos ſibi
jungit; ſic deſtruit quos de radiis ſuis exſtruit. So doth he ſhew them farre from
ſtrangeneſs to him, whom he hath with him; ſo doth he teach them to be forſaken,
whom he joyns with himſelf; ſo doth he deſtroy thoſe whom he graces with his
beams of glory,</hi> ſaith that Father. His act verifies his word. <hi>Think not that I
come to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets; I am not come to deſtroy, but to fulfill
them, Mat.</hi> 5. 17. Oh what conſolation, what confirmation was this to the
Diſciples, to ſee ſuch examples of their future Glory? ſuch witneſſes and
adorers of the eternal Deity of their Maſter? They ſaw in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
what they themſelves ſhould be. How could they ever fear to be miſerable,
that ſaw ſuch precedents of their inſuing glory? how could they fear to die,
that ſaw in others the happineſs of their own change? The rich Glutton
pleads with <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>if one came to them from the dead, they will amend:
Abraham</hi> anſwers, <hi>they have Moſes and the Prophets, let them hear them.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
here is both <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets; and theſe too come from the dead:
how can we now but be perſwaded of the happy ſtate of another world, unleſs
we will make our ſelves worſe then the damned? See and conſider that the
Saints of God are not loſt, but departed; gone into a far countrey with their
Maſter, to return again richer and better then they went. Leſt we ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
think this the condition of <hi>Elias</hi> onely, that was rapt into Heaven, ſee here
<hi>Moſes</hi> matched with him, that died and was buried. And is this the ſtate of
theſe two Saints alone? Shall none be ſeen with him in the <hi>Tabor</hi> of Heaven
but thoſe which have ſeen him in <hi>Horeb</hi> and <hi>Carmel?</hi> O thou weak Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
was onely one or two lims of Chriſts body glorious in the Transfiguration,

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> or the whole? He is the Head, we are the Members. If <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi>
were more excellent parts, Tongue, or Hand; let us be but Heels or Toes, his
body is not perfect in glory without ours. <hi>When Chriſt, which is our life, ſhall
appear, then ſhall we alſo appear with him in glory,</hi> Coloſ. 3. 4. How truely may
we ſay to death, <hi>Rejoyce not mine enemy, though I fall, yet ſhall I riſe,</hi> yea I
ſhall riſe in falling? <hi>We ſhall not all ſleep, we ſhall be changed,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
to his <hi>Theſſalonians. Elias</hi> was changed, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſlept; both appeared: to teach
us, that neither our ſleep nor change can keep us from appearing with him.
When therefore thou ſhalt receive the ſentence of death on Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi>
or when the fiery Chariot ſhall come and ſweep thee from this vale of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,

but this one, What <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> did with Chriſt in their apparition. For

to ſee and ſay nothing: but, (as if their Glory had no whit changed
their profeſſion) they are Prophets ſtill, and <hi>foretold his departure,</hi> as S. <hi>Luke</hi>

theſe Heavenly witneſſes tell it over again, for confirmation. Like as <hi>John

two of theſe three witneſſes had ſo ſwallowed this hope, that they had put in

The throne of <hi>David</hi> did ſo fill their eyes, that they could not ſee his

Now therefore that they might ſee that his Sufferings and Death were not of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>

Paſſion, but immediately before and after he did ſome great Miracle. And
here anſwerably, in the midſt of his miraculous Transfiguration, the two Saints
ſpeak of his Paſſion. A ſtrange opportunity: In his higheſt Exaltation to ſpeak
of his Sufferings; to talk of <hi>Calvary</hi> in <hi>Tabor;</hi> when his Head ſhone with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
glory, to tell him how it muſt bleed with thorns; when his Face ſhone like
the Sun, to tell him it muſt be blubbered and ſpat upon; when his Garments
gliſtered with that celeſtial brightneſs, to tell him they muſt be ſtripped and
divided; when he was adored by the Saints of Heaven, to tell him how he
muſt be ſcorned by the baſeſt of men; when he was ſeen between two Saints,
to tell him how he muſt be ſeen between two Malefactors: in a word, in the
midſt of his Divine Majeſty, to tell him of his ſhame; and whilſt he was Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured
in the Mount, to tell him how he muſt be disfigured upon the Croſs.
Yet theſe two Heavenly Prophets found this the fitteſt time for this diſcourſe:
rather chuſing to ſpeak of his Sufferings in the height of his Glory, then of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Glory after his Sufferings. It is moſt ſeaſonable in our beſt to think of our
worſt eſtate: for both that thought will be beſt digeſted when we are well;
and that change will be beſt prepared for when we are the furtheſt from it.
You would perhaps think it unſeaſonable for me, in the midſt of all your

to ſerve in a Death's head amongſt your Royal diſhes, to ſhew your Coffins in

gorgeous without, and perhaps proud within, remember that ere long, as one
worm decks you without, ſo another worm ſhall conſume you within; and
that both the earth that you pranck up, and that earth wherewith you pranck

rareſt occurrences that ever befel the Saviour of the World. I am wont to

Transfiguration, and Agonie: the firſt in the Womb of the Virgin, the ſecond
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:44233:78"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in the Wilderneſs, the third in the Mount, the fourth in the Garden: the firſt,
that God ſhould become man; the ſecond, that God and man ſhould be tempted
and tranſported by Satan; the third, that man ſhould be glorified upon earth;
the laſt, that he which was man and God ſhould ſweat blood under the ſenſe
of Gods wrath for man. And all theſe either had the Angels for witneſſes, or
the immediate voice of God. The firſt had Angels ſinging, the ſecond Angels
miniſtring, the third the voice of God thundring, the fourth the Angels com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting:
that it may be no wonder, the Earth marvels at thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at

changes: <hi>Sublimitas in humilitatem, Height to lowlineſs,</hi> when the Word
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> took fleſh; <hi>Contemptibilitas in Majeſtatem,</hi> when Chriſt transformed himſelf
before his Diſciples; <hi>Mutabilitas in Aeternitatem,</hi> when he roſe again, and

did riſe out of the valley of <hi>Galilee,</hi> ſo this Exaltation did riſe out of the midſt
of Chriſt's Humiliation. Other marvels do increaſe his dejection, this onely
makes for his Glory; and the glory of this is matchable with the humiliation
of all the reſt. That Face wherein before (ſaith <hi>Eſay) there was no form<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor
beautie,</hi> now ſhines as the Sun: That Face which men hid their faces from in
contempt, now ſhines ſo, that mortal eyes could not chuſe but hide themſelves
from the luſtre of it, and immortal receive their beams from it. He had ever

                     <hi>in vultu ſidereum quiddam,</hi> as <hi>Hierome</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>a certain heavenly</hi> Majeſty and
port <hi>in his countenance,</hi> which made his Diſciples follow him at firſt ſight;
but now here was the perfection of ſuperceleſtial brightneſs. It was a Miracle
in the Three Children, that they ſo were delivered from the flames, that their
very garments ſmelt not of the fire: it is no leſs Miracle in Chriſt, that his
very garments were died Celeſtial, and did ſavour of his Glory: like as
<hi>Aaron</hi> was ſo anointed on his head and beard, that his skirts were all perfumed.
His clothes therefore ſhined as ſnow, yea (that were but a wateriſh white) as
the Light it ſelf, ſaith S. <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Matthew,</hi> in the moſt Greek Copies.
That ſeamleſs coat, as it had no welt, ſo it had no ſpot. The King's Son is all
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> fair, even without. O excellent Glory of his Humanitie! The beſt Diamond
or Carbuncle is hid with a caſe: but this brightneſs pierceth through all his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and makes them lightſome in him, which uſe to conceal light in others.
<hi>Herod</hi> put him on in mockage <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. not a white, but <hi>a bright
robe</hi> (the ignorance whereof makes a ſhew of diſparity in the Evangeliſts:) but
God the Father, to glorifie him, cloaths his very garments with Heavenly
ſplendor. <hi>Behold thou art fair (my beloved) behold thou art fair; and there is
no ſpot in thee. Thine head is as fine gold, thy mouth is as ſweet things, and thou
art wholly delectable. Come forth, ye daughters of Sion, and behold King Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
with the Crown wherewith his Father crowned him in the day of the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> gladneſs of his heart.</hi> O Saviour, if thou wert ſuch in <hi>Tabor,</hi> what art thou
in Heaven? If this were the glory of thy Humanity, what is the preſence of thy
Godhead? Let no man yet wrong himſelf ſo much as to magnifie this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
as anothers, and to put himſelf out of the participation of this glory.
Chriſt is our head, we are his members. As we all were in the Firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> both
innocent and ſinning; ſo are we in the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> both ſhining in <hi>Tabor,</hi>
and bleeding ſweat in the Garden. And as we are already happy in him, ſo
ſhall we be once in our ſelves by and through him. <hi>He ſhall change our vile
bodies, that they may be like his glorious body.</hi> Behold our Pattern, and
rejoyce; <hi>Like his glorious body.</hi> Theſe very bodies that are now cloddie like
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the earth, ſhall once be bright as the Sun: and we that now ſee clay in one
anothers faces, ſhall then ſee nothing but Heaven in our countenances: and
we that now ſet forth our bodies with clothes, ſhall then be clothed upon with
Immortality, out of the wardrobe of Heaven. And if ever any painted face
ſhould be admitted to the ſight of this Glory, (as I much fear it: yea I am
ſure God will have none but true faces in Heaven;) they would be aſhamed to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:44233:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
think that ever they had faces to daub with theſe beaſtly pigments, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
of this Heavenly complexion. Let us therefore look upon this fleſh, not ſo
much with contempt of what it was and is, as with a joyfull hope of what it ſhall
be. And when our courage is aſſaulted with the change of theſe bodies from
healthfull to weak, from living to dead; let us comfort our ſelves with the
aſſurance of this change from duſt to incorruption. We are not ſo ſure of death
as of Transfiguration. <hi>All the daies of</hi> our <hi>appointed time</hi> we <hi>will therefore wait,
till</hi> our <hi>changing ſhall come.</hi>

                  <p>Now from the Glory of the Maſter, give me leave to turn your eyes to
the Error of the Servant, who having ſlept with the reſt, and now ſuddenly
awaking, knoweth not whether he ſlept ſtill. To ſee ſuch a light about him,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
three ſo glittering perſons before him, made him doubt now, as he did after,
when he was carried by the Angel through the iron gate, whether it were
a pleaſing dream, or a real act. All ſlept, and now all waked; onely <hi>Peter</hi>
ſlept waking, and I know not whether more erred in his ſpeech or in his ſleep.
It was a ſhame for a man to ſleep in <hi>Tabor,</hi> but it is more a ſhame for a man
to dream with his eyes open. Thus did <hi>Peter; Maſter, it is good for us to be
here. Let us make us three Tabernacles.</hi> I could well ſay with <hi>Optatus</hi> in this or
any other occaſion, <hi>Ipſius Sancti</hi> Petri <hi>beatitudo veniam tribuat, dubito dicere
peccaſſe tantam ſanctitatem, Let bleſſed Peter pardon me, I fear to ſay ſo great
Holineſs offended.</hi> Yet ſince our adverſaries are ſo over-partial to this worthy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Saint, in whom they have as little as they boaſt much, that they can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
his praiſe ſhould blemiſh the dignity of all the reſt, yea that God himſelf
is in danger to be a loſer by the advancement of ſo dear a Servant; give me
leave to lay my finger a little upon this blot. God would never have recorded
that which it ſhould be uncharitable for us to obſerve. It was the injurious
kindneſs of <hi>Marcion</hi> in honour of <hi>Peter,</hi> to leave out the ſtory of <hi>Malchus,</hi> as
<hi>Epiphanius</hi> notes: It ſhall be our blame, if we do not ſo note, that we benefit our
ſelves even by his imperfections. S. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Goſpel is ſaid to be <hi>Peter</hi>'s. O bleſſed
Apoſtle, can it be any wrong to ſay of thee that which thou haſt written of
thy ſelf, not for inſultation, not for exprobration? God forbid but that men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
may be aſhamed to give that to him which he hath denied to himſelf.
Let me therefore not doubt to ſay (with reverence to ſo great a Saint)
that as he ſpake moſt, ſo he is noted to have erred moſt. Not to meddle with
his ſinking, ſtriking, Judaizing; one while we finde him carnally inſinuating,
another while carnally preſuming; one while weakly denying, another while
raſhly miſconſtruing. Carnally inſinuating; <hi>Maſter, favour thy ſelf.</hi> Which
though ſome Paraſites of <hi>Rome</hi> would fain ſmooth up, that he in this ſhewed
his love to Chriſt, as before his Faith, out of S. <hi>Hierome</hi> and S.<hi>Auſtin;</hi> yet it
muſt needs be granted, which <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>diligebat ſpiritum carnaliter, he loved
the ſpirit in a carnall faſhion.</hi> Let them chuſe whether they will admit Chriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
to have chid unjuſtly, or <hi>Peter</hi> worthy of chiding: Except perhaps, with <hi>Hilary,</hi>
they will ſtop where they ſhould not; <hi>Vade poſt me,</hi> ſpoken to <hi>Peter</hi> in appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation;
<hi>Satana, non ſapis quae Dei ſunt,</hi> ſpoken to Satan in objurgation,
Carnally preſuming; <hi>Though all men, yet not I.</hi> If he had not preſumed of
his ſtrength to ſtand, he had not fallen. And as one yawning makes many
open mouths; ſo did his vain reſolution draw on company: <hi>Likewiſe ſaid the
other Diſciples.</hi> For his weak Denial; ye all know his ſimple negation, lined
with an oath, faced with an imprecation. And here, that no man may need to
doubt of an error, the Spirit of God ſaith, <hi>he knew not what he ſaid:</hi> not onely

                     <hi>they were amazedly affrighted.</hi>
Amazedneſs may abate an errour of ſpeech, it cannot take it away. Beſides
aſtoniſhment, here was a fervour of ſpirit; a love to Chriſt's glory, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in it: a fire, but miſplaced, on the top of the chimney, not on the hearth;
<hi>Praematura devotio,</hi> as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>a devotion,</hi> but <hi>raſh</hi> and heady.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> And if it had not been ſo, yet it is not in the power of a good intention to
make a ſpeech good. In this the matter failed: For what ſhould ſuch Saints
doe in earthly Tabernacles, in Tabernacles of his making? And if he could
be content to live there without a tent (for he would have but three made) why
did he not much more conceive ſo of thoſe Heavenly gueſts? And if he ſpoke
this to retain them, how weak was it to think their abſence would be for
want of houſe-room? Or how could that at once be which <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi>
had told him, and that which he wiſhed? For how ſhould Chriſt both depart
at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and ſtay in the Mount? Or if he would have their abode there,
to avoid the ſufferings at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> how did he yet again ſing over that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſong for which he had heard before, <hi>Come behinde me, Satan?</hi> Or if it had been
fit for Chriſt to have ſtaied there, how weakly doth he (which <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>
obſerves) equalize the ſervant with the Maſter, the Saints with God? In a
word, the beſt and the worſt that can be ſaid here of <hi>Peter</hi> is, that which the
Pſalmiſt ſaith of <hi>Moſes,</hi>

                  <p>Yet if any earthly place or condition might have given warrant to <hi>Peter</hi>'s
motion, this was it. Here was a Hill, the Embleme of Heaven; here were two
Saints, the Epitome of Heaven; here was Chriſt, the God of Heaven. And if
<hi>Peter</hi> might not ſay ſo of this, how ſhall we ſay of any other place, <hi>Bonum eſt

darkneſs, by falſe light, by averſion? Darkneſs; he that doth ſin, is in darkneſs:
Falſe light; whilſt we meaſure eternal things by temporary: Averſion; while,
as weak eyes hate the light, we turn our eyes from the true and immutable
good, to the fickle and uncertain. We are not on the hill, but the valley; where
we have tabernacles, not of our own making, but of clay; and ſuch as wherein

                  <p>BEfore, the Diſciples eyes were dazled with Glory; now the brightneſs
of that glory is ſhaded with a <hi>Cloud.</hi> Frail and feeble eyes of mortality
cannot look upon an Heavenly luſtre. That Cloud imports both Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
and Obſcuration. Majeſty; for it was the teſtimony of God's
preſence of old: the Cloud covered the Mountain, the Tabernacle, the Oracle.
He that makes the clouds his Chariot, was in a cloud carried up into Heaven.
Where have we mention of any Divine repreſentation, but a Cloud is one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
part of it? What comes nearer to Heaven, either in place or reſemblance?
Obſcuration; for as it ſhew'd there was a Majeſty, and that Divine; ſo it
ſhew'd them that the view of that Majeſty was not for bodily eyes. Like as
when ſome great Prince walks under a Canopy, that veile ſhews there is a
Great perſon under it, but withall reſtrains the eye from a free ſight of his
perſon. And if the cloud were clear, yet it ſhaded them. Why then was this
cloud interpoſed betwixt that glorious Viſion and them, but for a check of
their bold eyes?</p>
                  <p>Had they too long gazed upon this reſplendent ſpectacle, as their eyes had
been blinded, ſo their hearts had perhaps grown to an over-bold familiarity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
with that Heavenly Object. How ſeaſonably doth the cloud intercept it? The
wiſe God knows our need of theſe viciſſitudes and allayes. If we have a light,
we muſt have a cloud; if a light to chear us, we muſt have a cloud to humble
us. It was ſo in <hi>Sinai,</hi> it was ſo in <hi>Sion,</hi> it was ſo in <hi>Olivet;</hi> it ſhall never be
but ſo. The natural day and night do not more duely interchange, then
this light and cloud. Above we ſhall have the light without the cloud, a
clear viſion and fruition of God without all dim and ſad interpoſitions: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
we cannot be free from theſe miſts and clouds of ſorrow and miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.</p>
                  <p>But this was a <hi>bright cloud.</hi> There is difference betwixt the cloud in <hi>Tabor,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
and that in <hi>Sinai:</hi> This was clear, that darkſome. There is darkneſs in the
Law, there is light in the Grace of the Goſpel. <hi>Moſes</hi> was there ſpoken to
in darkneſs; here he was ſpoken with in light. In that dark cloud there was
terrour; in this there was comfort. Though it were a Cloud then, yet it was
bright; and though it were bright, yet it was a Cloud. With much light
there was ſome ſhade. God would not ſpeak to them concerning Chriſt out
of darkneſs: neither yet would he manifeſt himſelf to them in an abſolute
brightneſs. All his appearances have this mixture. What need I other inſtance
then in theſe two Saints? <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake oft to God mouth to mouth: yet not ſo
immediately, but that there was ever ſomewhat drawn as a curtain betwixt God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
and him; either fire in <hi>Horeb,</hi> or ſmoak in <hi>Sinai:</hi> ſo as his face was not more
veiled from the people, then God's from him. <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall be ſpoken to by God,
but in the Rock, and under a Mantle. In vain ſhall we hope for any revelation
from God, but in a cloud. Worldly hearts are in utter darkneſs, they ſee not ſo
much as the leaſt glimpſe of theſe Divine beams, not a beam of that inacceſſible
light: The beſt of his Saints ſee him here but in a cloud, or in a glaſs. Happy
are we, if God have honoured us with theſe Divine repreſentations of himſelf.
Once, <hi>in his light we ſhall ſee light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I can eaſily think with what amazedneſs theſe three Diſciples ſtood com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
in that bright Cloud, exſpecting ſome miraculous event of ſo Heavenly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
a Viſion; when ſuddenly they might hear a voice ſounding out of that Cloud,
ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed, hear him.</hi> They need
not be told whoſe that voice was; the place, the matter evinced it. No
Angel in Heaven could, or durſt have ſaid ſo. How gladly doth <hi>Peter</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
recount it? <hi>For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when</hi>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:44233:81"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                     <hi>there came ſuch a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved
Son,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>It was onely the eare that was here taught, not the eye. As of <hi>Horeb,</hi>
ſo of <hi>Sinai,</hi> ſo of <hi>Tabor</hi> might God ſay, <hi>Ye ſaw no ſhape nor image in that
day that the Lord ſpake unto you.</hi> He that knows our proneneſs to ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
avoids thoſe occaſions which we might take to abuſe our own
fanſies.</p>
                  <p>Twice hath God ſpoken theſe words to his own Son from Heaven; once
in his Baptiſme, and now again in his Transfiguration. Here not without
ſome oppoſitive compariſon; not <hi>Moſes,</hi> not <hi>Elias,</hi> but <hi>This. Moſes</hi> and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                     <hi>Elias</hi> were Servants, this a <hi>Son: Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were ſons, but of grace
and choice; this is <hi>that Son,</hi> the Son by nature. Other ſons are <hi>beloved</hi>
as of favour, and free election; this is <hi>The Beloved,</hi> as in the unitie of his
eſſence. Others are ſo beloved, that he is pleaſed with themſelves; this ſo
beloved, that <hi>in</hi> and for <hi>him</hi> he is <hi>pleaſed</hi> with mankinde. As the relation
betwixt the Father and the Son is infinite, ſo is the Love. We meaſure the
intention of Love by the extention: the love that reſts in the perſon affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
alone, is but ſtreight: true Love deſcends (like <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Ointment) from
the head to the skirts; to children, friends allyes. O incomprehenſible
large love of God the Father to the Son, that for his ſake he is pleaſed with
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the World! O perfect and happy complacence! Out of Chriſt there is
nothing but enmity betwixt God and the Soul; in him there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but peace. When the beams are met in one center, they do not only
heat, but burn. Our weak love is diffuſed to many; God hath ſome, the
world more; and therein wives, children, friends: but this infinite love of
God hath all the beams of it united in one onely Object, the Son of his Love.
Neither doth he love any thing but in the participation of his Love, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation
from it. O God, let me be found in Chriſt, and how canſt thou but be
pleaſed with me?</p>
                  <p>This one voice proclaimes Chriſt at once the Son of God, the Reconciler of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the world, the Doctor and Law-giver of his Church. As the Son of God, he is
eſſentially intereſſed in his Love: as he is the Reconciler of the world in whom
God is well pleaſed, he doth moſt juſtly challenge our love and adherence: as
he is the Doctor and Law-giver, he doth juſtly challenge our audience, our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
Even ſo, Lord, teach us to hear and obey thee as our Teacher; to love
thee and believe in thee as our Reconciler; and as the eternal Son of thy Father
to adore thee.</p>
                  <p>The light cauſed wonder in the Diſciples; but the voice aſtoniſhment:
They are all falne down upon their faces. Who can blame a mortal man to
be thus affected with the voice of his Maker? Yet this word was but plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and hortatory. O God, how ſhall fleſh and blood be other then ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up with the horror of thy dreadful ſentence of death? <hi>The Lion ſhall
roar, who ſhall not be afraid?</hi> How ſhall thoſe that have ſlighted the ſweet
voice of thine invitations, call to the rocks to hide them from the terror of
thy Judgments?</p>
                  <p>The God of mercies pities our infirmities. I do not hear our Saviour ſay,
Ye lay ſleeping one while upon the earth, now ye lye aſtoniſhed: Ye could
neither wake to ſee, nor ſtand to hear; now lye ſtill and tremble. But he
graciouſly touches and comforts them, <hi>Ariſe, fear not.</hi> That voice which ſhall
once raiſe them up out of the earth, might well raiſe them up from it. That
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> hand which by the leaſt touch reſtored ſight, lims, life, might well reſtore
the ſpirits of the diſmaied. O Saviour, let that ſoveraign hand of thine touch
us when we lye in the trances of our griefs, in the bed of our ſecurities, in the
grave of our ſins, and we ſhall ariſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They looking up, ſaw no man ſave Jeſus alone:</hi> and that doubtleſs in his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
form. All was now gone, <hi>Moſes, Elias,</hi> the Cloud, the Voice, the Glory:
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44233:82"/>
                     <hi>Tabor</hi> it ſelf cannot be long bleſſed with that Divine light and thoſe ſhining <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
gueſts. Heaven will not allow to earth any long continuance of Glory. Only
above is conſtant happineſs to be look'd for and injoyed, where we ſhall ever
ſee our Saviour in his unchangeable brightneſs; where the light ſhall never be
either clouded or varied.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> are gone, only Chriſt is left. The glory of the Law and
the Prophets was but temporary, yea momentany; that onely Chriſt may
remain to us intire and conſpicuous. They came but to give teſtimony to Chriſt;
when that is done, they are vaniſhed.</p>
                  <p>Neither could theſe raiſed Diſciples finde any miſs of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> when
they had Chriſt ſtill with them. Had <hi>Jeſus</hi> been gone, and left either <hi>Moſes</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
or <hi>Elias,</hi> or both, in the Mount with his Diſciples, that preſence (though glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious)
could not have comforted them. Now that they are gone, and he is
left, they cannot be capable of diſcomfort. O Saviour, it matters not
who is away, whiles thou art with us. Thou art God all-ſufficient; what
can we want when we want not thee? Thy preſence ſhall make <hi>Tabor</hi> it
ſelf an Heaven; yea, Hell it ſelf cannot make us miſerable with the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <p>WHat a buſie life was this of Chriſts? He ſpent the night in the
mount of Olives, the day in the Temple: whereas the night is for
a retired repoſe, the day for company; His retiredneſs was for
prayer, his companiableneſs was for preaching. All night he
watches in the Mount; all the morning he preaches in the Temple. It was
not for pleaſure that he was here upon earth; his whole time was penal and
toilſome. How do we reſemble him, if his life were all pain and labour, ours all
paſtime?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>He found no ſuch fair ſucceſs the day before. <hi>The multitude was divided in

yet he returns to the Temple. It is for the ſluggard or the coward to plead
<hi>a Lion in the way:</hi> upon the calling of God, we muſt overlook and contemn
all the ſpight and oppoſition of men. Even after an ill harveſt we muſt ſow;
and after denials we muſt woe for God.</p>
                  <p>This Sun of Righteouſneſs prevents that other, and ſhines early with
wholeſome doctrines upon the Soules of his hearers. The Auditory is both
thronged, and attentive. Yet not all with the ſame intentions: If the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
came to learn, the Scribes and Phariſees came to cavil and carp at his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
With what a pretence of zeal and juſtice yet do they put themſelves
into Chriſts preſence? As lovers of Chaſtity and Sanctimony, and haters
of Uncleanneſs, <hi>they bring to him a woman taken in</hi> the flagrance of her
<hi>Adultery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And why the Woman rather? ſince the Mans offence was equal, if not
more; becauſe he ſhould have had more ſtrength of reſiſtance, more grace
not to tempt. Was it out of neceſſity? Perhaps, the man knowing his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
made uſe of his ſtrength to ſhift away, and violently brake from his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenders.
Or was it out of cunning? in that they hoped for more likely
matter to accuſe Chriſt in the caſe of the woman, then of the man: for that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
ſuppoſed his merciful diſpoſition might more probably incline to compaſſionate
her weakneſs, rather then the ſtronger veſſel.</p>
                  <p>Or was it rather out of partiality? Was it not then, as now, that the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſooneſt ſuffers; and impotency layes us open to the malice of an enemy?
Small flies hang in the webs, whiles waſps break through without control.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> The wand and the ſheet are for poor offenders; the great either out-face or
out-buy their ſhame. A beggarly drunkard is haled to the Stocks, whiles the
rich is chambered up to ſleep out his ſurfeit.</p>
                  <p>Out of theſe grounds is the woman brought to Chriſt: Not to the mount
of Olives, not to the way, not to his private lodging; but to the Temple: and
that not to ſome obſcure angle; but into the face of the aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>They pleaded for her death; the puniſhment which they would onwards
inflict was her ſhame: which muſt needs be ſo much more, as there were more
eyes to be witneſſes of her guiltineſs. All the brood of ſin affects darkneſs and
ſecrecy, but this more properly; the twilight, the night is for the adulterer.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> It cannot be better fitted then to be dragged out into the light of the Sun,
and to be proclamed with hootings and baſons. Oh the impudence of thoſe
men who can make merry profeſſions of their own beaſtlineſs, and boaſt of the
ſhameful trophees of their Luſt!</p>
                  <p>Methinks I ſee this miſerable Adultereſs how ſhe ſtands confounded amidſt
that gazing and diſdainful multitude; how ſhe hides her head, how ſhe
wipes her blubbered face and weeping eyes. In the mean time it is no dumb
ſhow that is here acted by theſe Scribes and Phariſees; they ſtep forth bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to her accuſation; <hi>Maſter, this Woman was taken in adultery in the very
act.</hi> How plauſibly do they begin? Had I ſtood by and heard them, ſhould
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> I not have ſaid, What holy, honeſt, conſcionable men are theſe? what devout
clients of Chriſt? with what reverence they come to him? with what zeal
of juſtice? When he that made and ranſacks their boſome tells me, <hi>All
this is done but to tempt him.</hi> Even the falſeſt hearts will have the plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
mouths: like to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Curtezan, <hi>their lips drop as an hony-comb,
and their mouth is ſmoother then oyl; but their end is bitter as wormwood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Falſe and hollow Phariſees! he is your Maſter whom ye ſerve, not he whom
ye tempt: only in this ſhall he be approved your Maſter, that he ſhall pay your
wages, and give you your portion with hypocrites.</p>
                  <p>The act of Adultery was her crime: to be taken in the very act, was no
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> part of her ſin, but the proof of her juſt conviction: yet her deprehenſion is
made an aggravation of her ſhame. Such is the corrupt judgement of the
world. To doe ill troubles not men, but to be taken in doing it: unknown
filthineſs paſſes away with eaſe; it is the notice that perplexes them, not
the guilt. But, O fooliſh ſinners, all your packing and ſecrecy cannot ſo
contrive it, but that ye ſhall be taken in the manner; your Conſcience takes
you ſo; the God of Heaven takes you ſo: and ye ſhall once finde that your
Conſcience is more then a thouſand witneſſes, and God more then a thouſand
Conſciences.</p>
                  <p>They that complain of the act, urge the puniſhment; <hi>Now Moſes in the Law
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> commanded us that ſuch ſhould be ſtoned.</hi> Where did <hi>Moſes</hi> bid ſo? Surely the
particularity of this execution was without the book: Tradition and Cuſtome
enacted it, not the Law.</p>
                  <p>Indeed <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded death to both the offenders, not the manner of
death to either. By analogie it holds thus: It is flatly commanded in the caſe
of a Damſel betrothed to an Husband, and found not to be a Virgin; in the
caſe of a Damſel betrothed, who being defiled in the city, cryed not: Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and cuſtome made up the reſt; obtaining out of this ground, that all
Adulterers ſhould be executed by lapidation. The antienter puniſhment was
burning; death alwaies, though in divers forms. I ſhame to think that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Chriſtians ſhould ſlight that ſin which both Jewes and Pagans held ever
deadly.</p>
                  <p>What a miſ-citation is this? <hi>Moſes commanded.</hi> The Law was God's, not
<hi>Moſes</hi>'s. If <hi>Moſes</hi> were imployed to mediate betwixt God and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Law
is never the more his: He was the hand of God to reach the Law to <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
the hand of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to take it from God. We do not name the water from
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:44233:83"/>
the pipes, but from the ſpring. It is not for a true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> to reſt in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
ſecond meanes, but to mount up to the ſupreme original of Juſtice. How re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent
ſoever an opinion was had of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he cannot be thus named without a
ſhameful undervaluing of the royal Law of his Maker. There is no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
man whoſe autority may not grow into contempt: that of the ever-living
God cannot but be ever ſacred and inviolable. It is now with the Goſpel,
as it was then with the Law: the word is no other then Chriſts, though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by our weakneſs; whoſoever be the Cryer, the Proclamation is the
King's of Heaven. Whiles it goes for ours, it is no marvel if it lye open to
deſpight.</p>
                  <p>How captious a word is this, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid thus, <hi>what ſaieſt thou?</hi> If they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
be not ſure that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid ſo, why do they affirm it? and if they be ſure,
why do they queſtion that which they know decided? They would not have
deſired a better advantage, then a contradiction to that received Law-giver.
It is their profeſſion, <hi>We are Moſes</hi>'s <hi>diſciples;</hi> and, <hi>We know that God ſpake to
Moſes.</hi> It had been quarrel enough to oppoſe ſo known a Prophet. Still I
finde it the drift of the enemies of truth to ſet Chriſt and <hi>Moſes</hi> together by
the eares; in the matter of the Sabbath, of Circumciſion, of Marriage and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,
of the uſe of the Law, of Juſtification by the Law, of the ſenſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the Law, and where not? But they ſhall never be able to effect it:
they two are faſt and indiſſoluble friends on both parts for ever; each ſpeaks <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
for other, each eſtabliſhes other; they are ſubordinate, they cannot be oppoſite;
<hi>Moſes</hi> faithful as a Servant, Chriſt as a Son. A faithful ſervant cannot be but
officious to the Son. The true uſe we make of <hi>Moſes</hi> is, to be our Schoolmaſter
to teach us, to whip us unto Chriſt; the true uſe we make of Chriſt is, to
ſupply <hi>Moſes. By him all that believe are juſtified from all things from which
they could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes.</hi> Thus muſt we hold in with both,
if we will have our part in either: ſo ſhall <hi>Moſes</hi> bring us to Chriſt, and Chriſt
to glory.</p>
                  <p>Had theſe Phariſees out of ſimplicity and deſire of reſolution in a caſe of
doubt, moved this queſtion to our Saviour, it had been no leſs commendable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
then now it is blame-worthy.</p>
                  <p>O Saviour, whither ſhould we have recourſe but to thine Oracle? Thou art
the Word of the Father, the Doctor of the Church. Whiles we hear from
others, What ſay Fathers? what ſay Councils? let them hear from us, <hi>What
ſaieſt thou?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here it was far otherwiſe: they came not to learn, but to tempt; and
to tempt that they might accuſe. Like their Father the Devil, who ſolicits to
ſin that he may plead againſt us for yieldance. Fain would theſe colloguing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
draw Chriſt to contradict <hi>Moſes,</hi> that they might take advantage of his
contradiction.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the one ſide they ſaw his readineſs to tax the falſe gloſſes which their
preſumptuous Doctors had put upon the Law, with an, <hi>I ſay unto you:</hi> on the
other, they ſaw his inclination to mercy and commiſeration in all his courſes,
ſo far as to neglect even ſome circumſtances of the Law, as to touch the Leper,
to heal on the Sabbath, to eat with known ſinners, to diſmiſs an infamous (but
penitent) offender, to ſelect and countenance two noted Publicans: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they might perhaps think that his compaſſion might draw him to croſs
this Moſaical inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>What a crafty bait is here laid for our Saviour? Such as he cannot bite at,
and not be taken. It ſeems to them impoſſible he ſhould avoid a deep preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
either to his juſtice or mercy. For thus they imagine; Either Chriſt will
ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> in ſentencing this woman to Death, or elſe he will croſs <hi>Moſes</hi>
in diſmiſſing her unpuniſhed. If he command her to be ſtoned, he loſes the
honour of his clemency and Mercy; if he appoint her diſmiſſion, he loſes the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> O the cunning folly of vain men, that hope to beguile wiſdome
it ſelf!</p>
                  <p>Silence and neglect ſhall firſt confound thoſe men, whom after his anſwer
will ſend away convicted. In ſtead of opening his mouth, our Saviour
bowes his body; and in ſtead of returning words from his lips, writes cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
on the ground with his finger. O Saviour, I had rather ſilently
wonder at thy geſture, then inquire curiouſly into the words thou wro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
or the myſteries of thus writing: only herein I ſee thou meanteſt to
ſhew a diſregard to theſe malicious and buſy cavillers. Sometimes tacitur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and contempt are the beſt anſwers. Thou that haſt bidden us <hi>Be wiſe as
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſerpents,</hi> giveſt us this noble example of thy prudence. It was moſt ſafe that
theſe tempters ſhould be thus kept faſting with a ſilent diſreſpect, that their
eagerneſs might juſtly draw upon them an inſuing ſhame.</p>
                  <p>The more unwillingneſs they ſaw in Chriſt to give his anſwer, the more
preſſive and importunate they were to draw it from him. Now, as forced
by their ſo zealous irritation, our Saviour rouzeth up himſelf, and gives it
them home, with a reprehenſory and ſtinging ſatisfaction; <hi>He that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſin among you, let him firſt caſt a ſtone at her.</hi> As if his very action
had ſaid, <q>I was loath to have ſhamed you; and therefore could have
been willing not to have heard your ill-meant motion: but ſince you will
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> needs have it, and by your vehemence force my juſtice, I muſt tell you,
there is not one of you but is as faulty as ſhe whom ye accuſe; there is
no difference, but that your ſin is ſmothered in ſecrecy, hers is brought
forth into the light. Ye had more need to make your own peace by an
humble repentance, then to urge ſeverity againſt another. I deny not but
<hi>Moſes</hi> hath juſtly from God impoſed the penalty of death upon ſuch hainous
offences, but what then would become of you? If death be her due, yet
not by thoſe your unclean hands: your hearts know you are not honeſt
enough to accuſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lo, not the bird, but the fouler is taken. He ſaies not, Let her be ſtoned;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> this had been againſt the courſe of his Mercy: he ſaies not, Let her not be
ſtoned; this had been againſt the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Now he ſo anſwers, that
both his Juſtice and Mercy are entire; ſhe diſmiſſed, they ſhamed.</p>
                  <p>It was the manner of the Jewes, in thoſe hainous crimes that were puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
with Lapidation, that the witneſſes and accuſers ſhould be the firſt
that ſhould lay hands upon the guilty: well doth our Saviour therefore
choak theſe accuſers with the conſcience of their ſo foul incompetency.
With what face, with what heart could they ſtone their own ſin in another
perſon?</p>
                  <p>Honeſty is too mean a term. Theſe Scribes and Phariſees were noted for
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> extraordinary and admired Holineſs: the outſide of their lives was not only
inoffenſive, but Saint-like and exemplary. Yet that all-ſeeing eye of the Son
of God, which <hi>found folly in the Angels,</hi> hath much more found wickedneſs in
theſe glorious Profeſſors. It is not for nothing that <hi>his eyes are like a flame of
fire.</hi> What ſecret is there which he ſearches not? Retire your ſelves, O ye
fooliſh ſinners, into your inmoſt cloſets, yea (if you can) into the center of the
earth; his eye follows you, and obſerves all your carriages: no bolt, no barre,
no darkneſs can keep him out. No thief was ever ſo impudent as to ſteal in
the very face of the Judge. O God, let me ſee my ſelf ſeen by thee, and I ſhall
not dare to offend.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Beſides notice, here is exprobration. Theſe mens ſins, as they had been
ſecret, ſo they were forgotten. It is long ſince they were done; neither did
they think to have heard any more news of them. And now when time and
ſecurity had quite worn them out of thought, he that ſhall once be their Judge,
calls them to a back-reckoning.</p>
                  <p>One time or other ſhall that juſt God lay our ſins in our diſh, and make

us poſſeſs the ſins of our youth. <hi>Theſe things thou didſt, and I kept ſilence; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
thou thoughteſt I was like unto thy ſelf: but I will reprove thee, and ſet them
in order before thee.</hi> The penitent mans ſin lies before him for his humiliation;
the impenitents, for his ſhame and confuſion.</p>
                  <p>The act of ſin is tranſient, not ſo the guilt; that will ſtick by us, and return
upon us, either in the height of our ſecurity, or the depth of our miſery, when
we ſhall be leaſt able to bear it. How juſt may it be with God to take us at
advantages, and then to lay his arreſt upon us when we are laid up upon a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſuit?</p>
                  <p>It is but juſt there ſhould be a requiſition of innocence in them that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
the vices of others. The offender is worthy of ſtoning, but who ſhall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
caſt them? How ill would they become hands as guilty as her own? What
doe they but ſmite themſelves, who puniſh their own offences in other men?
Nothing is more unjuſt or abſurd, then for the beam to cenſure the moat, the
oven to upbraid the kiln. It is a falſe and vagrant zeal that begins not firſt
at home.</p>
                  <p>Well did our Saviour know how bitter and ſtrong a pill he had given to
theſe falſe Juſticiaries; and now he will take leiſure to ſee how it wrought.
Whiles therefore he gives time to them to ſwallow it, and put it over, he
returns to his old geſture of a ſeeming inadvertencie. How ſped the

                  </p>
                  <p>I do no ſee any one of them ſtand out with Chriſt, and plead his own
innocency; and yet theſe men (which is very remarkable) placed the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or violation of the Law only in the outward act. Their hearts miſgave
them, that if they ſhould have ſtood out in conteſtation with Chriſt, he
would have utterly ſhamed them, by diſplaying their old and ſecret ſins; and
have ſo convinced them by undeniable circumſtances, that they ſhould never
have clawed of the reproach: <hi>And</hi> therefore <hi>when they heard it, being convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by their own conſcience, they went out one by one, beginning at the eldeſt,
even unto the laſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There might ſeem to be ſome kinde of mannerly order in this guilty depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
not all at once; leſt they ſhould ſeem violently chaſed away by this
charge of Chriſt; now their ſlinking away <hi>one by one</hi> may ſeem to carry a ſhew
of a deliberate and voluntary diſceſſion. <hi>The eldeſt</hi> firſt: The ancienter is
fitter to give then take example; and the yonger could think it no ſhame
to follow the ſteps of a grave fore-man.</p>
                  <p>O wonderful power of Conſcience! Man can no more ſtand out againſt
it, then it can ſtand out againſt God. The Almighty, whoſe ſubſtitute is
ſet in our boſome, ſets it on work to accuſe. It is no denying when that
ſayes we are guilty; when that condemns us, in vain are we acquitted by
the world. With what bravery did theſe Hypocrites come to ſet upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
Chriſt? with what triumph did they inſult upon that guilty ſoul? Now
they are thunder-ſtruck with their own Conſcience, and drop away con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded;
and well is he that can run away furtheſt from his own ſhame.
No wicked man needs to ſeek out of himſelf for a Judge, Accuſer, Witneſs,
Tormentor.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner do theſe Hypocrites hear of their ſins from the mouth of Chriſt,
then they are gone. Had they been ſincerely touched with a true remorſe,
they would have rather come to him upon their knees, and have ſaid, <q>Lord,
we know and finde that thou knoweſt our ſecret ſins; this argues thy
Divine Omniſcience. Thou that art able to know our ſins, art able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
them. O pardon the iniquities of thy ſervants. Thou that accuſeſt us,
do thou alſo acquit us.</q> But now inſtead hereof, they turn their back upon
their Saviour, and haſte away.</p>
                  <p>An impenitent man cares not how little he hath either of the preſence of
God, or of the mention of his ſins. O fools! if ye could run away from
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:44233:84"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> God, it were ſomewhat; but whiles ye move in him; what doe ye? whither
goe ye? Ye may run from his Mercy, ye cannot but run upon his Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt is <hi>left alone.</hi> Alone in reſpect of theſe complainants; not alone in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the multitude: there yet ſtands the mournfull Adultereſſe. She might
have gone forth with them; no body conſtrained her to ſtay: but that which
ſent them away, ſtayed her, Conſcience. She knew her guiltineſſe was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
accuſed, and durſt not be by her ſelf denied: as one that was therefore
faſtened there by her own guilty heart, ſhe ſtirs not till ſhe may receive a
diſmiſſion.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour was not ſo buſie in writing, but that he read the while the guilt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and abſence of thoſe accuſers; he that knew what they had done, knew no leſs
what they did, what they would doe. Yet, as if the matter had been ſtrange to
him, <hi>he lifts up himſelf, and ſaies, Woman, where are thy accuſers?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How well was this ſinner to be left there? Could ſhe be in a ſafer place then
before the Tribunal of a Saviour? Might ſhe have choſen her refuge, whither
ſhould ſhe rather have fled? O happy we, if when we are convinced in our
ſelves of our ſins, we can ſet our ſelves before that Judge who is our ſurety,
our Advocate, our Redeemer, our ranſome, our peace.</p>
                  <p>Doubtleſſe, ſhe ſtood doubtfull betwixt hope and fear; Hope, in that ſhe
ſaw her accuſers gone; Fear, in that ſhe knew what ſhe had deſerved: and now
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> whiles ſhe trembles in exſpectation of a ſentence, ſhe hears, <hi>Woman, where are
thy accuſers?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherein our Saviour intends the ſatisfaction of all the hearers, of all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders:
that they might apprehend the guiltineſs, and therefore the unfitneſs,
of the accuſers; and might well ſee there was no warrantable ground of his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proceeding againſt her.</p>
                  <p>Two things are neceſſary for the execution of a Malefactor, Evidence, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
the one from Witneſſes, the other from the Judge. Our Saviour asks
for both. The accuſation and proof muſt draw on the ſentence; the ſentence
muſt proceed upon the evidence of the proof; <hi>Where are thy accuſers? hath
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> no man condemned thee?</hi> Had ſentence paſſed legally upon the Adultereſſe,
doubtleſſe our Saviour would not have acquitted her: For as he would not
intrude upon others offices, ſo he would not croſſe or violate the juſtice done
by others. But now, finding the coaſt clear, he ſaies, <hi>Neither do I condemn
thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What, Lord? Doſt thou then ſhew favour to foul offenders? Art thou ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pleaſed that groſſe ſins ſhould be blanched, and ſent away with a gentle
connivency? Far, far be this from the perfection of thy Juſtice. He that hence
argues Adulteries not puniſhable by death, let him argue the unlawfulneſs of
dividing of inheritances, becauſe in the caſe of the two wrangling brethren
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thou ſaidſt, <hi>Who made me a divider of inheritances?</hi> Thou declinedſt the office,
thou didſt not diſlike the act, either of parting lands, or puniſhing offenders.
Neither was here any abſolution of the woman from a ſentence of death, but
a diſmiſſion of her from thy ſentence; which thou kneweſt not proper for
thee to pronounce. Herein hadſt thou reſpect to thy calling, and to the main
purpoſe of thy coming into the world; which was neither to be an arbiter of
Civil Cauſes, nor a judge of Criminal, but a Saviour of mankinde; not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the Body, but to ſave the Soul. And this was thy care in this miſerable
Offender; <hi>Goe, and ſin no more.</hi> How much more doth it concern us to keep
within the bounds of our vocation, and not to dare to trench upon the functions
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of others? How can we ever enough magnifie thy Mercy, who takeſt no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in the death of a ſinner? who ſo cameſt to ſave, that thou challengeſt us of
unkindneſs for being miſerable, <hi>Why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, O Son of God, though thou wouldſt not then be a Judge, yet thou wilt
once be: Thou wouldſt not in thy firſt coming judge the ſins of men, thou
wilt come to judge them in thy ſecond. The time ſhall come when upon that

juſt and glorious Tribunal thou ſhalt judge every man according to his works.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>

                  <p>ONE while I finde Chriſt invited by a Publican, now by a Phariſee.
Whereever he went, he made better chear then he found, in an happy
exchange of ſpiritual repaſt for bodily.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who knows not the Phariſees to have been the proud enemies of
Chriſt; men over-conceited of themſelves, contemptuous of others; ſevere
in ſhow, Hypocrites in deed; ſtrict Sectaries, inſolent Juſticiaries? Yet here
one of them invites Chriſt; and that in good earneſt. The man was not (like
his fellows) captious, not ceremonious: had he been of their ſtamp, the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of waſhing the feet had been mortall. No profeſſion hath not yielded
ſome good: <hi>Nicodemus</hi> and <hi>Gamaliel</hi> were of the ſame ſtrain. Neither is it
for nothing, that the Evangeliſt having branded this Sect for deſpiſing the
counſell of God againſt themſelves, preſently ſubjoyns this hiſtory of <hi>Simon</hi>
the Phariſee, as an exempt man. O Saviour, thou canſt finde out good Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
good Publicans, yea a good Thief upon the Croſſe; and that thou maieſt
finde, thou canſt make them ſo.</p>
                  <p>At the beſt, yet he was a Phariſee, whoſe table thou here refuſedſt not. So
didſt thou in wiſdome and mercy attemper thy ſelf, as to <hi>become all things to
all men, that thou mighteſt win ſome.</hi> Thy harbenger was rough, as in cloaths,
ſo in diſpoſition; profeſſedly harſh and auſtere: thy ſelf wert milde and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable.
So it was fit for both. He was a preacher of Penance; thou the author
of comfort and Salvation: He made way for Grace; thou gaveſt it. Thou
haſt bidden us to follow thy ſelf, not thy fore-runner. That then which Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks
and time-ſervers doe for earthly advantages, we will doe for ſpiritual; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
frame our ſelves to all companies, not in evil, but in good, yea in indifferent
things. What wonder is it that thou, who cam'ſt down from Heaven to frame
thy ſelf to our nature, ſhouldſt, whiles thou wert on earth, frame thy ſelf to
the ſeveral diſpoſitions of men? Catch not at this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O ye licentious Hypocrites,
men of all hours, that can eat with gluttons, drink with drunkards, ſing with
ribalds, ſcoffe with profane ſcorners, and yet talk holily with the religious,
as if ye had hence any colour of your changeable conformity to all faſhions.
Our Saviour never ſinn'd for any man's ſake, though for our ſakes he was ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that he might keep us from ſinning. Can ye ſo converſe with leud good
fellows, as that ye repreſſe their ſins, redreſſe their exorbitances, win them to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
God? now ye walk in the ſteps of him that ſtuck not to ſit down in the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees
houſe.</p>
                  <p>There ſate the Saviour, and, <hi>Behold, a woman in the City that was a ſinner.</hi>
I marvell not that ſhe is led in with a note of wonder; wonder, both on her
part, and on Chriſts. That any ſinner, that a ſenſual ſinner obdured in a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
trade of evil, ſhould voluntarily, out of a true remorſe for her leudneſs,
ſeek to a Saviour, it is worthy of an accent of admiration. The noiſe of the
Goſpel is common; but where is the power of it? it hath ſtore of hearers, but
few Converts. Yet were there no wonder in her, if it were not with reference to
the power and mercy of Chriſt; his power that thus drew the ſinner; his mercy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
that received her. O Saviour, I wonder at her, but I bleſſe thee for her; by
whoſe only Grace ſhe was both moved, and accepted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A ſinner?</hi> Alas, who was not? who is not ſo? Not only <hi>in many things we ſin
all;</hi> but in all things we all let fall many ſins. Had there been a woman not a
ſinner, it had been beyond wonder. One man there was that was not a ſinner;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:44233:85"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> even he that was more then man, that God and Man, who was the refuge of
this ſinner: but never woman that ſinned not. Yet he ſaid not, a Woman that
had ſinned, but, <hi>that was a ſinner.</hi> An action doth not give denomination, but
a trade. Even the wiſe Charity of Chriſtians (much more the mercy of God)
can diſtinguiſh between ſins of infirmity, and practice of ſin; and eſteem us not
by a tranſient act, but by a permanent condition.</p>
                  <p>The woman was noted for a luxurious and incontinent life. What a deal of
variety there is of ſins? That which faileth cannot be numbred. Every ſin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
deſerves to brand the Soul with this ſtyle. Here one is pickt out from
the reſt: ſhe is not noted for Murder, for Theft, for Idolatry: only her Luſt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> makes her a woman that was a ſinner. Other Vices uſe not to give the owner
this title, although they ſhould be more hainous then it.</p>
                  <p>Wantons may flatter themſelves in the indifferency or ſlightneſs of this
offence; their Souls ſhall need no other conveiance to Hell then this: which
cannot be ſo pleaſing to Nature as it is hatefull to God, who ſo ſpeaks of it as
if there were no ſins but it, <hi>a Woman that was a ſinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She was a ſinner, now ſhe is not; her very preſence argues her change. Had
ſhe been ſtill in her old trade, ſhe would no more have indured the ſight of
Chriſt, then that Devil did which cried out, <hi>Art thou come to torment me?</hi> Her
eyes had been lamps and fires of Luſt, not fountains of tears; her hairs had
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> been nets to catch fooliſh lovers, not a towell for her Saviour's feet: yet ſtill
ſhe carries the name of what ſhe was: a ſcar ſtill remains after the wound hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
<hi>Simon</hi> will be ever the Leper, and <hi>Matthew</hi> the Publican. How carefully
ſhould we avoid thoſe actions which may ever ſtain us?</p>
                  <p>What a difference there is betwixt the carriage and proceedings of God and
men? The mercy of God, as it <hi>calleth thoſe things that are not as if they were,</hi>
ſo it calleth thoſe things that were as if they were not; <hi>I will remember your
iniquities no more.</hi> As ſome skilfull Chirurgion ſo ſets the bone, or heals the
ſore, that it cannot be ſeen where the complaint was. Man's word is, that which
is done cannot be undone: but the omnipotent goodneſs of God doth (as it
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> were) undoe our once-committed ſins. <hi>Take away my iniquity, and thou ſhalt
finde none.</hi> What we were in our ſelves, we are not to him; ſince he hath chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
us from our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>O God, why ſhould we be niggardly, where thou art liberal? why ſhould we
be reading thoſe lines which thou haſt not onely croſſed, but quite blotted,
yea wiped out?</p>
                  <p>It is a good word, <hi>ſhe was a ſinner.</hi> To be wicked is odious to God, Angels,
Saints, men; to have been ſo, is bleſſed and glorious. I rejoice to look back,
and ſee my <hi>Egyptians</hi> lying dead upon the ſhore, that I may praiſe the Author
of my deliverance and victory. Elſe, it matters not what they were, what I was.

in her time. How much better is it to be obſcure, then infamous? Herein, I
doubt not, God meant to ſpare the reputation of a penitent Convert. He who
hates not the perſon, but the ſin, cares only to mention the ſin, not the perſon.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> It is juſtice to proſecute the Vice, it is mercy to ſpare the Offender. How inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

No men ſtood ſo much upon the terms of their own Righteouſneſs; no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>

neighbour was a ſinner? How doth he (though a better Phariſee) look awrie
to ſee ſuch a piece in his houſe, whiles he dares think, <hi>If this man were a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
he would ſurely know what manner of woman this is?</hi> Neither could ſhe
fore-imagine leſſe, when ſhe ventured to preſſe over the threſhold of a Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee.
Yet not the known auſterity of the man, and her miſ-welcome to the place,
could affright her from ſeeking her Saviour even there. No diſadvantage can
defer the Penitent Soul from a ſpeedy recourſe to Chriſt. She ſaies not, <q>If <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                        <hi>Jeſus</hi> were in the ſtreet, or in the field, or in the houſe of ſome humble Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican,
or any where ſave with a Phariſee, I would come to him; now I will
rather defer my acceſſe, then ſeek him where I ſhall finde ſcorn and cenſure:</q>
but, as not fearing the frowns of that overlie Hoſt, ſhe thruſts her ſelf into <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s
houſe to finde <hi>Jeſus.</hi> It is not for the diſtreſſed to be baſhfull; it is not
for a believer to be timorous. O Saviour, if thy Spouſe miſſe thee, ſhe will
ſeek thee through the ſtreets; the blows of the watch ſhall not daunt her. If
thou be on the other ſide of the water, a <hi>Peter</hi> will leap into the Sea, and ſwim
to thee: if on the other ſide of the fire, thy bleſſed Martyrs will run through
thoſe flames to thee. We are not worthy of the comfort of thy preſence, if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
whereſoever we know thou art, whether in priſon, or in exile, or at the ſtake,
we do not haſten thither to injoy thee.</p>
                  <p>The Place was not more unfit then the Time: a Phariſees houſe was not
more unproper for a ſinner, then a Feaſt was for humiliation. Tears at a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
are as Jigs at a Funeral. There is a ſeaſon for all things. Muſick had been
more apt for a Feaſt then mourning.</p>
                  <p>The heart that hath once felt the ſting of ſin and the ſweetneſs of remiſſion,
hath no power to delay the expreſſions of what it feels, and cannot be confined
to terms of circumſtance.</p>
                  <p>Whence then was this zeal of her acceſſe? Doubtleſſe ſhe had heard from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
the mouth of Chriſt, in thoſe heavenly Sermons of his, many gracious invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of all troubled and labouring ſouls; ſhe had obſerved how he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
to come under the roofs of deſpiſed Publicans, of profeſſed enemies;
ſhe had noted all the paſſages of his power and mercy; and now deep remorſe
wrought upon her heart for her former viciouſneſs. The pool of her Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
was troubled by the deſcending Angel, and now ſhe ſteps in for a cure.
The arrow ſtuck faſt in her Soul, which ſhe could not ſhake out; and now ſhe
comes to this ſoveraign Dittanie, to expell it. Had not the Spirit of God
wrought upon her ere ſhe came, and wrought her to come, ſhe had never ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſought or found Chriſt. Now ſhe comes in, and findes that Saviour whom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
ſhe ſought: ſhe comes in, but not empty-handed: though debauched, ſhe was a
Jeweſſe. She could not but have heard that ſhe ought <hi>not</hi> to <hi>appear before the
Lord empty.</hi> What then brings ſhe? It was not poſſible ſhe could bring to Chriſt
a better preſent then her own Penitent Soul; yet, to teſtifie that, ſhe brings
another, delicate both for the veſſel and the contents, <hi>A box of Alabaſter;</hi> a
ſolid, hard, pure, clear marble, fit for the receit of ſo precious an ointment:
the ointment pleaſant and coſtly; a compoſition of many fragrant Odors, not
for medicine but delight.</p>
                  <p>The Soul that is truly touched with the ſenſe of its own ſin, can think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
too good, too dear for Chriſt. The remorſed ſinner begins firſt with the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
tender of <hi>burnt-offerings, and calves of a year old;</hi> thence he aſcends to Heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombs,
<hi>thouſands of rams;</hi> and above that yet, to <hi>ten thouſand rivers of oyle;</hi>
and, yet higher, could be content to <hi>give the firſt-fruit of his body</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate
<hi>the ſin of his Soul.</hi> Any thing, every thing is too ſmall a price for peace.
O Saviour, ſince we have taſted how ſweet thou art, lo, we bring thee the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:44233:86"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> daintieſt and coſtlieſt perfumes of our humble Obediences: yea, if ſo much of
our blood, as this woman brought ointment, may be uſefull or pleaſing to thy
Name, we do moſt chearfully conſecrate it unto thee. If we would not have
thee think Heaven too good for us, why ſhould we ſtick at any earthly retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
to thee in lieu of thy great mercies?</p>
                  <p>Yet here I ſee more then the price. This odoriferous perſume was that
wherewith ſhe had wont to make her ſelf pleaſing to her wanton Lovers; and
now ſhe comes purpoſely to offer it up to her Saviour.</p>
                  <p>As her love was turned another way from ſenſual to Divine, ſo ſhall her
Ointment alſo be altered in the uſe: that which was abuſed to Luxury, ſhall
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> now be conſecrated to Devotion. There is no other effect in whatſoever true
Converſion; <hi>As we have given our members ſervants to iniquity to commit
iniquity, ſo ſhall we now give our members ſervants unto righteouſneſſe in holineſſe.</hi>
If the dames of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that thought nothing more worth looking on then their
own faces, have ſpent too much time in their glaſſes; now they ſhall caſt in
thoſe metalls to make a Laver for the waſhing off their uncleanneſſes. If I have
ſpent the prime of my ſtrength, the ſtrength of my wit, upon my ſelf and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
I have beſtowed my Alabaſter-box amiſſe: Oh now teach me, my God
and Saviour, to improve all my time, all my abilities to thy glory. This is all
the poor recompence can be made thee for thoſe ſhamefull diſhonors thou haſt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> received from me.</p>
                  <p>The Woman is come in; and now ſhe doth not boldly face Chriſt, but, as
unworthy of his preſence, ſhe <hi>ſtands behinde.</hi> How could ſhe in that ſite waſh his
feet with her tears? Was it that our Saviour did not ſit at the Feaſt (after our
faſhion) but, according to the then-Jewiſh and <hi>Roman</hi> faſhion, lay on the one
ſide? Or was it that this phraſe doth not ſo much import poſture as preſence?
Doubtleſſe, it was baſhfulneſſe and ſhame ariſing from the conſcience of her
own former wickedneſs that placed her thus. How well is the caſe altered?
She had wont to look boldly in the face of her Lovers: now ſhe dares not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the awfull countenance of her Saviour. She had wont to ſend her alluring
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> beams forth into the eyes of her wanton paramours: now ſhe caſts her dejected
eyes to the earth, and dares not ſo much as raiſe them up to ſee thoſe eyes from
which ſhe deſired commiſeration. It was a true inference of the Prophet, <hi>Thou
haſt an whores forehead, thou canſt not bluſh:</hi> there cannot be a greater ſign of
whoriſhneſs then impudence. This woman can now bluſh; ſhe hath put off
the Harlot, and is turned true Penitent. Baſhfulneſs is both a ſign, and effect of
Grace. O God, could we but bethink how wretched we are in Nature, how vile
through our ſins, how glorious, holy and powerfull a God thou art, (before
whom the brighteſt Angels hide their faces) we could not come but with a
trembling awfulneſs into thy preſence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Together with ſhame, here is ſorrow: a ſorrow teſtified by tears; and tears
in ſuch abundance, that ſhe waſhes the feet of our Saviour with thoſe ſtreams of
penitence; <hi>She began to waſh his feet with tears.</hi> We hear when ſhe began, we
hear not when ſhe ended. When the grapes are preſſed, the juice runs forth:
ſo when the minde is preſſed, tears diſtill; the true juice of penitence and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
Theſe eyes were not uſed to ſuch clouds, or to ſuch ſhowrs; there was
nothing in them formerly but ſun-ſhine of pleaſure, beams of Luſt: Now they
are reſolved into the drops of grief and contrition. Whence was this change,
but from the ſecret working of God's Spirit? <hi>He cauſed his winde to blow, and
the waters flowed; he ſmote the rock, and the waters guſhed out.</hi> O God, ſmite
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> thou this rocky Heart of mine, and the waters of Repentance ſhall burſt forth
in abundance.</p>
                  <p>Never were thy feet, O Saviour, bedewed with more precious liquor then
this of remorſefull tears. Theſe cannot be ſo ſpent, but that thou keepeſt
them in thy bottle; yea thou returneſt them back with intereſt of true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:
<hi>They that ſow in tears, ſhall reap in joy. Bleſſed are they that mourn.</hi> Lo
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:44233:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this wet ſeed-time ſhall be followed with an harveſt of happineſſe and glory.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this ſervice might be complete, as her eyes were the Ewre, ſo her
hair was the Towell for the feet of Chriſt. Doubtleſſe at a Feaſt there was no
want of the moſt curious linen for this purpoſe. All this was nothing to her:
to approve her ſincere Humility, and hearty devotion to Chriſt, her hair ſhall
be put to this glorious office. The hair is the chief ornament of womanhood:
the feet, as they are the loweſt part of the body, ſo the meaneſt for account,
and homelieſt for imployment: and lo, this Penitent beſtows the chief orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her head, on the meaneſt office to the feet of her Saviour. That hair
which ſhe was wont to ſpred as a net to catch her amorous companions, is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
with the imployment of wiping the beautifull feet of him that brought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
the glad tidings of peace and ſalvation: and, might it have been any ſervice to
him to have licked the duſt under thoſe feet of his, how gladly would ſhe have
done it? Nothing can be mean that is done to the honour of a Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Never was any hair ſo preferred as this. How I envy thoſe locks that were
graced with the touch of thoſe Sacred feet; but much more thoſe lips that
kiſſed them? Thoſe lips that had been formerly inured to the wanton tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of her laſcivious Lovers, now ſanctifie themſelves with the teſtimony of
her humble homage and dear reſpects to the Son of God. Thus her oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
hands, eyes, hair, lips are now conſecrated to the ſervice of Chriſt her
Saviour, whom ſhe had offended. If our ſatisfaction be not in ſome kinde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
to our offence, we are no true Penitents.</p>
                  <p>All this while I hear not one word fall from the mouth of this woman.
What need her tongue ſpeak, when her eyes ſpake, her hands ſpake, her ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
her countenance, her whole carriage was vocall? I like this ſilent ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
well, when our actions talk, and our tongues hold their peace. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
practice is contrary; Mens tongues are buſie, but their hands are ſtill.
All their Religion lies in their tongue; their hands either doe nothing, or ill:
ſo as their profeſſion is but winde, as their words. Wherefore are words but
for expreſſion of the minde? If that could be known by the eye or by the
hand, the language of both were alike. There are no words amongſt ſpirits; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
yet they perfectly underſtand each other. <hi>The Heavens declare the glory of
God.</hi> All tongues cannot ſpeak ſo loud as they that have none. Give me the
Chriſtian that is ſeen, and not heard. The noiſe that our tongue makes in a
formality of profeſſion, ſhall (in the ſilence of our hands) condemn us for Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites.</p>
                  <p>The Phariſee ſaw all this, but with an evil eye. Had he not had ſome Grace,
he had never invited ſuch a gueſt as <hi>Jeſus;</hi> and if he had had Grace enough, he
had never entertained ſuch a thought as this of the gueſt he invited: <hi>If this
man were a Prophet, he would have known what manner of woman it is that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
him; for ſhe is a ſinner.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>How many errors in one breath? Juſtly (O <hi>Simon</hi>) hath this one thought
loſt thee the thank of thy Feaſt. Belike, at the higheſt, thou judgedſt thy gueſt
but a Prophet; and now thou doubteſt whether he were ſo much. Beſides this
undervaluation, how unjuſt is the ground of this doubt? Every Prophet knew
not every thing; yea no Prophet ever knew all things. <hi>Eliſha</hi> knew the very
ſecrets of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> privy-chamber: yet he knew not the calamity of his
worthy Hoſteſſe. The finite knowledge of the ableſt Seer reaches but ſo far
as it will pleaſe God to extend it. Well might he therefore have been a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and in the knowledge of greater matters not have known this.</p>
                  <p>Unto this, how weakly didſt thou, becauſe of Chriſt's ſilent admiſſion of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
woman, ſuppoſe him ignorant of her quality? As if knowledge ſhould be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
alwaies by the noiſe of expreſſion. Stay but a while, and thou ſhalt finde
that he well knew both her life and thy heart. Beſides, how injuriouſly doſt
thou take this woman for what ſhe was? not conceiving (as well thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt)
were not this woman a Convert, ſhe would never have offered her ſelf
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:44233:87"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> into this preſence. Her modeſty and her tears bewray her change: and if ſhe
be changed, why is the cenſured for what ſhe is not?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, how ſtrong did it ſavour of the leven of thy profeſſion, that thou
ſuppoſeſt (were ſhe what ſhe was) that it could not ſtand with the knowledge
and holineſſe of a Prophet to admit of her leaſt touch, yea of her preſence?
Whereas on the one ſide, outward converſation in it ſelf makes no man unclean
or holy, but according to the diſpoſition of the patient; on the other, ſuch
was the purity and perfection of this thy glorious gueſt, that it was not poſſibly
infectible, nor any way obnoxious to the danger of others ſin. He that ſaid
once, <hi>Who touched me?</hi> in regard of virtue iſſuing from him, never ſaid,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Whom have I touched? in regard of any contagion incident to him. We ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
creatures, in whom the Prince of this world findes too much, may eaſily be
tainted with other mens ſins. He, who came to take away the ſins of the world,
was uncapable of pollution by ſin. Had the woman then been ſtill a ſinner, thy
cenſure of Chriſt was proud and unjuſt.</p>
                  <p>The Phariſee ſpake; but it was within himſelf: and now, behold, <hi>Jeſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, ſaid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What we think, we ſpeak to our hearts, and we ſpeak to God; and he
equally hears, as if it came out of our mouths. Thoughts are not free. Could
men know and convince them, they would be no leſſe liable to cenſure then if
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> they came forth clothed with words. God, who hears them, judges of them
accordingly. So here, the heart of <hi>Simon</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Jeſus anſwers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeſus</hi> anſwers him, but with a Parable. He anſwers many a thought with
Judgment; the blaſphemy of the heart, the murder of the heart, the adultery
of the heart are anſwered by him with reall vengeance. For <hi>Simon,</hi> our Saviour
ſaw his errour was either out of ſimple ignorance or weak miſtaking: where he
ſaw no malice then, it is enough to anſwer with a gentle conviction. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victive
anſwer of Chriſt is by way of Parable. The wiſdome of God knows
how to circumvent us for our gain; and can ſpeak that pleaſingly by a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
circumlocution, which right-down would not be digeſted. Had our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſaid in plain terms, <hi>Simon,</hi> whether doſt thou or this ſinner love me
more? the Phariſee could not for ſhame but have ſtood upon his reputation,
and in a ſcorn of the compariſon have proteſted his exceeding reſpects to
Chriſt. Now, ere he is aware, he is fetcht in to give ſentence againſt himſelf
for her whom he condemned. O Saviour, thou haſt made us fiſhers of men;
how ſhould we learn of thee, ſo to bait our hooks, that they may be moſt likely
to take? Thou the great houſholder of thy Church haſt provided victuals
for thy family, thou haſt appointed us to dreſſe them: if we do not ſo cook
them as that they may fit the palats to which they are intended, we do both
loſe our labour and thy coſt. The Parable is of two Debtors to one Creditor;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the one owed a leſſer ſum, the other a greater; both are forgiven. It was not
the purpoſe of him that propounded it, that we ſhould ſtick in the bark. God
is our Creditor, our ſins our Debts; we are all Debtors, but one more deep
then another. No man can pay this Debt alone; ſatisfaction is not poſſible:
only remiſſion can diſcharge us. God doth in mercy forgive as well the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
as the leaſt ſins. Our love to God is proportionable to the ſenſe of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.
So then the Phariſee cannot chuſe but confeſſe, that the more and
greater the ſin is, the greater mercy in the forgiveneſſe; and the more mercy
in the forgiver, the greater obligation and more love in the forgiven.</p>
                  <p>Truth, from whoſe mouth ſoever it falls, is worth taking up. Our Saviour
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> praiſes the true judgment of a Phariſee. It is an injurious indiſcretion in thoſe
who are ſo prejudiced againſt the perſons, that they reject the truth. He that
would not quench the ſmoaking flax, incourages even the leaſt good. As
the carefull Chirurgion ſtrokes the arme ere he ſtrikes the vein; ſo did Chriſt
here, ere he convinces the Phariſee of his want of love, he graceth him
with a fair approbation of his judgment. Yet the while turning both his
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:44233:88"/>
face and his ſpeech to the poor Penitent; as one that cared more for a true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
for ſin, then for a falſe pretence of reſpect and innocence.</p>
                  <p>With what a dejected and abaſhed countenance, with what earth-fixed eyes,
do we imagine the poor woman ſtood, when ſhe ſaw her Saviour direct his face
and words to her?</p>
                  <p>She that durſt but ſtand behinde him, and ſteal the falling of ſome teares
upon his feet, with what a bluſhing aſtoniſhment doth ſhe behold his ſidere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
countenance caſt upon her? Whiles his eye was turned towards this Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
his ſpeech was turned to the Phariſee concerning that Penitent, by him
miſtaken: <hi>Seeſt thou this Woman?</hi> He who before had ſaid, <hi>If this man were a
Prophet, he would have known what manner of Woman this is;</hi> now heares, <hi>Seeſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
thou this Woman? Simon</hi> ſaw but her outſide: <hi>Jeſus</hi> lets him ſee that he ſaw her
heart; and will thus convince the Phariſee that he is more then a Prophet, who
knew not her converſation only, but her Soul. The Phariſee that went all by
appearance, ſhall by her deportment ſee the proof of her good diſpoſition: it
ſhall happily ſhame him to hear the compariſon of the wants of his own enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
with the abundance of hers.</p>
                  <p>It is ſtrange that any of this formall Sect ſhould be defective in their Lotions.
<hi>Simon</hi> had not given water to ſo great a gueſt; ſhe waſhes his feet with her
teares. By how much the water of the eye was more precious then the water
of the earth, ſo much was the reſpect and courteſie of this Penitent above the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
neglected office of the Phariſee. What uſe was there of a Towell, where was no
water? She that made a fountain of her eyes, made precious napary of her
hair: that better flax ſhamed the linen in the Phariſees cheſt.</p>
                  <p>A kiſſe of the cheek had wont to be pledge of the welcome of their gueſts.
<hi>Simon</hi> neglects to make himſelf thus happy: ſhe redoubles the kiſſes of her
humble thankfulneſſe upon the bleſſed feet of her Saviour. The Phariſee omits
ordinary oyle for the head: ſhe ſupplies the moſt precious and fragrant oyle
to his feet.</p>
                  <p>Now the Phariſee reades his own taxation in her praiſe; and begins to
envy where he had ſcorned.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is our fault, O Saviour, if we miſtake thee. We are ready to think, ſo
thou have the ſubſtance of good uſage, thou regardeſt not the complements
and ceremonies; whereas now we ſee thee to have both meat and welcome
in the Phariſees houſe, and yet hear thee glance at his neglect of waſhing, kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
anointing. Doubtleſſe, omiſſion of due circumſtances in thy entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may deſerve to loſe our thanks. Do we pray to thee? do we hear thee
preach to us? now we make thee good chear in our houſe: but if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
not theſe things with the fit decency of our outward carriages, we give
thee not thy water, thy kiſſes, thy oyle. Even meet rituall obſervances are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for thy full welcome.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet how little had theſe things been regarded, if they had not argued the
womans thankfull love to thee, and the ground of that love, ſenſe of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
and the Phariſees default in both?</p>
                  <p>Love and action do neceſſarily evince each other. True love cannot lurk
long unexpreſſed: it will be looking out at the eyes, creeping out of the
mouth, breaking out at the fingers ends, in ſome actions of dearneſſe; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
thoſe wherein there is pain and difficulty to the agent, profit or pleaſure
to the affected. O Lord, in vain ſhall we profeſſe to love thee, if we doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for thee. Since our goodneſſe cannot reach up unto thee, who art our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
head; O let us beſtow upon thy feet (thy poor Members here below)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
our teares, our hands, our oyntment, and whatever our gifts or endevours may
teſtifie our thankfulneſſe and love to thee in them.</p>
                  <p>O happy word! <hi>Her ſins, which are many, are forgiven her.</hi> Methinks I ſee
how this poor Penitent revived with this breath; how new life comes into
her eyes, new blood into her cheeks, new ſpirits into her countenance:
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:44233:88"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> like unto our Mother Earth; when in that firſt confuſion, <hi>God ſaid, Let the
earth bring forthgraſſe, the herb that beareth ſeed, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit;</hi>
all runs out into flowers, and bloſſomes, and leaves, and fruit. Her former
teares ſaid, <hi>Who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> Now her chearfull
ſmiles ſay, <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt my Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seldomeever do we meet with ſo perfect a Penitent; ſeldome do we finde
ſo gracious a diſmiſſion. What can be wiſhed of any mortall creature but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
Safety, Faith, Peace? All theſe are here met to make a contrite Soul
happy. Remiſſion, the ground of her Safety; Faith, the ground of her Peace;

<hi>The foxes have holes, and the birds have neſts:</hi> he that had all,
poſſeſſed nothing. One while I ſee him in a publican's houſe,
then in a Phariſee's; now I finde him at <hi>Martha</hi>'s. His laſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
was with ſome neglect, this with too much ſolicitude. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
was now in his way; the Sun might as ſoon ſtand ſtil as he.</p>
                  <p>The more we move, the liker we are to Heaven, and to this God that made
it. His progreſſe was to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> for ſome holy Feaſt. He whoſe Devotion
neglected not any of thoſe ſacred Solemnities, will not neglect the due oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of his bodily refreſhing: as not thinking it meet to travell and preach
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> harbourleſſe, he diverts (where he knew his welcome) to the village of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanie.</hi>
There dwelt the two devout Siſters, with their Brother his Friend <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus;</hi>
their roof receives him. O happy houſe into which the Son of God
vouchſafed to ſet his foot! O bleſſed women, that had the grace to be the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſſes
to the God of Heaven! How ſhould I envy your felicity herein, if I
did not ſee the ſame favour (if I be not wanting to my ſelf) lying open to
me? I have two waies to entertain my Saviour, in his Members, and in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
In his Members, by Charity and Hoſpitableneſſe; <hi>what I doe to one of
thoſe his little ones, I doe to him:</hi> In himſelf, by Faith; <hi>If any man open, he will
come in and ſup with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> O Saviour, thou ſtandſt at the door of our hearts, and knockſt by the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations
of thy Meſſengers, by the ſenſe of thy Chaſtiſements, by the motions
of thy Spirit: if we open to thee by a willing admiſſion and faithfull welcome,
thou wilt be ſure to take up our Souls with thy gracious preſence; and not to
ſit with us for a momentany meal, but to dwell with us for ever. Lo, thou
didſt but call in at <hi>Bethany;</hi> but here ſhall be thy reſt for everlaſting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Martha</hi> (it ſeems) as being the elder Siſter, bore the name of the Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper;
<hi>Mary</hi> was her aſſiſtant in the charge. A Bleſſed pair; Siſters not
more in Nature then Grace, in Spirit no leſſe then in fleſh. How happy a thing
is it when all the parties in a family are joyntly agreed to entertain Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> No ſooner is <hi>Jeſus</hi> entred into the houſe then he falls to preaching: that no
time may be loſt, he ſtaies not ſo much as till his meat be made ready; but
whiles his bodily repaſt was in hand, provides ſpiritual food for his Hoſts. It
was his <hi>meat and drink to doe the will of</hi> his <hi>Father:</hi> he fed more upon his own
diet then he could poſſibly upon theirs; his beſt chear was to ſee them ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
fed. How ſhould we, whom he hath called to this ſacred Function, <hi>be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:44233:89"/>
in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon?</hi> We are, by his ſacred ordination, the Lights <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
of the world. No ſooner is the candle lighted, then it gives that light which it
hath, and never intermits till it be waſted to the ſnuff.</p>
                  <p>Both the Siſters for a time ſate attentively liſtening to the words of Chriſt.
Houſhold occaſions call <hi>Martha</hi> away: <hi>Mary</hi> ſits ſtill at his feet, and hears.
Whether ſhall we more praiſe her Humility, or her Docility? I do not ſee her
take a ſtool and ſit by him, or a chair and ſit above him; but, as deſiring to
ſhew her heart was as low as her knees, ſhe ſits at his feet. She was lowly ſet,
richly warmed with thoſe Heavenly beams. The greater ſubmiſſion, the more
Grace. If there be one hollow in the valley lower then another, thither the
waters gather.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Martha</hi>'s houſe is become a Divinity-ſchool: <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as the Doctor, ſits in
the chair; <hi>Martha, Mary,</hi> and the reſt, ſit as Diſciples at his feet. Standing
implies a readineſſe of motion; Sitting, a ſetled compoſedneſſe to this holy
attendance.</p>
                  <p>Had theſe two Siſters provided our Saviour never ſuch delicates, and waited
on his trencher never ſo officiouſly, yet had they not liſtened to his inſtruction,
they had not bidden him welcome; neither had he ſo well liked his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</p>
                  <p>This was the way to feaſt him; to feed their ears by his Heavenly Doctrine:
his beſt chear is our proficiency; our beſt chear is his Word. O Saviour,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
let my Soul be thus feaſted by thee, do thou thus feaſt thy ſelf by feeding me;
this mutual diet ſhall be thy praiſe and my happineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Martha</hi> was for the time an attentive hearer, yet now her care of
Chriſt's entertainment carries her into the Kitchin; <hi>Mary</hi> ſits ſtill. Neither
was <hi>Mary</hi> more devout then <hi>Martha</hi> buſie: <hi>Martha</hi> cares to feaſt <hi>Jeſus, Mary,</hi>
to be feaſted of him. There was more ſolicitude in <hi>Martha</hi>'s active part; more
piety in <hi>Mary</hi>'s ſedentary attendance: I know not in whether more zeal. Good
<hi>Martha</hi> was deſirous to expreſſe her joy and thankfulneſſe for the preſence of
ſo bleſſed a Gueſt, by the actions of her carefull and plenteous entertainment.
I know not how to cenſure the Holy woman for her exceſſe of care to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
her Saviour. Sure ſhe her ſelf thought ſhe did well; and out of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
fears not to complain to Chriſt of her Siſter.</p>
                  <p>I do not ſee her come to her Siſter, and whiſper in her eare the gread need
of her aide; but ſhe comes to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and in a kinde of unkinde expoſtulation of
her neglect, makes her moan to him, <hi>Lord, doſt thou not care that my ſiſter hath
left me to ſerve alone?</hi> Why did ſhe not rather make her firſt addreſſe to her
Siſter? Was it for that ſhe knew <hi>Mary</hi> was ſo tied by the ears with thoſe ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantine
chains that came from the mouth of Chriſt, that untill his ſilence
and diſmiſſion ſhe had no power to ſtir? Or was it out of an honour and reſpect
to Chriſt, that in his preſence ſhe would not preſume to call off her Siſter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
his leave.</p>
                  <p>Howſoever, I cannot excuſe the holy Woman from ſome weakneſſes. It
was a fault to meaſure her Siſter by her ſelf, and apprehending her own act to
be good, to think her Siſter could not doe well if ſhe did not ſo too. Whereas
Goodneſſe hath much latitude. Ill is oppoſed to Good, not Good to Good.
Neither in things lawfull or indifferent are others bound to our examples. <hi>Mary</hi>
might hear, <hi>Martha</hi> might ſerve, and both doe well. <hi>Mary</hi> did not cenſure
<hi>Martha</hi> for her riſing from the feet of Chriſt, to prepare his meal: neither
ſhould <hi>Martha</hi> have cenſured <hi>Mary</hi> for ſitting at Chriſts feet, to feed her
Soul. It was a fault, that ſhe thought an exceſſive care of a liberal outward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
of Chriſt was to be preferred to a diligent attention to Chriſt
ſpirituall entertainment of them. It was a fault, that ſhe durſt preſume to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
our Saviour of ſome kinde of unreſpect to her toile, <hi>Lord, doſt thou not
care?</hi> What ſaieſt thou, <hi>Martha?</hi> doſt thou challenge the Lord of Heaven and
earth of incogitancy and neglect? Doſt thou take upon thee to preſcribe unto
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:44233:89"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that infinite Wiſdome, in ſtead of receiving directions from him? It is well
thou metteſt with a Saviour, whoſe gracious mildneſſe knows how to pardon
and pity the errours of our zeal.</p>
                  <p>Yet I muſt needs ſay here wanted not fair pretences for the ground of this
thy expoſtulation. Thou, the elder Siſter, workeſt; <hi>Mary,</hi> the yonger, ſits
ſtill. And what work was thine but the hoſpital receit of thy Saviour and
his train? Had it been for thine own paunch, or for ſome carnal friends,
it had been leſſe excuſable; now it was for Chriſt himſelf, to whom thou
couldſt never be too obſequious.</p>
                  <p>But all this cannot deliver thee from the juſt blame of this bold ſubincuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                     <hi>Lord, doſt thou not care?</hi> How ready is our weakneſſe upon every ſlight
diſcontentment to quarrell with our beſt friend, yea with our good God; and
the more we are put to it, to think our ſelves the more neglected, and to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
God for our neglect? Do we groan on the bed of our ſickneſſe, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
in pain complain of long hours and weary ſides? ſtraight we think,
Lord, doſt thou not care that we ſuffer? Doth God's poor Church goe to
wrack, whiles <hi>the ploughers ploughing on</hi> her <hi>back, make long furrows?</hi> Lord,
doſt thou not care? But know thou, O thou feeble and diſtruſtfull Soul, the
more thou doeſt, the more thou ſuffereſt, the more thou art cared for: neither
is God ever ſo tender over his Church as when it is moſt exerciſed. Every
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> pang and ſtitch and gird is firſt felt of him that ſends it. O God, thou knoweſt
our works, and our labour, and our patience: we may be ignorant and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
thou canſt not but be gracious.</p>
                  <p>It could not but trouble devout <hi>Mary</hi> to hear her Siſters impatient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint;
a complaint of her ſelf to Chriſt, with ſuch vehemence of paſſion, as if
there had been ſuch ſtrangeneſſe betwixt the two Siſters, that the one would
doe nothing for the other without an external compulſion from a Superior.
How can ſhe chuſe but think, <q>If I have offended, why was I not ſecretly taxed
for it in a ſiſterly familiarity? What if there have been ſome little omiſſion?
muſt the whole houſe ring of it before my Lord and all his Diſciples?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Is this carriage beſeeming a Siſter? Is my Devotion worthy of a quarrell?
Lord, doſt thou not care that I am injuriouſly cenſured?</q> Yet I hear not a
word of reply from that modeſt mouth. O holy <hi>Mary,</hi> I admire thy patient ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:
thy Siſter blames thee for thy Piety; the Diſciples (afterwards) blame
thee for thy Bounty and coſt: not a word falls from thee in a juſt vindication
of thine honour and innocence, but in an humble taciturnity thou leaveſt thine
anſwer to thy Saviour.</p>
                  <p>How ſhould we learn of thee, when we are complained of for well-doing to
ſeal up our lips, and to expect our righting from above?</p>
                  <p>And how ſure, how ready art thou, O Saviour, to ſpeak in the cauſe of the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> dumb? <hi>Martha, Martha, thou art carefull and troubled about many things; but
one thing is needfull, and Mary hath choſen the better part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What needed <hi>Mary</hi> to ſpeak for her ſelf, when ſhe had ſuch an Advocate?
Doubtleſſe <hi>Martha</hi> was, as it were, divided from her ſelf with the multiplicity
of her carefull thoughts: our Saviour therefore doubles her name in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation;
that in ſuch diſtraction he may both finde and fix her heart. The
good woman made full account that Chriſt would have ſent away her Siſter
with a check, and her ſelf with thanks: but now her hopes fail her; and though
ſhe be not directly reproved, yet ſhe hears her Siſter more approved then ſhe;
<hi>Martha, Martha, thou art carefull and troubled about many things.</hi> Our Saviour
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> received courteſie from her in her diligent and coſtly entertainment; yet he
would not blanch her errour, and ſmooth her up in her weak miſpriſion. No
obligations may ſo enthrall us, as that our tongues ſhould not be free to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
faults where we finde them. They are baſe and ſervile ſpirits that will
have their tongue tied to their teeth.</p>
                  <p>This glance towards a reproof implies an oppoſition of the condition of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:44233:90"/>
the two Siſters. Themſelves were not more near in Nature, then their preſent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
humour and eſtate differed. <hi>One</hi> is oppoſed to many, <hi>neceſſary</hi> to ſuperfluous,
<hi>ſolicitude</hi> to quietneſſe: <hi>Thou art carefull and troubled about many things, one
thing is neceſſary.</hi> How far then may our care reach to theſe earthly things?
On the one ſide, O Saviour, thou haſt charged us to <hi>take no thought what to eat,
drink, put on;</hi> on the other, thy choſen Veſſel hath told us, that <hi>he that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
not for his family hath denied the faith, and is worſe then an Infidel.</hi> We may,
we muſt care for many things; ſo that our care be for good, and well. For
good, both in kinde and meaſure; well, ſo as our care be free from diſtraction,
from diſtruſt. From diſtraction, that it hinder us not from the neceſſary duties
of our general Calling; from diſtruſt, that we miſdoubt not Gods providence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
whiles we imploy our own. We cannot care for thee, unleſſe we thus care for
our ſelves, for ours.</p>
                  <p>Alas! how much care do I ſee every where, but how few <hi>Martha's?</hi> Her
care was for her Saviours entertainment, ours for our ſelves. One findes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities
in his Eſtate, which he deſires to extricate; another beats his brains
for the raiſing of his Houſe: One buſies his thoughts about the doubtfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
(as he thinks) of the Times, and caſts in his anxious head the imaginary
events of all things, oppoſing his hopes to his fears; another ſtudies how to
avoid the croſs blows of an Adverſary. <hi>Martha, Martha, thou art carefull and
troubled about many things.</hi> Fooliſh men! why do we ſet our hearts upon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
rack, and need not? why will we indure to bend under that burden, which more
able ſhoulders have offered to undertake for our eaſe?</p>
                  <p>Thou haſt bidden us, O God, to caſt our cares upon thee, with promiſe to
care for us. We do gladly unload our ſelves upon thee: O let our care be to
depend on thee, as thine is to provide for us.</p>
                  <p>Whether <hi>Martha</hi> be pitied or taxed for her ſedulity, I am ſure <hi>Mary</hi> is prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
for her devotion: <hi>One thing is neceſſary.</hi> Not by way of negation, as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
were neceſſary but this: but by way of compariſon, as that nothing is ſo
neceſſary as this. Earthly occaſions muſt vaile to ſpiritual. Of thoſe three
main grounds of all our actions, Neceſſity, Convenience, Pleaſure, each tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
other: Convenience carries it away from Pleaſure, Neceſſity from
Convenience, and one degree of Neceſſity from another. The degrees are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the conditions of the things neceſſary. The condition of theſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neceſſaries is, that without them we cannot live temporally; the condition
of the ſpiritual, that without them we cannot live eternally. So much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
then as there is betwixt temporary and eternal, ſo much there muſt needs
be betwixt the neceſſity of theſe bodily actions and thoſe ſpiritual: Both are
neceſſary in their kindes; neither muſt here be an oppoſition, but a ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The body and Soul muſt be friends, not rivals: we may not ſo ply the
Chriſtian, that we neglect the man.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh the vanity of thoſe men who neglecting that one thing neceſſary, affect
many things ſuperfluous! Nothing is needleſſe with worldly mindes but this
one which is onely neceſſary, the care of their Souls. How juſtly do they loſe
that they cared not for, whiles they over-care for that which is neither worthy
nor poſſible to be kept?</p>
                  <p>Neither is <hi>Marie</hi>'s buſineſſe more allowed then her ſelf: <hi>She hath choſen
the good part.</hi> It was not forced upon her, but taken up by her election. <hi>Martha</hi>
might have ſate ſtill as well as ſhe: She might have ſtir'd about as well as
<hi>Martha. Marie</hi>'s will made this choice, not without the inclination of him
who both gave this will and commends it. That will was before renewed; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
no marvell if it choſe the good: though this were not in a caſe of good and
evil, but of good and better. We have ſtill this holy freedome, through the
inoperation of him that hath freed us. Happy are we if we can improve this
liberty to the beſt advantage of our Souls.</p>
                  <p>The ſtability or perpetuity of good addes much to the praiſe of it. <hi>Martha</hi>'s
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:44233:90"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> part was ſoon gone; the thank and uſe of a little outward Hoſpitality cannot
long laſt: but <hi>Mary</hi>'s <hi>ſhall not be taken away from her.</hi> The act of her hearing
was tranſient, the fruit permanent; ſhe now hears that which ſhall ſtick by her
for ever.</p>
                  <p>What couldſt thou hear, O Holy <hi>Mary,</hi> from thoſe Sacred lips, which we
hear not ſtill? That Heavenly Doctrine is never but the ſame, not more ſubject
to change then the Author of it. It is not impoſſible that the exerciſe of the
Goſpel ſhould be taken from us; but the benefit and virtue of it is as inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
from our Souls as their Being. In the hardeſt times that ſhall ſtick clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt

                  <p>THE man was <hi>born blinde.</hi> This Cure requires not Art, but Power; a

though formleſſe; Art looks for matter formed to our hands:
God ſtands not upon either. Where there was not an Eye to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
what could an Oculiſt doe? It is only a God that can create. Such are we,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> O God, to all ſpiritual things: we want not ſight, but eyes: it muſt be thou
only that canſt make us capable of illumination.</p>
                  <p>The blinde man <hi>ſate begging.</hi> Thoſe that have eyes and hands and feet of
their own may be able to help themſelves; thoſe that want theſe helps muſt
be beholden to the eyes, hands, feet of others. The impotent are caſt upon our
mercy: Happy are we, if we can lend lims and ſenſes to the needy. Affected
beggery is odious: that which is of God's making juſtly challengeth relief.</p>
                  <p>Where ſhould this blinde man ſit begging, but near the Temple? At one
gate ſits a cripple, a blinde man at another. Well might theſe miſerable ſouls
ſuppoſe that Piety and Charity dwelt cloſe together: the two Tables were
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> both of one quarry. Then are we beſt diſpoſed to mercy towards our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
when we have either craved or acknowledged God's mercy towards our
ſelves. If we goe thither to beg of God; how can we deny mites, when we hope
for talents?</p>
                  <p>Never did <hi>Jeſus</hi> move one foot but to purpoſe. He paſſed by; but ſo as that
his Virtue ſtayed: ſo did he paſſe by, that his eye was fixed. The blinde man
could not ſee him; he ſees the blinde man. His goodneſs prevents us, and
yields better ſupplies to our wants. He ſaw compaſſionately; not ſhutting his
eyes, not turning them aſide, but bending them upon that dark and diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Object. That which was ſaid of the Sun, is much more true of him that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> made it, <hi>Nothing is hid from his light:</hi> but of all other things Miſeries (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

we had reaſon to be heartleſſe. O Saviour, why ſhould we not imitate
thee in this mercifull improvement of our Senſes? Wo be to thoſe eyes that

glance upon the ſores of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> the ſorrows of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the dungeon of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi>
the blinde Begger at the gate of the Temple.</p>
                  <p>The Diſciples ſee the blinde man too, but with different eyes: our Saviour
for pity and cure, they for expoſtulation; <hi>Maſter, who did ſin? this man or
his Parents, that he is born blinde?</hi> I like well that whatſoever doubt troubled
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> them, they ſtraight vent it into the eare of their Maſter. O Saviour, whiles
thou art in Heaven, thy ſchool is upon earth. Wherefore ſerve thy <hi>Prieſts lips</hi>
but to <hi>preſerve knowledge?</hi> What uſe is there of the tongue of the learned,
but to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon? Thou teacheſt us ſtill; and ſtill we doubt, and

                  <p>In one ſhort queſtion I finde two Truths and two Falſhoods; the Truths im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:44233:91"/>
the Falſhoods expreſſed. It is true, that commonly man's ſuffering is for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
ſin; that we may juſtly, and do often, ſuffer even for the ſins of our Parents.
It is falſe, that there is no other reaſon of our ſuffering but ſin; that a man
could ſin actually before he was, or was before his being; or could before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
ſuffer for his after-ſins. In all likelihood that abſurd conceit of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration
of Souls poſſeſſed the very Diſciples. How eaſily and how far may
the beſt be miſcarried with a common errour? We are not thankfull for our
own illumination, if we do not look with charity and pity upon the groſſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opinions
of our brethren.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour ſees, and yet will wink at ſo foul a miſpriſion of his Diſciples.
I hear neither chiding nor conviction. He that could have inlightned their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

himſelf here with a milde ſolution; <hi>Neither this man, nor his Parents.</hi> We
learn nothing of thee, O Saviour, if not meekneſs. What a ſweet temper ſhould
be in our carriage towards the weakneſſes of others judgment? how ſhould we
inſtruct them without bitterneſs, and without violence of Paſſion exſpect the
meet ſeaſons of their better information? The tender Mother or Nurſe doth
not rate her little one for that he goes not well; but gives him her hand,
that he may goe better. It is the ſpirit of lenity that muſt reſtore and confirm
the lapſed.</p>
                  <p>The anſwer is direct and punctual; neither the ſin of the man nor of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
bereaved him of his eyes: there was an higher cauſe of this privation;
the glory that God meant to win unto himſelf by redreſſing it. The Parents
had ſinned in themſelves; the man had ſinned in his firſt Parents: it is not the
guilt of either that is guilty of this blindneſs. All God's afflictive acts are not
puniſhments; ſome are for the benefit of the creature, whether for probation,
or prevention, or reformation; all are for the praiſe, whether of his Divine
Power, or Juſtice, or Mercy.</p>
                  <p>It was fit ſo great a work ſhould be uſher'd in with a preface. A ſuddain and
abrupt appearance would not have beſeemed ſo glorious a demonſtration of
Omnipotence. The way is made; our Saviour addreſſes himſelf to the Miracle:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
a Miracle not more in the thing done, then in the form of doing it.</p>
                  <p>The matter uſed was clay. Could there be a meaner? could there be ought
more unfit? O Saviour, how oft hadſt thou cured blindneſſes by thy word
alone? how oft by thy touch? How eaſily couldſt thou have done ſo here?
Was this to ſhew thy liberty, or thy power? Liberty, in that thou canſt at
pleaſure uſe variety of means, not being tied to any; Power, in that thou
couldſt make uſe of contraries? Hadſt thou pull'd out a box and applied ſome
medicinal ointment to the eyes, ſomething had been aſcribed to thy skill, more
to the natural power of thy receit: now thou madeſt uſe of clay, which had
been enough to ſtop up the eyes of the ſeeing, the virtue muſt be all in thee,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
none in the means. The utter diſproportion of this help to the Cure addes
glory to the worker.</p>
                  <p>How clearly didſt thou hence evince to the world, that thou who of clay
couldſt make eyes, wert the ſame who of clay hadſt made man? ſince there is
no part of the body that hath ſo little analogie to clay as the eye; this clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is contrary to that opacity. Had not the Jews been more blinde then the
man whom thou curedſt, and more hard and ſtiffe then the clay which thou
mollifiedſt, they had, in this one work, both ſeen and acknowledged thy
Deity.</p>
                  <p>What could the clay have done without thy tempering? It was thy ſpittle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
that made the clay effectual; it was that Sacred mouth of thine that made the
ſpittle medicinal: the water of <hi>Siloe</hi> ſhall but waſh off that clay which this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
moiſture made powerfull. The clay thus tempered, muſt be applied by
the hand that made it, elſe it avails nothing.</p>
                  <p>What muſt the blinde man needs think, when he felt the cold clay upon the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44233:91"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> holes of his eyes? or (ſince he could not conceive what an eye was) what muſt
the beholders needs think, to ſee that hollowneſs thus filled up? Is this the
way to give either eyes or ſight? Why did not the earth ſee with this clay as
well as the man? What is there to hinder the ſight, if this make it?</p>
                  <p>Yet with theſe contrarieties muſt the Faith be exerciſed, where God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
the bleſſing of a Cure.</p>
                  <p>It was never meant that this clay ſhould dwell upon thoſe pits of the eyes:
it is onely put on to be waſhed off; and that not by every water; none ſhall
doe it but that of <hi>Siloam,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Sent;</hi> and if the man had not been ſent
to <hi>Siloam,</hi> he had been ſtill blinde. All things receive their virtue from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> inſtitution. How elſe ſhould a piece of wheaten bread nouriſh the Soul?
How ſhould ſpring-water waſh off ſpiritual filthineſs? How ſhould the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs
of preaching ſave Souls? How ſhould the abſolution of God's Miniſter
be more effectual then the breath of an ordinary Chriſtian? Thou, O God,
haſt ſet apart theſe Ordinances; thy Bleſſing is annexed to them; hence is the
ground of all our uſe, and their efficacy. Hadſt thou ſo inſtituted, <hi>Jordan</hi> would
as well have healed Blindneſs, and <hi>Siloam</hi> Leproſie.</p>
                  <p>That the man might be capable of ſuch a Miracle, his Faith is ſet on work;
he muſt be led with his eyes daubed up to the pool of <hi>Siloam.</hi> He waſhes and
ſees. Lord, what did this man think when his eyes were now firſt given him?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> what a new world did he finde himſelf now come into? how did he wonder at
Heaven and earth, and the faces and ſhapes of all creatures, the goodly varieties
of colours, the chearfulneſs of the light, the lively beams of the Sun, the vaſt
expanſion of the aire, the pleaſant tranſparence of the water; at the glorious
piles of the Temple, and ſtately palaces of <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> Every thing did not
more pleaſe then aſtoniſh him. Lo, thus ſhall we be affected, and more, when
the ſcales of our mortality being done away, we ſhall ſee as we are ſeen; when
we ſhall behold the bleſſedneſs of that other world, the glory of the Saints
and Angels, the infinite Majeſty of the Son of God, the incomprehenſible
brightneſs of the all-glorious Deity. O my Soul, that thou couldſt be taken
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> up before-hand with the admiration of that which thou canſt not as yet be
capable of foreſeeing.</p>
                  <p>It could not be but that many eyes had been witneſſes of this man's want
of eyes. He ſate begging at one of the Temple gates: not only all the City, but
all the Country muſt needs know him; thrice a year did they come up to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi>
neither could they come to the Temple and not ſee him. His very
blindneſs made him noted. Deformities and infirmities of body do more
eaſily both draw and fix the eye then an ordinary ſymmetry of parts.</p>
                  <p>Beſides his Blindneſs, his Trade made him remarkable; the importunity of
his begging drew the eyes of the paſſengers. But of all other, the Place moſt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> notified him. Had he ſate in ſome obſcure village of <hi>Judaea,</hi> or in ſome blinde
lane of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> perhaps he had not been heeded of many; but now that he
took up his ſeat in the heart, in the head of the chief City, whither all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted
from all parts, what Jew can there be that knows not the blinde beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
at the Temple gate? Purpoſely did our Saviour make choice of ſuch a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
for his Miracle; a man ſo poor, ſo publick: the glory of the work could
not have reach'd ſo far, if it had been done to the wealthieſt Citizen of
<hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Neither was it for nothing that the act and the man is doubted of
and inquired into by the beholders; <hi>Is not this he that ſat begging? Some ſaid,
It is he; others ſaid, It is like him.</hi> No truths have received ſo full proofs as
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> thoſe that have been queſtioned. The want or the ſuddain preſence of an
eye (much more of both) muſt needs make a great change in the face; thoſe
little balls of light (which no doubt were more clear then Nature could have
made them) could not but give a new life to the countenance. I marvell not it
the neighbours, which had wont to ſee this dark viſage led by a guide, and
guided by a ſtaffe, ſeeing him now walking confidently alone out of his own
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:44233:92"/>
inward light, and looking them chearfully in the face, doubted whether this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
were he. The miraculous cures of God work a ſenſible alteration in men, not
more in their own apprehenſion, then in the judgment of others. Thus in the
redreſſe of the Spiritual blindneſſe, the whole habit of the man is changed.
Where before his Face looked dull and earthly; now there is a ſprightful chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
in it, through the comfortable knowledge of God and Heavenly things:
Whereas before his Heart was ſet upon worldly things; now he uſes them, but
injoyes them not: and that uſe is becauſe he muſt, not becauſe he would: Where
before his fears and griefs were only for pains of body, or loſſe of eſtate or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;
now they are only ſpent upon the diſpleaſure of his God, and the peril
of his Soul. So as now the neighbours can ſay, <hi>Is this the man? others, It is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
like him, it is not he.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The late-blinde man hears, and now ſees himſelf queſtioned; and ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
the doubt, <hi>I am he.</hi> He that now ſaw the light of the Sun, would not
hide the light of Truth from others. It is an unthankfull ſilence, to ſmother the
works of God in an affected ſecrecy. To make God a loſer by his bounty to
us, were a ſhamefull injuſtice. We our ſelves abide not thoſe ſponges that ſuck
up good turns unknown. O God, we are not worthy of our ſpiritual eye-ſight,
if we do not publiſh thy mercies on the houſe top, and praiſe thee in the great
congregation.</p>
                  <p>Man is naturally inquiſitive: we ſearch ſtudiouſly into the ſecret works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
we pry into the reaſons of the witty inventions of Art; but if there be any
thing that tranſcends Art and Nature, the more high and abſtruſe it is, the more
buſie we are to ſeek into it. This thirſt after hidden, yea forbidden, Knowledge
did once coſt us dear: but where it is good and lawful to know, inquiry is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable;
as here in theſe Jews, <hi>How were thine eyes opened?</hi> The firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of humane Reaſon is inquiſition, the next is information and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution:
and if the meaneſt events paſſe us not without a queſtion, how much
leſſe thoſe that carry in them wonder and advantage?</p>
                  <p>He that was ſo ready to profeſſe himſelf the Subject of the Cure, is no nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of proclaiming the Author of it; <hi>A man that is called Jeſus made clay, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
anointed mine eyes, and ſent me to Siloam to waſh, and now I ſee.</hi> The blinde man
knew no more then he ſaid, and he ſaid what he apprehended, <hi>A man.</hi> He heard
<hi>Jeſus</hi> ſpeak, he felt his hand; as yet he could look no further: upon his next
meeting he ſaw God in this man. In matter of Knowledge, we muſt be content
to creep ere we can goe. As that other recovered blinde man ſaw firſt men walk
like trees, after like men; ſo no marvel if this man ſaw firſt this God only as
man, after this man as God alſo. Onwards he thinks him a wonderfull man, a
mighty Prophet. In vain ſhall we either exſpect a ſuddain perfection in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of Divine matters, or cenſure thoſe that want it.</p>
                  <p>How did this man know what <hi>Jeſus</hi> did? He was then ſtone-blinde; what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
diſtinction could he yet make of perſons, of actions? True, but yet the blinde
man never wanted the aſſiſtance of others eyes; their relation hath aſſured him
of the manner of his Cure: beſides the contribution of his other Senſes, his
Eare might perceive the ſpittle to fall, and hear the injoined command; his
Feeling perceived the cold &amp; moiſt clay upon his lids. All theſe conjoined gave
ſufficient warrant thus to believe, thus to report. Our eare is our beſt guide
to a full apprehenſion of the works of Chriſt. The works of God the Father,
his Creation and Government, are beſt known by the Eye: The works of God
the Son, his Redemption and Mediation, are beſt known by the Eare. O Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
we cannot perſonally ſee what thou haſt done here. What are the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
of thine Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, but the relations of the blinde man's
guide, what and how thou haſt wrought for us? On theſe we ſtrongly relie,
theſe we do no leſſe confidently believe then if our very eyes had been witneſſes
of what thou didſt and ſufferedſt upon earth. There were no place for Faith, if
the Eare were not worthy of as much credit as the Eye.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:44233:92"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> How could the neighbours doe leſſe then ask where he was that had done
ſo ſtrange a cure? I doubt yet with what minde; I fear, not out of favour. Had
they been but indifferent, they could not but have been full of ſilent wonder,
and inclined to believe in ſo Omnipotent an Agent. Now, as prejudiced to
Chriſt, and partial to the Phariſees, they bring the late-blinde man before thoſe
profeſſed enemies unto Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>It is the prepoſterous Religion of the Vulgar ſort to claw and adore thoſe
which have tyrannically uſurped upon their Souls, though with neglect, yea
with contempt, of God in his word, in his works. Even unjuſt authority will
never want ſoothing up in whatſoever courſes, though with diſgrace and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to the Truth. Baſe mindes where they finde poſſeſſion, never look
after right.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour had pick'd out the Sabbath for this Cure. It is hard to finde
out any time wherein Charity is unſeaſonable. As Mercy is an excellent Grace,
ſo the works of it are fitteſt for the beſt day. We are all born blinde: the
Font is our <hi>Siloam:</hi> no day can come amiſſe, but yet God's day is the propereſt
for our waſhing and recovery.</p>
                  <p>This alone is quarrel enough to theſe ſcrupulous wranglers, that an act of
Mercy was done on that day wherein their envie was but ſeaſonable.</p>
                  <p>I do not ſee the man beg any more when he once had his eyes; no Burger in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                     <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was richer then he. I hear him ſtoutly defending that gracious au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of his Cure againſt the cavils of the malicious Phariſees: I ſee him as a
reſolute Confeſſour ſuffering excommunication for the name of Chriſt, and
maintaining the innocence and honour of ſo Bleſſed a benefactor: I hear him
read a Divinity Lecture to them that ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> his chair, and convincing
them of blindneſs, who puniſh'd him for ſeeing.</p>
                  <p>How can I but envie thee, O happy man, who of a Patient, proveſt an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
for thy Saviour; whoſe gain of bodily ſight made way for thy Spiritual
eyes; who haſt loſt a Synagogue, and haſt found Heaven; who being abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

Whiles our Saviour is transfigured on the Mount, his Diſciples are
perplexed in the valley. Three of his choice Followers were with
him above, raviſhed with the miraculous proofs of his Godhead: nine
other were troubled with the buſineſs of a ſtubborn Devil below.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Much people was met to attend Chriſt, and there they will ſtay till he come
down from <hi>Tabor.</hi> Their zeal and devotion brought them thither; their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
perſeverance held them there. We are not worthy the name of his cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
if we cannot painfully ſeek him, and ſubmiſſely wait his leiſure.</p>
                  <p>He that was now awhile retired into the Mount, to confer with his Father,
and to receive the attendance of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> returns into the valley to the
multitude. He was ſingled out awhile for prayer and contemplation; now he
was joyned with the multitude for their miraculous cure and Heavenly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
We that are his ſpiritual agents muſt be either preparing in the mount,
or exerciſing in the valley; one while in the mount of Meditation, in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of Action another; alone to ſtudy, in the aſſembly to preach: here is much
variety, but all is work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> when he came down from the hill, heard Muſick in the valley; Chriſt
when he came down from the hill, heard diſcord. The Scribes (it ſeems) were
ſetting hard upon the Diſciples: they ſaw Chriſt abſent, nine of his train left
in the valley, thoſe they flie upon. As the Devil, ſo his Imps, watch cloſe for all
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:44233:93"/>
advantages. No ſubtile enemy but will be ſure to attempt that part where is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
likelihood of leaſt defence, moſt weakneſs. When the Spouſe miſſes him whom
her Soul loveth, every watchman hath a buffet for her. O Saviour, if thou be
never ſo little ſtept aſide, we are ſure to be aſſaulted with powerful Temptations.</p>
                  <p>They that durſt ſay nothing to the Maſter, ſo ſoon as his back is turned fall
foul upon his weakeſt Diſciples. Even at the firſt hatching the Serpent was
thus crafty, to begin at the weaker veſſell: experience and time hath not aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his wit. If he ſtill work upon <hi>ſilly Women laden with divers luſts,</hi> upon rude
and ungrounded Ignorants, it is no other then his old wont.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour upon the skirts of the hill knew well what was done in the
plain; and therefore haſts down to the reſcue of his Diſciples. The clouds and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
vapors do not ſooner ſcatter upon the Sun's breaking forth, then theſe cavils
vaniſh at the preſence of Chriſt: in ſtead of oppoſition they are ſtraigth upon
their knees; here are now no quarrells, but humble ſalutations; and if Chriſt's
queſtion did not force theirs, the Scribes had found no tongue.</p>
                  <p>Doubtleſſe there were many eager Patients in this throng; none made ſo
much noiſe as the father of the Demoniack. Belike upon his occaſion it was that
the Scribes held conteſtation with the Diſciples. If they wrangled, he fues, and
that from his knees. Whom wil not need make both humble and eloquent?
The caſe was wofull, and accordingly expreſſed. A ſon is a dear name; but
this was his only ſon. Were his grief ordinary yet, the ſorrow were the leſſe; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
but he is a fearfull ſpectacle of judgment, for he is Lunatick. Were this Lunacy
yet merely from a natural diſtemper, it were more tolerable; but this is aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
by the poſſeſſion of a cruell ſpirit, that handles him in a moſt grievous
manner. Yet were he but in the rank of other Demoniacks, the diſcomfort
were more eaſie; but lo, this ſpirit is worſe then all other his fellows; others
are uſually diſpoſſeſſed by the Diſciples, this is beyond their power. <hi>I be ſought
thy Diſciples to caſt him out, but they could not: therefore, Lord, have thou mercy
on my Son.</hi> The deſpair of all other helps ſends us importunately to the God of
power. Here was his refuge; the ſtrong man had gotten poſſeſſion, it was only
the ſtronger then he that can eject him. O God, ſpiritual wickedneſſes have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
naturally ſeized upon our Souls: all humane helps are too weak; only thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
ſhall improve thy Power to our deliverance.</p>
                  <p>What bowels could chuſe but yearn at the diſtreſſe of this poor young man?
Phrenſy had taken his brain: that Diſeaſe was but health in compariſon of the
tyrannical poſſeſſion of that evil ſpirit, wherewith it was ſeconded. Out of Hell
there could not be a greater miſery: his Senſes are either bereſt, or elſe left to
torment him; he is torn and racked, ſo as he foams and gnaſhes, he pines and
languiſhes; he is caſt ſometimes into the fire, ſometimes into the water. How
that malitious Tyrant rejoices in the miſchief done to the creature of God?
Had earth had any thing more pernicious then fire and water, thither had he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
been thrown; though rather for torture, then diſpatch. It was too much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to die at once. O God, with how deadly enemies haſt thou matched us?
Abate thou their power, ſince their malice will not be abated.</p>
                  <p>How many think of this caſe with pity and horror, and in the mean time are
inſenſible of their own fearfuller condition?</p>
                  <p>It is but oftentimes that the Devil would caſt this young man into a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
fire; he would caſt the ſinner into an eternal fire, whoſe everlaſting
burnings have no intermiſſions. No fire comes amiſſe to him; the fire of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
the fire of Luſt, the fire of Hell. O God, make us apprehenſive of the
danger of our ſin, and ſecure from the fearfull iſſue of ſin.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe very ſame effects follow his ſpiritual poſſeſſion. How doth he tear
and rack them whom he vexes and diſtracts with inordinate cares and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows?
How do they foam and gnaſh whom he hath drawn to an impatient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining
at God's afflictive hand? How do they pine away who hourly decay
and languiſh in Grace?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:44233:93"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Oh the lamentable condition of ſinfull Souls, ſo much more dangerous, by
how much leſſe felt!</p>
                  <p>But all this while what part hath the Moon in this mans miſery? How
comes the name of that goodly Planet in queſtion? Certainly theſe diſeaſes
of the brain follow much the courſe of this queen of moiſture. That power
which ſhe hath in humors is drawn to the advantage of the malicious ſpirit;
her predominancy is abuſed to his deſpight: whether it were for the better
opportunity of his vexation, or whether for the drawing of envy and diſcredit
upon ſo noble a creature. It is no news with that ſubtle enemie to faſten his
effects upon thoſe ſecondary cauſes which he uſurps to his own purpoſes.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Whatever be the means, he is the tormentor. Much wiſdome needs to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh

                  <p>He that knew all things, asks queſtions; <hi>How long hath he been ſo?</hi> Not to

without the leave of the God of Spirits) but that by the confeſſion of
the Parent he might lay forth the wofull condition of the childe; that the
thank and glory of the Cure might be ſo much greater, as the complaint was
more grievous. <hi>He anſwered, From a childe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O God, how I adore the depth of thy wiſe and juſt and powerfull diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?

capable of good or evil, to yield him over to the power of that Evil one. What
need I ask for any other reaſon then that which is the rule of all Juſtice, thy

That childe, though an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> was conceived and born in that ſin which both
could and did give Satan an intereſt in him. Beſides, the actual ſins of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
deſerved this revenge upon that piece of themſelves. Rather, O God,
let me magnific this Mercy, that we and our s eſcape this Judgment, then que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
thy Juſtice, that ſome eſcape not. How juſt might it have been with thee,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that we, who have given way to Satan in our ſins, ſhould have way and ſcope
given to Satan over us in our puniſhments? It is thy praiſe that any of us are
free; it is no quarrell that ſome ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>Do I wonder to ſee Satans bodily poſſeſſion of this yong man from a childe,
when I ſee his ſpiritual poſſeſſion of every ſon of <hi>Adam</hi> from a longer date;
not from a childe, but from the womb, yea in it? Why ſhould not Satan poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
his own? we are all by nature the ſons of wrath. It is time for us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
him in Baptiſm, whoſe we are till we be regenerate. He hath right to us in
our firſt birth; our new birth acquits us from him, and cuts off all his claim.
How miſerable are they that have nothing but Nature? Better had it been to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> have been unborn, then not to be born again.</p>
                  <p>And if this poor ſoul from an infant were thus miſerably handled, having
done none actual evil; how juſt cauſe have we to fear the like Judgments, who
by many foul offences have deſerved to draw this executioner upon us? O my
Soul, thou haſt not room enough for thankfulneſſe to that good God, who hath
not delivered thee up to that malignant Spirit.</p>
                  <p>The diſtreſſed Father ſits not ſtill, neglects not means; <hi>I brought him to thy
Diſciples.</hi> Doubtleſſe the man came firſt to ſeek for Chriſt himſelf; finding
him abſent, he makes ſuit to the Diſciples. To whom ſhould we have recourſe
in all our ſpirituall complaints but to the agents and meſſengers of God? The
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> noiſe of the like cures had ſurely brought this man with much confidence to
crave their ſuccour; and now how cold was he at the heart, when he found
that his hopes were fruſtrate? <hi>They could not caſt him out.</hi> No doubt the
Diſciples tried their beſt, they laid their wonted charge upon this dumb ſpirit;
but all in vain. They that could come with joy and triumph to their Maſter,
and ſay, <hi>The Devils are ſubject to us,</hi> finde now themſelves matched with a
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:44233:94"/>
ſtubborn and refractory ſpirit. Their way was hitherto ſmooth and fair; they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
met with no rub till now. And now ſurely the father of the Demoniack was
not more troubled at this event then themſelves. How could they chuſe but
fear leſt their Maſter had with himſelf withdrawn that ſpiritual power which
they had formerly exerciſed? Needs muſt their heart fail them with their
ſucceſſe.</p>
                  <p>The man complained not of their impotence: it were fondly injurious to
accuſe them for that which they could not doe: had the want been in their will,
they had well deſerved a querulous language; it was no fault to want power.
Only he complains of the ſtubbornneſſe, and laments the invincibleneſſe of that
evil ſpirit.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhould wrong you, O ye bleſſed Followers of Chriſt, if I ſhould ſay that, as
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> was gone up into the Mount, loſt their belief with their
guide; ſo that ye, miſſing your Maſter (who was now aſcended up to his <hi>Tabor</hi>)
were to ſeek for your Faith. Rather the Wiſdome of God ſaw reaſon to
check your over-aſſured forwardneſſe; and both to pull down your hearts
by a juſt humiliation in the ſenſe of your own weakneſſe, and to raiſe up your
hearts to new acts of dependance upon that ſoveraign power from which your
limited virtue was derived.</p>
                  <p>What was more familiar to the Diſciples then ejecting of Devils? In this
only it is denied them. Our good God ſometimes findes it requiſite to hold us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
ſhort in thoſe abilities whereof we make leaſt doubt, that we may feel whence
we had them. God will be no leſſe glorified in what we cannot doe, then in
what we can doe. If his Graces were alwaies at our command, and ever alike,
they would ſeem natural, and ſoon run into contempt: now we are juſtly held
in an awfull dependance upon that gracious hand, which ſo gives as not to cloy
us, and ſo denies as not to diſcourage us.</p>
                  <p>Who could now but expect that our Saviour ſhould have pitied and bemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the condition of this ſad father and miſerable ſon, and have let fall ſome
words of comfort upon them? In ſtead whereof I hear him chiding and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining,
<hi>O faithleſſe and perverſe generation, how long ſhall I be with you? how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
long ſhall I ſuffer you?</hi> Complaining, not of that wofull father and more wofull
ſon; it was not his faſhion to adde affliction to the diſtreſſed, to break ſuch
bruiſed reeds; but of thoſe Scribes, who upon the failing of the ſucceſſe of this
ſuit, had inſulted upon the diſability of the Followers of Chriſt, and depraved
his power: although perhaps this impatient father, ſeduced by their ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
might ſlip into ſome thoughts of diſtruſt.</p>
                  <p>There could not be a greater crimination then <hi>faithleſſe and perverſe:</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
in not believing; perverſe, in being obſtinately ſet in their unbelief.
Doubtleſſe theſe men were not free from other notorious crimes: all were
drowned in their Infidelity. Morall uncleanneſſes or violences may ſeem <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
more hainous to men; none are ſo odious to God as theſe Intellectual wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
                  <p>What an happy change is here in one breath of Chriſt? <hi>How long ſhall I
ſuffer you? Bring him hither to me.</hi> The one is a word of anger, the other of
favour. His juſt indignation doth not exceed or impeach his Goodneſſe. What
a ſweet mixture there is in the perfect ſimplicity of the Divine Nature? <hi>In the
midſt of judgement he remembers mercy,</hi> yea he acts it. His Sun ſhines in the
midſt of this ſtorm. Whether he frown or whether he ſmile, it is all to one
purpoſe, that he may win the incredulous and diſobedient. Whither ſhould the
rigour of all our cenſures tend but to edification, and not to deſtruction? We <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
are Phyſicians, we are not executioners; we give purges to cure, and not poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to kill. It is for the juſt Judge to ſay one day to reprobate Souls, <hi>Depart
from me;</hi> in the mean time it is for us to invite all that are ſpiritually poſſeſſed
to the participation of mercy, <hi>Bring him hither to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O Saviour, diſtance was no hindrance to thy work: why ſhould the Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:44233:94"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be brought to thee? Was it that this deliverance might be the better
evicted, and that the beholders might ſee it was not for nothing that the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
were oppoſed with ſo refractory a ſpirit? or was it that the Scribes might
be witneſſes of that ſtrong hoſtility that was betwixt thee and that foul ſpirit,
and be aſhamed of their blaſphemous ſlander? or was it that the father of the
Demoniack might be quickened in that Faith which now, through the ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
of the Scribes, begun to droup; when he ſhould hear and ſee Chriſt ſo
chearfully to undertake and perform that whereof they had bidden him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair?</p>
                  <p>The poſſeſſed is brought; the Devil is rebuked and ejected. That ſtiff ſpirit
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> which ſtood out boldly againſt the commands of the Diſciples, cannot but
ſtoop to the voice of the Maſter: that power which did at firſt caſt him out
of Heaven, eaſily diſpoſſeſſes him of an houſe of clay. <hi>The Lord rebuke thee,
Satan,</hi> and then thou canſt not but flee.</p>
                  <p>The Diſciples, who were not uſed to theſe affronts, cannot but be troubled
at their miſ-ſucceſſe: <hi>Maſter, why could not we caſt him out?</hi> Had they been
conſcious of any defect in themſelves, they had never ask'd the queſtion. Little
did they think to hear of their Unbelief. Had they not had great Faith, they
could not have caſt out any Devils; had they not had ſome want of Faith, they
had caſt out this. It is poſſible for us to be defective in ſome Graces, and not to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> feel it.</p>
                  <p>Although not ſo much their weakneſſe is guilty of this unprevailing, as the
ſtrength of that evil ſpirit; <hi>This kind goes not out but by prayer and faſting.</hi>
Weaker ſpirits were wont to be ejected by a command; this Devil was more
ſturdy and boiſterous. As there are degrees of ſtatures in men, ſo there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of ſtrength and rebellion in ſpirituall wickedneſſes. Here bidding will
not ſerve, they muſt pray; and praying will not ſerve without faſting. They
muſt pray to God that they may prevail; they muſt faſt to make their prayer
more ſervent, more effectuall. We cannot now command, we can faſt and pray.
How good is our God to us, that whiles he hath not thought fit to continue to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> us thoſe means which are leſſe powerfull for the diſpoſſeſſing of the powers
of darkneſſe, yet hath he given us the greater? Whiles we can faſt and pray,
God will command for us; Satan cannot prevail againſt us.</p>

                  <p>Thoſe things we delight in, we love to behold: The eye and the heart will
go together. And can we think, O Saviour, that thy Glory hath diminiſhed

And doſt thou, O God, ſee what we give thee, and not ſee what we take <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
away from thee? Are our Offerings more noted then our Sacriledges? Surely
thy Mercy is not more quick-ſighted then thy Juſtice. In both kindes our
actions are viewed, our account is kept; and we are ſure to receive Rewards
for what we have given, and Vengeance for what we have defalked. With thine
eye of Knowledge thou ſeeſt all we doe; but what we doe well, thou ſeeſt
with thine eye of Approbation. So didſt thou now behold theſe pious and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Oblations. How well wert thou pleaſed with this variety? Thou ſaweſt
many rich men give much; and one poor Widow give more then they in leſſer
room.</p>
                  <p>The Jews were now under the <hi>Romane</hi> preſſure; they were all tributaries,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
yet many of them rich; and thoſe rich men were liberal to the common cheſt.
Hadſt thou ſeen thoſe many rich give little, we had heard of thy cenſure: thou
expecteſt a proportion betwixt the giver and the gift, betwixt the gift and the
receit: where that fails, the blame is juſt. That Nation (though otherwiſe
faulty enough) was in this commendable. How bounteouſly open were their
hands to the houſe of God? Time was, when their liberality was fain to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
by Proclamation; and now it needed no incitement: the rich gave
much, the pooreſt gave more. <hi>He ſaw a poor widow caſting in two mites.</hi> It was
miſery enough that ſhe was a Widow. The married woman is under the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
proviſion of an Husband; if ſhe ſpend, he earns: in that eſtate four hands <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
work for her; in her viduity but two. Poverty added to the ſorrow of her
widowhood. The loſſe of ſome Husbands is ſupplied by a rich joynture; it is
ſome allay to the grief that the hand is left full, though the bed be empty.
This woman was not more deſolate then needy. Yet this poor widow gives.
And what gives ſhe? An offering like her ſelf, <hi>two mites;</hi> or, in our language,
two half-farthing-tokens. Alas, good woman, who was poorer then thy ſelf?
wherefore was that Corban, but for the relief of ſuch as thou? who ſhould
receive, if ſuch give? Thy mites were ſomething to thee, nothing to the
Treaſury. How ill is that gift beſtowed, which diſ-furniſheth thee, and addes
nothing to the common ſtock? Some thrifty neighbour might perhaps have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
ſuggeſted this probable diſcouragement. <hi>Jeſus</hi> publiſhes and applauds her
bounty: <hi>He called his Diſciples, and ſaid unto them, Verily I ſay unto you, this
woman hath caſt in more then they all.</hi> Whiles the rich put in their offering, I ſee
no Diſciples called; it was enough that Chriſt noted their gifts alone: but
when the Widow comes with her two mites, now the domeſticks of Chriſt
are ſummoned to aſſemble, and taught to admire this munificence; a ſolemn
preface makes way to her praiſe, and her Mites are made more precious then
the others Talents. <hi>She gave more then they all.</hi> More, not only in reſpect of the
Minde of the giver, but of the proportion of the gift, as hers. A mite to her
was more then pounds to them: Pounds were little to them, two mites were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
all to her: They gave out of their abundance, ſhe out of her neceſſity. That
which they gave, left the heap leſſe, yet an heap ſtill; ſhe gives all at once,
and leaves her ſelf nothing. So as ſhe gave, not more then any, but <hi>more then
they all.</hi> God doth not ſo much regard what is taken out, as what is left<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of mercies, thou lookeſt at once into the bottome of her heart and the
bottome of her purſe; and eſteemeſt her gift according to both. As thou ſeeſt
not as man, ſo thou valueſt not as man: Man judgeth by the worth of the gift,
thou judgeſt by the minde of the giver and the proportion of the remainder.
It were wide with us if thou ſhouldſt goe by quantities. Alas, what have we
but mites, and thoſe of thine own lending? It is the comfort of our meanneſſe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
that our affections are valued and not our preſents: neither haſt thou ſaid,
<hi>God loves a liberal giver,</hi> but a <hi>chearfull.</hi> If I had more, O God, thou ſhouldſt
have it; had I leſſe, thou wouldſt not deſpiſe it, who <hi>accepteſt the gift according
to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, Lord, what have I but two mites, a Soul, and a Body? mere mites, yea,

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not ſo much, to thine Infiniteneſs, Oh that I could perfectly offer them up unto

with a ſubmiſſive profer of their allegeance, ſhe might have had ſome reaſon

ſuffering, dying, was in her eare, to make account of and ſuit for a

                  <p>To hear a man in his beſt health and vigor to talk of his confidence in God,
and aſſurance of Divine favour, cannot be much worth: but if in extremities

                  <p>What a ſtrange ſtyle is this that is given to this woman? It had been as

<hi>The mother of Zebedee's children. Zebedee</hi> was an obſcure man; ſhe, as his wife,
was no better; the greateſt honour ſhe ever had or could have, was to have
two ſuch ſons as <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John;</hi> theſe give a title to both their Parents.
Honour aſcends as well as deſcends. Holy Children dignifie the loyns and
womb from whence they proceed, no leſſe then their Parents traduce honour
unto them. <hi>Salome</hi> might be a good wife, a good huſwife, a good woman, a
good neighbour: all theſe cannot ennoble her ſo much as <hi>the mother of Zebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee's
children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> What a world of pain, toyl, care, coſt, there is in the birth and education of
children? Their good proof requites all with advantage. Next to happineſs
in our ſelves, is to be happy in a gracious Iſſue.</p>
                  <p>The ſuit was the ſons, but by the mouth of their mother: it was their
beſt policy to ſpeak by her lips. Even theſe Fiſhermen had already learned
craftily to fiſh for promotion. Ambition was not ſo bold in them as to ſhew

her own face: the envy of the ſuit ſhall thus be avoided, which could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
not but follow upon their perſonall requeſt. If it were granted, they had
what they would; if not, it was but the repulſe of a womans motion: which
muſt needs be ſo much more pardonable, becauſe it was of a mother for
her ſons.</p>
                  <p>It is not diſcommendable in parents to ſeek the preferment of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Why may not <hi>Abraham</hi> ſue for an <hi>Iſmael?</hi> So it be by lawfull means,
in a moderate meaſure, in due order, this endeavour cannot be amiſſe. It is
the neglect of circumſtances that makes theſe deſires ſinfull. Oh the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of thoſe Parents that care not which way they raiſe an houſe; that
deſire rather to leave their children great, then good; that are more ambitious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
to have their ſons Lords on earth, then Kings in Heaven! Yet I commend
thee, <hi>Salome,</hi> that thy firſt plot was to have thy ſons Diſciples of Chriſt,
then after to prefer them to the beſt places of that attendance. It is the true
method of Divine prudence, O God, firſt to make our children happy with
the honour of thy ſervice, and then to endeavour their meet advancement
upon earth.</p>
                  <p>The mother is but put upon this ſuit by her ſons; their heart was in her
lips. They were not ſo mortified by their continual converſation with Chriſt,
hearing his Heavenly doctrine, ſeeing his Divine carriage, but that their mindes
were yet roving after temporal Honours. Pride is the inmoſt coat, which we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
put off laſt, and which we put on firſt. Who can wonder to ſee ſome ſparks of
weak and worldly deſires in their holieſt teachers, when the bleſſed Apoſtles
were not free from ſome ambitious thoughts whiles they ſate at the feet, yea in
the boſome of their Saviour?</p>
                  <p>The near kindred this woman could challenge of Chriſt might ſeem to
give her juſt colour of more familiarity; yet now that ſhe comes upon a ſuit,
ſhe ſubmits her ſelf to the loweſt geſture of ſuppliants. We need not be taught
that it is fit for petitioners to the Great, to preſent their humble ſupplications
upon their knees. O Saviour, if this woman ſo nearly allied to thee according
to the fleſh, coming but upon a temporal occaſion to thee, being as then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
about with humane infirmities, adored thee ere ſhe durſt ſue to thee;
what reverence is enough for us that come to thee upon ſpiritual ſuits, ſitting
now in the height of Heavenly Glory and Majeſty? Say then, thou wife of
<hi>Zebedee,</hi> what is it that thou craveſt of thine omnipotent kinſman? <hi>A certain
thing.</hi> Speak out, woman; what is this certain thing that thou craveſt?
How poor and weak is this ſupplicatory anticipation to him that knew thy
thoughts ere thou utteredſt them, ere thou entertainedſt them? We are all
in this tune; every one would have ſomething; ſuch perhaps as we are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to utter. The Proud man would have a certain thing; Honour in the

the Malicious would have a certain thing; Revenge on his enemies: the
Epicure would have Pleaſure and Long life; the Barren, Children; the Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
Beauty. Each one would be humored in his own deſire; though in variety,
yea contradiction to other; though in oppoſition not more to God's will, then
our own good.</p>
                  <p>How this ſuit ſticks in her teeth, and dare not freely come forth, becauſe it
is guilty of its own faultineſſe? What a difference there is betwixt the prayers
of Faith, and the motions of Self-love and infidelity? Thoſe come forth
with boldneſſe, as knowing their own welcome, and being well aſſured, both
of their warrant and acceptation; theſe ſtand bluſhing at the door, not daring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
to appear; like to ſome baffled ſuit, conſcious to its own unworthineſſe and
juſt repulſe. Our inordinate deſires are worthy of a check: when we know that
our requeſts are holy, we cannot come with too much confidence to the throne
of Grace.</p>
                  <p>He that knew all their thoughts afar off, yet, as if he had been a ſtranger
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:44233:96"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to their purpoſes, asks, <hi>What wouldeſt thou?</hi> Our infirmities do then beſt ſhame
us, when they are fetcht out of our own mouths: Like as our Prayers alſo ſerve
not to acquaint God with our wants, but to make us the more capable of his
mercies.</p>
                  <p>The ſuit is drawn from her; now ſhe muſt ſpeak. <hi>Grant that theſe my two ſons
may ſit, one on thy right hand, the other on thy left, in thy Kingdome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is hard to ſay, whether out of more pride or ignorance. It was as received
as erroneous a conceit among the very Diſciples of Chriſt, that he ſhould raiſe
up a Temporal Kingdom over the now-tributary and beſlaved people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
The <hi>Romans</hi> were now their maſters; their fancy was, that their <hi>Meſsias</hi> ſhould
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſhake off this yoke, and reduce them to their former Liberty. So grounded
was this opinion, that the two Diſciples in their walk to <hi>Emmaus</hi> could ſay, <hi>We
truſted it had been he that ſhould have delivered Iſrael;</hi> and when, after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
he was walking up mount <hi>Olivet</hi> towards Heaven, his very Apoſtles
could ask him, if he would now reſtore that long-exſpected Kingdome. How
ſhould we mitigate our cenſures of our Chriſtian brethren, if either they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
or know not ſome ſecondary truths of Religion, when the domeſtick
Attendants of Chriſt, who heard him every day till the very point of his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
miſapprehended the chief cauſe of his coming into the world, and the ſtate
of his Kingdome? If our Charity may not bear with ſmall faults, what doe we
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> under his name that conniv'd at greater? Truth is as the Sun; bright in it ſelf,
yet there are many cloſe corners into which it never ſhined. O God, if thou open
our hearts, we ſhall take in thoſe beams: till thou doe ſo, teach us to attend
patiently for our ſelves, charitably for others.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Fiſhermen had ſo much Courtſhip to know, that the right hand and
the left of any Prince were the chief places of Honour. Our Saviour had ſaid
that his twelve Followers ſhould ſit upon twelve thrones, and judge the twelve
Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> This good woman would have her two ſons next to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
the prime Peers of his Kingdome. Every one is apt to wiſh the beſt to his
own. Worldly Honour is neither worth our ſuit, nor unworthy our acceptance.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Yea, <hi>Salome,</hi> had thy mind been in Heaven, hadſt thou intended this deſired pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence
of that celeſtial ſtate of Glory, yet I know not how to juſtifie thine
ambition. Wouldſt thou have thy ſons preferred to the <hi>Father of the faithfull,</hi>
to the bleſſed Mother of thy Saviour? That very wiſh were preſumptuous.
For me, O God, my ambition ſhall goe ſo high as to be a Saint in Heaven, and
to live as holily on earth as the beſt; but for precedency of Heavenly honour,
I do not, I dare not affect it. It is enough for me, if I may lift up my head amongſt
the heels of thy Bleſſed Ones.</p>
                  <p>The mother asks, the ſons have the anſwer. She was but their tongue, they
ſhall be her eares. God ever imputes the acts to the firſt mover, rather then
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to the inſtrument.</p>
                  <p>It was a ſore check, <hi>Ye know not what ye ask.</hi> In our ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
to ſpeak idly, is ſin; but in our ſuits to Chriſt to be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate,
as not to underſtand our own petitions, muſt needs be a foul
offence.</p>
                  <p>As Faith is the ground of our Prayers, ſo Knowledge is the ground of our
Faith. If we come with indigeſted requeſts, we prophane that Name we invoke.</p>
                  <p>To convince their unfitneſs for Glory, they are ſent to their impotency in
Suffering; <hi>Are ye able to drink of the cup whereof I ſhall drink, and to be baptized
with the Baptiſme wherewith I am baptized?</hi> O Saviour, even thou who wert one
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> with thy Father, haſt a Cup of thine own: never Potion was ſo bitter as that
which was mixed for thee. Yea, even thy draught is ſtinted; it is not enough
for thee to ſip of this Cup, thou muſt drink it up to the very dregs. When
the vinegar and gall were tendred to thee by men, thou didſt but kiſs the cup;
but when thy Father gave into thine hands a potion infinitely more diſtaſtful,
thou (for our health) didſt drink deep of it even to the bottome, and ſaidſt, <hi>It
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:44233:97"/>
is finiſhed.</hi> And can we repine at thoſe unpleaſing draughts of Affliction that are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
tempered for us ſinful men, when we ſee thee, the Son of thy Fathers love, thus
dieted? We pledge thee, O Bleſſed Saviour, we pledge thee, according to our
weakneſs, who haſt begun to us in thy powerful ſuffereings. Onely do thou enable
us (after ſome four faces made in our reluctation) yet at laſt willingly to pledge
thee in our conſtant Sufferings for thee.</p>
                  <p>As thou muſt be drenched within, ſo muſt thou be baptized without. Thy
Baptiſme is not of water, but of blood; both theſe came from thee in thy Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
we cannot be thine, if we partake not of both. If thou haſt not grudged
thy precious blood to us, well maieſt thou challenge ſome worthleſs drops
from us.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>When they talk of thy Kingdome, thou ſpeakeſt of thy bitter Cup, of thy
bloody Baptiſme. Suffering is the way to reigning. <hi>Through many tribulations
muſt we enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> There was never wedge of gold
that did not firſt paſs the fire; there was never pure grain that did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
the flail. In vain ſhall we dream of our immediate paſſage from the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
and jollity of earth to the glory of Heaven. Let who will hope to walk
upon Roſes and Violets to the throne of Heaven; O Saviour, let me trace thee
by the track of thy Blood, and by thy red ſteps follow thee to thine eternal reſt
and Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>I know this is no eaſie task; elſe thou hadſt never ſaid, <hi>Are ye able?</hi> Who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
ſhould be able if not they that had been ſo long bleſſed with thy preſence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by thy doctrine, and (as it were) beforehand poſſeſſed of their Heaven in
thee? Thou hadſt never made them judges of their power, if thou couldſt not
have convinced them of their weakneſs: Alas, how full of feebleneſs is our body,
and our minde of impatience? If but a Bee ſting our fleſh, it ſwels; and if but a
tooth ake, the head and heart complain. How ſmall trifles make us weary of
our ſelves? What can we doe without thee? without thee what can we ſuffer?
If thou be not, O Lord, ſtrong in my weakneſs, I cannot be ſo much as weak; I
cannot ſo much as be. Oh, do thou prepare me for my day, and enable me to my
trials: <hi>I can doe all things through</hi> thee <hi>that ſtrengtheneſt me.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>The motion of the two Diſciples was not more full of infirmity then their
anſwer, <hi>We are able.</hi> Out of an eager deſire of the Honour, they are apt to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
the condition. The beſt men may be miſtaken in their own powers.
Alas, poor men! when it came to the iſſue, they ran away, and I know not
whether one without his coat. It is one thing to ſuffer in ſpeculation, another
in practice. There cannot be a worſe ſigne then for a man in a carnal preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to vaunt of his own abilities. How juſtly doth God ſuffer that man to
be foiled purpoſely, that he may be aſhamed of his own vain ſelf-confidence?
O God, let me ever be humbly dejected in the ſenſe of mine own inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency;
let me give all the Glory to thee, and take nothing to my ſelf but my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
infirmities.</p>
                  <p>Oh the wonderful mildneſs of the Son of God! He doth not rate the two
Diſciples, either for their ambition in ſuing, or preſumption in undertaking:
but leaving the worſt, he takes the beſt of their anſwer; and omitting their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
incourages their good intentions; <hi>Ye ſhall drink indeed of my cup, and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
with my baptiſme: but to ſit on my right hand and my left, is not mine to give,
but to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.</hi> I know not whether there be
more mercy in the conceſſion, or ſatisfaction in the denial. Were it not an high
Honour to drink of thy Cup, O Saviour, thou hadſt not fore-promiſed it as a
favour. I am deceived if what thou granteſt were much leſs then that which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
thou denieſt. To pledge thee in thine own Cup, is not much leſs dignity and
familiarity then to ſit by thee. <hi>If we ſuffer with thee, we ſhall alſo reign together
with thee.</hi> What greater promotion can fleſh and blood be capable of, then a
conformity to the Lord of Glory? Enable thou me to drink of thy Cup, and
then ſet me where thou wilt.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> But, O Saviour, whiles thou dignifieſt them in thy grant, doſt thou diſparage
thy ſelf in thy denial? <hi>Not mine to give?</hi> Whoſe is it, if not thine? If it be thy
Fathers, it is thine. Thou, who art Truth, haſt ſaid, <hi>I and my Father are one.</hi>
Yea, becauſe thou art one with the Father, it is not thine to give to any ſave
thoſe for whom it is prepared of the Father. The Father's preparation was
thine, his gift is thine; the Decree of both is one. That eternal counſel is not
alterable upon our vain deſires. The Father gives theſe Heavenly honours to
none but by thee; thou giveſt them to none but according to the Decree of thy
Father. Many degrees there are of celeſtial Happineſs. Thoſe ſupernal Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are not all of an height. That Providence which hath varied our ſtations

not in reſpect of right, but of uſe and preſent fruition; ſo left, that upon juſt

Doubtleſs he was too wiſe to give away his own, that he might borrow of a

him. Of him, as the Houſholder, is the Tribute required; and by and for
him is it alſo paid. I inquire not either into the occaſion, or the ſumme.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> What need we make this exaction ſacrilegious? as if that half-ſhekel which

                  <p>O Saviour, how can thy ſervants challenge that freedome which thy ſelf
had not? who that pretends from thee can claim homage from thoſe to whom
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:44233:98"/>
thou gaveſt it? If thou by whom Kings reign forbareſt not to pay tribute <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
to an heathen Prince, what power under thee can deny it to thoſe that rule for
thee?</p>
                  <p>That demand was made without doors. No ſooner is <hi>Peter</hi> come in, then
he is prevented by his Maſter's queſtion, <hi>What thinkeſt thou, Simon, of whom do

This very interrogation was anſwer enough to that which <hi>Peter</hi> meant to

                  <p>But, O Saviour, may I preſume to ask what this is to thee? Thou haſt ſaid,

the Kings of the earth, or impoſed upon the ſons of earthly Kings? Thou

from the loyns of <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>David:</hi> what ſhould I plead that which thou

the argument is irrefragable and convictive. If the Kings of the earth do ſo
priviledge their children that they are free from all tributes and impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
how much more ſhall the King of Heaven give this immunity to
his onely and natural Son? ſo as in true reaſon I might challenge an exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

no earthly Saintſhip can exempt us from tribute to whom tribute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth.
There is a freedom, O Saviour, which our Chriſtianity cals us to affect;
a freedom from the yoke of ſin and Satan, from the ſervitude of our corrupt
affections: we cannot be Sons if we be not thus free. O free thou us by thy
free Spirit from the miſerable bondage of our Nature, ſo ſhall the children be
free: but as to theſe ſecular duties, no man is leſs free then the children. O

the ſea, or whether by thine Almighty word thou mad'ſt it in an inſtant in the
mouth of that fiſh, it is neither poſſible to determine, nor neceſſary to inquire.
I rather adore thine infinite Knowledge and Power, that couldſt make uſe of

thou didſt this: (though I do not finde that thou ever affectedſt a full purſe.)
What veins of Gold or Mines of Silver did not lye open to thy command?
But out of a deſire to teach <hi>Peter,</hi> that whiles he would be tributary to <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
the very fiſh of the ſea was tributary to him. How ſhould this incourage our

not pleading the merit of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his affection to Chriſt, but the mercy and
favour of Chriſt to him. Even that other reflexion of love had been no weak
motive; for, O Lord, thou haſt ſaid, <hi>Becauſe he hath ſet his love upon me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

profeſſeſt to love them that love thee. But yet the argument is more forcible
from thy love to us; ſince thou haſt juſt reaſon to reſpect every thing of thine
own, more then ought that can proceed from us. Even we weak men, what can
we ſtick at where we love? Thou, O infinite God, art Love it ſelf. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thou haſt done for us is out of thy love: the ground and motive of all thy
mercies is within thy ſelf, not in us; and if there be ought in us worthy of thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
love, it is thine own, not ours; thou giveſt what thou accepteſt. <hi>Jeſus</hi> well
heard the firſt groan of his dear <hi>Lazarus;</hi> every ſhort breath that he drew,
every ſigh that he gave was upon account: yet this Lord of Life lets his
<hi>Lazarus</hi> ſicken, and languiſh, and die; not out of neglect or impotence, but out
of power and reſolution. <hi>This ſickneſs is not to death.</hi> He to whom the iſſues of
death belong, knows the way both into it and out of it. He meant that ſickneſs
ſhould be to death in reſpect of the preſent condition, not to death in reſpect of
the event; to death in the proceſs of Nature, not to death in the ſucceſs of his
Divine power, <hi>that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.</hi> O Saviour, thy

willing thus to hide thy Godhead under the courſe weeds of our Humanity:
but here thou ſaiſt, <hi>That the Son of God might be glorified.</hi> Though thou wouldſt
hide thy Divine glory, yet thou wouldſt not ſmother it. Sometimes thou wouldſt
have thy Sun break forth in bright gleams, to ſhew that it hath no leſs light
even whiles it ſeems kept in by the clouds. Thou wert now near thy Paſſion;

                  <p>Neither didſt thou ſay merely, that God, but, <hi>that the Son of God might be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

                  <p>O God, in vain ſhall we tender our Devotions to thee indefinitely, as to a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

of their diſtreſs, thou heldeſt off two daies more from them? Canſt thou love
thoſe thou regardeſt not? canſt thou regard them from whom thou willingly
abſenteſt thy ſelf in their neceſſity? Behold, thy love as it is above ours, ſo it

upon the heady violence of his enemies? Lo, the ſtones of the Jews drove him
thence: the love of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and the care of his Divine glory drew him back
thither.</p>
                  <p>We may, we muſt be wiſe as ſerpents, for our own preſervation; we muſt be
careleſs of danger when God cals us to the hazard. It is far from God's purpoſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to give us leave ſo farre to reſpect our ſelves, as that we ſhould neglect him. Let
<hi>Judaea</hi> be all ſnares, all croſſes; O Saviour, when thou calleſt us, we muſt put
our lives into our hands, and follow thee thither.</p>
                  <p>This journey thou haſt purpoſed and contrived; but what needeſt thou to
acquaint thy Diſciples with thine intent? Where didſt thou ever (beſides here)
make them of counſel with thy voyages? Neither didſt thou ſay, How think
you if I goe? but, <hi>Let us goe.</hi> Was it for that thou, who kneweſt thine own
ſtrength, kneweſt alſo their weakneſs? Thou wert reſolute, they were timorous:
they were ſenſible enough of their late peril, and fearful of more; there was
need to fore-arm them with an exſpectation of the worſt, and preparation for
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> it. Surpriſal with evils may indanger the beſt conſtancy. The heart is apt to
fail, when it findes it ſelf intrapped in a ſuddain miſchief.</p>
                  <p>The Diſciples were dearly affected to <hi>Lazarus;</hi> they had learned to love
where their Maſter loved: yet now when our Saviour ſpeaks of returning to
that region of peril, they pull him by the ſleeve, and put him in minde of the
violence offered unto him; <hi>Maſter, the Jews of late ſought to ſtone thee, and goeſt
thou thither again?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No leſs then thrice in the fore going Chapter did the Jews lift up their hands
to murder him by a cruel lapidation. Whence was this rage and bloody attempt
of theirs? Onely for that he taught them the truth concerning his Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and gave himſelf the juſt ſtyle of the Son of God. How ſubject carnal
hearts are to be impatient of Heavenly verityes? Nothing can ſo much fret
that malignant ſpirit which rules in thoſe breaſts, as that Chriſt ſhould have his
own. If we be perſecuted for his Truth, we do but <hi>ſuffer with him with whom we
ſhall</hi> once <hi>reign.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However the Diſciples pleaded for their Maſters ſafety, yet they aimed at
their own; they well knew their danger was inwrapped in his. It is but a clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
colour that they put upon their own fear. This is held but a weak and baſe
Paſſion; each one would be glad to put off the opinion of it from himſelf, and
to ſet the beſt face upon his own impotency.</p>

our friend. Lo, he ſaies not, my friend, but <hi>ours;</hi> to draw them firſt into a

                  </p>
                  <p>Oh meek and merciful Saviour, that diſdaineſt not to ſtoop ſo low, as that

no diſparagement to match thy ſelf with weak and wretched men! <hi>Our

Love where is the moſt inequality; but friendſhip ſuppoſes pairs: yet the
Son of God ſaies of the ſons of men, <hi>Our friend Lazarus.</hi> Oh what an
high and happy condition is this for mortal men to aſpire unto, that the
God of Heaven ſhould not be aſhamed to own them for friends! Neither
ſaith he now abruptly, <hi>Lazarus</hi> our friend is dead; but, <hi>Lazarus our friend
ſleepeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O Saviour, none can know the eſtate of life or death ſo well as thou that
art the Lord of both. It is enough that thou telleſt us death is no other then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
ſleep: that which was wont to paſs for the cozen of death, is now it ſelf.
All this while we have miſtaken the caſe of our diſſolution: we took it for
an enemy, it proves a friend; there is pleaſure in that wherein we ſuppoſed
horror.</p>
                  <p>Who is affraid after the weary toiles of the day, to take his reſt by night?
or what is more refreſhing to the ſpent traveller then a ſweet ſleep? It is
our infidelity, our impreparation that makes death any other then advantage.
Even ſo, Lord, when thou ſeeſt I have toiled enough, let me ſleep in peace:
and when thou ſeeſt I have ſlept enough, awake me, as thou didſt thy <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;
But I goe to awake him.</hi> Thou ſaidſt not, Let us goe to awake him:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
thoſe whom thou wilt allow companions of thy way, thou wilt not allow
partners of thy work; they may be witneſſes, they cannot be actors. None
can awake <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of this ſleep but he that made <hi>Lazarus.</hi> Every mouſe
or gnat can raiſe us up from that other ſleep; none but an Omnipotent power
from this. This ſleep is not without a diſſolution. Who can command
the Soul to come down and meet the body, or command the body to piece
with it ſelf and riſe up to the Soul, but the God that created both? It is
our comfort and aſſurance (O Lord) againſt the terrors of death and tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the grave, that our Reſurrection depends upon none but thine Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>

                  <p>Who can blame the Diſciples if they were loath to return to <hi>Judaea?</hi>
Their laſt entertainment was ſuch as might juſtly diſhearten them. Were
this (as literally taken) all the reaſon of our Saviours purpoſe of ſo perilous
a voyage, they argued not amiſs, <hi>If he ſleep, he ſhall doe well.</hi> Sleep in ſickneſs

Yet it doth not alwaies follow, <hi>If he ſleep, he ſhall doe well:</hi> How many

                  <p>Wherefore are words but to expreſs meanings? why do we ſpeak but to
be underſtood? Since then our Saviour ſaw himſelf not rightly conſtrued,
he delivers himſelf planly, <hi>Lazarus is dead.</hi> Such is thy manner, O thou eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Word of thy Father, in all thy ſacred expreſſions. Thine own mouth is
thy beſt commentary: what thou haſt more obſcurely ſaid in one paſſage, thou
interpreteſt more clearly in another. Thou art the Sun, which giveſt us that
light whereby we ſee thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But how modeſtly doſt thou diſcover thy Deity to thy Diſciples? not upon
the firſt mention of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his death, inſtantly profeſſing thy Power and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> will of his reſuſcitation; but contenting thy ſelf only to intimate thy Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
in that thou couldſt in that abſence and diſtance know and report
his departure, they ſhall gather the reſt, and cannot chuſe but think, We
ſerve a Maſter that knows all things, and he that knows all things can
doe all things.</p>
                  <p>The abſence of our Saviour from the death-bed of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual,
but voluntary; yea, he is not only willing with it, but glad of it; <hi>I am
glad for your ſakes that I was not there.</hi> How contrary may the affections of
Chriſt and ours be, and yet be both good? The two worthy Siſters were much
grieved at our Saviours abſence, as doubting it might ſavour of ſome neglect;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Chriſt was glad of it, for the advantage of his Diſciples Faith. I cannot
blame them that they were thus ſorry; I cannot but bleſs him that he was
thus glad. The gain of their Faith in ſo Divine a Miracle was more then could
be countervailed by their momentany ſorrow. God and we are not alike affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with the ſame events; He laughs where we mourn, he is angry where
we are pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>The difference of the affections ariſes from the difference of the Objects,
which Chriſt and they apprehend in the ſame occurrence. Why are the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters

glad he was not there? for the benefit which he ſaw would accrew to their
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Faith. There is much variety of proſpect in every act, according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
intentions and iſſues thereof, yea even in the very ſame eyes. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſees his ſon combating in a Duel for his Country; he ſees blows and
wounds on the one ſide, he ſees renown and victory on the other: he
grieves at the wounds, he rejoyces in the Honour. Thus doth God in all
our Afflictions: he ſees our teares, and hears our groans, and pities us; but
withall he looks upon our Patience, our Faith, our Crown, and is glad that we
are afflicted.</p>
                  <p>O God, why ſhould not we conform our diet unto thine? When we ly in
pain and extremity, we cannot but droop under it; but do we finde our ſelves
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> increaſed in true Mortification, in Patience, in Hope, in a conſtant relyance on
thy Mercies? Why are we not more joyed in this then dejected with the
other? ſince the leaſt grain of the increaſe of Grace is more worth then can be
equalled with whole pounds of bodily vexation.</p>
                  <p>O ſtrange conſequence! <hi>Lazarus is dead;</hi> nevertheleſs, <hi>Let us goe unto him.</hi>
Muſt they not needs think, What ſhould we doe with a dead man? What

                  <p>Even thoſe that write the longeſt and moſt paſſionate dates of their amity,

a friend may follow us, and ſee us beſtowed in this houſe of our Age; but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
there he leaves us to our worms and duſt. But for thee, O Saviour, the grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
the earth, the coffin are no bounders of thy dear reſpects; even after
death, and burial, and corruption thou art graciouſly affected to thoſe thou

This Conference hath yet taught her more, and raiſed her heart to
an expectation of ſome wonderful effect. And now ſhe ſtands not ſtill, but
haſtes back into the Village to her Siſter; carried thither by the two wings

be to her Siſter: yet ſhe doth not ring it out aloud in the open Hall, but ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
whiſpers this pleaſing tidings in her Siſters eare, <hi>The Maſter is come and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:44233:101"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> calleth for thee.</hi> Whether out of modeſty, or diſcretion. It is not fit for a
woman to be loud and clamorous: nothing beſeems that Sex better then ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and baſhfulneſs; as not to be too much ſeen, ſo not to be heard too farre.
Neither did Modeſty more charm her tongue then Diſcretion; whether in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the gueſts, or to Chriſt himſelf. Had thoſe gueſts heard of Chriſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there, they had either out of fear or prejudice withdrawn themſelves from
him; neither durſt they have been witneſſes of that wonderful Miracle, as
being over-awed with that Jewiſh edict which was out againſt him: or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they had withheld the Siſters from going to him, againſt whom they
knew how highly their Governors were incenſed. Neither was ſhe ignorant
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of the danger of his own perſon, ſo lately before aſſaulted violently by his
enemies at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> She knew they were within the ſmoak of that bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
City, the neſt of his enemies; ſhe holds it not therefore fit to make open
proclamation of Chriſts preſence, but rounds her Siſter ſecretly in the eare.
Chriſtianity doth not bid us abate any thing of our warineſs and honeſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies;
yea it requires us to have no leſs of the Serpent then of the
Dove.</p>
                  <p>There is a time when we muſt preach Chriſt on the houſe-top; there is a
time when we muſt ſpeak him in the eare, and (as it were) with our lips ſhut.
Secrecy hath no leſs uſe then Divulgation. She ſaid enough, <hi>The Maſter is
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> come, and calleth for thee.</hi> What an happy word was this which was here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken?
what an high favour is this that is done; that the Lord of Life ſhould
perſonally come and call for <hi>Mary?</hi> yet ſuch as is not appropriated to her.
Thou comeſt to us ſtill, O Saviour, if not in thy bodily preſence, yet in thy
ſpiritual; thou calleſt us ſtill, if not in thy perſonall voice, yet in thine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.
It is our fault, if we doe not as this good woman, ariſe quickly, and come
to thee. Her friends were there about her, who came purpoſely to condole
with her; her heart was full of heavineſs: yet ſo ſoon as ſhe hears mention of
Chriſt, ſhe forgets friends, Brother, grief, cares, thoughts, and haſts to his
preſence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Still was <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſtanding in the place where <hi>Martha</hi> left him. Whether it be
noted to expreſs <hi>Marie</hi>'s ſpeed, or his own wiſe and gratious reſolutions; his
preſence in the Village had perhaps invited danger, and ſet off the intended
witneſſes of the work: or it may be to ſet forth his zealous deſire to diſpatch
the errand he came for; that as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faithful ſervant would not receive
any curteſie from the houſe of <hi>Bethuel,</hi> till he had done his Maſters buſineſs
concerning <hi>Rebeccah,</hi> ſo thou, O Saviour, wouldſt not ſo much as enter into the
houſe of theſe two Siſters in <hi>Bethany,</hi> till thou hadſt effected this glorious work
which occaſioned thee thither. It was thy <hi>meat and drink to doe the will of
thy Father;</hi> thy beſt Entertainment was within thy ſelf. How do we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thee, if we ſuffer either pleaſures or profits to take the wall of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices?</p>
                  <p>So good women were well worthy of kinde friends. No doubt <hi>Bethany,</hi>
being not two miles diſtant from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> could not but be furniſhed with
good acquaintance from the City: theſe knowing the dearneſs, and hearing of
the death of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> came over to comfort the ſad Siſters. Charity together
with the common practice of that Nation calls them to this duty. All our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes
exſpect theſe good offices from thoſe that love us; but of all others
Death, as that which is the extremeſt of evils, and makes the moſt fearful ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock
in families, cities, kingdomes, worlds. The complaint was grievous, <hi>I look'd
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> for ſome to comfort me, but there was none.</hi> It is ſome kinde of eaſe to ſorrow, to
have partners; as a burden is lightned by many ſhoulders; or as clouds ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into many drops, eaſily vent their moiſture into aire. Yea the very preſence
of friends abates grief. The peril that ariſes to the heart from Paſſion is the
fixedneſs of it, when, like a corroſiving plaiſter, it eates in into the ſore. Some
kinde of remedy it is, that it may breathe out in good ſociety.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:44233:102"/>
Theſe friendly neighbours ſeeing <hi>Mary</hi> haſten forth, make haſte to follow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
her. <hi>Martha</hi> went forth before; I ſaw none goe after her: <hi>Mary</hi> ſtirs; they
are at her heels. Was it for that <hi>Martha</hi> being the elder Siſter, and the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
of the family, might ſtirre about with leſs obſervation? or was it that
<hi>Mary</hi> was the more paſſionate, and needed the more heedy attendance? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
their care and intentiveneſs is truely commendable; they came to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
her, they doe what they came for. It contents them not to ſit ſtill and
chat within doores, but they wait on her at all turns. Perturbations of Minde
are diſeaſes: good keepers do not only tend the Patient in bed, but when he
ſits up, when he tries to walk; all his motions have their careful aſſiſtance.
We are no true friends, if our endeavours of the redreſs of diſtempers in them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
we love be not aſſiduous and unweariable.</p>
                  <p>It was but a loving ſuſpicion, <hi>She is gone to the grave to weep there.</hi> They
well knew how apt paſſionate mindes are to take all occaſions to renew their
ſorrow; every Object affects them. When ſhe ſaw but the Chamber of her dead
Brother, ſtraight ſhe thinks, there <hi>Lazarus</hi> was wont to lye, and then ſhe wept
afreſh; when the Table, There <hi>Lazarus</hi> was wont to ſit, and then new teares
ariſe; when the Garden, There <hi>Lazarus</hi> had wont to walk, and now again ſhe
weeps. How much more do theſe friends ſuppoſe the Paſſions would be ſtirred
with the ſight of the Grave, when ſhe muſt needs think, There is <hi>Lazarus?</hi> O
Saviour, if the place of the very dead corps of our friend have power to draw <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
our hearts thither, and to affect us more deeply; how ſhould our hearts be
drawn to and affected with Heaven, where thou ſitteſt at the right hand of thy
Father? There (O thou <hi>which wert dead and art alive</hi>) is thy body and thy
Soul preſent, and united to thy glorious Deity. Thither, O thither let our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
be; not to mourn there, (where is no place for ſorrow) but to rejoyce with
joy unſpeakable and glorious, and more and more to long for that thy beatifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
preſence.</p>
                  <p>Their indulgent love miſtook <hi>Marie</hi>'s errand; their thoughts (how kind
ſoever) were much too low: whiles they ſuppoſed ſhe went to a dead Brother,
ſhe went to a living Saviour. The world hath other conceits of the actions and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
carriage of the regenerate then are truely intended, ſetting ſuch conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon them as their own carnal reaſon ſuggeſts: they think them dying,
when behold they live; ſorrowful, when they are alwaies rejoycing; poor,
whiles they make many rich. How juſtly do we appeal from them as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent
Judges, and pity thoſe miſinterpretations which we cannot avoid?</p>
                  <p>Both the Siſters met Chriſt; not both in one poſture: <hi>Mary</hi> is ſtill noted
as for more Paſſion, ſo for more Devotion; ſhe that before ſate at the feet of
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> now falls at his feet. That preſence had wont to be familiar to her, and
not without ſome outward homelineſs; now it fetches her upon her knees, in
an awful veneration: whether out of a reverend acknowledgment of the ſecret <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
excellency and power of Chriſt; or out of a dumb intimation of that ſuit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
her dead Brother, which ſhe was afraid to utter. The very geſture it
ſelf was ſupplicatory. What poſition of body can be ſo fit for us, when we
make our addreſs to our Saviour? It is an irreligious unmannerlineſs for us to
goe leſs. Where the heart is affected with an awful acknowledgement of Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
the body cannot but bow.</p>
                  <p>Even before all her neighbours of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> doth <hi>Mary</hi> thus fall down at the
feet of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> ſo many witneſſes as ſhe had, ſo many ſpies ſhe had of that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
obſervance. It was no leſs then Excommunication for any body to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
him: yet good <hi>Mary,</hi> not fearing the informations that might be given by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
thoſe Jewiſh Goſſips, adores him; and in her ſilent geſture ſaies, as much as
her Siſter had ſpoken before, <hi>Thou art the Chriſt, the Son of God.</hi> Thoſe that
would give Chriſt his right, muſt not ſtand upon ſcrupulous fears. Are we na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
timorous? Why do we not fear the denial, the excluſion of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
<hi>Without ſhall be the fearfull.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:44233:102"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Her humble proſtration is ſeconded by a lamentable complaint; <hi>Lord, if thou
hadſt been here, my brother had not died.</hi> The Siſters are both in one mind, both in
one ſpeech; and both of them in one ſpeech bewray both ſtrength and infirmity:
ſtrength of Faith, in aſcribing ſo much power to Chriſt, that his preſence could
preſerve from death; infirmity, in ſuppoſing the neceſſity of a preſence for this
purpoſe. Why, <hi>Mary,</hi> could not thine Omnipotent Saviour as well in abſence
have commanded <hi>Lazarus</hi> to live? Is his hand ſo ſhort, that he can doe nothing
but by contaction? If his Power were finite, how could he have forbidden the
ſeizure of death? if infinite, how could it be limited to place, or hindered by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance?
It is a weakneſs of Faith to meaſure ſucceſs by means, and means by
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> preſence, and to tye effects to both, when we deal with an Almighty agent. Finite
cauſes work within their own ſphere; all places are equally near, and all effects
equally eaſie to the infinite. O Saviour, whiles thou now ſitteſt gloriouſly in
Heaven, thou doſt no leſs impart thy ſelf unto us then if thou ſtoodſt viſibly
by us, then if we ſtood locally by thee: no place can make difference of thy
virtue and aid.</p>
                  <p>This was <hi>Mary</hi>'s moan; no motion, no requeſt ſounded from her to her
Saviour. Her ſilent ſuit is returned with a mute anſwer; no notice is taken of
her error. Oh that marvellous mercy that connives at our faulty infirmities! All
the reply that I hear of is, a compaſſionate groan within himſelf. O bleſſed
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                     <hi>Jeſu,</hi> thou that wert free from all ſin, wouldſt not be free from ſtrong
affections. Wiſdome and Holineſs ſhould want much work, if even vehement
paſſions might not be quitted from offence. <hi>Mary</hi> wept; her tears drew on
tears from her friends; all their tears united drew groans from thee. Even
in thine Heaven thou doſt no leſs pity our ſorrows: thy glory is free from
groans, but abounds with compaſſion and mercy: if we be not ſparing of our
tears, thou canſt not be inſenſible of our ſorrows. How ſhall we imitate thee,
if, like our looking-glaſs, we do not anſwer tears, and weep on them that weep
upon us?</p>
                  <p>Lord, thou kneweſt (in abſence) that <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead, and doſt thou not
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> know where he was buried? Surely thou wert further off when thou ſawſt
and reportedſt his death, then thou wert from the grave thou inquiredſt of;
thou that kneweſt all things, yet askeſt what thou knoweſt, <hi>Where have ye laid
him?</hi> Not out of need, but out of will: that as in thy ſorrow, ſo in thy queſtion
thou mighteſt depreſs thy ſelf in the opinion of the beholders for the time, that
the glory of thine inſtant Miracle might be the greater, the leſs it was exſpected.
It had been all one to thy Omnipotence to have made a new <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
or in that remoteneſs to have commanded <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whereſoever he was,
to come forth: but thou wert neither willing to work more miracle then was
requiſite, nor yet unwilling to fix the minds of the people upon the exſpectation
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of ſome marvellous thing that thou meanteſt to work; and therefore askeſt,
<hi>Where have you laid him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are not more glad of the queſtion, then ready for the anſwer; <hi>Come and
ſee.</hi> It was the manner of the Jews, as likewiſe of thoſe <hi>Egyptians</hi> among whom
they had ſojourned, to lay up the dead bodies of their friends with great reſpect;
more coſt was wont to be beſtowed on ſome of their graves then on their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
as neither aſhamed then, nor unwilling to ſhew the decency of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulture,
they ſay, <hi>Come and ſee.</hi> More was hoped for from Chriſt then a mere
view; they meant and exſpected that his eye ſhould draw him on to ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
action. O Saviour, whiles we deſire our ſpiritual reſuſcitation, how ſhould
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> we labour to bring thee to our grave? how ſhould we lay open our deadneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee, and bewray to thee our impotence and ſenſeleſneſs? Come, Lord, and
ſee what a miſerable carkaſs I am; and by the power of thy mercy raiſe me from
the ſtate of my corruption.</p>
                  <p>Never was our Saviour more ſubmiſly dejected then now immediately
before he would approve and exalt the Majeſty of his Godhead. To his
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:44233:103"/>
groans and inward grief he adds his tears. Anone they ſhall confeſs him a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
God; theſe expreſſions of Paſſions ſhall onwards evince him to be a man. The
Jews conſtrue this well, <hi>See how he loved him.</hi> Never did any thing but love
fetch tears from Chriſt. But they do foully miſconſtrue Chriſt in the other;
<hi>Could not he that opened the eyes of him that was born blinde, have cauſed that
even this man ſhould not have died?</hi> Yes, know ye, O vain and importune
queſtioniſts, that he could have done it with eaſe. To open the eyes of a man
born blind was more then to keep a ſick man from dying: this were but to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
and maintain Nature from decaying; that were to create a new ſenſe, and
to reſtore a deficiency in Nature. To make an eye was no whit leſs difficult then
to make a man: he that could doe the greater might well have done the leſs.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
Ye ſhall ſoon ſee this was not for want of power. Had ye ſaid, Why would he
not? why did he not? the queſtion had been fairer, and the anſwer no leſs eaſie;
For his own greater glory. Little do ye know the drift whether of God's acts,
or delaies; and ye know as much as you are worthy. Let it be ſufficient for you
to underſtand that he who can doe all things, will doe that which ſhall be moſt
for his own honour.</p>
                  <p>It is not improbable that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who before groaned in himſelf for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
of their tears, now groaned for their incredulity. Nothing could ſo
much afflict the Saviour of men as the ſins of men. Could their external wrongs
to his body have been ſeparated from offence againſt his Divine perſon, their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
ſcornful indignities had not ſo much affected him. No injury goes ſo deep as our
ſpiritual provocations of our God. Wretched men! why ſhould we grieve the
good Spirit of God in us? why ſhould we make him groan for us that died to
redeem us?</p>
                  <p>With theſe groans, O Saviour, thou cameſt to the grave of <hi>Lazarus.</hi> The
door of that houſe of Death was ſtrong and impenetrable. Thy firſt word was,
<hi>Take away the ſtone.</hi> Oh weak beginning of a mighty Miracle! If thou meanteſt
to raiſe the dead, how much more eaſie had it been for thee to remove the
grave-ſtone? One grain of Faith in thy very Diſciples was enough to remove
mountains; and doſt thou ſay, <hi>Take away the ſtone?</hi> I wis, there was a greater <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
weight that lay upon the body of <hi>Lazarus</hi> then the ſtone of his Tomb; the
weight of Death and Corruption: a thouſand rocks and hils were not ſo heavy
a load as this alone: why then doſt thou ſtick at this ſhovel-full? Yea, how
eaſie had it been for thee to have brought up the body of <hi>Lazarus</hi> through
the ſtone, by cauſing that marble to give way by a ſudden rarefaction? But thou
thoughteſt beſt to make uſe of their hands rather: whether for their own more
full conviction; for had the ſtone been taken away by thy Followers, and <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
thereupon walked forth, this might have appeared to thy malignant ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to have been a ſet match betwixt thee, the Diſciples and <hi>Lazarus:</hi> or
whether for the exerciſe of our Faith, that thou mighteſt teach us to truſt thee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
under contrary appearances. Thy command to remove the ſtone ſeemed to
argue an impotence; ſtraight that ſeeming weakneſs breaks forth into an act of
Omnipotent power. The homelieſt ſhows of thine humane infirmity are ever
ſeconded with ſome mighty proofs of thy Godhead; and thy Miracle is ſo much
more wondred at, by how much it was leſs exſpected.</p>
                  <p>It was ever thy juſt will that we ſhould doe what we may. To remove the
ſtone or to untie the napkin was in their power; this they muſt doe: to raiſe
the dead was out of their power; this therefore thou wilt doe alone. Our hands
muſt doe their utmoſt, ere thou wilt put to thine.</p>
                  <p>O Saviour, we are all dead and buried in the grave of our ſinfull Nature. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
ſtone of obſtination muſt be taken away from our hearts, ere we can hear thy
reviving voice: we can no more remove this ſtone then dead <hi>Lazarus</hi> could
remove his; we can adde more weight to our graves. O let thy faithful agents
by the power of thy Law, and the grace of thy Goſpel take off the ſtone, that
thy voice may enter into the grave of miſerable corruption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:44233:103"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Was it a modeſt kinde of mannerlineſs in <hi>Martha,</hi> that ſhe would not have
Chriſt annoyed with the ill ſent of that ſtale carcaſs? or was it out of diſtruſt of
reparation, ſince her brother had paſſed all the degrees of corruption, that ſhe
ſaies, <hi>Lord, by this time he ſtinketh, for he hath been dead four daies?</hi> He that
underſtood hearts, found ſomewhat amiſs in that intimation; his anſwer had not
endeavored to rectifie that which was utterly faultleſs. I fear the good woman
meant to object this as a likely obſtacle to any further purpoſes or proceedings
of Chriſt. Weak faith is ſtill apt to lay blocks of difficulties in the way of the
great works of God.</p>
                  <p>Four days were enough to make any corps noiſome. Death it ſelf is not
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> unſavory; immediately upon diſſolution the body retains the wonted ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
it is the continuance under death that is thus offenſive. Neither is it
otherwiſe in our Spiritual condition: the longer we lie under our ſin, the more
rotten and corrupt we are. He who upon the freſh commiſſion of his ſin reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
himſelf by a ſpeedy repentance, yields no ill ſent to the noſtrils of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.
The Candle that is preſently blown in again offends not; it is the ſnuffe
which continues choaked with its own moiſture that ſends up unwholſome
and odious fumes. O Saviour, thou wouldſt yield to death, thou wouldſt not
yield to corruption: Ere the fourth day thou wert riſen again. I cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
many deadly foils; but oh, do thou raiſe me up again ere I ſhall paſs the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> degrees of rottenneſs in my ſins and treſpaſſes.</p>
                  <p>They that laid their hands to the ſtone doubtleſs held now ſtill awhile, and
looked one while on Chriſt, another while upon <hi>Martha,</hi> to hear what iſſue of
reſolution would follow upon ſo important an objection: when they finde a
light touch of taxation to <hi>Martha, Said not I to thee, that if thou wouldſt believe,
thou ſhouldſt ſee the glory of God?</hi> That holy woman had before profeſſed her
belief, as Chriſt had profeſſed his great intentions; both were now forgotten:
and now our Saviour is fain to revive both her memory and Faith; <hi>Said not I to
thee?</hi> The beſt of all Saints are ſubject to fits of unbelief and oblivion; the onely
remedy whereof muſt be the inculcation of Gods merciful promiſes of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and ſupportation. O God, if thou haſt ſaid it, I dare believe; I dare caſt my
Soul upon the belief of every word of thine. <hi>Faithfull art thou which haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, who wilt alſo doe it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſpight of all the unjuſt diſcouragements of Nature we muſt obey Chriſt's
command. Whatever <hi>Martha</hi> ſuggeſts, they remove the ſtone, and may now ſee
and ſmell him dead, whom they ſhall ſoon ſee revived. The ſent of the corps
is not ſo unpleaſing to them, as the perfume of their obedience is ſweet to
Chriſt. And now when all impediments are removed, and all hearts ready for
the work, our Saviour addreſſes to the Miracle.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>eyes</hi> begin; they are <hi>lift up</hi> to Heaven. It was the malicious miſ-ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of his enemies, that he lookt down to <hi>Beelzebub:</hi> the beholders ſhall now
ſee whence he exſpects and derives his power; and ſhall by him learn whence
to exſpect and hope for all ſucceſs. The heart and the eye muſt goe together:
he that would have ought to doe with God, muſt be ſequeſtred and lifted up
from earth.</p>
                  <p>His Tongue ſeconds his Eye; <hi>Father.</hi> Nothing more ſtuck in the ſtomack
of the Jews, then that Chriſt called himſelf the Son of God; this was imputed
to him for a Blaſphemy, worthy of ſtones. How ſeaſonably is this word ſpoken
in the hearing of theſe Jews, in whoſe ſight he will be preſently approved ſo?
How can ye now, O ye cavillers, except at that title which ye ſhall ſee irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragably
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> juſtified? Well may he call God Father, that can raiſe the dead out of
the grave. In vain ſhall ye ſnarle at the ſtyle, when ye are convinced of
the effect.</p>
                  <p>I hear of no Prayer, but a Thanks for hearing. Whiles thou ſaidſt nothing,
O Saviour, how doth thy Father hear thee? Was it not with thy Father and
thee, as it was with thee and <hi>Moſes?</hi> Thou ſaidſt, <hi>Let me alone Moſes,</hi> when
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:44233:104"/>
he ſpake not. Thy will was thy Prayer. Words expreſs our hearts to men,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
Thoughts to God. Well didſt thou know, out of the ſelf-fameneſs of thy will
with thy Fathers, that if thou didſt but think in thine heart that <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
ſhould riſe, he was now raiſed. It was not for thee to pray vocally and
audibly, leſt thoſe captious hearers ſhould ſay, thou didſt all by intreaty,
nothing by power. Thy thanks overtake thy deſires; ours require time and
diſtance: our thanks ariſe from the Echo of our prayers reſounding from
Heaven to our hearts; Thou, becauſe thou art at once in earth and Heaven,

                  <p>Now ye cavilling Jews are thinking ſtraight, Is there ſuch diſtance betwixt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
the Father and the Son? is it ſo rare a thing for the Son to be heard, that he
pours out his thanks for it as a bleſſing unuſual? Do ye not now ſee that he
who made your heart, knows it, and anticipates your fond thoughts with the
ſame breath? <hi>I knew that thou heareſt me alwaies; but I ſaid this for their ſakes,
that they might believe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Merciful Saviour, how can we enough admire thy goodneſs, who makeſt
our belief the ſcope and drift of thy doctrine and actions! Alas, what
wert thou the better if they believed thee ſent from God? what wert thou
the worſe if they believed it not? Thy perfection and glory ſtands not
upon the ſlippery terms of our approbation or diſlike; but is real in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
thy ſelf, and that infinite, without poſſibility of our increaſe or diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
We, we onely are they that have either the gain or loſs in thy receit or
rejection: yet ſo doſt thou affect our belief, as if it were more thine advantage
then ours.</p>
                  <p>O Saviour, whiles thou ſpak'ſt to thy Father, thou liftedſt up thine eyes;
now thou art to ſpeak unto dead <hi>Lazarus,</hi> thou liftedſt up thy voice, and <hi>criedſt
aloud, Lazarus, come forth.</hi> Was it that the ſtrength of the voice might anſwer
to the ſtrength of the affection? ſince we faintly require what we care not to
obtain, and vehemently utter what we earneſtly deſire. Was it that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the voice might anſwer to the greatneſs of the work? Was it that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
hearers might be witneſſes of what words were uſed in ſo miraculous an act;
no magical incantations, but authoritative and Divine commands? Was it to
ſignifie that <hi>Lazarus</hi> his Soule was called from farre? the ſpeech muſt be loud
that ſhall be heard in another world. Was it in relation to the eſtate of the
body of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whom thou hadſt reported to ſleep; ſince thoſe that are in a
deep and dead ſleep cannot be awaked without a loud call? Or was it in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
of that loud voice of the laſt Trumpet, which ſhall ſound into all
graves, and raiſe all fleſh from their duſt?</p>
                  <p>Even ſo ſtill, Lord, when thou wouldſt raiſe a Soul from the death of ſin and
grave of corruption, no eaſie voice will ſerve. Thy ſtrongeſt commands, thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
loudeſt denunciations of Judgements, the ſhrilleſt and ſweeteſt promulgations
of thy Mercies, are but enough.</p>
                  <p>How familiar a word is this, <hi>Lazarus, come forth?</hi> no other then he was wont
to uſe whiles they lived together. Neither doth he ſay, <hi>Lazarus,</hi> revive; but, as
if he ſuppoſed him already living, <hi>Lazarus, come forth:</hi> To let them know, that
thoſe who are dead to us, are to and with him alive; yea in a more entire and
feeling ſociety, then whiles they carried their clay about them. Why do I fear
that ſeparation which ſhall more unite me to my Saviour?</p>
                  <p>Neither was the word more familiar then commanding, <hi>Lazarus, come forth,</hi>
Here is no ſuit to his Father, no adjuration to the deceaſed, but a flat and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
injunction, <hi>Come forth.</hi> O Saviour, that is the voice that I ſhall once hear
ſounding into the bottome of my grave, and raiſing me up out of my duſt; that
is the voice that ſhall pierce the rocks, and divide the mountains, and fetch up
the dead out of the loweſt deeps. Thy word made all; thy word ſhall repair all.
Hence, all ye diffident fears; he whom I truſt is Omnipotent.</p>
                  <p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> It was the Jewiſh faſhion to enwrap the corps in linen, to tye the hands and
feet, and to cover the face of the dead. The Fall of man (beſides weakneſs)
brought ſhame upon him; ever ſince, even whiles he lives, the whole Body
is covered; but the Face, becauſe ſome ſparks of that extinct Majeſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
there, is wont to be left open. In death (all thoſe poor remainders be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gone, and leaving deformity and gaſtlineſs in the room of them) the Face
is covered alſo.</p>
                  <p>There lies <hi>Lazarus</hi> bound in double fetters: One Almighty word hath
looſed both; and now <hi>he that was bound came forth.</hi> He whoſe power could
not be hindred by the chains of death, cannot be hindred by linen bonds: He
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that gave life, gave motion, gave direction: He that guided the Soul of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>
into the body, guided the body of <hi>Lazarus</hi> without his eyes, moved the
feet without the full liberty of his regular paces: no doubt the ſame power
ſlackned thoſe ſwathing-bands of death, that the feet might have ſome little
ſcope to move, though not with that freedome that followed after. Thou didſt
not onely, O Saviour, raiſe the body of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> but the Faith of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders.
They cannot deny him dead, whom they ſaw riſing; they ſee the
ſignes of death, with the proofs of life. Thoſe very ſwathes convinced him
to be the man that was raiſed. Thy leſs Miracle confirms the greater; both
confirm the Faith of the beholders. O clear and irrefragable example of our
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> reſuſcitation! Say now, ye ſhameleſs <hi>Sadducees,</hi> with what face can ye deny the
Reſurrection of the body, when ye ſee <hi>Lazarus</hi> after four-days death riſing
up out of his grave? And if <hi>Lazarus</hi> did thus ſtart up at the bleating of this
Lamb of God, that was now every day preparing for the ſlaughter-houſe;
how ſhall the dead be rouzed up out of their graves by the roaring of that
glorious and immortal Lion, whoſe voice ſhall ſhake the powers of Heaven, and
move the very foundations of the earth?</p>
                  <p>With what ſtrange amazedneſs do we think that <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> the
Jews and the Diſciples lookt to ſee <hi>Lazarus</hi> come forth in his winding-ſheet,
ſhackled with his linen fetters, and walk towards them? Doubtleſs fear and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> horrour ſtrove in them, whether ſhould be for the time more predominant.
We love our friends dearly; but to ſee them again after their known
death, and that in the very robes of the grave, muſt needs ſet up the hair in a
kinde of uncouth rigour. And now, though it had been moſt eaſie for him
that brake the adamantine fetters of death, to have broke in pieces thoſe
linen ligaments wherewith his raiſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> was encumbred; yet he will not
doe it but by their hands. He that ſaid, <hi>Remove the ſtone,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Looſe Lazarus.</hi>
He will not have us exſpect his immediate help in that we can doe for our
ſelves. It is both a lazineſs, and a preſumptuous tempting of God, to look for
and extraordinary and ſupernatural help from God, where he hath inabled us
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> with common aid.</p>
                  <p>What ſtrange ſalutations do we think there were betwixt <hi>Lazarus</hi> and
Chriſt that had raiſed him; betwixt <hi>Lazarus</hi> and his Siſters and neighbors and
friends? what amazed looks? what unuſual complements? For <hi>Lazarus</hi> was
himſelf at once: here was no leiſure of degrees to reduce him to his wonted
perfection; neither did he ſtay to rub his eyes, and ſtretch his benummed lims,
nor take time to put off that dead ſleep wherewith he had been ſeized; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
he is both alive, and freſh, and vigorous: if they do but let him goe, he
walks ſo as if he had ailed nothing, and receives and gives mutual gratulations.
I leave them entertaining each other with glad embraces, with diſcourſes of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> reciprocal admiration, with praiſes and adorations of that God and Saviour
that had fetched him into life.</p>

Wherein yet, O Saviour, whether ſhall I more wonder
at thy Majeſty, or thine Humility; that Divine Majeſty which lay hid under ſo
humble appearance, or that ſincere Humility which veiled ſo great a glory?
Thou, O Lord, whoſe <hi>chariots are twenty thouſand, even thouſands of Angels,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
wouldſt make choice of the ſillieſt of beaſts to carry thee in thy laſt and Royal
Progreſs. How well is thy birth ſuited with thy triumph? Even that very
Aſs whereon thou rodeſt was propheſied of; neither couldſt thou have made
up thoſe vaticall Predictions without this conveyance. O glorious, and yet
homely pomp!</p>
                  <p>Thou wouldſt not loſe ought of thy right; thou that waſt a King, wouldſt be
proclaimed ſo: but that it might appear thy Kingdome was not of this world,
thou that couldſt have commanded all worldly magnificence, thoughteſt fit to
abandon it.</p>
                  <p>In ſtead of the Kings of the earth, who reigning by thee might have been <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
imployed in thine attendance, the people are thine heralds; their homely gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are thy foot-cloth and carpets; their green boughs the ſtrewings of thy
way; thoſe Palms which were wont to be born in the hands of them that
triumph, are ſtrewed under the feet of thy beaſt. It was thy greatneſs
and honour to contemn thoſe glories which worldly hearts were wont to
admire.</p>
                  <p>Juſtly did thy Followers hold the beſt ornaments of the earth worthy of no
better then thy treading upon; neither could they ever account their garments
ſo rich, as when they had been trampled upon by thy carriage. How happily
did they think their backs diſrobed for thy way? How gladly did they ſpend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
their breath in acclaming thee? <hi>Hoſanna to the Son of David: Bleſſed is he that
cometh in the name of the Lord.</hi> Where now are the great Maſters of the
Synagogue, that had enacted the ejection of whoſoever ſhould confeſs <hi>Jeſus</hi> to

proclaim him in the publick road, in the open ſtreets. In vain ſhall the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
enemies of Chriſt hope to ſuppreſs his glory: as ſoon ſhall they with
their hand hide the face of the Sun from ſhining to the world, as withhold
the beams of his Divine truth from the eyes of men by their envious oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.
In ſpight of all Jewiſh malignity, his Kingdome is confeſſed, applauded,

                  </p>
                  <p>O thou fairer then the children of men, in thy Majeſty ride on proſperouſly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of truth and meekneſs and righteouſneſs: and thy right hand ſhall teach thee
terrible things.</p>
                  <p>In this Princely (and yet poor and deſpicable) pomp doth our Saviour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the famous City of <hi>Jeruſalem; Jeruſalem</hi> noted of old for the ſeat of
Kings, Prieſts, Prophets: of Kings, for there was the throne of <hi>David;</hi> of
Prieſts, for there was the Temple; of Prophets, for there they delivered their
errands, and left their blood. Neither know I whether it were more wonder
for a Prophet to periſh out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or to be ſafe there. Thither would
<hi>Jeſus</hi> come as a King, as a Prieſt, as a Prophet: acclamed as a King; teaching <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
the people, and foretelling the wofull vaſtation of it, as a Prophet; and as a
Prieſt taking poſſeſſion of his Temple, and vindicating it from the foul pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanations
of Jewiſh Sacriledge. Oft before had he come to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> without
any remarkable change, becauſe without any ſemblance of State; now that he
gives ſome little glimpſe of his Royalty, <hi>the whole City was moved.</hi> When the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:44233:105"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Sages of the Eaſt brought the firſt news of the King of the Jewes, <hi>Herod was
troubled and all Jeruſalem with him;</hi> and now that the King of the Jews comes
himſelf (though in ſo mean a port) there is a new commotion. The ſilence
and obſcurity of Chriſt never troubles the world; he may be an underling
without any ſtir: but if he do but put forth himſelf never ſo little to bear the
leaſt ſway amongſt men, now their blood is up; the whole City is moved.
Neither is it otherwiſe in the private oeconomy of the Soul. O Saviour,
whiles thou doſt, as it were, hide thy ſelf, and lye ſtill in the heart, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
all termes contentedly from us, we entertain thee with no other then a
friendly welcome; but when thou once beginneſt to ruffle with our Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and to exerciſe thy Spiritual power in the ſubjugation of our vile
Affections, now all is in a ſecret uprore, all the angles of the heart are
moved.</p>
                  <p>Although, doubtleſs, this commotion was not ſo much of tumult, as of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
As when ſome uncouth ſight preſents it ſelf in a populous ſtreet, men run,
and gaze, and throng, and inquire; the feet, the tongue, the eyes walk; one
ſpectator draws on another, one asks and preſſes another; the noiſe increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
with the concourſe, each helps to ſtir up others exſpectation: ſuch was this
of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What meanes this ſtrangeneſs? Was not <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the Spouſe of Chriſt?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Had he not choſen her out of all the earth? Had he not begotten many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of her, as the pledges of their love? How juſtly maieſt thou now, O Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
complain with that mirrour of Patience, <hi>My breath was grown ſtrange
to my own wife, though I intreated her for the childrens ſake of my own body?</hi>
Even of thee is that fulfilled, which thy choſen Veſſel ſaid of thy Miniſters,
Thou art <hi>made a gazing-ſtock to the world, to Angels, and to men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As all the world was bound to thee for thy Incarnation and reſidence upon
the face of the earth, ſo eſpecially <hi>Judaea,</hi> to whoſe limits thou confinedſt thy
ſelf; and therein, above all the reſt, three Cities, <hi>Nazaret, Capernaum, Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
on whom thou beſtowedſt the moſt time, and coſt of preaching, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> miraculous works. Yet in all three thou receivedſt not ſtrange Entertainment
only, but hoſtile. In <hi>Nazaret</hi> they would have caſt thee down headlong from
the mount: In <hi>Capernaum</hi> they would have bound thee: In <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> they
crucified thee at laſt, and now are amazed at thy preſence. Thoſe places and
perſons that have the greateſt helps and priviledges afforded to them, are not
alwaies the moſt anſwerable in the return of their thankfulneſs. Chriſts
being amongſt us doth not make us happy, but his welcome. Every day may
we hear him in our ſtreets, and yet be as new to ſeek as theſe Citizens of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;
Who is this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Was it a queſtion of applauſe, or of contempt, or of ignorance? Applauſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of his abettors, contempt of the Scribes and Phariſees, ignorance of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude?
Surely his abettors had not been moved at this ſight; the Scribes
and Phariſees had rather envied then contemned: The multitude doubtleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
ſeriouſly, out of a deſire of information. Not that the citizens of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
knew not Chriſt, who was ſo ordinary a gueſt, ſo noted a Prophet
amongſt them. Queſtionleſs this queſtion was asked of that part of the train
which went before this Triumph, whiles our Saviour was not yet in ſight,
which ere long his preſence had reſolved. It had been their duty to have
known to have attended Chriſt, yea to have publiſhed him to others: ſince
this is not done, it is well yet that they ſpend their breath in an inquiry. No
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> doubt there were many that would not ſo much as leave their ſhop-board, and
ſtep to their doors or their windows, to ſay, <hi>Who is this?</hi> as not thinking it
could concern them who paſſed by, whiles they might ſit ſtill. Thoſe Greeks
were in ſome way to good, that could ſay to <hi>Philip, We would ſee Jeſus.</hi> O Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
thou haſt been ſo long amongſt us, that it is our juſt ſhame if we know
thee not. If we have been ſlack hitherto, let our zealous inquiry make amends
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:44233:106"/>
for our neglect. Let outward pomp and worldly glory draw the hearts and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
tongues of carnal men after them; Oh let it be my care and happineſs to ask after
nothing but thee.</p>
                  <p>The attending Diſciples could not be to ſeek for an anſwer; which of the
Prophets have not put it into their mouths? <hi>Who is this?</hi> Ask <hi>Moſes,</hi> and
he ſhall tell you, <hi>The ſeed of the Woman</hi> that <hi>ſhall break the Serpents head.</hi> Ask
our Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> and he ſhall tell you, <hi>The Shiloh of the tribe of Judah.</hi> Ask
<hi>David,</hi> and he ſhall tell you, <hi>The King of glory.</hi> Ask <hi>Eſay,</hi> he ſhall tell you,
<hi>Immanuel, Wonderful, Counſellor, The mighty God, The everlaſting Father, The
Prince of peace.</hi> Ask <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and he ſhall tell you, <hi>The righteous Branch.</hi> Ask
<hi>Daniel,</hi> he ſhall tell you, <hi>The Meſsiah.</hi> Ask <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, he ſhall tell you,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                     <hi>The Lamb of God.</hi> If ye ask the God of the Prophets, he hath told you, <hi>This is
my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Yea, if all theſe be too good for
you to conſult with, the Devils themſelves have been forced to ſay, <hi>I know who
thou art, even that Holy One of God.</hi> On no ſide hath Chriſt left himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a teſtimony; and accordingly the Multitude here have their anſwer ready,
<hi>This is Jeſus, the Prophet of Nazaret in Galilee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ye undervalue your Maſter, O ye well-meaning Followers of Chriſt: <hi>A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet?
yea, more then a Prophet? John Baptiſt</hi> was ſo, yet was but the harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of this <hi>Meſsiah.</hi> This was that God by whom the Prophets were both ſent
and inſpired. <hi>Of Nazaret,</hi> ſay you? ye miſtake him: <hi>Bethleem</hi> was the place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
of his Birth, the proof of his Tribe, the evidence of his Meſſiahſhip. If
<hi>Nazareth</hi> were honored by his preaching, there was no reaſon he ſhould be
diſhonoured by <hi>Nazareth.</hi> No doubt, he whom you confeſſed, pardoned the
errour of your confeſſion. Ye ſpake but according to the common ſtyle:
the two Diſciples in their walk to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> after the Death and Reſurrection
of Chriſt, give him no other title. This belief paſſed current with the people;
and thus high even the vulgar thoughts could then riſe: and, no doubt, even
thus much was for that time very acceptable to the Father of Mercies. If
we make profeſſion of the Truth according to our knowledg, though there
be much imperfection in our apprehenſion and delivery, the mercy of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
good God takes it well; not judging us for what we have not, but accepting
us in what we have. Shouldſt thou, O God, ſtand ſtrictly upon the punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
degrees of knowledg, how wide would it goe with millions of Souls?
for beſides much errour in many, there is more ignorance. But herein do we
juſtly magnifie and adore thy Goodneſs, that where thou findeſt diligent
endeavour of better information matched with an honeſt ſimplicity of heart,
thou paſſeſt by our unwilling defects, and crowneſt our well-meant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions.</p>
                  <p>But oh the wonderful hand of God in the carriage of this whole buſineſs!
The people proclaimed Chriſt firſt a King; and now they proclaim him a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
Why did not the <hi>Roman</hi> bands run into armes upon the one? why
did not the Scribes and Phariſees and the envious Prieſthood mutiny upon
the other? They had made Decrees againſt him, they had laid wait for him;
yet now he paſſes in ſtate through their ſtreets, acclamed both a King and
Prophet, without their reluctation. What can we impute this unto, but
to the powerful and over-ruling arme of his Godhead? He that reſtrained
the rage of <hi>Herod</hi> and his Courtiers upon the firſt news of a King born, now
reſtrains all the oppoſite powers of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from lifting up a finger againſt this
laſt and publick avouchment of the Regal and Prophetical Office of Chriſt.
When fleſh and blood have done their worſt, they can be but ſuch as he will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
make them: If the Legions of Hell combine with the Potentates of the earth,
they cannot goe beyond the reach of their tether: Whether they riſe or ſit ſtill,
they ſhall by an inſenſible ordination perform that will of the Almighty which
they leaſt think of, and moſt oppoſe.</p>
                  <p>With this humble pomp and juſt acclamation, O Saviour, doſt thou paſs
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:44233:106"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> through the ſtreets of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the Temple. Thy firſt walk was not to
<hi>Herod</hi>'s Palace, or to the Market-places or Burſes of that populous City,
but to the Temple; whether it were out of duty, or out of need: As a good
Son when he comes from farr, his firſt alighting is at his Fathers houſe; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would he think it other then prepoſterous, to viſit ſtrangers before his
friends, or friends before his Father. Beſides that the Temple had more
uſe of thy preſence: Both there was the moſt diſorder, and from thence, as
from a corrupt ſpring, it iſſued forth into all the chanels of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> A
wiſe Phyſician inquires firſt into the ſtate of the head, heart, liver, ſtomach,
the vital and chief parts, ere he asks after the petty ſymptoms of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and leſs-concerning members. Surely all good or evil begins at the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
If God have there his own, if men find there nothing but wholeſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
holy example, the Commonwealth cannot want ſome happy tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of Piety, Devotion, Sanctimony; as that fragrant perfume from <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>'s
head ſweetens his utmoſt skirts. Contrarily, the diſtempers of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
cannot but affect the Secular ſtate. As therefore the good Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
when he ſees the leaves grow yellow, and the branches unthriving,
looks preſently to the root; ſo didſt thou, O holy Saviour, upon ſight of the
diſorders ſpread over <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Judaea,</hi> addreſs thy ſelf to the rectifying of
the Temple.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> No ſooner is Chriſt alighted at the gate of the outer Court of his Fathers
houſe, then he falls to work: Reformation was his errand; that he roundly
attempts. That holy ground was profaned by ſacrilegious barterings: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the third court of that Sacred place was a publick Mart held; here was a
throng of buyers and ſellers, though not of all commodities, (the Jewes

The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> came many of them from far; it was no leſs from
<hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba</hi> then the ſpace of an hundred and threeſcore miles; neither
could it be without much inconvenience for them to bring their Bullocks,
Sheep, Goats, Lambs, meal, oyle, and ſuch other holy proviſion with them
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> up to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Order was taken by the Prieſts, that theſe might for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
be had cloſe by the Altar; to the eaſe of the offerer, and the benefit of
the ſeller, and perhaps no diſprofit to themſelves. The pretence was fair, the
practice unſufferable. The great owner of the Temple comes to vindicate
the reputation and rights of his own houſe; and in an indignation at that ſo
foul abuſe, layes fiercely about him, and with his three-ſtringed ſcourge
whips out thoſe Sacrilegious chapmen, caſts down their tables, throws away
their baskets, ſcatters their heaps, and ſends away their cuſtomers with ſmart
and horror.</p>
                  <p>With what fear and aſtoniſhment did the repining offenders look upon ſo
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> unexpected a Juſticer, whiles their conſcience laſhed them more then thoſe
cords, and the terrour of that meek chaſtiſer more affrighted them then his
blows? Is this that milde and gentle Saviour that came to <hi>take upon him
our ſtripes,</hi> and to undergoe <hi>the chaſtiſements of our peace?</hi> Is this that quiet
<hi>Lamb, which before his ſhearers openeth not his mouth?</hi> See now how his eyes
ſparkle with holy anger, and dart forth beams of indignation in the faces of
theſe guilty Collybiſts: ſee how his hands deal ſtrokes and ruine. Yea, thus,
thus it became thee, O thou gracious Redeemer of men, to let the world ſee,
thou haſt not loſt thy Juſtice in thy Mercy; that there is not more lenity in
thy forbearances, then rigour in thy juſt ſeverity; that thou canſt thunder, as
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> well as ſhine.</p>
                  <p>This was not thy firſt act of this kinde; at the entrance of thy publick work
thou beganſt ſo as thou now ſhutteſt up, with purging thine Houſe. Once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had theſe offenders been whipt out of that holy place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which now they
dare again defile. Shame and ſmart is not enough to rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>Oft yet had our Saviour been (beſides this) in the Temple, and often had
ſeen the ſame diſorder; he doth not think fit to be alwaies whipping. It was
enough thus twice to admoniſh and chaſtiſe them before their ruine. That
God who hates ſin alwaies, will not chide alwaies, and ſtrikes more ſeldome;
but he would have thoſe few ſtrokes perpetual monitors; and if thoſe prevail
not, he ſmites but once. It is his uniform courſe, firſt the Whip, and if that

                  <p>There is a reverence due to God's Houſe for the Owners ſake, for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices

be more plauſible colours caſt upon any act; the convenience, the neceſſity of
proviſions for the Sacrifice: yet through all theſe do the fiery eyes of our
Saviour ſee the foul Covetouſneſs of the Prieſts, the Fraud of the Money-chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
the intolerable abuſe of the Temple. Common eyes may be cheated
with eaſie pretexts; but he that looks through the heart at the face, juſtly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers

                  <p>None but the hand of publick authority muſt reform the abuſes of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Temple. If all be out of courſe there, no man is barred from ſorrow; the
grief may reach to all, the power of reformation onely to thoſe whom it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth.
It was but a juſt queſtion, though ill propounded to <hi>Moſes, Who
made thee a Judge or a Ruler?</hi> We muſt all imitate the zeal of our Saviour;
we may not imitate his correction. If we ſtrike uncalled, we are juſtly ſtricken
for our arrogation, for our preſumption. A tumultuary remedy may prove a

                  <p>But what ſhall I ſay of ſo ſharp and imperious an act from ſo meek an
Agent? Why did not the Prieſts and Levites (whoſe this gain partly was)

thoſe multitudes of men ſtand upon their defence, and wreſt that whip out of
the hand of a ſeemingly-weak and unarmed Prophet; but in ſtead thereof run

return thither where thou wert ſo palpably diſregarded. If they gave thee not

not diſcourageable by the moſt hateful indignities, by the baſeſt repulſes!
What burden canſt thou ſhrink under, who canſt bear the weight of ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Thou that giveſt food to all things living, art thy ſelf hungry. <hi>Martha, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
and <hi>Lazarus</hi> kept not ſo poor an houſe, but that thou mighteſt have eaten
ſomething at <hi>Bethany.</hi> Whether thine haſt out-ran thine appetite; or whether
on purpoſe thou forbareſt repaſt, to give opportunity to thine inſuing Miracle,
I neither ask, nor reſolve. This was not the firſt time that thou waſt hungry.
As thou wouldſt be a man, ſo thou wouldſt ſuffer thoſe infirmities that belong
to Humanity. Thou cameſt to be our High prieſt; it was thy act and intention, not
only to intercede for thy people, but to transfer unto thy ſelf as their ſins, ſo
their weakneſſes and complaints. Thou knoweſt to pity what thou haſt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> felt. Are we pinched with want? we indure but what thou didſt, we have reaſon
to be patient; thou induredſt what we do, we have reaſon to be thankful.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhall we ſay to this thine early hunger? The morning, as it is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged
from exceſs, ſo from need; the ſtomach is not wont to riſe with the
body. Surely, as thy occaſions were, no ſeaſon was exempted from thy want:
thou hadſt ſpent the day before in the holy labour of thy Reformation; after a
ſupperleſs departure thou ſpenteſt the night in Prayer; no meal refreſhed thy
toile. What do we think much to forbear a morſel, or to break a ſleep for
thee, who didſt thus neglect thy ſelf for us?</p>
                  <p>As if meat were no part of thy care, as if any thing would ſerve to ſtop the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> mouth of hunger, thy breakfaſt is expected from the next Tree. A Fig-tree
grew by the way ſide, ful grown, well ſpread, thick leaved, and ſuch as might
promiſe enough to a remote eye: thither thou cameſt to ſeek that which thou
foundſt not; and not findig what thou ſoughteſt, as diſpleaſed with thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment,
curſedſt that plant which deluded thy hopes. Thy breath inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
blaſted that deceitful tree; it did (no otherwiſe then the whole world muſt
needs doe) wither and dye with thy Curſe.</p>
                  <p>O Saviour, I had rather wonder at thine actions then diſcuſs them. If I
ſhould ſay that as man, thou either kneweſt not or conſideredſt not of this
fruitleſneſs, it could no way prejudice thy Divine Omniſcience; this infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> were no worſe then thy wearineſs or hunger: It was no more diſparagement
to thee to grow in Knowledge, then in ſtature; neither was it any more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
to thy perfect Humanity, that thou (as man) knewſt not all things at
once, then that thou wert not in thy childhood at thy full growth. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I doubt not to ſay, it is more likely thou cameſt purpoſely to this Tree,
knowing the barrenneſs of it anſwerable to the ſeaſon, and fore-reſolving the
event; that thou mighteſt hence ground the occaſion of ſo inſtructive a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle:
like as thou kneweſt <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dying, was dead, yet wouldſt not ſeem
to take notice of his diſſolution, that thou mighteſt the more glorifie thy Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in his reſuſcitation. It was thy willing and determined diſappointment for a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> greater purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>But why didſt thou curſe a poor tree for the want of that fruit which the
ſeaſon yielded not? If it pleaſed thee to call for that which it could not give,
the Plant was innocent; and if innocent, why curſed? O Saviour, it is fitter
for us to adore then to examine. We may be ſawcy in inqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>g after thee, and

                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:44233:108"/>
If that ſeaſon were not for a ripe fruit, yet for ſome fruit it was. Who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
knows not the nature of the Fig-tree to be alwaies bearing? That plant (if not
altogether barren) yields a continual ſucceſſion of increaſe; whiles one fig is
ripe, another is green; the ſame bough can content both our taſte and our
hope. This tree was defective in both, yielding nothing but an empty ſhade
to the miſ-hoping traveller.</p>
                  <p>Beſides that, I have learn'd that thou, O Saviour, wert wont not to ſpeak
only, but to work Parables. And what was this other then a real Parable of
thine? All this while hadſt thou been in the world; thou hadſt given many
proofs of thy Mercy (the earth was full of thy Goodneſs) none of thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
now, immediately before thy Paſſion, thou thoughteſt fit to give this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
double demonſtration of thy juſt auſterity. How elſe ſhould the world have
ſeen thou canſt be ſevere as well as meek and merciful? And why mighteſt
not thou, who madeſt all things, take liberty to deſtroy a plant for thine own
Glory? Wherefore ſerve thy beſt creatures but for the praiſe of thy Mercy and
Juſtice? What great matter was it if thou, who once ſaidſt, <hi>Let the earth
bring forth the herb yielding ſeed, and the tree yielding the fruit of its own kind,</hi>
ſhouldſt now ſay, <hi>Let this fruitleſs tree wither?</hi> All this yet was done in figure: In
this act of thine I ſee both an Embleme, and a Propheſie. How didſt thou here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
mean to teach thy Diſciples how much thou hateſt an unfruitful profeſſion,
and what judgements thou meanteſt to bring upon that barren generation?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Once before hadſt thou compared the Jewiſh nation to a Fig-tree in the midſt
of thy vineyard, which after three yeares exſpectation and culture yielding no
fruit, was by thee, the Owner, doomed to a ſpeedy exciſion; now thou
acteſt what thou then ſaidſt. No tree abounds more with leaf and ſhade; no
Nation abounded more with Ceremonial obſervations and ſemblances of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.
Outward profeſſion, where there is want of inward truth and real pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
doth but help to draw on and aggravate judgment. Had this Fig-tree
been utterly bear and leafleſs, it had perhaps eſcaped the Curſe. Hear this, ye
vain Hypocrites, that care only to ſhew well; never caring for the ſincere
truth of a Conſcionable Obedience: your fair outſide ſhall be ſure to help you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
to a Curſe.</p>
                  <p>That which was the fault of this tree, is the puniſhment of it, <hi>fruitleſneſs:
Let no fruit grow on thee hence forward for ever.</hi> Had the boughs been appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be torn down, and the body ſplit in pieces, the doom had been more
eaſy; and that juicy plant might yet have recovered, and have lived to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
this deficiency: now it ſhall be what it was, <hi>fruitleſs.</hi> Woe be to that
Church or Soul that is puniſhed with her own Sin. Outward plagues are but
favour in compariſon of Spiritual judgements.</p>
                  <p>That Curſe might well have ſtood with a long continuance; the Tree might
have lived long, though fruitleſs: but no ſooner is the word paſſed, then the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
leaves flagg and turn yellow, the branches wrinkle and ſhrink, the bark diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
the root dries, the plant withers.</p>
                  <p>O God, what creature is able to abide the blaſting of the breath of thy diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?
Even the moſt great and glorious Angels of Heaven could not ſtand one
moment before thine anger, but periſh'd under thy wrath everlaſtingly. How
irreſiſtible is thy Power? how dreadful are thy Judgements? Lord, chaſtiſe

thou profereſt to ſale? Were they able to pay, or thou capable to receive all

how were this price equivalent to the worth of him that made them? Had they
been able to have fetch'd down thoſe rich and glittering ſpangles of Heaven,
and to have put them into thy fiſt, what had this been to weigh with a God?
How baſely therefore doſt thou ſpeak of chaffering for him whoſe the world

could ſay, <hi>All the kingdomes of the earth, and the glory of them are mine; and I
give them to whom I pleaſe: all theſe will I give thee.</hi> Had he now made that

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> penny-wiſe, and pound-fooliſh: they know how to ſet high prizes upon the

Did not <hi>Judas</hi> (think we) bluſh, and grow pale again, and caſt down his guilty

true, he was a thief; but who knows that beſides his Maker? The outſides of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
men are no leſſe deceitfull then their hearts. It is not more unſafe to judge by
outward appearances, then it is uncharitable not to judge ſo.</p>
                  <p>Oh the head-ſtrong reſolutions of wickedneſſe, not to be checked by any
oppoſition! Who would not but have thought, if the notice of an intended evil
could not have prevented it, yet that the threats of judgment ſhould have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
the boldeſt offender? <hi>Judas</hi> can ſit by, and hear his Maſter ſay, <hi>Wo be
to the man by whom the Son of man is betraied; it had been better for that man
never to have been born,</hi> and is no more blank'd then very innocence; but
thinks, What care I? I have the money; I ſhall eſcape the ſhame: the fact ſhall
be cloſe, the match gainfull: it will be long ere I get ſo much by my ſervice; if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
I fare well for the preſent, I ſhall ſhift well enough for the future. Thus ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he claps up another bargain; he <hi>makes a covenant with death, and with
Hell an agreement.</hi> O <hi>Judas,</hi> didſt thou ever hear ought but truth fall from the
mouth of that thy Divine Maſter? Canſt thou diſtruſt the certainty of that
dreadfull menace of vengeance? How then durſt thou perſiſt in the purpoſe of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:44233:109"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſo flagitious and damnable a villany? Reſolved ſinners run on deſperately in
their wicked courſes; and have ſo bent their eyes upon the profit or pleaſure
of their miſchievous projects, that they will not ſee Hell lie open before them
in the way.</p>
                  <p>As if that ſhameleſs man meant to outbrave all accuſations, and to outface his
own heart, he dares ask too, <hi>Maſter, is it I?</hi> No Diſciple ſhall more zealouſly
abominate that crime then he that foſters it in his boſome. Whatever the
Searcher of hearts knows by him, is lock'd up in his own breaſt: to be perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
is nothing, ſo he may be ſecret: his Maſter knows him for a Traitor, it
is not long that he ſhall live to complain; his fellows think him honeſt: all
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is well, whiles he is well eſteemed. Reputation is the onely care of falſe hearts,
not truth of being, not conſcience of merit; ſo they may ſeem fair to men, they
care not how foul they are to God.</p>
                  <p>Had our Saviour onely had this knowledge at the ſecond hand, this bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
had been enough to make him ſuſpect the credit of the beſt intelligence:
Who could imagine that a guilty man dared thus brow-beat a juſt accuſation?
Now he whoſe piercing and unfailing eyes ſee things as they are, not as they
ſeem, can peremptorily convince the impudence of this hollow queſtioniſt with
a direct affirmation; <hi>Thou haſt ſaid.</hi> Fooliſh traitor! couldſt thou think that
thoſe blear eyes of thine would indure the beams of the Sun, or that counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſlip, the fire? was it not ſufficient for thee to be ſecretly vicious, but thou
muſt preſume to conteſt with an Omniſcient accuſer? Haſt thou yet enough?
Thou ſuppoſedſt thy crime unknown. To men it was ſo; had thy Maſter been
no more, it had been ſo to him: now his knowledge argues him Divine. How
durſt thou yet reſolve to lift up thy hand againſt him, who knows thine offence,
and can either prevent or revenge it? As yet the charge was private, either
not heard, or not obſerved by thy fellows: it ſhall be at firſt whiſpered to one,
and at laſt known to all. Baſhfull and penitent ſinners are fit to be concealed;
ſhame is meet for thoſe that have none.</p>
                  <p>Curioſity of Knowledge is an old diſeaſe of humane nature: beſides, <hi>Peter</hi>'s
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> zeal would not let him dwell under the danger of ſo doubtfull a crimination;
he cannot but ſit on thorns, till he know the man. His ſigns ask what his
voice dare not. What law requires all followers to be equally beloved? Why
may not our favours be freely diſpenſed where we like beſt, without envie,
without prejudice? None of Chriſt's train could complain of neglect; <hi>John</hi> is
higheſt in grace. Blood, affection, zeal, diligence have indeared him above his
fellows. He that is deareſt in reſpect, is next in place: in that form of ſide-ſitting
at the Table, he leaned on the boſome of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Where is more love,
there may be more boldneſſe. This ſecrecy and intireneſſe priviledges <hi>John</hi> to
ask that ſafely, which <hi>Peter</hi> might not without much inconvenience and peril of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> a check. The beloved Diſciple well underſtands this ſilent language, and dares
put <hi>Peter</hi>'s thought into words. Love ſhutteth out fear. O Saviour, the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of thy Goodneſſe emboldens us not to ſhrink at any ſuit. Thy love ſhed
abroad in our hearts bids us ask that which in a ſtranger were no better then
preſumption. Once, when <hi>Peter</hi> askt thee a queſtion concerning <hi>John, What
ſhall this man doe?</hi> he received a ſhort anſwer, <hi>What is that to thee?</hi> Now, when
<hi>John</hi> asks thee a queſtion (no leſſe ſeemingly curious) at <hi>Peter</hi>'s inſtance, <hi>Who is
it that betraies thee?</hi> however thou mighteſt have returned him the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
(ſince neither of their perſons was any more concerned) yet thou conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeſt
to a milde and full (though ſecret) ſatisfaction. There was not ſo much
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> difference in the men, as in the matter of the demand. No occaſion was given
to <hi>Peter</hi> of moving that queſtion concerning <hi>John;</hi> the indefinite aſſertion of
treaſon amongſt the Diſciples was a moſt juſt occaſion of moving <hi>John</hi>'s que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
for <hi>Peter</hi> and himſelf. That which therefore was timorouſly demanded,
is anſwered graciouſly; <hi>He it is to whom I ſhall give a ſop, when I have dipped it.
And he gave the ſop to Judas.</hi> How loath was our Saviour to name him whom
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:44233:110"/>
he was not unwilling to deſign? All is here expreſſed by dumb ſigns; the hand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
ſpeaks what the tongue would not. In the ſame language wherein <hi>Peter</hi> asked
the queſtion of <hi>John,</hi> doth our Saviour ſhape an anſwer to <hi>John:</hi> what a beck
demanded, is anſwered by a ſop.</p>
                  <p>O Saviour, I do not hear thee ſay, Look on whomſoever I frown, or to
whomſoever I doe a publick affront, that is the man; but, <hi>To whomſoever I ſhall
give a ſop.</hi> Surely a by-ſtander would have thought this man deep in thy
books, and would have conſtrued this act as they did thy tears for <hi>Lazarus,
See how he loves him.</hi> To carve a man out of thine own diſh, what could it
ſeem to argue but a ſingularity of reſpect? Yet, lo, there is but one whom
thou hateſt, one onely Traitor at thy board; and thou giveſt him a ſop. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
outward Gifts of God are not alwaies the proofs of his Love; yea, ſometimes
are beſtowed in diſpleaſure. Had not he been a wiſe Diſciple that ſhould have
envied the great favour done to <hi>Judas,</hi> and have ſtomached his own preteriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
So fooliſh are they, who meaſuring God's affection by temporal benefits,
are ready to applaud proſpering wickedneſs, and to grudge outward bleſſings
to them which are uncapable of any better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>After the ſop, Satan entred into Judas.</hi> Better had it been for that treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Diſciple to have wanted that morſell: Not that there was any malignity
in the bread, or that the ſop had any power to convey Satan into the receiver,
or that by a neceſſary concomitance that evil ſpirit was in or with it. Favours <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
ill uſed make the heart more capable of further evil. That wicked ſpirit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
takes occaſion by any of God's gifts, to aſſault us the more eagerly.
After our Sacramental morſell, if we be not the better, we are ſure the worſe.
I dare not ſay, yet I dare think that <hi>Judas,</hi> comparing his Maſter's words and
<hi>John</hi>'s whiſperings with the tender of this ſop, and finding himſelf thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted,
was now ſo much the more irritated to perform what he had wickedly
purpoſed. Thus Satan took advantage by the ſop of a further poſſeſſion. Twice
before had that evil ſpirit made a palpable entry into that lewd heart. Firſt, in
his Covetouſneſſe and Theft; thoſe ſinfull habits could not be without that
author of ill: then in his damnable reſolution, and plot of ſo hainous a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
againſt Chriſt. Yet now (as if it were new to begin) <hi>After the ſop Satan
entred.</hi> As in every groſſe ſin which we entertain, we give harbour to that evil
ſpirit; ſo in every degree of growth in wickedneſſe, new hold is taken by him
of the heart. No ſooner is the foot over the threſhold, then we enter into the
houſe: when we paſſe thence into the inner rooms, we make ſtill but a perfect
entrance. At firſt Satan entred, to make the houſe of <hi>Judas</hi>'s heart his own;
now he enters into it as his own. The firſt purpoſe of ſin opens the gates to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;
conſent admits him into the entry; full reſolution of ſin gives up the keys
to his hands, and puts him into abſolute poſſeſſion. What a plain difference
there is betwixt the regenerate and evil heart? Satan laies ſiege to the beſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
by his Tentations; and ſometimes upon battery and breach made enters: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
admits him by willing compoſition. When he is entred upon the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
he is entertained with perpetual skirmiſhes, and by an holy violence at laſt
repulſed: in the other he is plauſibly received, and freely commandeth. Oh the
admirable meekneſs of this Lamb of God! I ſee not a frown, I hear not a check;
but, <hi>What thou doeſt, doe quickly.</hi> Why do we ſtartle at our petty wrongs, and
ſwell with anger, and break into furious revenges upon every occaſion, when
the pattern of our Patience lets not fall one harſh word upon ſo ſoul &amp; bloody
a Traitor? Yea, ſo fairly is this carried, that the Diſciples as yet can apprehend
no change; they innocently think of commodities to be bought: when Chriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
ſpeaks of their Maſter ſold, and, as one that longs to be out of pain, haſtens the
pace of his irreclamable conſpirator, <hi>That thou doeſt, doe quickly.</hi> It is one thing
to ſay, Doe what thou intendeſt, and another to ſay, <hi>Doe quickly what thou doeſt.</hi>
There was villany in the deed; the ſpeed had no ſin, the time was harmleſſe,
whiles the man and the act was wicked. O <hi>Judas,</hi> how happy had it been for
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:44233:110"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> thee, if thou hadſt never done what thou perfidiouſly intendedſt? but ſince thou
wilt needs doe it, delay is but a torment.</p>
                  <p>That ſteely heart yet relents not; the obfirmed Traitor knows his way to
the High Prieſt's hall and to the garden; the watchword is already given, <hi>Hail
Maſter,</hi> and <hi>a kiſſe.</hi> Yet more Hypocriſie? yet more preſumption upon ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
a lenity? How kneweſt thou, O thou falſe Traitor, whether that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
cheek would ſuffer it ſelf to be defiled with thine impure touch? Thou
well foundſt thy treachery was unmasked; thine heart could not be ſo falſe to
thee as not to tell thee how hatefull thou wert. Goe, kiſſe and adore thoſe ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlings
which thou art too ſure of; the Maſter whom thou haſt ſold is not
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> thine. But oh the impudence of a deplored ſinner! That tongue which hath
agreed to ſell his Maſter, dares ſay, <hi>Hail;</hi> and thoſe lips that have paſſed the
compact of his death, dare offer to kiſſe him whom they had covenanted to
kill. It was God's charge of old, <hi>Kiſſe the Son, leſt he be angry.</hi> O Saviour,
thou hadſt reaſon to be angry with this kiſſe; the ſcourges, the thorns, the
nails, the ſpear of thy Murderers were not ſo painfull, ſo piercing, as this touch
of <hi>Judas:</hi> all theſe were in this one alone. The ſtabs of an Enemy cannot be ſo
grievous as the skin-deep wounds of a Diſciple.</p>

                  <p>WHAT a Preface do I finde to my Saviour's Paſſion? an Hymn,
and an Agonie: a chearfull Hymn, and an Agonie no leſſe ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull.
An Hymn begins, both to raiſe and teſtifie the coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
reſolutions of his Suffering; an Agonie follows, to ſhew
that he was truly ſenſible of thoſe extremities wherewith he was reſolved to
grapple. All the Diſciples bore their part in that Hymn; it was fit they ſhould
all ſee his comfortable &amp; Divine Magnanimity wherewith he entred into thoſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſad liſts: only Three of them ſhall be allowed to be the witneſſes of his Agonie;
only thoſe three that had been the witneſſes of his glorious Transfiguration.
That ſight had well fore-arm'd and prepared them for this: how could they be
diſmai'd to ſee his trouble, who there ſaw his Majeſty? how could they be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mai'd
to ſee his body now ſweat, which they had then ſeen to ſhine? how could
they be daunted to ſee him now accoſted with <hi>Judas</hi> and his train, whom they
then ſaw attended with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias?</hi> how could they be diſcouraged to
hear the reproaches of baſe men, when they had heard the voice of God to him
from that excellent glory, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Now before theſe eyes this Sun begins to be over-caſt with clouds; <hi>He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be ſorrowfull and very heavy.</hi> Many ſad thoughts for mankinde had he
ſecretly hatched, and yet ſmothered in his own breaſt; now his grief is too
great to keep in: <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowfull, even unto death.</hi> O Saviour,
what muſt thou needs feel when thou ſaidſt ſo? Feeble mindes are apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone
themſelves upon light occaſions; the grief muſt needs be violent that
cauſeth a ſtrong heart to break forth into a paſſionate complaint. Woe is me,
what a word is this for the Son of God? Where is that Comforter which thou
promiſedſt to ſend to others? where is that thy <hi>Father of all mercies and God
of all comfort, in whoſe preſence is the fulneſſe of joy, and at whoſe right hand
there are pleaſures for evermore?</hi> where are thoſe conſtant and chearfull reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of a fearleſſe walking through the valley of the ſhadow of death? Alas!
if that face were not hid from thee whoſe eſſence could not be diſunited, theſe
pangs could not have been. The Sun was withdrawn awhile, that there might
be a cool, though not a dark night, as in the world, ſo in thy breaſt; withdrawn
in reſpect of ſight, not of being. It was the hardeſt piece of thy ſufferings, that
thou muſt be diſconſolate.</p>

                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:44233:111"/>
But to whom doſt thou make this moan, O thou Saviour of men? Hard is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
that man driven that is fain to complain to his inferiours. Had <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>James,</hi>
or <hi>John</hi> thus bewailed himſelf to thee, there had been eaſe to their Soul in ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it ſelf; thou hadſt been both apt to pity them, and able to relieve them:
but now in that thou lamenteſt thy caſe to them, alas! what iſſue couldſt thou
exſpect? They might be aſtoniſh'd with thy grief; but there is neither power in
their hands to free thee from thoſe ſorrows, nor power in their compaſſion to
mitigate them. Nay, in this condition what could all the Angels of Heaven
(as of themſelves) doe to ſuccour thee? What ſtrength could they have but
from thee? What creature can help when thou complaineſt? It muſt be only
the ſtronger that can aid the weak.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Old and holy <hi>Simeon</hi> could fore-ſay to thy Bleſſed Mother, that <hi>a ſword
ſhould pierce through her Soul;</hi> but, alas! how many ſwords at once pierce thine?
Every one of theſe words is both ſharp and edged; <hi>My Soul is exceeding ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
even unto death.</hi> What humane Soul is capable of the conceit of the leaſt
of thoſe ſorrows that oppreſſed thine? It was not thy body that ſuffered now:
the pain of body is but as the body of pain; the anguiſh of the Soul is as the
Soul of anguiſh. That, and in that thou ſufferedſt: where are they that dare ſo
far diſparage thy Sorrow, as to ſay thy Soul ſuffered only in ſympathy with thy
body; not immediately, but by participation; not in its ſelf, but in its partner?
Thou beſt kneweſt what thou felteſt, and thou that felteſt thine own pain canſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
crie out of thy Soul. Neither didſt thou ſay, My Soul is troubled; ſo it often
was, even to tears: but,<hi>My Soul is ſorrowfull;</hi> as if it had been before aſſaulted,
now poſſeſſed with grief. Nor yet this in any tolerable moderation; changes
of Paſſion are incident to every humane Soul: but, <hi>Exceeding ſorrowfull.</hi> Yet
there are degrees in the very extremities of evils: thoſe that are moſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
may yet be capable of a remedy, at leaſt a relaxation; thine was paſt
theſe hopes, <hi>Exceeding ſorrowfull unto death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What was it, what could it be, O Saviour, that lay thus heavy upon thy
Divine Soul? Was it the fear of Death? was it the fore-felt pain, ſhame, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of thine enſuing Crucifixion? Oh poor and baſe thoughts of the narrow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
hearts of cowardly and impotent mortality! How many thouſands of thy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Martyrs have welcomed no leſſe tortures with ſmiles and gratulations,
and have made a ſport of thoſe exquiſite cruelties which their very Tyrants
thought unſufferable? Whence had they this ſtrength but from thee? If their
weakneſs were thus undaunted and prevalent, what was thy power? No, no:
It was the ſad weight of the ſin of mankinde; it was the heavy burden of thy
Fathers wrath for our ſin that thus preſſed thy Soul, and wrung from thee
theſe bitter expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>What can it avail thee, O Saviour, to tell thy grief to men? who can eaſe
thee, but he of whom thou ſaidſt, <hi>My Father is greater then I?</hi> Lo, to him thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
turneſt; <hi>O Father, if it be poſsible, let this cup paſſe from me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Was not this that <hi>prayer</hi> (O dear Chriſt) which <hi>in the daies of thy fleſh thou
offeredſt up with ſtrong crying and tears to him that was able to ſave thee from
death?</hi> Surely this was it. Never was crie ſo ſtrong; never was God thus
ſolicited. How could Heaven chuſe but ſhake at ſuch a Prayer from the Power
that made it? How can my heart but tremble to hear this ſuit from <hi>the Captain
of our Salvation?</hi> O thou that ſaidſt, <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> doſt thou ſuffer
ought from thy Father but what thou wouldſt, what thou determinedſt? was
this Cup of thine either caſual or forced? wouldſt thou wiſh for what thou
kneweſt thou wouldſt not have poſſible? Far, far be theſe miſ-raiſed thoughts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
of our ignorance and frailty. Thou cameſt to ſuffer, and thou wouldſt doe
what thou cameſt for: yet ſince thou wouldſt be a man, thou wouldſt take all
of man, ſave ſin: it is but humane (and not ſinfull) to be loath to ſuffer what
we may avoid. In this velleity of thine, thou wouldſt ſhew what that Nature
of ours which thou hadſt aſſumed could incline to wiſh; but in thy reſolution,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:44233:111"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> thou wouldſt ſhew us what thy victorious thoughts raiſed and aſſiſted by thy
Divine power had determinately pitched upon; <hi>Nevertheleſſe not as I will, but
as thou wilt.</hi> As man thou hadſt a Will of thine own: no humane Soul can
be perfect without that main faculty. That will, which naturally could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to incline towards an exemption from miſeries, gladly vails to that Divine
will whereby thou art deſigned to <hi>the chaſtiſements of our peace.</hi> Thoſe pains
which in themſelves were grievous, thou embraceſt as decreed: ſo as thy fear
hath given place to thy love and obedience. How ſhould we have known theſe
evils ſo formidable, if thou hadſt not in half a thought inclined to deprecate
them? How could we have avoided ſo formidable and deadly evils, if thou
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hadſt not willingly undergone them? We acknowledge thine holy fear, we
adore thy Divine fortitude.</p>
                  <p>Whiles thy Minde was in this fearfull agitation, it is no marvell if thy Feet
were not fixed. Thy place is more changed then thy thoughts. One while thou
walkeſt to thy drouzy Attendants, and ſtirreſt up their needfull vigilancy; then
thou returneſt to thy paſſionate Devotions, thou falleſt again upon thy face.
If thy body be humbled down to the earth, thy Soul is yet lower; thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are ſo much more vehement as thy pangs are;<hi>And being in an agony he
prayed more earneſtly, and his ſweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down
to the ground.</hi> O my Saviour, what an agonie am I in, whiles I think of thine?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> What pain, what fear, what ſtrife, what horrour was in thy Sacred breaſt? How
didſt thou ſtruggle under the weight of our ſins, that thou thus ſweateſt, that
thou thus bleedeſt? All was peace with thee: thou wert one with thy coeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and coeſſential Father; all the Angels worſhipped thee; all the powers of
Heaven and earth awfully acknowledged thine Infiniteneſs. It was our perſon
that feoffed thee in this miſery and torment; in that thou ſuſtainedſt thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
wrath and our curſe. If eternal death be unſufferable, if every ſin deſerve
eternal death, what, O what was it for thy Soul in this ſhort time of thy bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Paſſion to anſwer thoſe millions of eternal deaths which all the ſins of all
mankinde had deſerved from the juſt hand of thy Godhead? I marvell not if
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> thou bleedeſt a ſweat, if thou ſweateſt blood: If the moiſture of that Sweat be
from the Body, the tincture of it is from the Soul. As there never was ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Sweat, ſo neither can there be ever ſuch a Suffering. It is no wonder if
the Sweat were more then natural, when the Suffering was more then humane.</p>
                  <p>O Saviour, ſo willing was that precious blood of thine to be let forth for us,
that it was ready to prevent thy Perſecutors; and iſſued forth in thoſe pores,
before thy wounds were opened by thy Tormentors. O that my heart could
bleed unto thee with true inward compunction for thoſe ſins of mine which
are guilty of this thine Agonie, and have drawn blood of thee both in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and on the Croſs. Woe is me: I had been in Hell, if thou hadſt not been
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in thine Agonie; I had ſcorched, if thou hadſt not ſweat. Oh let me abhor my
own wickedneſſe, and admire and bleſſe thy Mercy.</p>
                  <p>But, O ye bleſſed Spirits which came to comfort my conflicted Saviour,
how did ye look upon the Son of God, when ye ſaw him labouring for life
under theſe violent temptations? with what aſtoniſhment did ye behold him
bleeding whom ye adored? In the Wilderneſs, after his Duell with Satan, ye
came and miniſtred unto him; and now in the Garden, whiles he is in an harder
combat, ye appear to ſtrengthen him. O the wiſe and marvellous diſpenſation
of the Almighty! Whom God will afflict, an Angel ſhall relieve; the Son
ſhall ſuffer, the Servant ſhall comfort him; the God of Angels droupeth, the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Angel of God ſtrengthens him.</p>
                  <p>Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> if as Man thou wouldſt be <hi>made a little lower then the Angels;</hi>
how can it diſparage thee to be attended and cheared up by an Angel? Thine
Humiliation would not diſdain comfort from meaner hands. How free was
it for thy Father to convey ſeaſonable conſolations to thine humbled Soul, by
whatſoever means? Behold, though thy Cup ſhall not paſſe, yet it ſhall be
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:44233:112"/>
ſweetned. What if thou ſee not (for the time) thy Fathers face? yet thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
ſhalt feel his hand. What could that Spirit have done without the God of
Spirits? O Father of Mercies, thou maieſt bring thine into Agonies, but thou
wilt never leave them there. <hi>In the midſt of the ſorrows of my heart thy comforts
ſhall refreſh my Soul.</hi> Whatſoever be the means of my ſupportation, I know and

                  <p>WHerefore, O Saviour, didſt thou take thoſe three choice Diſciples
with thee from their fellows, but that thou expectedſt ſome
comfort from their preſence? A ſeaſonable word may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
fall from the meaneſt attendant; and the very ſociety
of thoſe we truſt carries in it ſome kinde of contentment. Alas! what broken
reeds are men? Whiles thou art ſweating in thine Agonie, they are ſnorting
ſecurely. Admonitions, threats, intreaties cannot keep their eyes open. Thou
telleſt them of danger, they will needs dream of eaſe; and though twice rouzed
(as if they had purpoſed this neglect) they careleſly ſleep out thy ſorrow and
their own peril. What help haſt thou of ſuch Followers? In the mount of thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Transfiguration they ſlept, and beſides fell on their faces, when they ſhould
behold thy glory, and were not themſelves for fear; in the garden of thine
Agonie, they fell upon the ground for drouzineſſe, when they ſhould compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
thy ſorrow, and loſt themſelves in a ſtupid ſleepineſſe. Doubtleſſe even
this diſregard made thy prayers ſo much more fervent. The leſſe comfort we
finde on earth, the more we ſeek above. Neither ſoughtſt thou more then thou
foundeſt: Lo, thou <hi>wert heard in that which thou fearedſt.</hi> An Angel ſupplies
men; that Spirit was vigilant whiles thy Diſciples were heavy. The exchange
was happy.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner is this good Angel vaniſhed, then that domeſtick Devil appears:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                     <hi>Judas</hi> comes up, and ſhews himſelf in the head of thoſe miſcreant troups.
He whoſe too much honour it had been to be a Follower of ſo Bleſſed a Maſter,
affects now to be the leader of this wicked rabble. The Sheeps fleece is now
caſt off; the Wolf appears in his own likeneſſe. He that would be falſe to
his Maſter, would be true to his Chapmen: Even evil ſpirits keep touch with
themſelves. The bold Traitor dare yet ſtill mix Hypocriſie with Villany;
his very ſalutations and kiſſes murder. O Saviour, this is no news to thee. All
thoſe who under a ſhew of Godlineſſe practiſe impiety, do ſtill betray thee
thus. Thou who hadſt ſaid, <hi>One of you is a Devil,</hi> didſt not now ſay, <hi>Avoid
Satan;</hi> but, <hi>Friend, wherefore art thou come?</hi> As yet, <hi>Judas,</hi> it was not too late.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
Had there been any the leaſt ſpark of Grace yet remaining in that perfidious
boſome, this word had fetcht thee upon thy knees. All this Sunſhine cannot
thaw an obdurate heart. The ſign is given, <hi>Jeſus</hi> is taken. Wretched Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor!
why wouldſt thou for this purpoſe be thus attended? and ye fooliſh
Prieſts and Elders! why ſent you ſuch a band, and ſo armed for this apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?
One meſſenger had been enough for a voluntary priſoner. Had my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
been unwilling to be taken, all your forces (with all the Legions of Hell
to help them) had been too little: ſince he was willing to be attached, two
were too many. When he did but ſay, <hi>I am he,</hi> that eaſie breath alone routed all
your troups, and caſt them to the earth, whom it might as eaſily have caſt down <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
into Hell. What if he had ſaid, I will not be taken? where had ye been? or
what could your ſwords and ſtaves have done againſt Omnipotence?</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Diſciples that failed of their vigilance, failed not of their courage:
they had heard their Maſter ſpeak of providing ſwords, and now they thought
it was time to uſe them: <hi>Shall we ſmite?</hi> They were willing to fight for him
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:44233:112"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with whom they were not carefull to watch: but of all other <hi>Peter</hi> was moſt
forward; in ſtead of opening his lips, he unſheaths his ſword; and in ſtead of
Shall I? ſmites. He had noted <hi>Malchus,</hi> a buſie ſervant of the High prieſt, too
ready to ſecond <hi>Judas,</hi> and to lay his rude hands upon the Lord of Life: againſt
this man his heart riſes, and his hand is lift up. That eare which had too-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiouſly
liſtened to the unjuſt and cruell charge of his wicked Maſter, is now
ſevered from that worſe head which it had miſ-ſerved.</p>
                  <p>I love and honour thy zeal, O bleſſed Diſciple: Thou couldſt not brook
wrong done to thy Divine Maſter. Had thy life been dearer to thee then his
ſafety, thou hadſt not drawn thy ſword upon a whole troup. It was in earneſt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that thou ſaidſt, <hi>Though all men, yet not I;</hi> and, <hi>Though I ſhould die with thee,
yet I will not deny thee.</hi> Lo, thou art ready to die upon him that ſhould touch
that Sacred perſon; what would thy life now have been in compariſon of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
him? Since thou wert ſo fervent, why didſt thou not rather fall upon
that treachour that betrai'd him, then that Sergeant that arreſted him? Surely
the ſin was ſo much greater, as the plot of miſchief is more then the execution;
as a Domeſtick is nearer then a Stranger; as the treaſon of a Friend is worſe
then the forced enmity of an Hireling. Was it that the guilty wretch upon the
fact done ſubduced himſelf, and ſhrouded his falſe head under the wings of
darkneſſe? Was it that thou couldſt not ſo ſuddenly apprehend the odious
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> depth of that Villany, and inſtantly hate him that had been thy old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion?
Was it that thy amazedneſſe as yet conceived not the purpoſed iſſue
of this ſeizure, and aſtoniſhedly waited for the ſucceſſe? Was it that though
<hi>Judas</hi> were more faulty, yet <hi>Malchus</hi> was more imperiouſly cruell? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
thy Courage was awaked with thy ſelf; and thy heart was no leſſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
then thine hand was raſh. <hi>Put up again thy ſword into his place; for all they
that take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword.</hi> Good intentions are no warrant for
our actions. O Saviour, thou canſt at once accept of our meanings, and cenſure
our deeds. Could there be an affection more worth incouragement then the
love to ſuch a Maſter? Could there be a more juſt cauſe wherein to draw his
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſword then in thy quarrell? Yet this love, this quarrell cannot ſhield <hi>Peter</hi>
from thy check: thy meek tongue ſmites him gently, who had furiouſly ſmote
thine enemy; <hi>Put up thy ſword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſword; but to put up, not to uſe: there is a ſword which <hi>Peter</hi>
may uſe; but it is of another metall. Our weapons are, as our warfare, ſpiritual:
if he ſmite not with this, he incurs no leſſe blame then for ſmiting with the
other; as for this material ſword, what ſhould he doe with it that is not allowed
to ſtrike? When the Prince of Peace bade his Followers ſell their coat and buy
a ſword, he meant to inſinuate the need of theſe arms, not their improvement;
and to teach them the danger of the time, not the manner of the repulſe of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> danger. When they therefore ſaid, <hi>Behold, here are two ſwords;</hi> he anſwered, <hi>It
is enough:</hi> he ſaid not, Go buy more. More had not been enow, if a bodily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
had been intended: <hi>David</hi>'s tower had been too ſtreight to yield ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
furniture of this kinde. When it comes to uſe, <hi>Peter</hi>'s one ſword is too
much: <hi>Put up thy ſword.</hi> Indeed there is a temporal ſword; and that ſword
muſt be drawn, elſe wherefore is it? but drawn by him that bears it; and he
bears it that is ordained to be an avenger, to <hi>execute wrath upon him that doth
evil; for he bears not the ſword in vain.</hi> If another man draw it, it cuts his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
and draws ſo much blood of him that unwarrantably wields it, as that
<hi>he who takes the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword.</hi> Can I chuſe but wonder how
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> could thus ſtrike unwounded? how he, whoſe firſt blow made the fray,
could eſcape hewing in pieces from that band of Ruffians? This could not have
been, if thy power, O Saviour, had not reſtrained their rage; if thy ſeaſonable
and ſharp reproof had not prevented their revenge.</p>
                  <p>Now, for ought I ſee, <hi>Peter</hi> ſmarts no leſſe then <hi>Malchus:</hi> neither is <hi>Peter</hi>'s
eare leſſe ſmitten by the milde tongue of his Maſter, then <hi>Malchus</hi> his eare by
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:44233:113"/>
the hand of <hi>Peter.</hi> Weak Diſciple! thou <hi>haſt zeal, but not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
there is not more danger in this act of thine, then inconſideration and
ignorance. <hi>The cup which my Father hath given me, ſhall I not drink it?</hi>
Thou draweſt thy ſword to reſcue me from ſuffering. Alas! if I ſuffer not, what
would become of thee? what would become of mankinde? where were that
eternal and juſt Decree of my Father, wherein I am a <hi>Lamb ſlain from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world?</hi> Doſt thou go about to hinder thine own and the whole
worlds Redemption? Did I not once before call thee <hi>Satan</hi> for ſuggeſting to
me this immunity from my Paſſion? and doſt thou now think to favour me
with a reall oppoſition to this great and neceſſary work? Canſt thou be ſo
weak as to imagine that this Suffering of mine is not free and voluntary? Canſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
thou be ſo injurious to me as to think I yield, becauſe I want aid to reſiſt?
Have I not given to thee and to the world many undeniable proofs of my Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence?
Didſt thou not ſee how eaſie it had been for me to have blown
away theſe poor forces of my adverſaries? Doſt thou not know that if I would
require it, all the glorious troups of the Angels of Heaven (any one whereof
is more then worlds of men) would preſently ſhew themſelves ready to attend
and reſcue me? Might this have ſtood with the Juſtice of my Decree, with the
Glory of my Mercy, with the Benefit of mans Redemption, it had been done;
my Power ſhould have triumphed over the impotent malice of my enemies:
but now, ſince that eternal Decree muſt be accompliſhed, my Mercy muſt be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
approved, mankinde muſt be ranſomed; and this cannot be done without my
Suffering. Thy wel-meant valour is no better then a wrong to thy ſelf, to the
world, to me, to my Father.</p>
                  <p>O gracious Saviour, whiles thou thus ſmiteſt thy Diſciple, thou healeſt
him whom thy Diſciple ſmote. Many greater Miracles hadſt thou done; none
that bewraied more mercy and meekneſſe then this laſt Cure: of all other this
eare of <hi>Malchus</hi> hath the loudeſt tongue to blazon the praiſe of thy Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
and Goodneſſe to thy very enemies. Wherefore came that man but in
an hoſtile manner to attach thee? Beſides his own, what favour was he worthy
of for his Maſters ſake? And if he had not been more forward then his fellows,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
why had not his skin been as whole as theirs? Yet, even amidſt the throng of
thine apprehenders, in the heat of their violence, in the height of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
and thine own inſtant peril of death, thou healeſt that unneceſſary eare,
which had been guilty of hearing Blaſphemies againſt thee, and receiving
cruell and unjuſt charges concerning thee. O <hi>Malchus,</hi> could thy eare be
whole, and not thy heart broken and contrite with remorſe for riſing up againſt
ſo mercifull and ſo powerfull an hand? Could thou chuſe but ſay, <q>O bleſſed
<hi>Jeſu,</hi> I ſee it was thy Providence that preſerved my head, when my eare
was ſmitten; it is thine Almighty Power that hath miraculouſly reſtored
that eare of mine which I had juſtly forfeited: this head of mine ſhall never <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
be guilty of plotting any further miſchief againſt thee; this eare ſhall never
entertain any more reproaches of thy name; this heart of mine ſhall ever
acknowledge and magnifie thy tender mercies thy Divine Omnipotence?</q>
Could thy fellows ſee ſuch a demonſtration of Power and Goodneſſe with
unrelenting hearts? Unthankfull <hi>Malchus,</hi> and cruell ſouldiers! ye were worſe
wounded, and felt it not. God had ſtruck your breaſts with a fearfull obdura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

ſcum of the incenſed multitude runs after him with ſhouts and ſcorns? The act
of death hath not in it ſo much miſery and horrour, as the pomp of death.</p>
                  <p>And what needed all this pageant of Cruelty? wherefore was this ſtate and
lingring of an unjuſt execution? Was it for that their malice held a quick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> too much Mercy? Was it for that, whiles they meant to be bloody, they
would fain ſeem juſt? A ſuddain violence had been palpably murderous:
now the colour of a legal proceſſe guilds over all their deadly ſpight; and
would ſeem to render them honeſt, and the accuſed guilty.</p>
                  <p>This attachment, this convention of the innocent was a true night-work;
a deed of ſo much darkneſſe was not for the light. Old <hi>Annas</hi> and that
wicked Bench of gray-headed Scribes and Elders can be content to break their
ſleep to doe miſchief: Envie and malice can make noon of midnight. It is
reſolved he ſhall die; and now pretences muſt be ſought that he may be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
murdered. All evil begins at the Sanctuarie: The Prieſts and Scribes and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Elders are the firſt in this bloody ſcene; they have pai'd for this head, and now
long to ſee what they ſhall have for their thirty ſilverlings. The Bench is ſet
in the Hall of <hi>Caiaphas:</hi> Falſe witneſſes are ſought for, and hired: they agree
not, but ſhame their ſuborners. Woe is me, what ſafety can there be for Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
when the evidence is wilfully corrupted? What State was ever ſo pure,
as not to yield ſome miſcreants, that will either ſell or lend an oath? What a
brand hath the wiſdome of God ſet upon falſhood, even diſſonance and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
whereas Truth ever holds together, and jars not whiles it is it ſelf. O
Saviour, what a perfect innocence was in thy Life, what an exact purity in thy
Doctrine, that malice it ſelf cannot ſo much as deviſe what to ſlander? It
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> were hard if Hell ſhould not finde ſome Factors upon earth. At laſt two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
are brought in, that have learned to agree with themſelves, whiles they
differed from truth; they ſay the ſame, though falſe; <hi>This fellow ſaid, I am able
to deſtroy the Temple of God, and build it again in three daies.</hi> Perjured wretches!
Were theſe the terms that you heard from that Sacred mouth? Said he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
thus as ye have depoſed? It is true, he ſpake of a Temple, of deſtroying,
of building, of three daies; but did he ſpeak of that Temple, of his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying,
of a material building in that ſpace? He ſaid, <hi>Deſtroy ye:</hi> Ye ſay,
<hi>I am able to deſtroy.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>this Temple of his body:</hi> Ye ſay, <hi>the Temple of

                     <hi>I am able in three daies to build this</hi> material <hi>Temple of God.</hi> The words were
his, the ſentence yours: The words were true, the evidence falſe. So whiles
you report the words and miſreport the ſenſe, ye ſwear a true falſhood,
aud are truly forſworn. Where the reſolutions are fixed, any colour will
ſerve. Had thoſe words been ſpoken, they contained no crime; had he been
ſuch as they ſuppoſed him, a mere man, the ſpeech had carried a ſemblance
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:44233:114"/>
of oſtentation, no ſemblance of Blaſphemy: yet how vehement is <hi>Caiaphas</hi> for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
an anſwer? as if thoſe words had already battered that ſacred pile, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
of his ability had been the higheſt treaſon againſt the God of the
Temple. That infinite Wiſdome knew well how little ſatisfaction there could
be in anſwers, where the ſentence was determined; <hi>Jeſus held his peace.</hi> Where
the asker is unworthy, the queſtion captious, words bootleſſe, the beſt anſwer
is ſilence.</p>
                  <p>Erewhile his juſt and moderate ſpeech to <hi>Annas</hi> was returned with a buffet
on the cheek, now his ſilence is no leſſe diſpleaſing. <hi>Caiaphas</hi> was not more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
then crafty: what was in vain attempted by witneſſes, ſhall be drawn
out of Chriſts own mouth; what an accuſation could not effect, an adjuration <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
ſhall; <hi>I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Chriſt,
the Son of God.</hi> Yea, this was the way to ſcrew out a killing anſwer. <hi>Caiaphas,</hi>
thy mouth was impure, but thy charge is dreadfull. Now if <hi>Jeſus</hi> hold his
peace, he is cried down for a prophane diſregarder of that awfull Name; if he
anſwer, he is enſnared: an affirmation is death; a denial worſe then death. No,
<hi>Caiaphas,</hi> thou ſhalt well know it was not fear that all this while ſtopped that
Gracious mouth: thou ſpeakeſt to him that cannot fear thoſe faces he hath
made: he that hath charged us to confeſſe him, cannot but confeſſe himſelf;
<hi>Jeſus ſaith unto him, Thou haſt ſaid. There is a time to ſpeak, and a time to keep
ſilence.</hi> He that is the Wiſdome of his Father, hath here given us a pattern <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
of both. We may not ſo ſpeak as to give advantage to cavils; we may not be
ſo ſilent as to betray the Truth. Thou ſhalt have no more cauſe, proud and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
<hi>Caiaphas,</hi> to complain of a ſpeechleſſe priſoner: now thou ſhalt hear
more then thou demandedſt; <hi>Hereafter ſhall ye ſee the Son of man ſitting on the
right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of Heaven.</hi> There ſpake my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
<hi>the voice of God, and not of man.</hi> Hear now, inſolent High Prieſt, and be
confounded. That Son of man whom thou ſeeſt, is the Son of God whom thou
canſt not ſee: That Son of man, that Son of God, that God and man whom
thou now ſeeſt ſtanding deſpicably before thy Conſiſtorial ſeat in a baſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectedneſſe,
him ſhalt thou once with horrour and trembling ſee majeſtically <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
ſitting on the Throne of Heaven, attended with thouſand thouſands of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and coming in the clouds to that dreadfull Judgment, wherein thy ſelf
amongſt other damned malefactors ſhalt be preſented before that glorious tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
of his, and adjudged to thy juſt torments.</p>
                  <p>Goe now, wretched Hypocrite, and rend thy garments; whiles in the mean
time thou art worthy to have thy Soul rent from thy body, for thy ſpightfull
Blaſphemy againſt the Son of God. Onwards thy pretence is fair, and ſuch as
cannot but receive applauſe from thy compacted crue; <hi>What need have we of

                  </p>
                  <p>What heed is to be taken of mens judgment? So light are they upon the

of their ſentence.</p>
                  <p>O Saviour, this is not the laſt time wherein thou haſt received cruel dooms
from them that profeſſe Learning and Holineſs. What wonder is it if thy weak
members ſuffer that which was indured by ſo perfect an head? What care we
to be judged by man's day, when thou, who art the Righteous Judge of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>

let looſe upon thee: what meaſure can be too hard for him that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
worthy of death? Now thoſe foul mouths defile thy Bleſſed Face
with their impure ſpittle, the venemous froth of their malice; now thoſe cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
hands are lifted up to buffet thy Sacred Cheeks; now ſcorn and inſultation
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:44233:114"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> triumphs over thine humble Patience, <hi>Propheſie unto us, thou Chriſt, who it is

Thou art bound, who cameſt to looſe the bands of death; thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,

                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean while, how can I enough wonder at thy infinite Mercy, who

back upon thy frail and ingratefull Diſciple; and in whoſe gracious eare <hi>Peter</hi>'s
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Cock ſounded louder then all theſe reproaches? O Saviour, thou who in thine
apprehenſion couldſt forget all thy danger, to correct and heal his over-laſhing,
now in the heat of thy arraignment and condemnation canſt forget thy own
miſery, to reclaim his errour; and by that ſeaſonable glance of thine eye,
to ſtrike his heart with a needfull remorſe. He that was lately ſo valiant to
fight for thee, now the next morning is ſo cowardly as to deny thee: He ſhrinks
at the voice of a Maid, who was not daunted with the ſight of a Band. O <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
had thy ſlip been ſudden, thy fall had been more eaſie: Premonition ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates
thy offence; that ſtone was foreſhewed thee whereat thou ſtumbledſt:
neither did thy warning more adde to thy guilt, then thine own fore-reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> How didſt thou vow, though thou ſhouldſt die with thy Maſter, not to
deny him? Hadſt thou ſaid nothing, but anſwered with a trembling ſilence,
thy ſhame had been the leſſe. Good purpoſes, when they are not held, do ſo
far turn enemies to the entertainer of them, as that they help to double both
his ſin and puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Yet a ſingle denial had been but eaſie; thine (I fear to ſpeak it) was lined
with ſwearing and execration. Whence then, oh whence was this ſo vehement
and peremptory diſclamation of ſo gracious a Maſter? What ſuch danger had
attended thy profeſſion of his attendance? One of thy fellows was known to
the high-prieſt for a Follower of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> yet he not onely came himſelf into
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that open Hall, in view of the Bench, but treated with the Maid that kept the
door to let thee in alſo. She knew him what he was; and could therefore
ſpeak to thee, as brought in by his mediation, <hi>Art not thou alſo one of this mans
Diſciples? Thou alſo</hi> ſuppoſes the firſt acknowledged ſuch; yet what crime,
what danger was urged upon that noted Diſciple? What could have been more
to thee? Was it that thy heart miſgave thee thou mighteſt be called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for <hi>Malchus?</hi> It was no thank to thee that that eare was healed; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did there want thoſe that would think how near that eare was to the head.
Doubtleſſe, that buſie fellow himſelf was not far off, and his fellows and kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
would have been apt enough to follow thee (beſides thy Diſcipleſhip)
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> upon a bloodſhed, a riot, a reſcue. Thy conſcience hath made thee thus unduly
timorous: and now, to be ſure to avoid the imputation of that affray, thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceſt
all knowledge of him in whoſe cauſe thou foughteſt. Howſoever the
ſin was hainous. I tremble at ſuch a Fall of ſo great an Apoſtle. It was thou,
O <hi>Peter,</hi> that buffetedſt thy Maſter more then thoſe Jews; it was to thee that
he turned the cheek from them, as to view him by whom he moſt ſmarted:
he felt thee afar off, and anſwered thee with a look; ſuch a look as was able to
kill and revive at once. Thou haſt wounded me (maieſt thou now ſay) O my
Saviour, <hi>thou haſt wounded my heart with one of thine eyes:</hi> that one Eye of thy
Mercy hath wounded my heart with a deep remorſe for my grievous ſin, with
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> an indignation at my unthankfulneſſe; that one glance of thine hath reſolved
me into the tears of ſorrow and contrition. <hi>Oh that mine eyes were fountains,</hi>
and my cheeks channels that ſhall never be dryed! <hi>And Peter went out, and wept
bitterly.</hi>

<hi>Tiberius</hi> had befriended them too well with ſo favourable
a Governour as <hi>Pilate.</hi> Had they had the power of life and death
in their hands, they had not been beholden to an Heathen for a Legal murder.
I know not whether they more repine at this ſlavery, or pleaſe themſelves to
think how cleanly they can ſhift off this blood into anothers hand. Theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
great Maſters of <hi>Iſrael</hi> flock from their own Conſiſtory to <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Judgment-hall.
The Sentence had been theirs, the Execution muſt be his; and now they
hope to bear down <hi>Jeſus</hi> with the ſtream of that frequent confluence.</p>
                  <p>But what ailes you, O ye Rulers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that ye ſtand thus thronging at the
door? why do ye not go in to that publick room of Judicature, to call for
that Juſtice ye came for? Was it for that ye would not defile your ſelves with
the contagion of an Heathen roof? Holy men! your Conſciences would not
ſuffer you to yield to ſo impure an act; your Paſſeover muſt be kept, your
perſons muſt be clean: whiles ye exſpect Juſtice from the man, ye abhor the
pollution of the place. Woe to you Prieſts, Scribes, Elders, Hypocrites; can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
there be any roof ſo unclean as that of your own breaſts? Not <hi>Pilate</hi>'s walls,
but your hearts are impure. Is Murder your errand, and do you ſtick at a local
infection? <hi>God ſhall ſmite</hi> you, ye <hi>whited walls.</hi> Do ye long to be ſtained with
blood, with the blood of God? and do ye fear to be defiled with the touch of
<hi>Pilate</hi>'s pavement? Doth ſo ſmall a gnat ſtick in your throats, whiles ye ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
ſuch a Camel of flagitious wickedneſſe? Goe out of your ſelves, ye falſe
diſſemblers, if ye would not be unclean. <hi>Pilate,</hi> onwards, hath more cauſe to
fear leſt his walls ſhould be defiled with the preſence of ſo prodigious Monſters
of Impiety.</p>
                  <p>That plauſible Governour condeſcends to humour their Superſtition: They <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
dare not come in to him; he yields to goe forth to them. Even <hi>Pilate</hi> begins
juſtly, <hi>What accuſation bring you againſt this man?</hi> It is no judging of Religion
by the outward demeanour of men; there is more Juſtice amongſt <hi>Romans</hi> then
amongſt Jews. Theſe malicious Rabbies thought it enough that they had ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced
<hi>Jeſus;</hi> no more was now exſpected but a ſpeedy execution. <hi>If he were
not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.</hi> Civil Juſtice
muſt be their hangman. It is enough conviction that he is delivered up to the
ſecular powers. Themſelves have judged, theſe other muſt kill. <hi>Pilate</hi> and
<hi>Caiaphas</hi> have changed places: this Pagan ſpeaks that Law and Juſtice which
that High prieſt ſhould have done; and that High prieſt ſpeaks thoſe murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
incongruities which would better have beſeemed the mouth of a Pagan.
What needs any new triall? Doſt thou know, <hi>Pilate,</hi> who we are? Is this the
honour that thou giveſt to our ſacred Prieſthood? Is this thy valuation of our
Sanctity? Had the baſeſt of the vulgar complained to thee, thou couldſt but
have put them to a review. Our Place and Holineſſe lookt not to be diſtruſted.
If our ſcrupulous Conſciences ſuſpect thy very walls, thou maieſt well think
there is ſmall reaſon to ſuſpect our Conſciences. Upon a full hearing, ripe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation,
and exquiſitely-judicial proceeding, we have ſentenced this Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
to death: there needs no more from thee but thy command of Execution.
Oh monſter, whether of Malice or Unjuſtice! Muſt he then be a Malefactor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
whom ye will condemn? Is your bare word ground enough to ſhed blood?
Whom did ye ever kill but the righteous? By whoſe hands periſhed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets?
The word was but miſtaken; ye ſhould have ſaid, <hi>If we had not been
Malefactors, we had never delivered up this innocent man unto thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It muſt needs be notoriouſly unjuſt which very Nature hath taught Pagans

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to abhor. <hi>Pilate</hi> ſees and hates this bloody ſuggeſtion and practice. <q>Do ye pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
Holineſs, and urge ſo injurious a violence? If he be ſuch as ye accuſe
him, where is his conviction? If he cannot be legally convicted, why ſhould
he die? Do you think I may take your complaint for a crime? If I muſt judge
for you, why have you judged for your ſelves? Could ye ſuppoſe that I
would condemn any man unheard? If your Jewiſh Laws yield you this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws yield it not to me. It is not for me to judge after your
laws, but after our own. Your prejudgment may not ſway me. Since ye

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> O <hi>Pilate,</hi> how happy had it been for thee, if thou hadſt held thee there?
thus thou hadſt waſh'd thy hands more clean then in all thy baſons. Might
Law have been the rule of this Judgment, and not Malice, this blood had not
been ſhed. How palpably doth their tongue bewray their heart? <hi>It is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for us to put any man to death. Pilate</hi> talks of Judgment, they talk of Death.
This was their only aime: Law was but a colour, Judgment was but a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
Death was their drift, and without this nothing. Blood-thirſty Prieſts
and Elders! it is well that this power of yours is reſtrained: no Innocence
could have been ſafe, if your lawleſſe will had had no limits. It were pity this
ſword ſhould be in any but juſt and ſober hands. Your fury did not alwaies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with Law: what Law allowed your violence to <hi>Stephen,</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi>
and your deadly attempts againſt this Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom ye now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute?
How lawfull was it for you to procure that death which ye could not
inflict? It is all the care of Hypocrites to ſeek umbrages and pretences for
their hatefull purpoſes; and to make no other uſe of Laws (whether Divine or
humane)
but to ſerve turns.</p>
                  <p>Where death is fore-reſolved, there cannot want accuſations. Malice is not
ſo barren as not to yield crimes enough. <hi>And they began to accuſe him, ſaying,
We found this fellow perverting the nation; and forbidding to give tribute unto
Caſear, ſaying that he himſelf is Chriſt and King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                     <q>What accuſations ſaidſt thou, O <hi>Pilate?</hi> Hainous &amp; capital. Thou mighteſt
have believed our confident intimation: but ſince thou wilt needs urge us to
particulars, know that we come furniſhed with ſuch an inditement as ſhall
make thine ears glow to hear it. Beſides that Blaſphemy whereof he hath
been condemned by us, this man is a Seducer of the people, a raiſer of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
an uſurper of Soveraignty.</q> O impudent ſuggeſtion! What marvel is it,
O Saviour, if thine honeſt ſervants beloaded with ſlanders, when thy moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
perſon eſcaped not ſo ſhamefull criminations? Thou a perverter of the
Nation, who taughteſt the way of God truly? Thou a forbidder of Tribute,
who payedſt it, who preſcribedſt it, who provedſt it to be <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s due? Thou a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> challenger of temporal Soveraignty, who avoidedſt it, renouncedſt it, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedſt
to come to ſerve? Oh the forehead of Malice! Goe, ye ſhameleſſe tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
and ſwear that Truth is guilty of all Falſhood, Juſtice of all Wrong; and
that the Sun is the only cauſe of Darkneſſe, Fire of Cold.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Pilate</hi> ſtartles at the Charge. The name of Tribute, the name of <hi>Caeſar</hi>
is in mention: Theſe potent ſpells can fetch him back to the common Hall,
and call <hi>Jeſus</hi> to the Bar. There, O Saviour, ſtandſt thou meekly to be judged,
who ſhalt once come to judge the quick and the dead. Then ſhall he before
whom thou ſtoodſt guiltleſſe and dejected, ſtand before thy dreadfull Majeſty
guilty and trembling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> The name of a King, of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> is juſtly tender and awfull; the leaſt whiſper
of an Uſurpation or diſturbance is entertained with a jealous care. <hi>Pilate</hi> takes
this intimation at the firſt bound; <hi>Art thou then the King of the Jews?</hi> He felt
his own free-hold now touched, it was time for him to ſtir. <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks
were now famouſly known to be near expiring. Many arrogant and buſie
ſpirits (as <hi>Judas</hi> of <hi>Galilee, Theudas,</hi> and that <hi>Egyptian</hi> Seducer) taking that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:44233:116"/>
advantage, had raiſed ſeveral Conſpiracies, ſet up new titles to the Crown,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
gathered Forces to maintain their falſe claims. Perhaps <hi>Pilate</hi> ſuppoſed ſome
ſuch buſineſſe now on foot, and therefore asks ſo curiouſly, <hi>Art thou the King
of the Jewes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that was no leſſe Wiſdome then Truth, thought it not beſt either to
affirm or deny at once. Sometimes it may be extremely prejudicial to ſpeak
all truths. To diſclaim that Title ſuddenly which had been of old given him
by the Prophets, at his Birth by the Eaſtern Sages, and now lately at his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
by the acclaming multitude, had been injurious to himſelf; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
and challenge it abſolutely, had been unſafe, and needleſly provoking.
By wiſe and juſt degrees therefore doth he ſo affirm this truth, that he both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
ſatisfies the inquirer, and takes off all perill and prejudice from his aſſertion.
<hi>Pilate</hi> ſhall know him a King; but ſuch a King as no King needs to fear, as all
Kings ought to acknowledge and adore: <hi>My Kingdome is not of this world.</hi> It
is your miſtaking, O ye earthly Potentates, that is guilty of your fears. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>
hears of a King born, and is troubled; <hi>Pilate</hi> hears of a King of the Jews,
and is incenſed. Were ye not ignorant, ye could not be jealous: Had ye lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to diſtinguiſh of Kingdomes, theſe ſuſpicions would vaniſh.</p>
                  <p>There are Secular Kingdomes, there are Spirituall; neither of theſe trenches
upon other: your Kingdome is Secular, Chriſts is Spirituall; both may, both
muſt ſtand together. His Laws are Divine, yours civil: His Reign is eternall,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
yours temporall: the glory of his Rule is inward, and ſtands in the Graces of
Sanctification, Love, Peace, Righteouſneſs, Joy in the Holy Ghoſt; yours in
outward pomp, riches, magnificence: His Enemies are the Devil, the World,
the Fleſh; yours are bodily uſurpers, and externall peace-breakers: His
Sword is the power of the Word and Spirit, yours materiall: His rule is over
the Conſcience, yours over bodies and lives: He puniſhes with Hell, ye with
temporal death or torture. Yea ſo far is he from oppoſing your Government,
that <hi>by him ye Kings reign:</hi> your Scepters are his; but to maintain, not to
wield, not to reſiſt. O the unjuſt fears of vain men! He takes not away your
earthly Kingdomes, who gives you Heavenly; he diſcrowns not the Body, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
crowns the Soul; his intention is not to make you leſſe great, but more happy,</p>
                  <p>The charge is ſo fully anſwered, that <hi>Pilate</hi> acquits the priſoner. The Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Maſters ſtand ſtill without; their very malice dares not venture their pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
in going in to proſecute their accuſation. <hi>Pilate</hi> hath examined him
within; and now comes forth to theſe eager complainants, with a cold anſwer
to their over-hot expectation; <hi>I finde in him no fault at all.</hi> O noble teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Chriſt's Innocence from that mouth which afterwards doomed him to
death! What a difference there is betwixt a man as he is himſelf, and as he
is the ſervant of others wills? It is <hi>Pilate</hi>'s tongue that ſaies, <hi>I finde in him no
fault at all:</hi> It is the Jews tongue in <hi>Pilate</hi>'s mouth that ſaies, <hi>Let him be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
That cruell ſentence cannot blot him whom this atteſtation cleareth.
Neither doth he ſay, I finde him not guilty in that whereof he is accuſed; but
gives an univerſal acquittance of the whole carriage of Chriſt, <hi>I finde in him no
fault at all.</hi> In ſpight of Malice, Innocence ſhall finde abettors. Rather then
Chriſt ſhall want witneſſes, the mouth of <hi>Pilate</hi> ſhall be opened to his juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
How did theſe Jewiſh blood-ſuckers ſtand thunder-ſtricken with ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exſpected
a word? His abſolution was their death; his acquital their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.
<hi>No fault,</hi> when we have found Crimes? <hi>no fault at all,</hi> when we have
condemned him for capital offences? How palpably doth <hi>Pilate</hi> give us the
lie? How ſhamefully doth he affront our authority and diſparage our juſtice?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
So ingenuous a teſtimony doubtleſſe exaſperated the fury of theſe Jews: the
fire of their indignation was ſeven-fold more intended with the ſenſe of their
repulſe.</p>
                  <p>I tremble to think how juſt <hi>Pilate</hi> as yet was, and how ſoon after depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
yea how mercifull together with that Juſtice. How ſain would he have
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:44233:116"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> freed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whom he found faultleſſe? Corrupt cuſtome, in memory of their
deliverance from <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, allowed to gratifie the Jews with the
free delivery of ſome one priſoner. (Tradition would be incroaching: the
Paſchal Lamb was monument enough of that happy reſcue: men affect to have
ſomething of their own.) <hi>Pilate</hi> was willing to take this advantage of diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<hi>Jeſus.</hi> That he might be the more likely to prevail, he propoſeth him
with the choice and nomination of ſo notorious a Malefactor as he might juſtly
think uncapable of all mercy; <hi>Barabbas,</hi> a Thief, a Murderer, a Seditionary;
infamous for all, odious to all. Had he propounded ſome other innocent priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
he might have feared the election would be doubtfull; he cannot miſdoubt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the competition of ſo prodigious a Malefactor. <hi>Then they all cried again, Not
him, but Barabbas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O Malice beyond all example ſhameleſſe and bloody! Who can but bluſh to
think that an Heathen ſhould ſee Jews ſo impetuouſly unjuſt, ſo ſavagely
cruell? He knew there was no fault to be found in <hi>Jeſus;</hi> he knew there was
no Crime that was not to be found in <hi>Barabbas:</hi> yet he hears (and bluſhes to
hear) them ſay, <hi>Not him, but Barabbas.</hi> Was not this (think we) out of ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of condition? Every thing affects the like to it ſelf; every thing affects
the preſervation of that it liketh. What wonder is it then if ye Jews, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
your ſelves the murderers of that Juſt One, favour a <hi>Barabbas?</hi> O Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> what a killing indignity was this for thee to hear from thine own Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Haſt thou refuſed all Glory, to put on ſhame and miſery for their ſakes?
Haſt thou diſregarded thy Bleſſed ſelf, to ſave them? and do they refuſe thee
for <hi>Barabbas?</hi> Haſt thou ſaid, Not Heaven, but Earth; not Soveraignty, but
Service; not the Gentile, but the Jew? and do they ſay, Not him, but <hi>Barab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas?
Do ye thus requite the Lord, O ye fooliſh people</hi> and unjuſt? Thus were thine
ears and thine eyes firſt crucified; and through them was thy Soul wounded
even to death, before thy death; whiles thou ſaweſt their rage, and heardſt
their noiſe of <hi>Crucifie, crucifie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pilate</hi> would have chaſtiſed thee. Even that had been a cruell mercy from
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> him; for what evil hadſt thou done? But that cruelty had been true mercy
to this of the Jews, whom no blood would ſatisfie but that of thy heart. He
calls for thy Fault, they call for thy Puniſhment; as proclaiming thy Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion
is not intended to ſatisfie Juſtice, but Malice, <hi>They cried the more, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
him, Crucifie him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As their clamour grew, ſo the Preſidents Juſtice declined. Thoſe Graces that
lie looſe and ungrounded, are eaſily waſht away with the firſt tide of Popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Thrice had that man proclaimed the Innocence of him whom he now
inclines to condemn, <hi>willing to content the people.</hi> Oh the fooliſh aimes of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition!
Not God, not his Conſcience come into any regard; but the People.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> What a baſe Idol doth the proud man adore? even the Vulgar, which a baſe
man deſpiſeth. What is their applauſe but an idle winde? what is their anger
but a painted fire? O <hi>Pilate,</hi> where now is thy ſelf and thy people? whereas
a good conſcience would have ſtuck by thee for ever, and have given thee
boldneſs before the face of that God which thou and thy people ſhall never
have the Happineſs to behold.</p>
                  <p>The Jews have plaid their firſt part; the Gentiles muſt now act theirs. Cruell
<hi>Pilate,</hi> who knew <hi>Jeſus</hi> was <hi>delivered for envie,</hi> accuſed falſly, maliciouſly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued,
hath turned his profered chaſtiſement into ſcourging; <hi>Then Pilate took
Jeſus and ſcourged him.</hi> Woe is me, dear Saviour; I feel thy laſhes; I ſhrink
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> under thy painfull whippings; thy nakedneſs covers me with ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.
That tender and precious body of thine is galled and torn with cords.
Thou that didſt of late water the garden of <hi>Gethſemani</hi> with the drops of
thy bloody ſweat, doſt now bedew the pavement of <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Hall with the

of Murder, whoſe very trade was killing, and whoſe looks were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to prevent their hands? Theſe, for the greater terrour of their concourſe,
are called together; and whether by the connivence or the command of their
wicked Governour, or by the inſtigation of the malicious Jews, conſpire to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
his death with ſcorns, which they will after inflict with violence.</p>
                  <p>O my Bleſſed Saviour, was it not enough that thy Sacred body was ſtripped
of thy garments, and waled with bloody ſtripes, but that thy Perſon muſt be
made the mocking-ſtock of thine inſulting enemies, thy Back diſguiſed with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
purple robes, thy Temples wounded with a thornie Crown, thy Face ſpate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
thy Cheeks buffeted, thy Head ſmitten, thy Hand ſceptred with a reed,
thy ſelf derided with wrie mouths, bended knees, ſcoffing acclamations? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent
Souldiers! whence is all this jeering and ſport, but to flout Majeſty? All
theſe are the ornaments and ceremonies of a Royal Inauguration, which now
in ſcorn ye caſt upon my deſpiſed Saviour. Goe on, make your ſelves merry
with this jolly paſtime. Alas! long agoe ye now feel whom ye ſcorned. Is
he a King, think you, whom ye thus plai'd upon? Look upon him with gnaſhing
and horrour, whom ye look'd at with mockage and inſultation. Was not that
Head fit for your Thorns, which you now ſee crowned with Glory and Majeſty?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
Was not that Hand fit for a Reed, whoſe iron Scepter cruſhes you to death?
Was not that Face fit to be ſpate upon, from the dreadfull aſpect whereof ye
are ready to deſire the mountains to cover you?</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, whither, O whither doſt thou ſtoop, O thou coeternal
Son of thine eternal Father? whither doſt thou abaſe thy ſelf for me? I have
ſinned, and thou art puniſhed; I have exalted my ſelf, and thou art dejected;
I have clad my ſelf with ſhame, and thou art ſtripped; I have made my ſelf
naked, and thou art clothed with robes of diſhonour; my head hath deviſed
evil, and thine is pierced with thorns; I have ſmitten thee, and thou art ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
for me; I have diſhonoured thee, and thou for my ſake art ſcorned; Thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
art made the ſport of men for me, that have deſerved to be inſulted on by
Devils.</p>
                  <p>Thus diſguiſed, thus bleeding, thus mangled, thus deformed art thou
brought forth, whether for compaſſion, or for a more univerſal deriſion, to the
furious multitude, with an <hi>Ecce homo, Behold the man:</hi> look upon him, O ye
mercileſſe Jews; ſee him in his ſhame, in his wounds and blood, and now ſee
whether ye think him miſerable enough. Ye ſee his Face blew and black with
buffeting, his Eyes ſwoln, his Cheeks beſlabbered with ſpittle, his Skin torn
with ſcourges, his whole Body bathed in blood; and would ye yet have more?
<hi>Behold the man;</hi> the man whom ye envied for his greatneſſe, whom ye feared <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
for his uſurpation: Doth he not look like a King? is he not royally dreſſed?
See whether his magnificence do not command reverence from you. Would ye
wiſh a Finer King? Are ye not afraid he will wreſt the Scepter out of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s
hand? <hi>Behold the man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, and behold him well, O thou proud <hi>Pilate,</hi> O ye cruel Souldiers, O ye
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:44233:117"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> inſatiable Jews. Ye ſee him baſe, whom ye ſhall ſee glorious: the time ſhall
ſurely come wherein ye ſhall ſee him in another dreſſe: he ſhall ſhine whom ye
now ſee to bleed; his Crown cannot be now ſo ignominious and painfull, as
it ſhall be once majeſtical and precious; ye who now bend your knees to him in
ſcorn, ſhall ſee all knees both in Heaven and in earth and under the earth to
bow before him in an awfull adoration; ye that now ſee him with contempt,
ſhall behold him with horrour.</p>
                  <p>What an inward war do I yet finde in the breaſt of <hi>Pilate?</hi> His Conſcience
bids him ſpare, his Popularity bids him kill. His Wife warned by a Dream,
warns him to have no hand in the blood of that juſt man; the importunate
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> multitude preſſes him for a ſentence of death. All ſhifts have been tried to free
the man whom he hath pronounced innocent: All violent motives are urged to
condemn that man whom malice pretends guilty.</p>
                  <p>In the height of this ſtrife, when Conſcience and moral Juſtice were ready
to ſway <hi>Pilate</hi>'s diſtracted heart to a juſt diſmiſſion, I hear the Jews cry out,
<hi>If thou let this man goe, thou art not Caeſar's friend.</hi> There is the word that ſtrikes
it dead: it is now no time to demur any more. In vain ſhall we hope that a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
heart can prefer the care of his Soul to the care of his ſafety and honour,
God to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Now <hi>Jeſus</hi> muſt die: <hi>Pilate</hi> haſts into the Judgment hall; the
Sentence ſticks no longer in his teeth, <hi>Let him be crucified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Yet how foul ſo ever his Soul ſhall be with this fact, his hands ſhall be clean;
<hi>He took water and waſht his hands before the multitude, ſaying, I am innocent of
the blood of this juſt perſon: ſee ye to it.</hi> Now all is ſafe I wis: this is expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
enough; water can waſh off blood, the hands can cleanſe the heart: proteſt
thou art innocent, and thou canſt not be guilty. Vain Hypocrite! canſt thou
think to eſcape ſo? Is Murder of no deeper dye? Canſt thou dream waking
thus to avoid the charge of thy wives dream? Is the guilt of the blood of the Son
of God to be wip'd off with ſuch eaſe? What poor ſhifts do fooliſh ſinners make
to beguile themſelves? Any thing will ſerve to charm the Conſcience, when
it liſts to ſleep.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> But, O Saviour, whiles <hi>Pilate</hi> thinks to waſh off the guilt of thy blood with
water, I know there is nothing that can waſh off the guilt of this his ſin but thy
blood. Oh do thou waſh my Soul in that precious bathe, and I ſhall be clean,
Oh <hi>Pilate,</hi> if that very blood which thou ſheddeſt do not waſh off the guilt of
thy bloodſhed, thy water doth but more defile thy Soul, and intend that fire
wherewith thou burneſt.</p>
                  <p>Little did the deſperate Jews know the weight of that blood, which they
were ſo forward to wiſh upon themſelves and their children. Had they depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
their intereſt in that horrible murder, they could not ſo eaſily have avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the vengeance: but now that they fetch it upon themſelves by a willing
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> execration, what ſhould I ſay, but that they long for a curſe? it is pity they
ſhould not be miſerable. And have ye not now felt, O Nation worthy of
plagues, have ye not now felt what blood it was whoſe guilt ye affected? Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
hundred years are now paſſed ſince you wiſhed your ſelves thus wretched:
have ye not been ever ſince the hate and ſcorn of the world? Did ye not live
(many of you) to ſee your City buried in aſhes, and drowned in blood?
to ſee your ſelves no Nation? Was there ever people under Heaven that was
made ſo famous a ſpectacle of miſerie and deſolation? Have ye yet enough
of that blood which ye called for upon your ſelves and your children? Your
former cruelties, uncleanneſſes, Idolatries coſt you but ſome ſhort Captivities;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> God cannot but be juſt: this Sin under which you now lie groaning and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn,
muſt needs be ſo much greater then theſe, as your vaſtation is more; and
what can that be other then the murder of the Lord of Life? Ye have what ye

                  <p>THe ſentence of Death is paſt, and now who can with dry eyes behold the
ſad pomp of my Saviours bloody execution? All the ſtreets are full
of gazing ſpectators, waiting for this ruefull ſight. At laſt, O Saviour,
there thou comeſt out of <hi>Pilate</hi>'s gate, bearing that which ſhall ſoon
bear thee. To expect thy Croſſe was not torment enough; thou muſt carry it.
All this while thou ſhalt not only ſee, but feel thy death before it come; and
muſt help to be an agent in thine owne Paſſion. It was not out of favour, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
thoſe ſcornfull robes being ſtripped off, thou art led to death in thine own
cloaths. So was thy face beſmeared with blood, ſo ſwoln and diſcoloured with
buffetings, that thou couldſt not have been known, but by thy wonted habit.
Now thine inſulting enemies are ſo much more imperiouſly cruell, as they
are more ſure of their ſucceſſe. Their mercileſſe tormentings have made thee
half dead already: yet now, as if they had done nothing, they begin afreſh;
and will force thy weakned and fainting nature to new tasks of pain. The
tranſverſe of thy Croſſe (at leaſt) is upon thy ſhoulder: when thou canſt
ſcarce goe, thou muſt carry. One kicks thee with his foot, another ſtrikes thee
with his ſtaffe, another drags thee haſtily by thy cord, and more then one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
ſpur on thine unpitied wearineſſe with angry commands of haſt. Oh true form
and ſtate of a ſervant! All thy former actions, O Saviour, were (though pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
yet) free; this, as it is in itſelf ſervile, ſo it is tyrannouſly inforced: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
yet more upon thee by thy own Love to mankind, then by their power
and deſpight. It was thy Father that <hi>laid upon</hi> thee <hi>the iniquity of us all:</hi> It
was thine own Mercy that cauſed thee to bear our ſins upon the Croſſe, and to
bear the Croſſe (with the curſe annexed to it) for our ſins. How much more
voluntary muſt that needs be in thee, which thou requireſt to be voluntarily
undertaken by us? It was thy charge, <hi>If any man will come after me, let him
deny himſelf, and take up his croſſe and follow me.</hi> Thou didſt not ſay, Let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
him bear his croſſe as forceably impoſed by another; but, <hi>Let him take up
his croſſe,</hi> as his free burden: free in reſpect of his heart, not in reſpect of his
hand: ſo free, that he ſhall willingly undergoe it, when it is laid upon him; not
ſo free as that he ſhall lay it upon himſelf unrequired. O Saviour, thou didſt
not ſnatch the Croſſe out of the Souldiers hands, and caſt it upon thy ſhoulder;
but when they laid it on thy neck, thou underwenteſt it. The conſtraint was
theirs, the will was thine. It was not ſo heavy to them, or to <hi>Simon,</hi> as it was to
thee; they felt nothing but the wood, thou felteſt it clogged with the load of
the ſins of the whole world. No marvell if thou faintedſt under that ſad bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
thou that beareſt up the whole earth by thy word, didſt ſweat, and pant,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
and groan under this unſupportable carriage. O bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> how could I be
confounded in my ſelf to ſee thee, after ſo much loſſe of blood and over-toiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of pain, languiſhing under that fatal tree? And yet why ſhould it more
trouble me to ſee thee ſinking under thy Croſſe now, then to ſee thee anone
hanging upon thy Croſſe? In both thou wouldſt render thy ſelf weak and
miſerable, that thou mighteſt ſo much the more glorifie thy infinite mercy in
ſuffering.</p>
                  <p>It is not out of any compaſſion of thy miſery, or care of thine eaſe, that
<hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> is forced to be the porter of thy Croſſe; it was out of their
own eagerneſſe of thy diſpatch: thy feeble paces were too ſlow for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
their thirſt after thy blood made them impatient of delay. If thou have
wearily ſtrugled with the burden of thy ſhame all along the ſtreets of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
when thou com'ſt once paſt the gates, an helper ſhall be deputed to thee:
the expedition of thy death was more ſweet to them, then the pain of a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring
paſſage. What thou ſaidſt to <hi>Judas,</hi> they ſay to the Executioner, <hi>What
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:44233:118"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> thou doeſt, doe quickly.</hi> Whiles thou yet liveſt, they cannot be quiet, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſafe: to haſten thine end, they lighten thy carriage.</p>
                  <p>Hadſt thou done this out of choice which thou didſt out of conſtraint, how
I ſhould have envied thee, O <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> as too happy in the honour to
be the firſt man that bore that Croſſe of thy Saviour, wherein millions of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Martyrs have (ſince that time) been ambitious to ſucceed thee? Thus to
bear thy Croſſe for thee, O Saviour, was more then to bear a crown from
thee. Could I be worthy to be thus graced by thee, I ſhould pity all other
glories.</p>
                  <p>Whiles thou thus paſſeſt, O dear <hi>Jeſu,</hi> the ſtreets and waies reſound
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> not all with one note. If the malicious Jews and cruell Souldiers inſulted
upon thee, and either haled or railed thee on with a bitter violence, thy
faithfull Followers were no leſſe loud in their moans and ejulations;
neither would they indure that the noiſe of their cries and lamentations
ſhould be drowned with the clamour of thoſe reproches: but eſpecially
thy Bleſſed Mother, and thoſe other zealous aſſociates of her own Sex, were
moſt paſſionate in their wailings. And why ſhould I think that all that devout
multitude which ſo lately cried <hi>Hoſanna</hi> in the ſtreets, did not alſo bear
their part in theſe publick condolings? Though it had not concerned thy ſelf,
O Saviour, thine ears had been ſtill more open to the voice of grief then of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> malice: and ſo thy lips alſo are open to the one, ſhut to the other; <hi>Daughters
of Jeruſalem, weep not for me, but weep for your ſelves and for your children.</hi>
Who would not have thought, O Saviour, that thou ſhouldſt have been
wholly taken up with thine own ſorrows? The expectation of ſo bitter
a Death had been enough to have overwhelmed any Soul but thine: yet
even now can thy gracious eye finde time to look beyond thine own miſeries,
at theirs; and to pity them, who, inſenſible of their own inſuing condition,
mourned for thine now preſent. They ſee thine extremity, thou fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeſt
theirs; they powre out their ſorrow upon thee, thou diverteſt it upon
themſelves. We ſilly creatures walk blindefolded in this vale of tears,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and little know what evil is towards us: only what we feel we know; and
whiles we feel nothing, can finde leiſure to beſtow our commiſeration on
thoſe who need it perhaps leſſe then our ſelves. Even now, O Saviour,
when thou wert within the view of thy <hi>Calvary,</hi> thou canſt foreſee and
pity the vaſtation of thy <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and giveſt a ſad Prophecy of the
imminent deſtruction of that City which lately had coſt thee tears, and
now ſhall coſt thee blood. It is not all the indign cruelty of men that can rob
thee of thy Mercy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> could not want Malefactors, though <hi>Barabbas</hi> was diſmiſſed.
That all this execution might ſeem to be done out of the zeal of Juſtice, two
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> capital offenders, adjudged to their Gibbet, ſhall accompany thee, O Saviour,
both to thy death and in it. They are led manicled after thee, as leſſe criminous:
no ſtripes had diſabled them from bearing their own Croſſes. Long agoe was
this unmeet ſociety foretold by thine Evangelical Seer, <hi>He was taken from priſon
and from judgment; He was cut out of the land of the living; He made his grave
with the Wicked.</hi> O bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> it had been diſparagement enough to thee to
be forted with the beſt of men (ſince there is much ſin in the perfecteſt, and
there could be no ſin in thee;) but to be matched with the ſcum of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
whom vengeance would not let to live, is ſuch an indignity as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds
my thoughts. Surely there is no Angel in Heaven but would have
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> been proud to attend thee; and what could the earth afford worthy of thy
train? yet malice hath ſuited thee with company next to Hell; that their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſſe
might reflect upon thee, and their Sin might ſtain thine Innocence.
Ye are deceived, O ye fond Judges: This is the way to grace your dying
malefactors; this is not the way to diſgrace him whoſe guiltleſneſſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
triumph'd over your injuſtice: his preſence was able to make your
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:44233:119"/>
Thieves happy; their preſence could no more blemiſh him then your own.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
Thus guarded, thus attended, thus accompanied art thou, Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> led to
that loathſome and infamous hill, which now thy laſt blood ſhall make Sacred:
now thou ſetteſt thy foot upon that riſing ground which ſhalt prevent thine
<hi>Olivet,</hi> whence thy Soul ſhall firſt aſcend into thy Glory.</p>
                  <p>There whiles thou art addreſſing thy ſelf for thy laſt Act, thou art preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with that bitter and farewell-potion wherewith dying Malefactors were
wont to have their ſenſes ſtupified, that they might not feel the torments
of their execution. It was but the common mercy of men to alleviate the
death of Offenders; ſince the intent of their laſt doom is not ſo much pain, as
diſſolution.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>That draught, O Saviour, was not more welcome to the guilty then hatefull
unto thee. In the vigor of all thine inward and outward ſenſes, thou wouldſt
incounter the moſt violent aſſaults of death, and ſcornedſt to abate the leaſt
touch of thy quickeſt apprehenſion. Thou well kneweſt that the work thou
wenteſt about would require the uſe of all thy powers; it was not thine eaſe
that thou ſoughteſt, but our Redemption; neither meanteſt thou to yield to
thy laſt enemy, but to reſiſt and to overcome him: which that thou mighteſt
doe the more gloriouſly, thou challengedſt him to doe his worſt; and in the
mean time wouldſt not disfurniſh thy ſelf of any of thy powerfull faculties.
This greateſt combat that ever was ſhall be fought on even hand: neither <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
wouldſt thou ſteal that Victory which thou now atchievedſt over Death and
Hell. Thou didſt but touch at this cup; it is a far bitterer then this that thou
art now drinking up to the dregs: thou refuſedſt that which was offered thee
by men, but that which was mixed by thine eternal Father (though mere Gall
and Wormwood) thou didſt drink up to the laſt drop. And therein, O Bleſſed
<hi>Jeſu,</hi> lies all our health and ſalvation. I know not whether I do more ſuffer in
thy pain, or joy in the iſſue of thy Suffering.</p>
                  <p>Now, even now, O Saviour, art thou entring into thoſe dreadfull liſts, and
now art thou grapling with thy laſt enemy; as if thou hadſt not ſuffered till
now, now thy bloody Paſſion begins: a cruell expoliation begins that violence.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
Again do theſe grim and mercileſſe Souldiers lay their rude hands upon thee,
and ſtrip thee naked; again are thoſe bleeding wales laid open to all eyes;
again muſt thy Sacred body undergoe the ſhame of an abhorred nakedneſſe.
Lo, thou that clotheſt man with raiment, beaſts with hides, fiſhes with ſcales
and ſhells, earth with flowers, Heaven with Stars, art deſpoiled of cloaths,
and ſtandeſt expoſed to the ſcorn of all beholders. As the Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> entred
into his Paradiſe, ſo doſt thou (the Second <hi>Adam</hi>) into thine, naked; and as the
Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was clothed with Innocence when he had no cloaths, ſo wert thou
(the Second) too: and more then ſo; thy nakedneſſe, O Saviour, cloaths our
Souls not with Innocence only, but with Beauty. Hadſt not thou been naked,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
we had been cloathed with confuſion. O happy nakedneſſe, whereby we are
covered from ſhame! O happy ſhame, whereby we are inveſted with glory!
All the beholders ſtand wrapped with warm garments; thou only art ſtripped
to tread the wine-preſſe alone. How did thy Bleſſed Mother now wiſh her
veile upon thy ſhoulders? and that Diſciple who lately ran from thee naked,
wiſh'd in vain that his loving pity might doe that for thee, which fear forced
him to for himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Shame is ſucceeded with Pain. Oh the torment of the Croſſe! Methinks
I ſee and feel, how having faſtned the tranſverſe to the body of that fatal
Tree, and lai'd it upon the ground, they racked and ſtrained thy tender and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
ſacred Lims, to fit the extent of their fore-appointed meaſure; and having
tentered out thine arms beyond their natural reach, how they faſtned them
with cords, till thoſe ſtrong iron nails (which were driven up to the head
through the palms of thy Bleſſed hands) had not more firmly then pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
fixed thee to the Gibbet. The tree is raiſed up, and now not without a

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> vehement concuſſion ſetled in the mortiſe. Woe is me, how are thy joynts

how doth thine own weight torment thee, whiles thy whole body reſts
upon this forced and dolorous hold, till thy nailed feet bear their part in a no
leſſe afflictive ſupportation? How did the rough iron pierce thy Soul, whiles
paſſing through thoſe tender and ſenſible parts it carried thy fleſh before it, and
as it were rivetted it to that ſhamefull Tree?</p>
                  <p>There now, O dear <hi>Jeſu,</hi> there thou hangeſt between Heaven and earth,
naked, bleeding, forlorn, deſpicable, the ſpectacle of miſeries, the ſcorn of men.
Be abaſhed, O ye Heavens and earth, and all ye creatures wrap up your ſelves
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in horrour and confuſion, to ſee the ſhame and pain and curſe of your moſt
pure and Omnipotent Creator. How could ye ſubſiſt, whiles he thus ſuffers in
whom ye are? O Saviour, didſt thou take fleſh for our Redemption to be
thus indignely uſed, thus mangled, thus tortured? Was this meaſure fit to be
offered to that Sacred body that was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt of the pure
ſubſtance of an immaculate Virgin? Woe is me; that which was unſpotted with
ſin, is all blemiſhed with humane crueltie, and ſo wofully disfigured, that the
Bleſſed Mother that bore thee could not now have known thee; ſo bloody
were thy Temples, ſo ſwolne and diſcoloured was thy Face, ſo was the skin of
thy whole body ſtreaked with red and blew ſtripes, ſo did thy thornie diadem
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſhade thine Heavenly countenance, ſo did the ſtreams of thy blood cover and
deform all thy parts. The eye of Senſe could not diſtinguiſh thee, O dear Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
in the neareſt proximity to thy Croſſe: the eye of Faith ſees thee in all
this diſtance; and by how much more ignominy, deformity, pain it finds in
thee, ſo much more it admires the glory of thy mercy. Alas! is this the Head
that is decked by thine eternall Father with a Crown of pure gold, of immortall
and incomprehenſible Majeſty, which is now buſhed with thorns? Is this the
Eye that ſaw the Heavens opened, and the Holy Ghoſt deſcending upon that
head, that ſaw ſuch reſplendence of Heavenly brightneſſe on mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> which
now begins to be overclouded with death? Are theſe the Eares that heard
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the voice of thy Father owning thee out of Heaven, which now tingle with
buffettings, and glow with reproaches, and bleed with thorns? Are theſe the
Lips that <hi>ſpake as never mans ſpake, full of grace and power,</hi> that called out
dead <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that ejected the ſtubborneſt Devils, that commanded the cure
of all diſeaſes, which now are ſwoln with blows, and diſcoloured with blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

which the Angels of Heaven ſo deſired to ſee, and can never be ſatisfied with
ſeeing, that is thus foul with the naſty mixtures of ſweat, and blood, and ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings

by their touch healed the lame, the deaf, the blind, which are now bleeding
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> with the nailes? Are theſe the Feet which walked lately upon the liquid pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the ſea, before whoſe footſtool all the Nations of the earth are bidden
to worſhip, that are now ſo painfully fixed to the Croſſe? O cruell and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull
mankind, that offered ſuch meaſure to the Lord of Life! O infinitely
mercifull Saviour, that wouldſt ſuffer all this for unthankfull mankind! That
fiends ſhould doe theſe things to guilty ſouls, it is (though terrible, yet) juſt;
but that men ſhould doe thus to the Bleſſed Son of God, it is beyond the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of our horrour.</p>
                  <p>Even the moſt hoſtile diſpoſitions have been only content to kill; Death
hath ſated the moſt eager malice: thine enemies, O Saviour, held not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſatisfied, unleſſe they might injoy thy torment. Two Thieves are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be thy companions in death; thou art deſigned to the midſt, as the chief
malefactor: on whether hand ſoever thou lookeſt, thine eye meets with an
hatefull partner. But, O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> how ſhall I enough admire and celebrate
thy infinite Mercy, who madeſt ſo happy an uſe of this Jewiſh deſpight, as to
improve it to the occaſion of the Salvation of one, and the comfort of millions?
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:44233:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Is not this, as the laſt, ſo the greateſt ſpecialty of thy wonderfull compaſſion, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
convert that dying Thief? with thoſe nailed hands to ſnatch a Soul out of the
mouth of Hell? Lord, how I bleſſe thee for this work? how doe I ſtand ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
at this, above all other the demonſtrations of thy Goodneſſe and Power?
The Offender came to die: nothing was in his thoughts but his guilt and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<hi>whiles he was yet in his blood,</hi> thou <hi>ſaidſt, This Soul ſhall live.</hi> Ere yet the
intoxicating Potion could have time to work upon his brain, thy Spirit infuſes
Faith into his heart. He that before had nothing in his eye but preſent death
and torture, is now lifted up above his Croſſe in a bleſſed ambition; <hi>Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
me when thou comeſt into thy Kingdome.</hi> Is this the voice of a Thief, or
of a Diſciple? Give me leave, O Saviour, to borrow thine own words; <hi>Verily <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
I have not found ſo great faith, no not in all Iſrael.</hi> He ſaw thee hanging miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
by him, and yet ſtyles thee <hi>Lord;</hi> he ſaw thee dying, yet talks of thy <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi>
he felt himſelf dying, yet talks of a future <hi>remembrance.</hi> O Faith
ſtronger then death, that can look beyond the Croſſe at a Crown; beyond
diſſolution at a remembrance of Life and Glory! Which of thine eleven were
heard to ſpeak ſo gracious a word to thee in theſe thy laſt pangs? After thy
Reſurrection and knowledge of thine impaſſible condition it was not ſtrange
for them to talk of thy Kingdome; but in the midſt of thy ſhamefull death,
for a dying malefactor to ſpeak of thy reigning, and to implore thy remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of himſelf in thy Kingdome, it is ſuch an improvement of Faith as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſheth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
my Soul with admiration. O bleſſed Thief, that haſt thus happily
ſtolne Heaven! How worthy hath thy Saviour made thee to be a partner of his
ſufferings, a pattern of undauntable belief, a ſpectacle of unſpeakable mercy?
<hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> Before I wondred at thy Faith;
now I envy at thy Felicity. Thou cravedſt a remembrance; thy Saviour ſpeaks
of a preſent poſſeſſion, <hi>This day:</hi> thou ſuedſt for remembrance as a favour
to the abſent; thy Saviour ſpeaks of thy preſence with him: thou ſpakeſt
of a Kingdome; thy Saviour of Paradiſe. As no Diſciple could be more
faithfull, ſo no Saint could be happier. O Saviour, what a precedent is this of
thy free and powerfull grace? Where thou wilt give, what unworthineſſe can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
barre us from Mercy? when thou wilt give, what time can prejudice our voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
who can deſpair of thy goodneſſe, when he that in the morning was
poſting towards Hell, is in the evening with thee in Paradiſe? Lord, he could
not have ſpoken this to thee, but by thee, and from thee. What poſſibility was
there for a thief to think of thy Kingdome, without thy Spirit? That good
Spirit of thine breathed upon this man, breathed not upon his fellow; their
trade was alike, their ſin was alike, their ſtate alike, their croſſe alike, only thy
Mercy makes them unlike: One is taken, the other is refuſed. Bleſſed be thy
Mercy in taking one; bleſſed be thy Juſtice in leaving the other. Who can
deſpair of that Mercy? who cannot but tremble at that Juſtice?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, O ye cruell Prieſts and Elders of the Jews, ye have full leiſure to
feed your eyes with the ſight ye ſo much longed for; there is the blood ye
purchaſed: and is not your malice yet glutted? Is not all this enough, without
your taunts and ſcoffs and ſports at ſo exquiſite a miſery? The people, the
paſſengers are taught to inſult, where they ſhould pity. Every man hath a
ſcorn ready to caſt at a dying innocent. A generous nature is more wounded
with the tongue, then with the hand. O Saviour, thine eare was more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
pierced then thy brows, or hands, or feet. It could not but goe deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy Soul, to hear theſe bitter and girding reproaches from them thou cameſt
to ſave.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, alas! what ſleabitings were theſe in compariſon of thoſe inward tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which thy Soul felt in the ſenſe and apprehenſion of thy Fathers wrath
for the ſins of the whole world, which now lay heavy upon thee for ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
This, oh this was it that preſſed thy Soul as it were to the nethermoſt
hell. Whiles thine eternall Father lookt lovingly upon thee, what didſt thou,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:44233:120"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> what neededſt thou to care for the frowns of men or Devils? but when he once
turn'd his face from thee, or bent his brows upon thee, this, this was worſe
then death. It is no marvel now, if darkneſs were upon the face of the
whole earth, when thy Fathers face was eclipſed from thee by the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our ſins. How ſhould there be light in the world without, when the
God of the world, the Father of lights, complains of the want of light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in?
That word of thine, O Saviour, was enough to fetch the Sun down out of
Heaven, and to diſſolve the whole frame of Nature, when thou criedſt, <hi>My God,
my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Oh what pangs were theſe, dear <hi>Jeſu,</hi> that
drew from thee this complaint? Thou well kneweſt nothing could be more
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> cordial to thine enemies, then to hear this ſad language from thee: they
could ſee but the outſide of thy ſufferings; never could they have concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſo deep an anguiſh of thy Soul, if thy own lips had not expreſſed it.
Yet as not regarding their triumph, thou thus powreſt out thy ſorrow:
and when ſo much is uttered, who can conceive what is felt?</p>
                  <p>How is it then with thee, O Saviour, that thou thus aſtoniſheſt men and
Angels with ſo woful a quiritation? Had thy God left thee? Thou not
long ſince ſaidſt, <hi>I and my Father are One:</hi> Are ye now ſevered? Let
this thought be as farre from my Soul, as my Soul from Hell. No more
can thy Bleſſed Father be ſeparated from thee, then from his own Eſſence.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> His Union with thee is eternal; his Viſion was intercepted: He could not
withdraw his Preſence, he would withdraw the influence of his comfort.
Thou, the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> ſtoodſt for mankind upon this Tree of the Croſs,
as the Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood and fell for mankind under the Tree of Offence.
Thou bareſt our ſins; thy Father ſaw us in thee, and would puniſh us in thee,
thee for us: how could he but withhold comfort where he intended cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement?
Herein therefore he ſeems to forſake thee for the preſent, in
that he would not deliver thee from that bitter Paſſion which thou wouldſt
undergoe for us. O Saviour, hadſt thou not been thus forſaken, we had
periſhed; thy dereliction is our ſafety: and however our narrow Souls are
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> not capable of the conceit of thy pain and horror; yet we know there can
be no danger in the forſaking, whiles thou canſt ſay, <hi>My God.</hi> He is ſo thy God
as he cannot be ours: all our right is by Adoption, thine by Nature; thou
art one with him in eternal Eſſence, we come in by Grace and merciful electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
yet whiles thou ſhalt inable me to ſay, <hi>My God,</hi> I ſhall hope never to ſink
under thy deſertions.</p>
                  <p>But whiles I am tranſported with the ſenſe of thy Sufferings, O Saviour, let
me not forget to admire thoſe ſweet Mercies of thine which thou powredſt
out upon thy Perſecutors. They rejoyce in thy death, and triumph in thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
and ſcoff at thee in both: In ſtead of calling down fire from Heaven
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> upon them, thou heapeſt coals of fire upon their heads; <hi>Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they doe.</hi> They blaſpheme thee, thou prayeſt for them;
they ſcorn, thou pitieſt; they ſin aganſt thee, thou prayeſt for their forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
they profeſs their malice, thou pleadeſt their ignorance. O compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
without example, without meaſure, fit for the Son of God, the Saviour
of men! Wicked and fooliſh Jewes! ye would be miſerable, he will not let
you: ye would fain pull upon your ſelves the guilt of his blood, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precates
it: ye kill, he ſues for your remiſſion and life. His tongue cries
louder then his blood, <hi>Father, forgive them.</hi> O Saviour, thou couldſt not but
be heard. Thoſe who out of ignorance and ſimplicity thus perſecuted thee, find
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the happy iſſue of thine interceſſion. Now I ſee whence it was that three
thouſand ſouls were converted ſoon after at one Sermon. It was not <hi>Peter</hi>'s
ſpeech, it was thy prayer, that was thus effectual. Now they have grace to
know and confeſs whence they have both forgiveneſs and ſalvation, and can
recompence their blaſphemies with thankſgiving. What ſin is there, Lord,
whereof I can deſpair of the remiſſion, or what offence can I be unwilling to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:44233:121"/>
remit, when thou prayeſt for the forgiveneſs of thy murderers and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no day ſo long but hath his evening. At laſt, O bleſſed Saviour,
thou art drawing to an end of theſe painful ſufferings, when ſpent with toil
and torment thou crieſt out, <hi>I thirſt.</hi> How ſhouldſt thou do other? O dear
<hi>Jeſu,</hi> how ſhouldſt thou do other then thirſt? The night thou hadſt ſpent
in watching, in prayer, in agony, in thy conveyance from the Garden to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
from <hi>Annas</hi> to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> from <hi>Caiaphas</hi> to <hi>Pilate,</hi> in thy reſtleſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
in buffetings and ſtripes; the day in arraignments, in haling from place

tugging under thy Croſs, in woundings and diſtenſion, in pain and paſſion:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
No marvel if thou thirſtedſt. Although there was more in this drought then
thy need: It was no leſs requiſite thou ſhouldſt thirſt, then that thou
ſhouldſt dye: Both were upon the ſame predetermination, both upon the
ſame prediction. How elſe ſhould that word be verified, Pſal. 22. 14, 15.
<hi>All my bones are out of joynt; my heart is like waxe, it is melted in the midſt of
my bowels: My ſtrength is dried up like a potſherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my
jawes; and thou haſt brought me into the duſt of death?</hi> Had it not been to make
up that word whereof one jot cannot paſs, though thou hadſt felt this thirſt, yet
thou hadſt not bewrayed it. Alas! what could it avail to bemoan thy wants
to inſulting enemies, whoſe ſport was thy miſery? How ſhould they pity thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
thirſt, that pitied not thy bloodſhed? It was not their favour that thou expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedſt
herein, but their conviction. O Saviour, how can we, thy ſinful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
think much to be exerciſed with hunger and thirſt, when we hear thee
thus complain?</p>
                  <p>Thou that not long ſince proclaimedſt in the Temple, <hi>If any man thirſt, let
him come to me and drink: He that believeth in me, out of his belly ſhall flow
rivers of living waters,</hi> now thy ſelf thirſteſt: Thou in whom we believe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineſt
to want ſome drops; thou hadſt the command of all the waters both
above the firmament and below it, yet thou wouldſt thirſt. Even ſo, Lord, thou
that wouldſt dye for us, wouldſt thirſt for us. O give me to thirſt after thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
waters which thou promiſeſt, whatever become of thoſe waters which thou
wouldſt want. The time was, when craving water of the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> thou gaveſt
better then that thou askedſt. Oh give me to thirſt after that more precious
Water; and ſo do thou give me of that water of life, that I may never thirſt
again.</p>
                  <p>Bleſſed God, how marvelouſly doſt thou contrive thine own affaires? Thine
enemies whiles they would deſpight thee, ſhall unwittingly juſtifie thee and
convince themſelves. As thou fore ſaidſt, <hi>In thy thirſt, they gave thee vineger
to drink.</hi> Had they given thee Wine, thou hadſt not taken it; the night before
thou hadſt taken leave of that comfortable liquor, reſolving to drink no more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
of that ſweet juice till thou ſhouldſt drink it new with them in thy Fathers
Kingdome. Had they given thee Water, they had not fulfilled that prediction,
whereby they were ſelf-condemned. I know not now, O dear <hi>Jeſu,</hi> whether
this laſt draught of thine were more pleaſing to thee or more diſtaſtful: Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtful
in it ſelf (for what liquor could be equally harſh?) pleaſing, in that
it made up thoſe Sufferings thou wert to indure, and thoſe Propheſies thou

                  <p>Now there is no more to doe, thy full conſummation of all predictions, of

Lo, thou that art the Mediator betwixt God and man, the reconciler
of Heaven and earth, art lift up betwixt earth and Heaven, that thou mighteſt

Even whiles thou ſuffereſt, thou reigneſt. Oh the impotent madneſs of

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Earth and Hell have done their worſt. O Saviour, thou art in thy Paradiſe,
and triumpheſt over the malice of men and Devils: The remainders of thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
perſon are not yet free. The Souldiers have parted thy garments, and
caſt lots upon thy ſeamleſs coat (thoſe poor ſpoils cannot ſo much inrich them
as glorifie thee, whoſe Scriptures are fulfilled by their barbarous ſortitions.)
The Jews ſue to have thy bones divided; but they ſue in vain. No more could
thy garments be whole then thy body could be broken. One inviolable Decree
over-rules both. Fooliſh executioners! ye look up at that crucified Body, as
if it were altogether in your power and mercy; nothing appears to you but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence
and death: little do ye know what an irreſiſtible guard there is upon
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that Sacred corps; ſuch as if all the Powers of Darkneſs ſhall band againſt, they

                  </p>
                  <p>Still the infallible Decree of the Almighty leads you on to his own ends,
through your own waies. Ye ſaw him already dead, whom ye came to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch:
thoſe bones therefore ſhall be whole, which ye had had no power to
break. But yet, that no piece either of your cruelty or of Divine prediction
may remain unſatisfied, he whoſe bones may not be impaired, ſhall be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

of the ſouldiers with a ſpear pierced his ſide, and forthwith there came out blood
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and water.</hi> Malice is wont to end with life; here it overlives it. Cruel man!
what means this ſo late wound? what commiſſion hadſt thou for this bloody
act? <hi>Pilate</hi> had given leave to break the bones of the living, he gave no leave
to gore the ſide of the dead: what wicked ſupererogation is this? what a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity
of maliciouſneſs? To what purpoſe did thy ſpear pierce ſo many hearts
in that one? why wouldſt thou kill a dead man? Methinks the Bleſſed Virgin,
and thoſe other paſſionate aſſociates of hers, and the Diſciple whom <hi>Jeſus</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
together with the other of his fellows, the friends and followers of Chriſt,
and eſpecially he that was ſo ready to draw his ſword upon the troup of his

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the bounds of patience at ſo ſavage a ſtroke: their ſorrow could not chuſe but
turn to indignation, and their hearts could not but riſe (as even mine doth

But, O God, when I look up to theee, and conſider how thy holy and wiſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
ſo overrules the moſt barbarous actions of men, that (beſides their
will) they turn beneficial, I can at once hate them, and bleſs thee. This very
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:44233:122"/>
wound hath a mouth to ſpeak the Meſſiahſhip of my Saviour, and the truth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
of thy Scripture, <hi>They ſhall look at him whom they have pierced.</hi> Behold now
the Second <hi>Adam</hi> ſleeping, and out of his ſide formed the Mother of the living,
the Evangelical Church. Behold the Rock which was ſmitten, and the waters
of life guſhed forth. Behold <hi>the fountain that is ſet open to the houſe of David,
for ſin and for uncleanneſs;</hi> a fountain not of water only, but of blood too.
O Saviour, by thy water we are waſhed, by thy blood we are redeemed. Thoſe
two Sacraments which thou didſt inſtitute alive, flow alſo from thee dead, as
the laſt memorials of thy Love to thy Church: the water of Baptiſme, which
is <hi>the laver of Regeneration; the blood of the new Teſtament ſhed for remiſsion of

three Witneſſes on earth, whoſe atteſtation cannot fail us. Oh precious and
ſoveraign wound, by which our Souls are healed! Into this cleft of the rock
let my Dove fly and enter, and there ſafely hide her ſelf from the talons of
all the birds of prey.</p>
                  <p>It could not be but that the death of Chriſt, contrived and acted at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
in ſo ſolemn a Feſtival, muſt needs draw a world of beholders: The <hi>Romans,</hi>
the Centurion and his band, were there as actors, as ſuperviſors of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Thoſe ſtrangers were no otherwiſe ingaged, then as they that would hold
fair correſpondence with the Citizens where they were engariſoned: their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from prejudice rendred them more capable of an ingenuous conſtruction <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
of all events. <hi>Now when the Centurion and they that were with him that watched
Jeſus ſaw the Earthquake, and the things that were done, they feared greatly, and
glorified God, and ſaid, Truely this was the Son God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What a marvelous concurrence is here of ſtrong and irrefragable convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
Meekneſs in ſuffering, Prayer for his murderers, a faithful reſignation
of his Soul into the hands of his Heavenly Father, the Sun eclipſed, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
darkned, the earth trembling, the graves open, the rocks rent, the veile of
the Temple torn; who could goe leſs then this, <hi>Truly this was the Son of
God?</hi> He ſuffers patiently; this is through the power of Grace; many good
men have done ſo through his enabling. The frame of Nature ſuffers with him; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
this is proper to the God of Nature, the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>I wonder not that theſe men confeſſed thus; I wonder that any Spectator
confeſſed it not: theſe proofs were enough to fetch all the world upon their
knees, and to have made all mankind a Convert. But all hearts are not alike;
no means can work upon the wilfully-obdured. Even after this the Souldier
pierced that Bleſſed ſide; and whiles Pagans relented, Jews continued im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent.
Yet even of that Nation, thoſe beholders whom envie and partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

they were deeply affected with the mortal indignities which were offered to

at thoſe powerful demonſtrations of the Deity of him in whom they believed;
and ſtrangely diſtracted in their thoughts, whiles they compared thoſe Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings

could he die? His Reſurrection, his Aſcenſion, ſhould ſoon after perfect their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſaweſt thy dear Son and Saviour thus indignely uſed, thus ſtripped, thus
ſtretched, thus nailed, thus bleeding, thus dying, thus pierced? How did thy
troubled heart now recount what the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> had reported to thee from
God in the meſſage of thy bleſſed Conception of that Son of God? How didſt
thou think of the miraculous formation of that thy Divine burden by the
power of the Holy Ghoſt? How didſt thou recal thoſe prophecies of <hi>Anna</hi> and
<hi>Simeon</hi> concerning him, and all thoſe ſupernatural works of his, the irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
proofs of his Godhead? and laying all theſe together, with the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
infirmities of his Paſſion, how wert thou crucified with him? The care
that he took for thee in the extremity of his torments, could not chuſe but
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> melt thy heart into ſorrow: But oh, when in the height of his pain and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thou heardſt him cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>
what a cold horrour poſſeſſed thy Soul? I cannot now wonder at thy qualms
and ſwoonings; I could rather wonder that thou ſurvivedſt ſo ſad an hour.
But when recollecting thy ſelf, thou ſaweſt the Heavens to bear a part with
thee in thy mourning, and felteſt the earth to tremble no leſs then thy ſelf,
and foundſt that the dreadful concuſſion of the whole frame of Nature proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Deity of him that would thus ſuffer and dye, and remembredſt his
frequent predictions of drinking this bitter cup, and of being baptized thus in
blood; thou beganſt to take heart, and to comfort thy ſelf with the aſſured
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> exſpectation of the glorious iſſue. More then once had he foretold thee his
victorious Reſurrection. He who had openly profeſſed <hi>Jonas</hi> for his type, and
had fore-promiſed in three daies to raiſe up the ruined Temple of his Body, had
doubtleſs given more full intimation unto thee, who hadſt ſo great a ſhare in
that ſacred body of his. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by Faith.</hi> Lo, that Faith of thine in
his enſuing Reſurrection, and in his triumph over death, gives thee life, and
chears up thy drouping Soul, and bids it in an holy confidence to triumph over
all thy fears and ſorrows; and him whom thou now ſeeſt dead and deſpiſed,
repreſents unto thee living, immortal, glorious.</p>

                  <p>GRace doth not ever make ſhow where it is. There is much ſecret ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
both in the earth and ſea, which never eye ſaw. I never heard
any news till now of <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea:</hi> yet was he eminently
both rich, and wiſe, and good; a worthy, though cloſe Diſciple
of our Saviour. True Faith may be wiſely reſerved, but will not be cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly.
Now he puts forth himſelf and dares beg the Body of <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Death is wont to end all quarrels. <hi>Pilate</hi>'s heart tells him he hath done
too much already, in ſentencing an innocent to death: no doubt that Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion
had related unto him the miraculous ſymptoms of that Paſſion. He
that ſo unwillingly condemned Innocence, could rather have wiſhed that juſt
man alive, then have denied him dead. The body is yielded, and taken
down; and now, that which hung naked upon the Croſs, is wrapped in
fine linen; that which was ſoiled with ſweat and blood, is curiouſly wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
and embalmed. Now even <hi>Nicodemus</hi> comes in for a part, and fears
not the envie of a good profeſſion. Death hath let that man looſe, whom
the Law formerly over-awed with reſtraint. He hates to be a night-bird
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> any longer; but boldly flies forth, and looks upon the face of the Sun, and
will be now as liberal in his Odors, as he was before niggardly in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
O Saviour, the earth was thine and the fulneſs of it; yet as thou
hadſt not an houſe of thine own whiles thou livedſt, ſo thou hadſt not a
grave when thou wert dead. <hi>Joſeph</hi> that rich Councellor lent thee his:
lent it ſo, as it ſhould never be reſtored: thou took'ſt it but for a while;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:44233:123"/>
but that little touch of that Sacred Corps of thine made it too good for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
the owner.</p>
                  <p>O happy <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that hadſt the honour to be Landlord of the Lord of
life! how well is thy houſe-room repai'd with a <hi>manſion not made with hands,
eternall in the heavens?</hi> Thy Garden and thy Tombe were hard by <hi>Calva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
where thou couldſt not fail of many monitions of thy frailty. How oft
hadſt thou ſeaſoned that new Tombe with ſad and ſavory meditations? and
hadſt oft ſaid within thy ſelf, Here I ſhall once lye down to my laſt reſt, and
wait for my Reſurrection? Little didſt thou then think to have been diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by ſo Bleſſed a gueſt; or that thy grave ſhould be again ſo ſoon
empty, and in that emptineſs uncapable of any mortal in-dweller. How glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
doſt thou now reſign thy grave to him in whom thou liveſt, and who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
for ever, whoſe Soul is in Paradiſe, whoſe Godhead every where? Hadſt
thou not been rich before, this gift had enriched thee alone, and more enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
thee then all thine earthly Honour. Now great Princes envie thy boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and have thought themſelves happy to kiſs the ſtones of that rock which
thou thus hewedſt, thus beſtowedſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus purely wrapped and ſweetly embalmed lyes the precious body of
our Saviour in <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s new vault. Are ye now alſo at reſt, O ye Jewiſh
Rulers? Is your malice dead and buried with him? Hath <hi>Pilate</hi> enough
ſerved your envie and revenge? Surely it is but a common hoſtility that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
can die; yours ſurviveth death, and puts you upon a further project. <hi>The
chief Prieſts and Phariſees came together unto Pilate, ſaying, Sir, we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that this Deceiver ſaid whiles he was yet alive, After three daies I will
riſe again: Command therefore that the Sepulcher be made ſure till the third
day; leſt his Diſciples come by night, and ſteal him away, and ſay to the people,
he is riſen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How full of terrors and inevitable perplexities is guiltineſs? Theſe men
were not more troubled with envie at Chriſt alive, then now with fear of his
Reſurrection. And what can now ſecure them? <hi>Pilate</hi> had helpt to kill him;
but who ſhall keep him from riſing? Wicked and fooliſh Jewes! how fain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
would ye fight againſt God, and your own hearts? How gladly would ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
your ſelves, in believing him to be a Deceiver whom your conſciences
knew to be no leſs true then powerful? <hi>Lazarus</hi> was ſtill in your ey: That
man was no phantaſme; his death, his reviving was undeniable; the ſo freſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſcitation
of that dead body after four daies diſſolution was a manifeſt convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Omnipotence. How do ye vainly wiſh that he could deceive you in
the fore-reporting of his own Reſurrection? Without a Divine power he
could have raiſed neither <hi>Lazarus</hi> nor himſelf: with and by it, he could as well
raiſe himſelf as <hi>Lazarus.</hi> What need we other witneſſes then your own
mouths? That which he would doe, ye confeſs he foretold; that the truth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
of his word might anſwer the power of this deed, and both of them might
argue him the God of Truth and Power, and your ſelves enemies to both. And
now what muſt be done? The Sepulcher muſt be ſecured, and you with it:
An huge ſtone, a ſtrong guard muſt doe the deed: and that ſtone muſt be ſealed,
that guard of your own deſigning. Methinks I hear the Souldiers and buſy Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
when they were rolling that other weighty ſtone (for ſuch we probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
to the mouth of the vault with much toile and ſweat and breathleſneſs,
how they brag'd of the ſureneſs of the place and unremovableneſs of that load;
and when that ſo choice a Watch was ſet, how they boaſted of their valour and
vigilance, and ſaid, they would make him ſafe from either riſing or ſtealing. Oh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
the madneſs of impotent men, that think by either wile or force to fruſtrate
the will and deſigns of the Almighty! How juſtly doth that wiſe and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Arbiter of the world laugh them to ſcorn in Heaven, and befool them in
their own vain devices? O Saviour, how much evidence had thy Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
wanted, if theſe enemies had not been thus maliciouſly provident?
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:44233:123"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> how irrefragable is thy riſing made by theſe bootleſs endeavours of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention?</p>
                  <p>All this while the devout <hi>Maries</hi> keep cloſe, and ſilently ſpend their
Sabbath in a mixture of grief and hope. How did they wear out thoſe
ſad hours in bemoaning themſelves each to other; in mutual relations
of the patient ſufferings, of the happy expiration of their Saviour, of the
wonderfull events both in the Heavens and earth that accompanied his
Crucifixion, of his frequent and clear Predictions of his Reſurrection? And
now they have gladly agreed (ſo ſoon as the time will give them leave) in the
dawning of the Sunday morning to viſit that dear Sepulcher. Neither will
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> they goe empty-handed? She that had beſtowed that coſtly Alabaſter-box of
Ointment upon their Saviour alive, hath prepared no leſs precious Odors for
him dead.</p>
                  <p>Love is reſtleſs and fearleſs. In the dark of night theſe good Women goe
to buy their ſpices, and ere the day-break are gone out of their houſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Tomb of Chriſt to beſtow them. This Sex is commonly fearful;
it was much for them to walk alone in that unſafe ſeaſon: yet, as deſpiſing all
fears and dangers, they thus ſpend the night after their Sabbath. Might they
have been allowed to buy their Perfumes on the Sabbath, or to have viſited
that holy Tomb ſooner, can we think they would have ſtaid ſo long? can we
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſuppoſe they would have cared more for the Sabbath then for the <hi>Lord of the
Sabbath,</hi> who now kept his Sabbath in the Grave? Sooner they might not
come, later they would not, to preſent their laſt homage to their dead Saviour.
Had theſe holy women known their <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be alive, how had they haſted,
who made ſuch ſpeed to doe their laſt offices to his ſacred Corps? For us, we
<hi>know that our Redeemer liveth;</hi> we know where he is. O Saviour, how cold
and heartleſs is our love to thee, if we do not haſt to finde thee in thy Word and
Sacraments; if our Souls do not fly up to thee in all holy Affections into thy
Heaven?</p>
                  <p>Of all the Women <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> is firſt named, and in ſome Evangeliſts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
alone: She is noted above her fellows. None of them were ſo much obliged,
none ſo zealouſly thankful: Seven Devils were caſt out of her by the command
of Chriſt. That Heart which was freed from Satan by that powerful diſpoſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was now poſſeſſed with a free and gracious bounty to her deliverer. Twice
at the leaſt hath ſhe powred out her fragrant and coſtly Odors upon him.
Where there is a true ſenſe of favour and beneficence, there cannot but be
a fervent deſire of retribution. O Bleſſed Saviour, could we feel the danger
of every ſin, and the malignity of thoſe ſpiritual poſſeſſions from which thou
haſt freed us, how ſhould we pour out our ſelves into thankfulneſs unto
thee?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Every thing here had horrour. The Place, both ſolitary and a Sepulcher:
Nature abhors, as the viſage, ſo the region of Death and Corruption. The
Time, Night; onely the Moon gave them ſome faint glimmering, (for this
being the ſeventeenth day of her age, afforded ſome light to the later part of
the night.) The Buſineſs, the viſitation of a dead Corps. Their zealous
Love hath eaſily overcome all theſe. They had followed him in his Sufferings
when the Diſciples-left him; they attended him to his Croſs weeping; they
followed him to his Grave, and ſaw how <hi>Joſeph</hi> laid him: even there they leave
him not, but, ere it be day-light, return to pay him the laſt tribute of their
duty. How much <hi>ſtronger is Love then death?</hi> O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> why ſhould
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> not we imitate thy love to us? Thoſe <hi>whom thou loveſt, thou loveſt to the
end,</hi> yea in it, yea after it: even when we are dead, not our Souls onely,
but our very duſt is dearly reſpected of thee. What condition of thine
ſhould remove our affections from thy perſon in Heaven, from thy lims
on earth?</p>
                  <p>Well did theſe worthy Women know what <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> and <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:44233:124"/>
had done to thee; they ſaw how curiouſly they had wrapped thee, how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
preciouſly they had embalmed thee: yet, as not thinking others beneficence
could be any juſt excuſe of theirs, they bring their own Odors to thy Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be perfumed by the touch of thy Sacred body. What thank is it to us
that others are obſequious to thee, whiles we are ſlack or niggardly? We may
rejoyce in others forwardneſs; but if we reſt in it, how ſmall joy ſhall it be to
us, to ſee them goe to Heaven without us?</p>
                  <p>When on the Friday-evening they attended <hi>Joſeph</hi> to the intombing
of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> they mark'd the place, they mark'd the paſſage, they mark'd
that inner grave-ſtone which the owner had fitted to the mouth of that
tomb; which all their care is now to remove; <hi>Who ſhall roll away the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
ſtone?</hi> That other more weighty load wherewith the vault was barred, the
ſeal, the guard ſet upon both, came not perhaps into their knowledge;
this was the private plot of <hi>Pilate</hi> and the Prieſts, beyond the reach of their
thoughts.</p>
                  <p>I do not hear them ſay, How ſhall we recover the charges of our Odors?
or, How ſhall we avoid the envy and cenſure of our angry Elders, for honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him whom the Governours of our Nation have thought worthy of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation?
The onely thought they now take is, <hi>Who ſhall roll away the ſtone?</hi>
Neither do they ſtay at home and move this doubt, but when they are well
forward on their way, reſolving to try the iſſue. Good hearts cannot be ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
ſolicitous for any thing under Heaven, as for removing thoſe impediments
which lie between them and their Saviour. O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> thou who art clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
revealed in Heaven, art yet ſtill both hid and ſealed up from too many here
on earth: Neither is it ſome thin veil that is ſpred between thee and them,
but an huge ſtone; even a true ſtone of offence lies rolled upon the mouth of
their hearts. Yea, if a ſecond weight were ſuperadded to thy Grave here, no
leſs then three ſpiritual bars are interpoſed betwixt them and thee above;
Idleneſs, Ignorance, Unbelief. Who ſhall roll away theſe ſtones, but the ſame
power that removed thine? O Lord, remove that our Ignorance, that we may
know thee; our Idleneſs, that we may ſeek thee; our Unbelief, that we may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
find and enjoy thee.</p>
                  <p>How well it ſucceeds when we go faithfully and conſcionably about our
work, and leave the iſſue to God? Lo, now God hath removed the cares of
theſe holy Women, together with the grave-ſtone. To the wicked that falls
out which they feared, to the Godly that which they wiſhed and cared for,
yea more. Holy cares ever prove well; the worldly dry the bones, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint
the hopes. Could theſe good Viſitants have known of a greater ſtone
ſealed, of a ſtrong watch ſet, their doubts had been doubled: now God goes
beyond their thoughts, and at once removes that which both they did and
might have feared: The ſtone is removed, the ſeal broken, the watch fled.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
What a ſcorn doth the Almighty God make of the impotent deſignes of men?
They thought, the ſtone ſhall make the grave ſure, the ſeal ſhall make the ſtone
ſure, the guard ſhall make both ſure: Now when they think all ſafe, God ſends
an Angel from Heaven above, the earth quakes beneath, the ſtone rolls away,
the Souldiers ſtand like carkaſſes, and when they have got heart enough to
run away, think themſelves valiant; the Tomb is opened, Chriſt is riſen, they
confounded. Oh the vain projects of ſilly men! as if with one ſhovel-full of
mire they would dam up the Sea; or with a clout hang'd forth they would
keep the Sun from ſhining. Oh theſe Spiders-webs, or houſes of Cards which
fond children have (as they think) skilfully framed, which the leaſt breath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
breaks and ruines! Who are we, ſorry worms, that we ſhould look in any
buſineſs to prevail againſt our Creator? What creature is ſo baſe that he
cannot arm againſt us to our confuſion? The Lice and Frogs ſhall be too ſtrong
for <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the Worms for <hi>Herod. There is no wiſdome nor counſel againſt
the Lord.</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Oh the marvellous pomp and magnificence of our Saviours Reſurrection!
The earth quakes, the Angel appears; that it may be plainly ſeen that
this Divine perſon now riſing had the command both of earth and Heaven.
At the diſſolution of thine Humane nature, O Saviour, was an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake;
at the re-uniting of it is an Earthquake; to tell the world that
the God of Nature then ſuffered, and had now conquered. Whiles thou
laieſt ſtill in the earth, the earth was ſtill; when thou cameſt to fetch
thine own, <hi>The earth trembled at the preſence of the Lord, at the preſence of
the God of Jacob.</hi> When thou our true <hi>Sampſon</hi> awakedſt, and foundſt
thy ſelf tied with theſe <hi>Philiſtian</hi> cords, and rouſedſt up, and brakeſt thoſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hard and ſtrong twiſts with a ſudden power, no marvel if the room ſhook
under thee.</p>
                  <p>Good cauſe had the earth to quake, when the God that made it powerfully
calls for his own fleſh from the uſurpation of her bowels. Good cauſe had
ſhe to open her graves and yield up her dead in attendance to the Lord
of Life, whom ſhe had preſumed to detain in that cell of her darkneſs.
What a ſeeming impotence was here, that thou, who art the true Rock of
thy Church, ſhouldſt lye obſcurely ſhrouded in <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s rock? thou that art
the true corner-ſtone of thy Church, ſhouldſt be ſhut up with a double ſtone,
the one of thy grave, the other of thy vault? thou, <hi>by whom we are ſealed
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to the day of our Redemption,</hi> ſhouldſt be ſealed up in a blind cavern of
earth? But now what a demonſtration of power doth both the world and
I ſee in thy glorious Reſurrection? The rocks tear, the graves open, the
ſtones roll away, the dead riſe and appear, the Souldiers flee and tremble,
Saints and Angels attend thy riſing. O Saviour, thou laieſt down in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
thou riſeſt in power and glory; thou laieſt down like a man, thou riſeſt
like a God.</p>
                  <p>What a lively image haſt thou herein given me of the dreadful Majeſty of
the general Reſurrection and thy ſecond appearance? Then not the earth
onely, but <hi>the powers of Heaven ſhall be ſhaken:</hi> not ſome few graves ſhall be
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> open, and ſome Saints appear; but all the bars of death ſhall be broken,
and <hi>all that ſleep in their graves ſhall awake, and ſtand up from the dead</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee: not ſome one Angel ſhall deſcend; but thou, <hi>the great Angel of the
Covenant,</hi> attended with thouſand thouſands of thoſe mighty Spirits. And if
theſe ſtout Souldiers were ſo filled with terrour at the feeling of an Earthquake
and the ſight of an Angel, that they had ſcarce breath left in them for the time
to witneſs them alive; where ſhall thine enemies appear, O Lord, in the
day of thy terrible appearance, when the earth ſhall reel and vaniſh, and
the elements ſhall be on a flame about their ears, and the Heavens ſhall wrap
up as a ſcroll?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> O God, thou mighteſt have removed this ſtone by the force of thine
Earthquake, as well as rive other rocks; yet thou wouldſt rather uſe the
Miniſtery of an Angel: or, thou that gaveſt thy ſelf life, and gaveſt being
both to the ſtone and to the earth, couldſt more eaſily have removed the
ſtone then moved the earth; but it was thy pleaſure to make uſe of an
Angels hand. And now he that would ask why thou wouldſt doe it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by an Angel then by thy ſelf, may as well ask why thou didſt not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
give thy Law by thine own immediate hand then by the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Angels; why by an Angel thou ſtruckeſt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with plagues,
the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> with the ſword; why an Angel appeared to comfort thee after
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> thy Temptation and Agony, when thou wert able to comfort thy ſelf;
why thou uſeſt the influences of Heaven to fruiten the earth; why thou
imployeſt Second cauſes in all events, when thou couldſt doe all things
alone. It is good reaſon thou ſhouldſt ſerve thy ſelf of thine own; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Thou didſt raiſe thy ſelf, the Angels removed the ſtone. They that could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
have no hand in thy Reſurrection, yet ſhall have an hand in removing outward
impediments; not becauſe thou needſt, but becauſe thou wouldſt: like as thou
alone didſt raiſe <hi>Lazarus,</hi> thou badſt others let him looſe. Works of Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
thou reſerveſt to thine own immediate performance; ordinary actions
thou doeſt by ſubordinate means.</p>
                  <p>Although this act of the Angels was not merely with reſpect to thee;
but partly to thoſe devout Women, to eaſe them of their care, to manifeſt unto
them thy Reſurrection. So officious are thoſe glorious Spirits, not onely to
thee their Maker, but even to the meaneſt of thy ſervants, eſpecially in the
furtherance of all their ſpiritual deſignes. Let us bring our Odours, they will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

to promote each others Salvation? We pray to doe thy will here as they
doe in Heaven: if we do not act our wiſhes, we do but mock thee in our
Devotions.</p>
                  <p>How glorious did this Angel of thine appear? The terrified Souldiers ſaw
his face like lightning, both they and the Women ſaw his garments ſhining,
bright, and white as ſnow: ſuch a preſence became his errand. It was fit that,
as in thy Paſſion the Sun was darkned, and all Creatures were clad with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs,
ſo in thy Reſurrection the beſt of thy Creatures ſhould teſtifie their joy
and exſultation in the brightneſs of their habit; that as we on Feſtival-dayes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
put on our beſt cloaths, ſo thine Angels ſhould celebrate this bleſſed Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivity
with a meet repreſentation of Glory. They could not but injoy our
joy, to ſee the work of mans Redemption thus fully finiſhed: and if there be
<hi>mirth in Heaven at the converſion of one ſinner,</hi> how much more when a world
of ſinners is perfectly ranſomed from death, and reſtored to Salvation? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
if but one or two appeared, all rejoyced, all triumphed. Neither could
they but be herein ſenſible of their own happy advantage, who by thy media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <p>But, above all other, the Love of thee their God and Saviour muſt needs
heighten their joy, and make thy Glory theirs. It is their perpetual work to
praiſe thee: how much more now when ſuch an occaſion was offered as never
had been ſince the world began, never could be after? when thou the God of
Spirits hadſt vanquiſhed all the ſpiritual powers of darkneſs, when thou the
Lord of Life hadſt conquered death for thee and all thine, ſo as they may now
boldly inſult over their laſt enemy, <hi>O death, where is thy ſting? O grave, where is
thy victory?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly, if Heaven can be capable of an increaſe of joy and felicity,
never had thoſe Bleſſed Spirits ſo great a cauſe of triumph and gratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
as in this day of thy glorious Reſurrection. How much more, O dear
<hi>Jeſu,</hi> ſhould we men, whoſe fleſh thou didſt aſſume, unite, revive, for whoſe
ſake and in whoſe ſtead thou didſt vouchſafe to ſuffer and die, whoſe
arrerages thou payedſt in death, and acquittedſt in thy Reſurrection, whoſe
Souls are diſcharged, whoſe Bodies ſhall be raiſed by the power of thy riſing;
how much more ſhould we think we have cauſe to be over-joyed with the
happy memory of this great work of thy Divine Power and unconceiveable
Mercy?</p>
                  <p>Lo now, how weak ſoever I am in my ſelf, yet in the confidence of this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Reſurrection of my Saviour I dare boldly challenge and defie you, O all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
ye adverſe Powers. Doe the worſt ye can to my Soul; in deſpight of you it
ſhall be ſafe.</p>
                  <p>Is it Sin that threats me? Behold, this Reſurrection of my Redeemer
publiſhes my diſcharge. My Surety was arreſted and caſt into the priſon
of his Grave: had not the utmoſt farthing of mine arrerages been paid, he
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:44233:125"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> could not have come forth. He is come forth: the Summe is fully ſatisfied.
What danger can there be of a diſcharged Debt?</p>
                  <p>Is it the Wrath of God? Wherefore is that but for ſin? If my ſin be defraied,
that quarrel is at an end: and if my Saviour ſuffered it for me, how can I fear to
ſuffer it in my ſelf? That infinite Juſtice hates to be twice paid. He is riſen,
therefore he hath ſatisfied. <hi>Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died; yea
rather, that is riſen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it Death it ſelf? Lo, my Saviour that overcame death by dying,
hath triumph'd over him in his Reſurrection. How can I now fear a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
enemy? What harm is there in the Serpent, but for his ſting?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                     <hi>The ſting of death is ſin:</hi> that is pulled out by my powerful Redeemer,
it cannot now hurt me; it may refreſh me to carry this cool Snake in my
boſome.</p>
                  <p>O then, my dear Saviour, I bleſs thee for thy Death; but I bleſs thee more
for thy Reſurrection. That was a work of wonderful Humility, of infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
this was a work of infinite Power: In that was humane Weakneſs; in this
Divine Omnipotence: In that thou didſt <hi>die for our ſins;</hi> in this thou didſt <hi>riſe
again for our Juſtification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now how am I conformable to thee, if when thou art riſen I lie ſtill in
the grave of my Corruptions? How am I a lim of thy body, if whiles thou
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> haſt that perfect dominion over death, death hath dominion over me; if whiles
thou art alive and glorious, I lie rotting in the duſt of death? I know the loco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motive
faculty is in the Head: by the power of the Reſurrection of thee our
Head, all we thy Members cannot but be raiſed. As the earth cannot hold my
body from thee in the day of the Second Reſurrection, ſo cannot ſin withhold
my Soul from thee in the Firſt. How am I thine, if I be not riſen? and <hi>if</hi> I <hi>be
riſen with</hi> thee, why do I not <hi>ſeek the things above, where</hi> thou <hi>ſitteſt at the right
hand of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Vault or Cave which <hi>Joſeph</hi> had hewn out of the rock was large,
capable of no leſs then ten perſons: upon the mouth of it Eaſtward was
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that great ſtone rolled; within it, at the right hand, in the North part
of the Cave, was hewn out a receptacle for the body, three handfuls high
from the pavement; and a ſtone was accordingly fitted for the cover of
that Grave.</p>
                  <p>Into this Cave the good Women (finding the ſtone rolled away) deſcended
to ſeek the body of Chriſt; and in it ſaw the Angels. This was the Goal
to which <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ran, finding the ſpoils of death, the grave cloaths
wrapped up, and the napkin that was about the head folded up together and
laid in a place by it ſelf: and as they came in haſte, ſo they return'd with
wonder.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> I marvel not at your ſpeed, O ye bleſſed Diſciples, if upon the report
of the Women ye ran, yea flew upon the wings of zeal, to ſee what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of your Maſter. Ye had wont to walk familiarly together in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
of your Lord: now ſociety is forgotten; and, as for a wager, each
tries the ſpeed of his legs, and with neglect of other, vies who ſhall be firſt at
the Tomb.</p>
                  <p>Who would not but have tried maſteries with you in this caſe, and have
made light touches of the earth to have held paces with you? Your deſire
was equal; but <hi>John</hi> is the yonger, his lims are more nimble, his breath
more free: he firſt looks into the Sepulcher, but <hi>Peter</hi> goes down firſt. O
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> happy competition who ſhall be more zealous in the enquiry after Chriſt!
Ye ſaw enough to amaze you, not enough to ſettle your Faith. How well
might you have thought, <q>Our Maſter is not ſubduced, but riſen. Had he
been taken away by others hands, this fine linen had not been left behinde:
Had he not himſelf riſen from this bed of earth, he had not thus wrapped
up his night-cloaths, and laid them ſorted by themſelves. What can
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:44233:126"/>
we doubt, when he foretold us he would riſe?</q> O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> how wilt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
thou pardon our errours? how ſhould we pardon and pity the errours of each
other in leſſer occaſions, whenas yet thy prime and deareſt Diſciples, after ſo
much Divine inſtruction, <hi>knew not the Scriptures, that thou muſt riſe again from
the dead?</hi> They went away more aſtoniſhed then confident; more full of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as yet then of belief.</p>
                  <p>There is more ſtrength of zeal (where it takes) in the weaker Sex.
Thoſe holy Women, as they came firſt, ſo they ſtaid laſt: eſpecially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
<hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> ſtands ſtill at the mouth of the Cave weeping.
Well might thoſe tears have been ſpared, if her Knowledge had been
anſwerable to her Affection, her Faith to her Fervour. Withall, (as our eye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
will be where we love) ſhe ſtoops, and looks down into that dear Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher.</p>
                  <p>Holy deſires never but ſpeed well. There ſhe <hi>ſees two</hi> glorious <hi>Angels,
the one</hi> ſitting <hi>at the head, the other at the feet where the body of Jeſus had
lain.</hi> Their ſhining brightneſs ſhew'd them to be no mortal creatures: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had but newly come out of the Sepulcher, and
both found and left it empty in her ſight, which was now ſuddenly fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with thoſe celeſtial gueſts. That white linen wherewith <hi>Joſeph</hi> had
ſhrouded the Sacred body of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> was now ſhamed with a brighter
whiteneſs.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet do I not find the good Woman ought appalled with that inexſpected
glory. So was her heart taken up with the thought for her Saviour, that
ſhe ſeemed not ſenſible of whatſoever other Objects. Thoſe tears which
ſhe did let drop into the Sepulcher, ſend up back to her the voice of thoſe
Angels, <hi>Woman, why weepeſt thou?</hi> God and his Angels take notice of every
tear of our Devotion. The ſudden wonder hath not dried her eyes, nor
charmed her tongue: She freely confeſſeth the cauſe of her grief to be the
miſſing of her Saviour; <hi>They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where
they have laid him.</hi> Alas, good <hi>Mary,</hi> how doſt thou loſe thy tears? of
whom doſt thou complain, but of thy beſt friend? who hath removed thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
Lord but himſelf? who but his own Deity hath taken away that humane
body out of that region of death? Neither is he now laid any more, he ſtands
by thee whoſe removal thou complaineſt of. Thus many a tender and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Soul afflicts it ſelf with the want of that Saviour whom it hath, and
feeleth not.</p>
                  <p>Senſe may be no judge of the bewailed abſence of Chriſt. Do but turn
back thine eye, O thou Religious Soul, <hi>and ſee Jeſus ſtanding by thee,</hi> though
<hi>thou knewſt not that it was Jeſus.</hi> His habit was not his own. Sometimes it pleaſes
our Saviour to appear unto his not like himſelf: his holy diſguiſes are our trials.
Sometimes he will ſeem a Stranger, ſometimes an Enemie; ſometimes he offers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
himſelf to us in the ſhape of a poor man, ſometimes of a diſtreſſed Captive.
Happy is he that can diſcern his Saviour in all forms. <hi>Mary</hi> took him for a
Gardener. Devout <hi>Magdalene,</hi> thou art not much miſtaken. As it was the trade
of the Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> to dreſs the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> ſo was it the trade of the Second
to tend the Garden of his Church. He diggs up the ſoil by ſeaſonable Afflictions,
he ſows in it the ſeeds of Grace, he plants it with gracious motions, he waters it
with his Word, yea with his own blood, he weeds it by wholſome cenſures.
O Bleſſed Saviour, what is it that thou neglecteſt to doe for this ſelected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure
of thy Church? As in ſome reſpect thou art <hi>the true Vine, and</hi> thy
<hi>Father the Husbandman;</hi> ſo alſo in ſome other we are the Vine, and thou art <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
the Husbandman. Oh be thou ſuch to me as thou appearedſt unto <hi>Magdalene:</hi>
break up the fallows of my Nature, implant me with Grace, prune me with
meet corrections, bedew me with the former and latter rain; doe what thou
wilt to make me fruitful.</p>
                  <p>Still the good Woman weeps, and ſtill complains, and paſſionately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:44233:126"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of thee, O Saviour, for thy ſelf. How apt are we, if thou doſt never
ſo little vary from our apprehenſions, to miſ-know thee, and to wrong our
ſelves by our miſ-opinions? All this while haſt thou concealed thy ſelf from
thine affectionate client; thou ſaweſt her teares, and heardeſt her importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and inquiries: at laſt (as it was with <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that he could no longer
contain himſelf from the notice of his brethren) thy compaſſion cauſes thee
to break forth into a clear expreſſion of thy ſelf by expreſſing her name
unto her ſelf; <hi>Mary.</hi> She was uſed as to the name, ſo to the ſound, to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
Thou ſpakeſt to her before, but in the tone of a ſtranger; now of a
friend, of a Maſter. Like a good Shepheard, <hi>thou calleſt thy ſheep by their
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> name, and they know thy voice.</hi> What was thy call of her, but a clear pattern
of our Vocation?</p>
                  <p>As her, ſo thou calleſt us; firſt, familiarly, effectually. She could not begin
with thee otherwiſe then in the compellation of a ſtranger; it was thy mercy
to begin with her. That correction of thy Spirit is ſweet and uſeful, <hi>Now
after ye have known God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>or rather are known of him.</hi> We do know thee, O
God, but our active knowledge is after our paſſive; firſt we are known of
thee, then we know thee that kneweſt us. And as our Knowledge, ſo is our
Calling, ſo is our Election; thou beginneſt to us in all, and moſt juſtly ſayeſt,
<hi>You have not choſen me, but I have choſen you.</hi> When thou wouldſt ſpeak to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> this Devout client as a ſtranger, thou ſpakeſt aloof; <hi>Woman, whom ſeekeſt thou?</hi>
now when thou wouldſt be known to her, thou calleſt her by her name, <hi>Mary.</hi>
General invitations and common mercies are for us as men; but where thou
giveſt Grace as to thine elect, thou comeſt cloſe to the Soul, and winneſt us
with dear and particular intimations.</p>
                  <p>That very name did as much as ſay, Know him of whom thou art known
and beloved, and turns her about to thy view and acknowledgment; <hi>She turned
her ſelf, and ſaith unto him, Rabboni, which is to ſay, Maſter.</hi> Before, her face
was towards the Angels: this word fetches her about, and turns her face to
thee, from whom her miſpriſion had averted it. We do not rightly apprehend
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> thee, O Saviour, if any creature in Heaven or earth can keep our eyes and our
hearts from thee. The Angels were bright and glorious; thy appearance was
homely, thy habit mean: yet when ſhe heard thy voice, ſhe turns her back
upon the Angels, and ſalutes thee with a <hi>Rabboni,</hi> and falls down before thee,
in a deſire of an humble amplexation of thoſe Sacred feet which ſhe now rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to ſee paſt the uſe of her Odours.</p>
                  <p>Where there was ſuch familiarity in the mutual compellation, what
means ſuch ſtrangeneſs in the charge; <hi>Touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended
to my Father?</hi> Thou wert not wont, O Saviour, to make ſo dainty of being
touched: It is not long ſince theſe very ſame hands touched thee in thine anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the Bloody-fluxed woman touched thee; the thankful Penitent in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s
houſe touched thee. What ſpeak I of theſe? The multitude touch'd thee,
the Executioners touch'd thee; and even after thy Reſurrection thou didſt not
ſtick to ſay to thy Diſciples, <hi>Touch me, and ſee,</hi> and to invite <hi>Thomas</hi> to put his
fingers into thy ſide: neither is it long after this before thou ſuffereſt the three
<hi>Maries</hi> to touch and hold thy feet. How then ſaiſt thou, <hi>Touch me not?</hi> Was it
in a mild taxation of her miſtaking? as if thou hadſt ſaid, Thou knoweſt not
that I have now an Immortal body, but ſo demeaneſt thy ſelf towards me as if I
were ſtill in my wonted condition; know now that the caſe is altered: howſoever
indeed I have not yet aſcended to my Father, yet this body of mine which
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> thou ſeeſt to be real and ſenſible, is now impaſſible, and qualified with Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
and therefore worthy of a more awful veneration then heretofore. Or
was it a gentle reproof of her dwelling too long in this dear hold of thee, and
fixing her thoughts upon thy Bodily preſence; together with an implied
direction of reſerving the height of her affection for thy perfect glorification
in Heaven? Or laſtly, was it a light touch of her too much haſt and eagerneſs
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:44233:127"/>
in touching thee, as if ſhe muſt uſe this ſpeed in preventing thine Aſcenſion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
or elſe be indangered to be diſappointed of her hopes? as if thou hadſt ſaid,
Be not ſo paſſionately forward and ſuddain in laying hold on me, as if I were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
aſcending; but know that I ſhall ſtay ſome time with you upon earth,
before my going up to my Father. O Saviour, even our well-meant zeal in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and injoying thee may be faulty; if we ſeek thee where we ſhould not, on
earth; how we ſhould not, unwarrantably. There may be a kind of carnality
in Spiritual actions. <hi>If we have heretofore known thee after the fleſh, henceforth
know we thee ſo no more.</hi> That thou livedſt here in this ſhape, that colour,
this ſtature, that habit, I ſhould be glad to know; nothing that concerns
thee can be unuſeful. Could I ſay, here thou ſateſt, here thou layeſt, here <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
and thus thou wert crucified, here buried, here ſetteſt thy laſt foot; I ſhould
with much contentment ſee and recount theſe memorials of thy preſence: But if
I ſhall ſo faſten my thoughts upon theſe, as not to look higher to the ſpiritual
part of thine atchievements, to the power and iſſue of thy Reſurrection, I am
never the better.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner art thou riſen then thou ſpeakeſt of aſcending; as thou didſt lie
down to riſe, ſo didſt thou riſe to aſcend: that is the conſummation of thy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and ours in thee. Thou that forbadſt her touch, injoynedſt her errand; <hi>Goe
to my brethren, and ſay, I aſcend unto my Father and your Father, to my God and
your God.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>The annunciation of thy Reſurrection and Aſcenſion is more then a private
fruition; this is for the comfort of one, that for the benefit of many. To ſit
ſtill and injoy is more ſweet for the preſent; but to goe and tell is more
gainful in the ſequel. That great Angel thought himſelf (as he well might)
highly honoured, in that he was appointed to carry the happy news unto the
Bleſſed Virgin (thy Holy Mother) of her conception of thee her Saviour:
how honourable muſt it needs be to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> that ſhe muſt be the

                  <p>To whom then doſt thou ſend her? <hi>Goe tell my Brethren.</hi> Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> who
are thoſe? were they not thy Followers? yea, were they not thy forſakers?
yet ſtill thou ſtileſt them thy Brethren. O admirable Humility! O infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy!
How doſt thou raiſe their titles with thy ſelf? At firſt they were thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
then Diſciples, a little before thy death they were thy Friends; now after
thy Reſurrection they were thy Brethren. Thou that wert exalted infinitely
higher from mortal to immortal, deſcendeſt ſo much lower to call them Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
who were before Friends, Diſciples, Servants. What do we ſtand upon
terms of our poor inequality, when the Son of God ſtoops ſo low as to call us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
Brethren? But, oh Mercy without meaſure! Why wilt thou, how canſt thou,
O Saviour, call them Brethren, whom in their laſt parting thou foundſt fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives?
Did they not run from thee? Did not one of them rather leave his
inmoſt coat behind him, then not be quit of thee? Did not another of them
deny thee, yea abjure thee? and yet thou ſaiſt, <hi>Goe tell my Brethren.</hi> It is not
in the power of the ſins of our infirmity to unbrother us: when we look at the
acts themſelves, they are hainous; when at the perſons, they are ſo much more
faulty as more obliged; but when we look at the mercy of thee who haſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
us, now, <hi>who ſhall ſeparate us?</hi> When we have ſinned, thy dearneſs hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to aggravate our ſorrows; but when we have ſorrowed, our Faith hath no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
leſs reaſon to uphold us from deſpairing: even yet we are Brethren. Brethren
in thee, O Saviour, who art aſcending for us; in thee, who haſt made thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ours, thy God our God. He is thy Father by eternal Generation, our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by his gracious Adoption; thy God by unity of Eſſence, our God by his

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> It is this propriety wherein our life and happineſs conſiſteth: They are weak
comforts that can be raiſed from the apprehenſion of thy general Mecies.
What were I the better, O Saviour, that God were thy Father, if he be not
mine? Oh do thou give me a particular ſenſe of my intereſt in thee, and thy
goodneſs to me. Bring thou thy ſelf home to me, and let me finde that I have a
God and Saviour of my own.</p>
                  <p>It is fit I ſhould mark thy order; Firſt, <hi>my Father,</hi> then <hi>yours.</hi> Even ſo,
Lord, He is firſt thine, and in thine onely right ours. It is in thee that we are
adopted, it is in thee that we are elected; without thee, God is not onely a
ſtranger, but an enemie to us. Thou onely canſt make us free, thou onely
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> canſt make us Sons. Let me be found in thee, and I cannot fail of a Father in
Heaven.</p>
                  <p>With what joy did <hi>Mary</hi> receive this errand? with what joy did the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
welcome it from her? Here was good news from a far Country, even as
far as the utmoſt regions of Death.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Diſciples whoſe flight ſcattered them upon their Maſters apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
are now, at night, like a diſperſed Covie met together by their mutual call:
their aſſembly is ſecret; when the light was ſhut in, <hi>when the doors were ſhut</hi>
up. Still were they fearful, ſtill were the Jews malicious. The aſſured ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of their Maſters Reſurrection and Life hath filled their hearts with joy
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and wonder. Whiles their thoughts and ſpeech are taken up with ſo happy a
ſubject, his miraculous and ſuddain preſence bids their ſenſes be witneſſes of
his reviving and their happineſs. <hi>When the doors were ſhut where the Diſciples
were aſſembled, for fear of the Jews, came Jeſus, and ſtood in the midſt, and ſaid,
Peace be unto you.</hi> O Saviour, how thou cameſt in thither I wonder, I inquire
not: I know not what a Glorified body can doe; I know there is nothing that
thou canſt not doe. Had not thine entrance been recorded for ſtrange and
ſupernatural, why was thy ſtanding in the midſt noted before thy paſſage into
the room? why were the doors ſaid to be ſhut whiles thou cameſt in? why
were thy Diſciples amazed to ſee thee ere they heard thee? Doubtleſs, they that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> once before took thee for a Spirit when thou didſt walk upon the waters,
could not but be aſtoniſhed to ſee thee whiles the doors were barred, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any noiſe of thine entrance) to ſtand in the midſt: well might they think
thou couldſt not thus be there, if thou wert not the God of Spirits. There
might ſeem more ſcruple of thy realty then of thy power: and therefore after
thy wonted greeting, thou ſheweſt them thy hands and thy feet ſtamped with
the impreſſions of thy late ſufferings. Thy reſpiration ſhall argue the truth
of thy life. Thou breatheſt on them as a man, thou giveſt them thy Spirit as
a God; and as God and man thou ſendeſt them on the great errand of thy
Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>

<hi>They were glad when they had ſeen the Lord.</hi> Had they known thee for no
other then a mere man, this re-appearance could not but have affrighted them;
ſince till now by thine Almighty power this was never done, that the long-ſince
dead roſe out of their graves, and appeared unto many: But when they
recounted the miraculous works that thou hadſt done, and thought of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>

                  <p>We cannot but be loſers by our abſence from holy Aſſemblies. Where
wert thou, <hi>O Thomas,</hi> when the reſt of that Sacred Family were met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Had thy fear put thee to ſo long a flight, that as yet thou wert not
returned to thy fellows? or didſt thou ſuffer other occaſions to detain thee
from this happineſs? Now for the time thou miſſedſt that Divine breath which
ſo comfortably inſpired the reſt; now thou art ſuffered to fall into that weak
diſtruſt which thy preſence had prevented. They told thee, <hi>We have ſeen
the Lord;</hi> was not this enough? would no eyes ſerve thee but thine own?
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:44233:128"/>
were thy eares to no uſe for thy Faith? <hi>Except I ſee in his hands the print of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thruſt my hand
into his ſide, I will not believe.</hi> Suſpicious man, who is the worſe for that?
Whoſe is the loſs if thou believe not? Is there no certainty but in thine own
ſenſes? Why were not ſo many and ſo holy eyes and tongues as credible
as thine own hands and eyes? How little wert thou yet acquainted with the
waies of Faith? <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> Theſe are the tongues that muſt
win the whole world to an aſſent; and doſt thou the firſt man detrect to
yield? Why was that word ſo hard to paſs? Had not that thy Divine
Maſter foretold thee with the reſt that he muſt be crucified, and the third
day riſe again? Is any thing related to be done but that which was fore-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
any thing beyond the ſphere of Divine Omnipotence? Go then, and
pleaſe thy ſelf in thine over-wiſe incredulity, whiles thy fellows are happy in
believing.</p>
                  <p>It is a whole week that <hi>Thomas</hi> reſts in this ſullen unbelief; in all which
time doubtleſs his eares were beaten with the many conſtant aſſertions of
the holy Women (the firſt witneſſes of the Reſurrection) as alſo of the
two Diſciples walking to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> (whoſe hearts burning within them,
had ſet their tongues on fire in a zealous relation of thoſe happy occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
with the aſſured reports of the riſing and re-appearance of many Saints
in attendance of the Lord and giver of life: yet ſtill he ſtruggles with his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
own diſtruſt, and ſtiffely ſuſpends his belief to that truth whereof he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny himſelf enough convinced. As all bodies are not equally apt to
be wrought upon by the ſame Medicine, ſo are not all Souls by the ſame
means of Faith; one is refractory, whiles others are pliable. O Saviour,
how juſtly mighteſt thou have left this man to his own pertinacie? whom
could he have thank'd if he had periſhed in his unbelief? But, O thou good
Shepherd of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that couldſt be content to leave the ninety and nine to
go fetch one ſtray in the wilderneſs, how careful wert thou to reduce this
ſtragler to his fellows? Right ſo were thy Diſciples re-aſſembled, ſuch
was the ſeaſon, the place the ſame, ſo were the doors ſhut up, when (that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
unbelieving Diſciple being now preſent with the reſt,) thou ſo cameſt in,
ſo ſtoodſt in the midſt, ſo ſhewedſt thy hands and feet; and ſingling out
thy incredulous client, inviteſt his eyes to ſee, and his fingers to handle
thine hands, and his hand to be thruſt into thy ſide, that he might not be
faithleſs, but faithful.</p>
                  <p>Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> how thou pittieſt the errors and infirmities of thy ſervants?
Even when we are froward in our miſconceits and worthy of nothing but
deſertion, how thou followeſt us, and overtakeſt us with mercy; and in
thine abundant compaſſion wilt reclaim and ſave us, when either we meant
not or would not? By how much more unworthy thoſe eyes and hands <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
were to ſee and touch that immortal and glorious body, by ſo much more
wonderful was thy Goodneſs in condeſcending to ſatisfie that curious Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
Neither do I hear thee ſo much as to chide that weak obſtinacy. It
was not long ſince thou didſt ſharply take up the two Diſciples that walk'd
to <hi>Emmaus, O fools and ſlow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken!</hi>
but this was under the diſguiſe of an unknown traveller, upon the way,
when they were alone: Now thou ſpeakeſt with thine own tongue, before all
thy Diſciples, in ſtead of rebuking, thou only exhorteſt; <hi>Be not faithleſs, but
faithfull.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Behold, thy Mercy no leſs then thy Power hath melted the congealed heart <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
of thy unbelieving follower; <hi>Then Thomas anſwered and ſaid unto him, My
Lord, and my God.</hi> I do not hear that when it came to the iſſue, <hi>Thomas</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
his hands in this tryal: his eyes were now ſufficient aſſurance; the
ſenſe of his Maſters Omniſcience in this particular challenge of him ſpared
(perhaps) the labour of a further diſquiſition. And now how happily was
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:44233:128"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that doubt beſtowed, which brought forth ſo faithful a confeſſion, <hi>My Lord,

                  </p>
                  <p>I hear not ſuch a word from thoſe that believed. It was well for us, it was
well for thee, <hi>O Thomas,</hi> that thou diſtruſtedſt: elſe, neither had the world
received ſo perfect an evidence of that Reſurrection whereon all our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
dependeth; neither hadſt thou yielded ſo pregnant and divine an aſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation
to thy Bleſſed Saviour. Now thou doſt not only profeſs his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
but his Godhead too, and thy happy intereſt in both. And now,
if <hi>they</hi> be <hi>bleſſed that have not ſeen and</hi> yet <hi>believed;</hi> bleſſed art thou alſo
that having ſeen, haſt thus believed: and bleſſed be thou, O God, who

not for a ſuddain paſſage, but for a leiſurely converſation. Upon thine
Eaſter-day thou ſpakeſt of thine Aſcenſion; but thou wouldſt have
forty daies interpoſed. Hadſt thou merely reſpected thine own Glory, thou

                  <p>Thy death had troubled the hearts of many Diſciples, who thought that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> condition too mean to be compatible with the glory of the <hi>Meſsiah;</hi> and
thoughts of diffidence were apt to ſeize upon the holieſt breaſts. So long there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

only canſt give an account: it was not for fleſh and blood to trace the waies
of Immortality; neither was our frail, corruptible, ſinful nature a meet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
for thy now-glorified Humanity; the glorious angels of Heaven were
now thy fitteſt attendants. But yet how oft did it pleaſe thee graciouſly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
thy ſelf this while unto men; and not only to appear unto thy Diſciples,
but to renew unto them the familiar forms of thy wonted converſation, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring,

wherefore ſhould they be now aſſembled, but for the choice and diſtribution of
Offices, and for the ordering of the affairs of that ſtate which was now to be

into all needful and requiſite verities. And now, with a gracious promiſe
of that Spirit of thine, with a careful charge renewed unto thy Diſciples for
the promulgation of thy Goſpel, with an Heavenly Benediction of all thine
acclaming attendance, thou tak'ſt leave of earth; <hi>When he had ſpoken theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

                  <p>Oh happy parting, fit for the Saviour of mankind, anſwerable to that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

                  <p>It was from the mount of Olives that thou tookſt thy riſe into Heaven.
Thou mighteſt have aſcended from the valley; all the globe of earth was alike
to thee: but ſince thou wert to mount upward, thou wouldſt take ſo much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
advantage as that ſtaire of ground would afford thee; thou wouldſt not uſe
the help of a Miracle in that wherein Nature offered her ordinary ſervice.
What difficulty had it been for thee to have ſtyed up from the very center of
earth? But ſince thou hadſt made hills ſo much nearer unto Heaven, thou
wouldſt not neglect the benefit of thy own Creation. Where we have common
helps, we may not depend upon Supernatural proviſions; we may not ſtrain
the Divine Providence to the ſupply of our negligence, or the humoring of
our preſumption. Thou that couldſt alwaies have walked on the Sea, wouldſt
walk ſo but once, when thou wantedſt ſhipping: thou, to whom the higheſt
mountains were but valleys, wouldſt walk up to an hill to aſcend thence into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
Heaven. O God, teach me to bleſs thee for means, when I have them; and
to truſt thee for means, when I have them not; yea to truſt to thee without
means, when I have no hope of them.</p>
                  <p>What hill was this thou choſeſt but the mount of Olives? Thy Pulpit
ſhall I call it, or thine Oratory? The place from whence thou hadſt wont to
ſhowre down thine Heavenly Doctrine upon the hearers; the place whence
thou hadſt wont to ſent up thy Prayers unto thy Heavenly Father; the place
that ſhared with the Temple for both: In the day-time thou wert preaching
in the Temple, in the night praying in the mount of Olives. On this very hill
was the bloody ſweat of thine Agonie; now is it the mount of thy Triumph.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
From this mount of Olives did flow that oyle of gladneſs wherewith thy
Church is everlaſtingly refreſhed. That God that uſes to puniſh us in the
ſame kind wherein we have offended, retributes alſo to us in the ſame kind
and circumſtances wherein we have been afflicted. To us alſo, O Saviour,
even to us thy unworthy members doſt thou ſeaſonably vouchſafe to
give a proportionable joy to our heavineſs, laughter to our mourning,
glory to contempt and ſhame. Our agonies ſhall be anſwered with exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>Whither then, O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> whither didſt thou aſcend? whither but
home into thine Heaven? From the mountain wert thou taken up; and what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
but Heaven is above the hills? Lo, theſe are thoſe mountains of ſpices which thy
Spouſe, the Church, long ſince deſired thee to climbe. Thou haſt now climbed
up that infinite ſteepneſs, and haſt left all ſublimity below thee. Already
hadſt thou approved thy ſelf the Lord and Commander of Earth, of Sea, of
Hell. The Earth confeſt thee her Lord, when at thy voice ſhe rendered thee
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:44233:129"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> thy <hi>Lazarus;</hi> when ſhe ſhook at thy Paſſion, and gave up her dead Saints:
The Sea acknowledged thee, in that it became a pavement to thy feet and
(at thy command) to the feet of thy Diſciple; in that it became thy Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury
for thy Tribute-money: Hell found and acknowledged thee, in that thou
conqueredſt all the powers of darkneſs; even him that had the power of
death, the Devil. It now onely remained that, as the Lord of the Aire,
thou ſhouldſt paſs through all the regions of that yielding element; and, as
Lord of Heaven, thou ſhouldſt paſs through all the glorious contignations
thereof; that ſo <hi>every knee</hi> might <hi>bow to thee both in Heaven, and in Earth, and
under the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Thou hadſt an everlaſting right to that Heaven that ſhould be, an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
poſſeſſion of it ever ſince it was; yea even whiles thou didſt cry and
ſpraul in the Cratch, whiles thou didſt hang upon the Croſs, whiles thou
wert ſealed up in thy Grave: but thine Humane nature had not taken actual
poſſeſſion of it till now. Like as it was in thy true Type, <hi>David,</hi> he had right
to the Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael</hi> immediately upon his anointing; but yet many an
hard brunt did he paſs ere he had the full poſſeſſion of it in his aſcent to <hi>Hebron.</hi>
I ſee now, O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> I ſee where thou art; even farre above all Heavens,
at the right hand of thy Father's Glory. This is the farre countrey into which
the Nobleman went to receive for himſelf a Kingdom; farre off to us, to thee
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> near, yea intrinſecal. Oh do thou raiſe up my Heart thither to thee; place thou
my Affections upon thee above, and teach me therefore to love Heaven becauſe
thou art there.</p>
                  <p>How then, O Bleſſed Saviour, how didſt thou aſcend? <hi>Whiles they beheld, he
was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their ſight.</hi> So waſt thou taken up,
as that the act was thine own, the power of the act none but thine. Thou that
deſcendedſt waſt the ſame that aſcendedſt: as in thy deſcent there was no
uſe of any power or will but thine own, no more was there in thine aſcent.
Still and ever wert thou the Maſter of thine own acts. Thou laidſt down
thy own life, no man took it from thee; Thou raiſedſt up thy ſelf from
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> death, no hand did or could help thee; Thou carriedſt up thine own glorified
fleſh, and placedſt it in Heaven. The Angels did attend thee, they did not aid
thee: whence had they their ſtrength but from thee? <hi>Elias</hi> aſcended to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but he was fetcht up in a Chariot of fire; that it might appear hence, that
man had need of other helps, who elſe could not of himſelf ſo much as lift up
himſelf to the Aiery Heaven, much leſs to the Empyreal. But thou, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
neededſt no Chariot, no carriage of Angels: thou art the Author of
life and motion; they move in and from thee. As thou therefore didſt move
thy ſelf upward, ſo, by the ſame Divine power, thou wilt raiſe us up to the
participation of thy Glory. Theſe <hi>vile bodies ſhall be made like to thy glorious
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> body, according to the working whereby thou art able to ſubdue all things unto
thy ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elias</hi> had but one witneſs of his rapture into Heaven: S. <hi>Paul</hi> had none, no
not himſelf; for <hi>whether in the body or out of the body</hi> he knew not. Thou,
O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> wouldſt neither have all eyes witneſſes of thine Aſcenſion, nor
yet too few. As after thy Reſurrection thou didſt not ſet thy ſelf upon the
pinnacle of the Temple, nor yet publickly ſhew thy ſelf within it, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
thy preſence too cheap; but madeſt choice of thoſe eyes whom thou
wouldſt bleſs with the ſight of thee; thou wert ſeen indeed of five hundred
at once, but they were Brethren: So in thine Aſcenſion, thou didſt not carry
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> all <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> promiſcuouſly forth with thee to ſee thy glorious departure,
but onely that ſelected company of thy Diſciples which had attended thee in
thy life. Thoſe who immediately upon thine aſcending returned to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
were an hundred and twenty perſons: a competent number of witneſſes, to
verifie that thy miraculous and triumphant paſſage into thy Glory. Lo, thoſe
onely were thought worthy to behold thy Majeſtical Aſcent, which had
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:44233:130"/>
been partners with thee in thy Humiliation. Still thou wilt have it thus with us,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
O Saviour, and we embrace the condition: if we will converſe with thee in
thy lowly eſtate here upon earth, wading with thee through contempt and
manifold afflictions, we ſhall be made happy with the ſight and communion of
thy Glory above.</p>
                  <p>O my Soul, be thou now (if ever) raviſhed with the contemplation of this
comfortable and bleſſed farewel of thy Saviour. What a ſight was this,
how full of joyful aſſurance, of ſpiritual conſolation? Methinks I ſee it ſtill
with their eyes, how thou my glorious Saviour didſt leiſurely and inſenſibly
riſe up from thine Olivet, taking leave of thine acclaming Diſciples now left
below thee, with gracious eyes, with Heavenly Benedictions. Methinks I ſee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
how they followed thee with eager and longing eyes, with arms lifted up,
as if they had wiſhed them winged to have ſoared up after thee. And if <hi>Eliah</hi>
gave aſſurance to his ſervant <hi>Eliſha,</hi> that if he ſhould behold him in that
rapture, his Maſters Spirit ſhould be doubled upon him; what an acceſſion
of the Spirit of joy and confidence muſt needs be to thy happy Diſciples in
ſeeing thee thus gradually riſing up to thy Heaven? Oh how unwillingly
did their intentive eyes let goe ſo Bleſſed an Object! How unwelcome was
that Cloud that interpoſed it ſelf betwixt thee and them, and cloſing up it
ſelf, left only a glorious ſplendour behind it, as the bright track of thine
Aſcenſion? Of old here below the Glory of the Lord appeared in the Cloud; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
now afarre off in the sky the Cloud intercepted this Heavenly Glory; if di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
did not rather doe it then that bright meteor. Their eyes attended
thee on thy way ſo farre as their beams would reach; when they could goe
no further, the Cloud received thee. Lo, yet even that very ſcreen, whereby
thou wert taken off from all earthly view, was no other then glorious:
how much rather do all the beholders fix their ſight upon that Cloud, then
upon the beſt piece of the Firmament? Never was the Sun it ſelf gazed on
with ſo much intention. With what long looks, with what aſtoniſhed
acclamations did theſe tranſported beholders follow thee their aſcending
Saviour? as if they would have lookt through that Cloud and that Heaven that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
hid thee from them.</p>
                  <p>But oh, what tongue of the higheſt Archangel of Heaven can expreſs
the welcome of thee the King of Glory into thoſe Bleſſed Regions of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality?
Surely the Empyreal Heaven never reſounded with ſo much joy:
<hi>God aſcended with jubilation, and the Lord with the ſound of the Trumpet.</hi>
It is not for us weak and finite creatures, to wiſh to conceive thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible,
ſpiritual, Divine gratulations that the Glorious Trinity gave
to the victorious and now-glorified Humane nature. Certainly, if <hi>when he
brought his onely-begotten Son into the world, he ſaid, Let all the Angels
worſhip him;</hi> much more now that he <hi>aſcends on high, and hath led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
captive, hath he given him a Name above all Names, that at the
name of JESUS all knees ſhould bow.</hi> And if the Holy Angels did ſo
caroll at his Birth, in the very entrance into that eſtate of Humiliation and in
firmity; with what triumph did they receive him now returning from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
atchievement of man's Redemption? And if when his Type had van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
<hi>Goliah,</hi> and carried the head into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the damſels came forth to
meet him with dances and timbrels; how ſhall we think thoſe Angelical Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
triumphed in meeting of the great Conqueror of Hell and Death? How
did they ſing, <hi>Lift up your heads, ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlaſting doors,
and the King of glory ſhall come in?</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Surely, as he ſhall come, ſo he went: and <hi>behold he ſhall come with
thouſands of his Holy Ones; thouſand thouſands miniſtred unto him, and ten
thouſand thouſands ſtood before him:</hi> From all whom methinks I hear that
bleſſed applauſe, <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was killed, to receive power, and riches,
and wiſdome, and ſtrength, and honour, and glory, and praiſe: Praiſe, and honour,

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and glory, and power, be to him that ſitteth upon the Throne, and to the Lamb
for evermore.</hi> And why doſt not thou, O my Soul, help to bear thy part with
that happy Quire of Heaven? Why art not thou rapt out of my boſome
with an extaſie of joy, to ſee this Humane nature of ours exalted above all the
Powers of Heaven, adored of Angels, Archangels, Cherubin, Seraphim, and
all thoſe mighty and glorious Spirits, and <hi>ſitting</hi> there <hi>crowned with infinite
Glory and Majeſty?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Although little would it avail thee that our Nature is thus honoured, if
the benefit of this Aſcenſion did not reflect upon thee. How many are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
enough in themſelves, notwithſtanding the Glory of their humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in Chriſt? None but thoſe that are found in him are the happier by
him: who but the Members are the better for the glory of the Head? O
Saviour, how ſhould our weakneſs have ever hoped to climb into Heaven,
if thou hadſt not gone before and made way for us? It is for us that thou
the Fore-runner art entred in: Now thy Church hath her wiſh, <hi>Draw me,
and I ſhall run after thee.</hi> Even ſo, O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> how ambitiouſly ſhould
we follow thee with the paces of Love and Faith, and aſpire towards thy Glory?
Thou that art <hi>the way,</hi> haſt made the way to thy ſelf and us; <hi>Thou didſt humble
thy ſelf, and becameſt obedient to the death, even to the death of the Croſs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hath God alſo highly exalted thee;</hi> and upon the ſame terms will not
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> fail to advance us: we ſee thy track before us, of Humility and Obedience.
Oh teach me to follow thee in the rougheſt waies of Obedience, in the
bloody paths of Death, that I may at laſt overtake thee in thoſe high ſteps of
Immortality.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt thoſe millions of Angels that attended this triumphant Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of thine, O Saviour, ſome are appointed to this lower ſtation, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
thine aſtoniſhed Diſciples, in the certain aſſurance of thy no-leſs glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Return; <hi>Two men ſtood by them in white apparel.</hi> They ſtood by
them, they were not of them; they ſeemed Men, they were Angels: <hi>Men</hi> for
their familiarity; <hi>two,</hi> for more certainty of teſtimony; <hi>in white,</hi> for the joy
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of thine Aſcenſion.</p>
                  <p>The Angels formerly celebrated thy Nativity with Songs: but we do not
finde they then appeared in white: thou wert then to undergoe much ſorrow,
many conflicts; it was the vale of tears into which thou wert come down.
So ſoon as thou wert riſen, the women ſaw an Angel in the form of a young
man, cloathed in white; and now, ſo ſoon as thou art aſcended, <hi>Two men
cloathed in white</hi> ſtand by thy Diſciples: thy task was now done, thy victory
atchieved, and nothing remained but a Crown, which was now ſet upon thy
head. Juſtly therefore were thoſe bleſſed Angels ſuited with the robes of light
and joy. And why ſhould our garments be of any other colour? why ſhould
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> oile be wanting to our heads, when the eyes of our Faith ſee thee thus aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?
It is for us, O Saviour, that thou art gone to prepare a place in thoſe
celeſtial Manſions; it is for us that thou ſitteſt at the right hand of Majeſty.
It is a piece of thy Divine Prayer to thy Father, that <hi>thoſe whom he hath
given thee, may be with thee.</hi> To every bleeding Soul thou ſaieſt ſtill as thou
didſt to <hi>Peter, Whither I goe thou canſt not follow me now, but thou ſhalt
follow me hereafter.</hi> In aſſured hope of this Glory, why do I not rejoyce,
and beforehand walk in white with thine Angels, that at the laſt I may walk
with thee in white?</p>
                  <p>Little would the preſence of theſe Angels have availed, if they had not been
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> heard as well as ſeen. They ſtand not ſilent therefore, but directing their
ſpeech to the amazed beholders, ſay, <hi>Ye men of Galilee, why ſtand ye gazing
into heaven?</hi> What a queſtion was this? Could any of thoſe two hundred and
forty eyes have power to turn themſelves off to any other Object then that
Cloud, and that point of Heaven where they left their aſcended Saviour?
Surely every one of them were ſo fixed, that had not the ſpeech of theſe
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:44233:131"/>
Angels called them off, there they had ſet up their reſt till the darkneſs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
of night had interpoſed. Pardon me, O ye Bleſſed Angels; had I been
there with them, I ſhould alſo have been unwilling to have had mine eyes pull'd
off from that dear proſpect, and diverted unto you. Never could they have
gazed ſo happily as now. If but ſome Great man be advanced to Honour
over our heads, how apt we are to ſtand at a gaze, and to eye him as ſome
ſtrange meteor? Let the Sun but ſhine a little upon theſe Dials, how are
they look'd at by all paſſengers? Yet, alas, what can earthly advancement
make us other then we are, duſt and aſhes; which the higher it is blown,
the more it is ſcattered? Oh how worthy is the King of Glory to command
our eyes now in the higheſt pitch of his Heavenly exaltation? Lord, I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
look enough at the place where thou art; but what eye could be ſatisfied
with ſeeing the way that thou wenteſt?</p>
                  <p>It was not the purpoſe of theſe Angels to check the long looks of theſe
faithfull Diſciples after their aſcended Maſter; it was onely a change of
eyes that they intended, of Carnal for Spiritual, of the eye of Senſe for the
eye of Faith. <hi>This ſame Jeſus which is taken up from you into heaven, ſhall ſo
come in like manner as ye have ſeen him goe into Heaven.</hi> Look not after him,
O ye weak Diſciples, as ſo departed that ye ſhall ſee him no more; if he be
gone, yet he is not loſt; thoſe Heavens that received him, ſhall reſtore him;
neither can thoſe Bleſſed Manſions decreaſe his Glory. Ye have ſeen him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
aſcend upon the Chariot of a bright Cloud; and in the clouds of Heaven
ye ſhall ſee him deſcend again to his laſt Judgement. He is gone: can it
trouble you to know you have an Advocate in Heaven? Strive not now ſo
much to exerciſe your bodily eyes in looking after him, as the eyes of your
Souls in looking for him.</p>
                  <p>Ye cannot, O ye Bleſſed Spirits, wiſh other then well to mankind. How
happy a diverſion of eyes and thoughts is this that you adviſe? If it be our
ſorrow to part with our Saviour, yet to part with him into Heaven it is our
comfort and felicity: if his abſence could be grievous, his return ſhall be happy
and glorious.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Even ſo, Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi> In the mean while it is not Heaven that
can keep thee from me, it is not earth that can keep me from thee. Raiſe thou
up my Soul to a life of Faith with thee: let me ever injoy thy converſation,
whiles I exſpect thy return.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

            <p>YEa, bleſſed be the Lord, who hath added this unto the load of his other
Mercies to his unworthy ſervant, that the ſame Tongue which was
called not long ſince to chatter out our Publick Mournings, in the
Solemn Faſt of this place, is now imployed in a Song of Praiſe; and
the ſame Hand which was here lifted up for Supplication, is now lift up in
Thanksgiving. Ye that then accompanied me with your tears and ſighs,
accompany me now, I beſeech you, (in this happy change of note and
time) with your joyful Smiles and Acclamations to the GOD that hath
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> wrought it.</p>
            <p>It is not more natural for the Sun, when it looks upon a moiſt and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fermented
earth, to cauſe Vapors to aſcend thence, then it is for Greatneſs
and Goodneſs, when they both meet together upon an honeſt heart, to draw
up holy deſires of gratulation. The worth of the Agent doth it not alone,
without a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>it diſpoſition in the Subject. Let the Sun caſt his ſtrongeſt beams
upon a flint, a pumice, he fetches out no ſtream: Even ſo the Greatneſs and
Goodneſs of the Almighty beating upon a dry and hard heart, prevailes
nothing. Here all three are happily met: In God, infinite Greatneſs, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Goodneſs; ſuch Greatneſs, that he is attended with thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of Angels; (a Guard fit for the King of Heaven) ſuch Goodneſs,
that he <hi>receives Gifts even for the rebellious:</hi> In <hi>David,</hi> a Gracious heart,
that in a ſweet ſenſe of the great Goodneſs of his God breaths out this Divine
<hi>Epiphonema, Bleſſed be the Lord, who loadeth us daily with benefits, even the God
of our Salvation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Wherein, methinks, the ſweet Singer of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſeems to raiſe his note to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:44233:132"/>
the emulation of the Quire of Heaven in the melody of their <hi>Allelujahs:</hi> yea,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
let me ſay, now that he ſings above in that Bleſſed Conſort of glorious Spirits,
his Ditty cannot be better then this that he ſung here upon earth, and wherein
we are about to bear our parts at this time. Prepare, I beſeech you, both your
eares for <hi>David</hi>'s Song, and your hearts and tongues for your own. And firſt,
in this Angelical ſtrain your thoughts cannot but obſerve, without me, the
Deſcant, and the Ground. The Deſcant of Gratulation, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord:</hi>
wherein is both Applauſe, and Excitation; an Applauſe given to God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and an Excitation of others to give that Applauſe. The Ground is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
reſpect. Of what God is in himſelf, <hi>God and Lord:</hi> Of what God is and
doth to us, <hi>which loadeth us daily with benefits:</hi> Of what he is both in himſelf <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
and to us, <hi>The God of our Salvation;</hi> which laſt, (like to ſome rich Stone) is
ſet off with a dark foyl, <hi>To God the Lord belong the iſſues from death.</hi> So in
the firſt, for his own ſake, in the ſecond, for our ſakes, in the third, for his
own and ours; as God, as Lord, as a Benefactor, as a Saviour and Deliverer,
<hi>Bleſſed be the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not hard to obſerve that <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Allelujahs</hi> are more then his <hi>Hoſannas;</hi>
his thanks more then his ſuits. Oft-times doth he praiſe God when be begs
nothing: ſeldome ever doth he beg that favour for which he doth not raiſe up
his Soul to an anticipation of Thanks: neither is this any other then the
univerſal under-ſong of all his Heavenly Ditties, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord. Praiſed</hi> (as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
our former Tranſlation hath it) is too low; Honour is more then Praiſe;
Bleſſing is more then Honour. Neither is it for nothing that from this word
<hi>Barac to bleſs,</hi> is derived <hi>Berec the knee,</hi> which is bowed in bleſſing; and the
cryer before <hi>Joſeph</hi> proclaimed <hi>Abrech,</hi> calling for the honour of the knee from
all beholders, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 43. Every ſlight trivial acknowledgement of worth is a
Praiſe: Bleſſing is in a higher ſtrain of gratitude, that carries the whole ſway
of the heart with it in a kinde of Divine rapture. Praiſe is in matter of comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
Bleſſing of Devotion.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle's Rule is, that <hi>the leſs is bleſſed of the greater, Abraham</hi> of the
King of <hi>Salem;</hi> The Prophets charge is, that <hi>the greater ſhould be bleſſed of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
leſs,</hi> yea the greateſt of the leaſt, God of man. This agrees well: Bleſſing is an
act that will bear reciprocation; God bleſſeth man, and man bleſſeth God. God
bleſſeth man imperatively; man bleſſeth God optatively: God bleſſeth man in
the acts of Mercy; man bleſſeth God in the notions, in the expreſſions of
thanks: God bleſſes man when he makes him good and happy; man bleſſeth
God when he confeſſeth how good, how gracious, how glorious he is; ſo as the
bleſſing is wholly taken up in agnition, in celebration: in the one we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Bounty of God to us; in the other we magnifie him vocally, really, for
that Bounty.</p>
            <p>Oh ſee then what high account God makes of the affections and actions of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
his poor, ſilly, earth-creeping creatures; that he gives us in them power to
bleſs himſelf, and takes it as an honour to be bleſſed of us. <hi>David</hi> wonders
that God ſhould ſo vouchſafe to bleſs man: how much more muſt we needs
wonder at the mercy of God, that will vouchſafe to be bleſſed by man, a worm,
an atome, a nothing? Yet both S. <hi>James</hi> tels us that <hi>with the tongue we bleſs God;</hi>
and the Pſalmiſt calls for it here as a ſervice of dear acceptation, <hi>Bleſſed be the
Lord.</hi> Even we men live not (Cameleon-like) with the aire of thanks, nor
feed ere the fatter with praiſes; how much leſs our Maker? O God, we know
well that whatſoever men or Angels doe or doe not, thou canſt not but be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
Bleſſed in thy ſelf; before ever any creature was, thou didſt equally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
injoy thy bleſſed Self from all Eternity: what can this worthleſs looſe filme
of fleſh either adde to or detract from thine Infiniteneſs? Yet thou <hi>that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
thy ſelf to behold the things that are done in Heaven and earth,</hi> humbleſt
thy ſelf alſo to accept the weak breath of our Praiſes, that are ſent up to thee
from earth to Heaven. How ſhould this incourage the vows, the endeavours
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:44233:132"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of our hearty thankfulneſs, to ſee them graciouſly taken? Would men take up
with good words, with good deſires, and quit our bonds for thanks, who would
be a debter? With the God of Mercy this cheap payment is current. If he then
will honour us ſo far as to be bleſſed of us, Oh let us honour him ſo far as to
bleſſe him. <hi>Quare verbis parcam? gratuita ſunt, Why do we ſpare thanks that
coſt us nothing?</hi> as that wiſe heathen. <hi>O give unto the Lord, ye mighty, give
unto the Lord the praiſes due to his name; offer to God the ſacrifice of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving:</hi>
and ſtill let the foot of our ſong be, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This for the Deſcant of gratulation; the Ground follows. His own ſake
hath reaſon to be firſt: God will be bleſſed both as <hi>Jah,</hi> and <hi>Adonai;</hi> the one
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the ſtyle of his Eſſence, the other of his Soveraignty. Even the moſt accurſed
<hi>Deiſt</hi> would confeſſe, that as a pure, ſimple, infinite, abſolute being, God is to
be bleſſed: for if Being be good, and theſe two be convertible, Nature muſt
needs teach him, that an abſolute and infinite Being muſt needs be abſolutely
and infinitely good. But what do I blur the Glory of this Day with mention of
thoſe Monſters, whoſe Idol is Nature, whoſe Religion is ſecondary Atheiſm,
whoſe true region is the loweſt Hell? Thoſe damned Ethnicks cannot, will not
conceive of God as he is, becauſe they impiouſly ſever his Eſſence from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Relations. We Chriſtians can never be ſo heavenly affected to God as
we ought, till we can riſe to this pitch of Piety, to bleſſe God for what he is
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in himſelf, without the external beneficial relations to the creature: Elſe our
reſpects reflect too much homeward, and we do but look through God at
our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Neither is it for us only to bleſſe him as an abſolute God, but as a Soveraign
Lord too, whoſe Power hath no more limit then his Eſſence; the great Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
of Heaven and earth, giving laws to his creature, overruling all things,
marſhalling all events, cruſhing his enemies, maintaining his Church, adored
by Angels, trembled at by Devils. Behold here a Lord worthy to be bleſſed.
We honour, as we ought, your conſpicuous Greatneſs, O ye eminent Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
of the earth: but, alas! what is this to the great Lord of Heaven? when
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> we look up thither, we muſt crave leave to pity the breath of your noſtrils, the
ruſt of your Coronets, the duſt of your graves, the ſting of your felicities, and
(if ye take not good heed) the blots of your memories. As ye hold all in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee
from this great Lord, ſo let it be no diſparagement to you to doe your low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt
homage to his footſtool: homage, I mean, in Action; give me the reall
benediction; I am ſure that is the beſt. They bleſſe God that praiſe him; they
bleſſe him more and praiſe him beſt that obey him. There are that crouch to
you Great ones, who yet hate you: Oh let us take heed of offering theſe hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
obſervances to the ſearcher of hearts, if we love not our own confuſion.
They that proclaimed Chriſt at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> had not only <hi>Hoſanna</hi> in their
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> mouths, but palms in their hands too; ſo muſt we have. Let me ſay then, If
the Hand bleſs not the Lord, the Tongue is an Hypocrite. Away with the waſt
complements of our vain Formalities: Let our loud actions drown the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of our words, in bleſſing the name of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Neither muſt we bleſs God as a Soveraign Lord only, but (which is yet
a more feeling relation) as a munificent Benefactor, <hi>Who loadeth us daily with
benefits.</hi> Such is man's ſelf-love, that no inward worth can ſo attract his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
as outward beneficence. Whiles thou makeſt much of thy ſelf, every one
ſhall ſpeak well of thee; how much more whiles thou makeſt much of them?
Here God hath met with us alſo. Not to perplex you with ſcanning the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of ſenſes wherewith I have obſerved this Pſalm, above all other of <hi>David</hi>'s,
to abound; ſee here, I beſeech you, a four-fold gradation of Divine Bounty.
Firſt, here are <hi>Benefits.</hi> The word is not expreſſed in the Original, but neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
implied in the ſenſe: for there are but three loads whereof man is capable
from God, Favours, Precepts, Puniſhments; the other two are out of the
road of Gratulation. When we might therefore have exſpected Judgments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:44233:133"/>
hold <hi>Benefits.</hi> And thoſe, ſecondly, not ſparingly handfulled out to us, but dealt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
to us by the whole load; <hi>loadeth with benefits.</hi> Whom, thirdly, doth he load, but
<hi>us?</hi> Not worthy and well-deſerving ſubjects, but <hi>us</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Rebels.</hi> And laſtly
this he doth, not at one doal and no more, (as even churls rare Feaſts uſe to
be plentifull,) but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſucceſſively, unweariedly, perpetually. One favour
were too much, here are <hi>Benefits;</hi> a ſprinkling were too much, here is a <hi>load;</hi>
once were too oft, here is <hi>daily</hi> largition. Caſt your eyes therefore a little upon
this threefold exaggeration of Beneficence: the meaſure, <hi>a load of benefits;</hi> the
ſubject, unworthy <hi>us;</hi> the time, <hi>daily. Who daily loadeth us with benefits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where ſhall we begin to ſurvey this vaſt load of Mercies? Were it no more
but that he hath given us a world to live in, a life to injoy, aire to breath in,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
earth to tread on, fire to warm us, water to cool and cleanſe us, cloaths to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us, food to nouriſh us, ſleep to refreſh us, houſes to ſhelter us, variety of
creatures to ſerve and delight us; here were a juſt load. But now, if we yet
adde to theſe civility of breeding, dearneſſe of friends, competency of Eſtate,
degrees of Honour, honeſty or dignity of vocation, favour of Princes, ſucceſſe
in imployments, domeſtick comforts, outward peace, good reputation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
from dangers, reſcue from evils; the load is well mended. If yet ye
ſhall come cloſer, and adde due proportion of Body, integrity of parts, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of ſenſes, ſtrength of nature, mediocrity of health, ſufficiency of appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
vigour of digeſtion, wholſome temper of ſeaſons, freedome from cares; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
this courſe muſt needs heighten it yet more. If ſtill ye ſhall adde to theſe the
order and power and exerciſe of our inward Faculties, inriched with Wiſdome,
Art, Learning, Experience, expreſſed by a not-unhandſome Elocution; and ſhall
now lay all theſe together that concern Eſtate, Body, Minde; how can the
axel-tree of the Soul but crack under the load of theſe Favours? But if from
what God hath done for us as men, we look to what he hath done for us as
Chriſtians; that he hath imbraced us with an everlaſting Love, that he hath
molded us anew, enlivened us by his Spirit, fed us by his Word &amp; Sacraments,
clothed us with his Merits, bought us with his Blood, becoming vile to make
us glorious, a Curſe, to inveſt us with Bleſſedneſs, in a word, that he hath given <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
himſelf to us, his Son for us; <hi>Oh the height, and depth, and breadth</hi> of the rich
mercies of our God! Oh the boundleſſe, topleſſe, bottomleſſe load of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
benefits, whoſe immenſity reaches from the center of this earth to the
unlimited extent of the very Empyreal Heavens! <hi>Oh that men would praiſe
the Lord for his goodneſſe, and declare the wonders that he doth for the children
of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Mercies are great in themſelves, our unworthineſs doth greaten them
more. To doe good to the well-deſerving were but retribution; He <hi>ladeth
us,</hi> who are no leſſe rebellious to him then he is beneficial to us. Our ſtreight
and ſhallow bounty picks out the worthieſt and moſt capable Subject; the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
greateſt gift that ever God gave, he gives us whiles we are enemies. It was
our Saviour's charge to his Diſciples, <hi>Interrogate quis dignus, Ask who is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi>
that is, (as <hi>Hierom</hi> interprets it) of the honour to receive ſuch gueſts.
Should God ſtand upon thoſe terms with us, what ſhould become of us? See,
and wonder, and be aſhamed, O ye Chriſtian hearers. God loads us, and we
load him; God loads us with Benefits, we load him with our Sins. <hi>Behold, I am
preſſed under you,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>as a cart is preſſed that is full of ſheaves,</hi> Amos 2. 13.
He ſhould goe away laden with our thanks, with the preſents of our duty; and
we ſhamefully clog him with our continual provocations. Can there be here
any danger of ſelf-ſacrificing with <hi>Sejanus,</hi> and not rather the juſt danger of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
our ſhame and confuſion in our ſelves? How can we but hate this unkinde
and unjuſt unanſwerableneſſe? Yet herein ſhall we make an advantage of our
fouleſt ſins, that they give ſo much more luſtre to the glorious mercies of our
God, who overcomes our evil with good, and loads even <hi>us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The over-long interruption of favours loſeth their thanks, and the beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:44233:133"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> languiſh in too much diſuſe. Our God takes order for that, by a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
of beneficence; he <hi>ladeth us daily:</hi> Every day, every minute renews his
favours upon us; <hi>Semper largitor, ſemper donator,</hi> as <hi>Hierome.</hi> To ſpeak ſtrictly,
there is no time preſent; nothing is preſent but an inſtant, and that can no
more be called Time then a prick can be called a Line: yet how ſwift ſoever
the wings of Time are, they cannot cut one inſtant, but they muſt carry with
them a ſucceſſive renovation of God's gracious kindneſs to us.</p>
            <p>This Sun of his doth not riſe once in an age, or once in a year, but every
minute ſince it was created riſeth to ſome parts of the earth, and every day
to us. Neither doth he once hurl down upon our heads ſome violent drops
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in a ſtorm, but he plies us with the ſweet ſhowrs of the former and the latter
rain: Wherein the Mercy of God condeſcends to our impotency, who are
ready to periſh under uncomfortable intermiſſions. <hi>Non mihi ſufficit,</hi> ſaith that
Father, It is not enough that he hath given me once, if he give me not alwaies.
To daies Ague makes us forget yeſterſtaies health: Former meals do not relieve
our preſent hunger. This cottage of ours ruines ſtraight, if it be not new daubed
every day, new repaired. The liberal care of our God therefore tiles over one
benefit with another, that it may not rain through. And if he be ſo unwearied
in his Favours, why are we weary of our Thanks? Our bonds are renewed every
day to our God; why not our payments? Not once in a year, or moon, or
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> week, but every day once (without fail) were the Legal Sacrifices reiterated;
and that of all thoſe creatures which were neceſſary for ſuſtentation, a Lamb,
flowre, wine, oyle, that is, meat, bread, drink, ſauce: Why? but that in all
theſe we ſhould ſtill daily re-acknowledge our new obligations to the giver?
Yea, <hi>ex plenitudine &amp; lacrymis,</hi> as it is in the Original, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 29. <hi>of our plenty
and tears,</hi> that is, (as <hi>Cajetan</hi>) of a dear or cheap year muſt we return: more or
leſſe may not miſſe our thanks. We need daily, we beg daily, (<hi>Give us this
day</hi>) we receive daily; why do we not daily retribute to our God, and act as
ſome read it, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord daily, who loadeth us with his benefits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is time now to turn your eyes to that mixt reſpect, that reacheth both to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> God and us. Ye have ſeen him a Benefactor, ſee him a Saviour and Deliverer;
<hi>The God of our Salvation.</hi> The Vulgar's <hi>ſalutaria,</hi> following the Septuagint,
differs from our <hi>Salvation</hi> but as the Means from the End. With the Hebrews
<hi>Salvation</hi> is a wide word, compriſing all the favours of God that may tend to
preſervation; and therefore the Pſalmiſt elſewhere extends this act both to
man and beaſt; and, as if he would comment upon himſelf, expounds <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>ſave,</hi> by <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>proſper, Pſal.</hi> 118. 25. It is ſo dear a title of God, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
cannot have enough of it; the interpoſition of a <hi>Selah</hi> cannot bar the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling
of it in my Text.</p>
            <p>Every deliverance, every preſervation fathers it ſelf upon God: yet as the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Soul is the moſt precious thing in the world, and life is the moſt precious
thing that belongs to the Soul, and eternal life is the beſt of lives, and the
danger and loſſe of this life is the fearfulleſt and moſt horrible; chiefly is this
greateſt Salvation here meant, wherein God intends moſt to bleſſe and be
bleſſed.</p>
            <p>Of this Salvation is he the God by Preordination, by Purchace, by Gift. By
Preordination, in that he hath decreed it to us from eternity, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi>
8. 30. By Purchace, in that he hath bought it for us, and us to it, by the price of
his blood, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. By Gift, in that he hath feoft us in it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>The gift of God is eternal life,</hi> Rom. 6. 23. Since therefore he decreed
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> it, he bought it, he beſtows it, juſtly is he <hi>the God of our Salvation.</hi> Who can,
who dates arrogate to himſelf any partnerſhip in this great work? What
power can diſpoſe of the Souls final condition, but the ſame that made it? Who
can give Eternity, but he that onely hath it? What but an infinite Merit can
purchaſe an infinite Glory? Curſed be that ſpirit that will offer to ſhare with
his Maker. Down with your Crowns, O ye glorious Elders, at the foot of him
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:44233:134"/>
that ſits on the Throne, with a <hi>Non nobis, Domine, Not unto us, O Lord, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
us, but to thy Name give the praiſe.</hi> Away with the proud incroachment of
the Merits of the beſt Saints, of Papal Largeſſes. Only <hi>our God is the God of our
Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How happy are we the while? All actions are according to the force of the
Agent: weak Cauſes produce feeble Effects, contingent caſual, neceſſary cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
Our Salvation therefore being the work of an infinitely-powerfull cauſe,
cannot be diſappointed. Loe the beauty of <hi>Solomon's Al-chum; who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
his will?</hi> When we look to our own fleſhie hands, here is nothing but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement;
when we look to our ſpiritual enemies, here is nothing but ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour:
but when we caſt up our eyes to the Mighty God, here is nothing but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
confidence, nothing but comfort. Comfort ye, comfort ye therefore, O ye
feeble Souls, and ſend your bold defiances to the Prince of darkneſſe. Heaven
is high and hard to reach, Hell is ſteep and ſlipperie, our Fleſh is earthy and
impotent, Satan ſtrong &amp; rancorous, Sin ſubtle, the World alluring, all theſe;
yet, <hi>God is the God of our Salvation.</hi> Let thoſe infernal Lions roar and ramp
upon us; let the gates of Hell doe their worſt; let the World be a cheater, our
Fleſh a traitor, the Devil a tyrant; <hi>Faithfull is he that hath promiſed, who will
alſo doe it. God is the God of our Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How much more then in theſe outward temporal occaſions, when we have
to doe with an arm of fleſh? Do the enemies of the Church rage and ſnuffe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
and breath nothing but threats and death? Make ſure of our God, he ſhall be
ſure to make them lick our duſt. Great <hi>Benhadad</hi> of the <hi>Syrians</hi> ſhall come
with his hempen collar to the King of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> The very windes and waves ſhall
undertake thoſe <hi>Mahumetan</hi> or <hi>Marian</hi> powers that ſhall riſe up againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of the God of Salvation.</p>
            <p>Salvation is rateable according to the danger from which we are delivered:
Since Death therefore is the utmoſt of all terribles, needs muſt it be the higheſt
improvement of Salvation, that <hi>to our God belong the iſſues from death.</hi> Death
hath here a double latitude, of kinde, of extent: The kinde is either temporal,
or eternal; the extent reaches not only to the laſt compleat act of diſſolution,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
but to all the paſſages that lead towards it. Thus the iſſues from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> death belong
to our God, whether by way of preſervation, or by way of reſcue. How gladly
do I meet in my Text with the dear and ſweet name of our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
Death by dying, and triumphed over Hell by ſuffering, and carries <hi>the
keyes both of death and hell,</hi> Revel. 1. 18? He is the God, the Author and Finiſher
of our Salvation, <hi>to whom belong the iſſues from death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Look firſt at the temporary: he keeps it from us, he fetches us from it.</p>
            <p>It is true, there is a <hi>Statutum eſt</hi> upon it, die we muſt; Death knocks equally
at the hatch of a Cottage and gate of a Palace: but our times are in God's hand;
the Lord of life hath ſet us our period, whoſe Omnipotence ſo contrives all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
events, that neither enemy, nor caſualty, nor diſeaſe can prevent his hour.
Were death ſuffered to run looſe and wild, what boot were it to live? now it is
tether'd up ſhort by that Almighty hand, what can we fear? If envy repine, and
villany plot againſt Sacred Soveraignty, God hath well proved upon all the
Poiſons, and Piſtols, and Poniards, and Gun-powders of the two late memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ſucceſſions, that <hi>to him alone belong the iſſues from death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Goe on then, bleſſed Soveraign, goe on couragiouſly in the waies of your
God: the inviſible guard of Heaven ſhall ſecure your Royal head; the God of
our Salvation ſhall make you a third glorious inſtance to all poſterities, that
<hi>unto him belong the iſſues from death.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
            </p>
            <p>Thus God keeps death from us: it is more comfort yet that he fetches us
from it. Even the beſt head muſt at laſt lie down in the duſt, and ſleep in
death. Oh vain cracks of valour! thou bragſt thy ſelf able to kill a man; a
worm hath done it, a flie hath done it. Every thing can finde the way down unto
death; none but the Omnipotent can finde the way up out of it: He findes,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:44233:134"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he makes theſe iſſues for all his. As it was with our Head, ſo it is with the
Members.</p>
            <p>Death might ſeize, it cannot hold: <hi>Guſtavit, non deglutivit:</hi> It may nibble
at us, it ſhall not devour us. Behold the only Soveraign Antidote againſt the
ſorrows, the frights of death. Who can fear to lay himſelf down and take a
nap in the bed of death, when his heart is aſſured that he ſhall awake glorious
in the morning of his reſurrection? Certainly it is only our infidelity that
makes death fearfull. <hi>Rejoice not over me, O my</hi> laſt <hi>enemy; though I fall, I ſhall
riſe again. O Death, where is thy ſting? O Grave, where is thy victory?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Caſt ye one glance of your eyes upon the ſecond and eternal death; the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> iſſues wherefrom belong to our God, not by way of reſcue, as in the former,
but of preſervation. <hi>Ex inferno nulla redemptio</hi> is as true as if it were Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.
Father <hi>Abraham</hi> tells the damned Glutton in the Parable, there is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>a great gulf,</hi> that bars all return. Thoſe black gates of Hell are barred
without by the irreverſible Decree of the Almighty.</p>
            <p>Thoſe bold Fabuliſts therefore, whoſe impious Legends have deviſed <hi>Trajan</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> The reſcue is not more hopeleſſe then the prevention is comfortable. There
is none of us but is naturally walking down to theſe chambers of death; every
ſin is a pace thitherwards: only the gracious hand of our God ſtaies us. In
our ſelves, in our ſins we are already no better then brands of that Hell. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
be the God of our Salvation, that hath found happy iſſues from this death.
What iſſues? Even thoſe bloody iſſues that were made in the hands and feet
and ſide of our Bleſſed Saviour, that invaluably-precious blood of the Son of
God is that whereby we are redeemed, whereby we are juſtified, whereby we
are ſaved. Oh that our Souls might have had leiſure to dwell a while upon the
meditation of thoſe dreadfull torments we are freed from, of that infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that hath freed us, of that happy exchange of a glorious condition to
which we are freed! But the publick occaſion of this day calls off my ſpeech,
and invites me to the celebration of the ſenſible mercy of God in our late Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
deliverance.</p>
            <p>Wherein let me firſt bleſſe the God of our Salvation, that hath put it into
the heart of his choſen Servant to ſet up an Altar in this ſacred threſhing-floor,
and to offer up this daies Sacrifice to his name, for the ſtay of our late mortal
contagion. How well it becomes our <hi>Gideon</hi> to be perſonally exemplary, as in
the beating of this Earthen pitcher in the firſt publick act of Humiliation, ſo in
the lighting of this Torch of publick joy, and ſounding the Trumpet of a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thankfull jubilation? and how well will it become us to follow ſo pious, ſo
gracious an example? Come therefore, all ye that fear the Lord, and let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
what he hath done for our Souls. Come, let us <hi>bleſſe the Lord, the God
of our Salvation, that loadeth us daily with benefits; the God to whom belong the
iſſues of death.</hi> Let us bleſſe him in his infinite Eſſence and Power; bleſſe him
in his unbounded and juſt Soveraignty; bleſſe him in his marvellous Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
large, continual, undeſerved; bleſſe him in his Preſervations; bleſſe him
in his Deliverances. We may but touch at the two laſt.</p>
            <p>How is our Earth ready to ſink under the load of his Mercies? What Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
under Heaven hath not envied and wondred at our Bleſſings? I do not carry
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> back your eyes to the ancient favours of our God, to the memorable fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

<hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I muſt follow the times, let me rather balk that helliſh Sulphur-mine
then not ſearch it; and yet who can look at that any otherwiſe then the
Jews do at the Rain-bow, with horror and aſtoniſhment? What do I tell you
of our long Peace, our full Plenty, our wholſome Laws, our eaſefull Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
with a world of theſe common favours? It is for poor men to reckon.
Thoſe two late Bleſſings (if no more) were worthy of immortal memory; the
Prince out of <hi>Spain,</hi> Religion out of the duſt. For the one, what a winter was
there in all good hearts when our Sun was gone ſo far Southward? how chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a Spring in his return? For the other, who ſaw not how Religion began
(during thoſe purpoſely-protracted Treaties) to droop and languiſh, her friends
to ſigh, her enemies to inſult, daring to brave us with challenges, to threaten
our ruine? <hi>The Lord looked down from Heaven, and viſited this poor Vine of his,</hi>
and hath ſhaken off theſe Caterpillars from her then-waſting leaves; now we
live, and it flouriſheth.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe would have been great favours of God even to the beſt Nation, but
more to us, who have anſwered Mercies with Rebellions. O God, if proud
diſguiſes, if gluttonous pamperings, if drunken healths, if wanton dalliances,
if bloody oaths, if mercileſſe oppreſſions may earn Bleſſings from thee, too
many of us have ſupererogated. Woe is me, theſe are the meaſures thou haſt
had from too many hands. That thou ſhouldſt therefore inlarge thy bounty
to an unworthy, unkinde, diſobedient generation, it is more then we can won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at; and we could almoſt be ready to ſay with <hi>Peter, Lord, depart from us,
for we are ſinfull men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet the wiſe Juſtice of the Almighty meant not to cocker us up with mere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
dainties, with a looſe indulgence, but hath thought fit to temper our ſweets
with tartneſſe, and to ſtrike our backs whiles he ſtrokes our heads. <hi>Ecce in
pace amaritudo amariſsima;</hi> the comfort of our Peace was allayed with the
bitterneſſe of death. He ſaw that in this common Plethorie it was fit for us
to bleed; he ſaw us Eeles that would not be caught, but when the waters were
troubled: He therefore ſent his deſtroying Angel abroad, who laid about
him on all ſides. What ſlaughter, what lamentation, what horror was there
in the ſtreets of our mother City? More then twenty thouſand Families run
from their houſes, as if thoſe had been on fire over their heads, and ſeek ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in <hi>Zoar</hi> and the mountains. Some of them are overtaken by the purſuer,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
and drop down in the way, and lie there as wofull ſpectacles of mortality,
till neceſſity, and not Charity, could finde them a grave. Others paſſe on,
and for friends finde ſtrangers: Danger made men wiſely and unwillingly
unhoſpital: The Cozen, the Brother forgets his own blood, and the Father
looks ſhily upon his own childe, and welcomes him with frowns, if not with
repulſes. There were that repai'd their grudged harbour with infection. And
thoſe that ſped beſt, what with care for their abandoned houſes and eſtate,
what with grief for the miſery of their forſaken neighbours, what with the
rage of thoſe Epidemical diſeaſes which they found abroad, (as it is well
obſerved by one, that in a contagious time all ſickneſſes have ſome tincture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
of Peſtilence) wore out their daies in the deepeſt ſorrow and heavineſſe.
There leave we them, and return to the miſerable Metropolis of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
which they left. Who can expreſſe the dolefull condition of that time
and place? The arms of <hi>London</hi> are the <hi>Red Croſs</hi> and the <hi>Sword;</hi> what houſe
almoſt wanted theſe? Here was the Red Croſs upon the door, the Sword
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:44233:135"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of God's Judgment within doors, and the Motto was, <hi>Lord, have mercy
upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What could we hear but alarms of death? what could we ſee but Trophees
of death? Here was nothing but groaning and crying, and dying and burying:
Carts were the Biers, wide pits were the Graves, mens cloaths were their
Coffins, and the very Exequies of friends were murderous. The carkaſſes of
the dead might ſay, with the ſons of the Prophets, <hi>Behold the place where we lie is
too ſtreight for us.</hi> New Dormitories are bought for the dead, and furniſhed;
neither might the corpſes be allowed to lie ſingle in their earthen beds, but
are piled up like fagots in a ſtack, for the ſociety of their future Reſurrection.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> No man ſurvived, but he might ſay with the Pſalmiſt, that <hi>thouſands fell at his
ſide, and ten thouſands at his right hand.</hi> And if we take all together, (the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

though his time were ſhorter. It is not without reaſon that from the Hebrew

Certainly the Plague turns the moſt populous City into a Deſart. Oh the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
deſolation of this place! It was almoſt come to <hi>Herba tegit Trojam.</hi> And
if ſome infrequent paſſenger croſſed our ſtreets, it was not without his medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Poſie at his noſe, and his Zedoary or Angelica in his mouth. Every room
ſeemed a Peſt-houſe, every ſent mortal. Here ſhould he meet one pale ghoſt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> muffled up under the throat, another dragging his legs after him for the tumor
of his groin, another beſpotted with the Tokens of inſtant death: here might
he hear one ſhreeking out in a frantick diſtraction, there another breathing
out his Soul in his laſt groans. What ſhould I ſay more? This glorious cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Kingdome ſeemed no other then a dreadfull dungeon to her own,
a very <hi>Golgotha</hi> to all beholders; and this proud Queen of our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Cities
ſate in the duſt of her compaſſion, howling in the rags of her ſackcloth, not
mourning more then mourned for, pitied no leſſe then forſaken; when the
God of our Salvation looked down upon her deep afflictions, and miraculouſly
proved unto us, that <hi>unto him belong the iſſues from death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> It was he that put it into the heart of his Gracious Servant to command a
<hi>Ninive</hi>-like Humiliation. What pithie, what paſſionate Prayers were injoined
to his diſconſolate Church? With what holy eagerneſſe did we devour thoſe
Faſts? How well were we pleaſed with the auſterity of that pious Penitence?
What loud cries did beat on all ſides at the gates of Heaven? and with what
inexſpectable, unconceivable mercy were they anſwered? How ſuddenly were
thoſe many thouſands brought down to one poor unity, not a number? O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
evils were wont to come on horſeback, to goe away on foot; this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
did not poſt but flie away. Methought, like unto the great ice, it ſunk
at once. Only ſo many are ſtricken as may hold us awfull, and ſo few as may
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> leave us thankfull.</p>
            <p>Oh how ſoon is our Faſting and mourning turned into Laughter and
joy? How boldly do we now throng into this Houſe of God, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
mix our breaths in a common Devotion? <hi>This is the Lord's doing, and
it is marvailous in our eyes. O thou that heareſt the prayer, to thee ſhall all fleſh

            <p>It might have been juſt with thee, O God, to have ſwept us away in the

Howling and lamentation is fitter for this occaſion. Surely, as we do

Favours and Bleſſings from God to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> Sins (which are the higheſt Wrongs)
from <hi>Iſrael</hi> to God; Judgments, by way of Revenge from God to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And
each of thoſe follow upon other. God begins with Favours to his people, they
anſwer him with their Sins, he replies upon them with Judgments: and all of
theſe are in their height. The Favours of God are ſuch, as he asks, <hi>What could
be more?</hi> The Sins are aggravated by thoſe Favours: what worſe then <hi>wilde

Queſtion, <hi>What could have been done more to my Vineyard that I have not
done to it?</hi> Every word is a new obligation. That <hi>Iſrael</hi> is a Vineyard is no

Vineyard ſo exquiſitely cultivated, as nothing more could be either added or
deſired, is moſt of all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſrael</hi> is no vaſt Deſart, no wilde Foreſt, no mooriſh Fen, no barren Heath,
no thornie Thicket, but a Vineyard; a Soile of uſe and fruit. Look where you
will in God's Book, ye ſhall never finde any lively member of Gods Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:44233:137"/>
to any but a fruitfull tree: Not to a tall Cypreſſe, the Embleme of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
Honour; nor to a ſmooth Aſh, the Embleme of unprofitable Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,

but Form; nor to a hollow Maple, nor to a trembling Aſpe, nor to a prickly
Thorn; ſhortly, not to any Plant whatſoever whoſe fruit is not uſefull and
beneficial. Hear this then, ye goodly Cedars, ſtrong Elmes, faſt-growing
Willows, ſappy Sycomores, and all the reſt of the fruitleſſe trees of the earth,
I mean all faſhionable and barren Profeſſors whatſoever: ye may ſhoot up in
height, ye may ſpread far, ſhade well, ſhew fair; but what are ye good for?
Ye may be fit for the Foreſt, Ditches, Hedg-rows of the world; ye are not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
for the true ſaving ſoil of God's <hi>Iſrael:</hi> that is a Vineyard; there is place for
none but Vines; and true Vines are fruitfull. <hi>He that abideth in me bringeth
forth much fruit,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 15. 5.</p>
            <p>And of all fruits, what is comparable to that of the Vine? Let the Vine it
ſelf ſpeak in <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s Parable, <hi>Jud. 9. 13. Should I leave my Wine which chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
God and man?</hi> How is this? God cheared with Wine? It is an high Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole;
yet ſeconded by the God of truth: <hi>I will drink no more of the fruit of
this Vine, till I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom,</hi> Mat. 26. 29. It
muſt needs be an excellent liquor which is uſed to reſemble the joyes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Yea, the Blood of the Son of God, that celeſtial Nectar, which tomorrow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
ſhall chear our Souls, is it otherwiſe reſembled then by the blood of the
Grape? He is <hi>Vitis vera, the true Vine;</hi> this is his juice.</p>
            <p>Alas! would God we had not too much cauſe to complain of the pleaſure of
this fruit: Religion, Reaſon, Humanity ſavour not to the palate of many in

it daily cheat of their Subſtance, of their Patrimony, of their Health, of their
Wit, of their Senſe, of their Life, of their Soul? Oh that we had the grace to be
ſenſible of our owne ſcorn and danger. But this is the honour of the fruit,
and the ſhame of the man: the exceſſe is not more our Sin, then the delicacy
is the praiſe of the Grape. For ſweetneſſe of verdure then all plants will yield <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

of forwardneſſe. Honourable and beloved, how ſhould this hearten us
in our holy ſtations, in our conſcionable actions? Whiles we continue Vines,
it is not in the power of our imperfections to loſe our thanks. The delicateſt
Grape cannot be ſo reliſhſome to the palate of man, as our poor weak obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
are to the God of Mercies. <hi>Thou haſt raviſhed my heart, my Siſter, my
Spouſe, thou haſt raviſhed my heart,</hi> ſaith Chriſt of his Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 9. The
Vine is a noble plant, but a feeble and tender one. Other trees grow up alone
out of the ſtrength of their own ſap; this grovels on the ground, and rots if it
have not an Elm to prop it: like as Man, the beſt creature, is in his birth moſt
helpleſſe, and would preſently die without outward ſuccours. Such is the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
of God; the worthieſt piece of Gods Creation, yet of it ſelf impotent to
good: here is no growth, no life but from that Divine Hand. <hi>Without me ye
can doe nothing.</hi> They are no Vines that can ſtand alone: Thoſe proud ſpirits,
as they have no need of God, ſo God hath no intereſt in them. His <hi>Iſrael</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
is a Vineyard; and the Vine muſt be propped.</p>
            <p>As a Vineyard, ſo God's Vineyard. The Church ſhall be ſure not to be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterleſſe.
There is much waſt ground that hath no owner; our Globe can tell
us of a great part of the World that hath no name but <hi>Incognita, not known</hi>
whether it have any inhabitant: but a Vineyard was never without a Poſſeſſor;
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:44233:137"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> till <hi>Noah</hi> the true <hi>Janus</hi> planted one, there was no news of any. Come into
ſome wilde <hi>Indian</hi> Foreſt all furniſhed with goodly Trees, you know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ever man were there; God's hand we are ſure hath been there, perhaps
not mans: but if you come into a well-dreſſed Vineyard, where you ſee the
Hillocks equally ſwelling, the Stakes pitcht in a juſt height and diſtance, and
the Vines handſomely pruned, now it is eaſie to ſay (as the Philoſopher did
when he found Figures) Here hath been a man, yea a good husband. There is
an univerſall Providence of God over the World; but there is a ſpecial eye and
hand of God over his Church. In this God challengeth a peculiar intereſt: that
is his (as we heard worthily this day) in a double right, of Confederation, of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Redemption. <hi>Iſrael is my Son, yea my firſt-born,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Pharaoh. Thou haſt
brought a Vine out of AEgypt, thou haſt caſt out the Heathen and planted it,</hi> ſaith
the Pſalmiſt, 80. 8.</p>
            <p>Oh the blaſphemous diffidence of fooliſh men! Can we, dare we impute ill
husbandry to the God of Heaven? Hath God a Vineyard, and ſhall he not tend
it? ſhall he not mightily protect it? Goe on, ye <hi>Foxes,</hi> ye <hi>little Foxes,</hi> to <hi>ſpoil
the tender Grapes;</hi> goe on, ye <hi>Boars of the Wood, to waſte</hi> this Vineyard, and
ye <hi>wilde beaſts of the field</hi> to <hi>devour</hi> it: our ſins, our ſins have given this
ſcope to your violence and our calamity: But ye ſhall once know that this
Vineyard hath an Owner, even the mighty God of <hi>Jacob;</hi> every cluſter that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> you have ſpoiled ſhall be fetcht back again from the bloody Wine-preſſe of his
wrath; and in ſpight of all the gates of Hell this Vine ſhall flouriſh. Even ſo,
<hi>return, we beſeech thee, O God of Hoſts: look down from Heaven, and viſit this
Vine, and the Vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that
thou madeſt ſtrong for thy ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ye have ſeen <hi>Iſrael</hi> a Vineyard, and God's Vineyard: now caſt your eyes
upon the favours that God hath done to his Vineyard <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſuch as that God
appeals to their own hearts for Judges, <hi>What could have been done more to my
Vineyard that I have not done?</hi> Mark, I beſeech you: He doth not ſay, <hi>What
could have been done more then hath been done?</hi> but, <hi>more, that I have not done?</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> challenging all the acts done to his Vineyard for his own. As the Soil is his, ſo
is all the culture. He that elſewhere makes himſelf <hi>the Vine, and</hi> his <hi>Father the
Husbandman,</hi> here makes <hi>Iſrael</hi> the Vine, and himſelf the Husbandman. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is, nothing can be done to his Church that paſſeth not his hands. <hi>My
Father ſtill worketh,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and I work.</hi> This work, this care knows no
end, no limits. Many a good Husband over-tasks himſelf, and undertakes
more then his eye can overlook, or his hand ſway; and therefore is fain to
truſt to the management of others; and it ſpeeds thereafter. But the owner
of this Vineyard is every where, and works whereever he is: nothing can
paſſe his eye, every thing muſt paſſe his hand. This is the difference betwixt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Vineyard and his that is <hi>greater then Solomon: Solomon lets out his
Vineyard to Keepers,</hi> Cant. 8. 11. Chriſt keeps his in his own hand. He uſeth
indeed the help of men, but as Tools rather then as Agents; he works by
them, they cannot work but by him. Are any of you Great ones Benefactors
to his Church? (a rare ſtyle I confeſſe in theſe not dative but ablative times) ye
are but as the hands of the Sub-almoners of Heaven: God gives by you. Are
any great Potentates of the earth ſecret or open perſecutors of his Church?
<hi>Aſhur is the rod of my wrath,</hi> ſaith God: they are but as God's pruning<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to make his Vine bleed out her ſuperfluous juice: God cuts by them. He is
the Author of both, men are the inſtruments. To him muſt we return the praiſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of his Mercy in the one, and in the other the awe of his Judgments. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is done to his Church, God doth it himſelf. Neither doth he ſay, <hi>What
could I have done more that I have not done?</hi> as our former Tranſlation reads it,
with a reference to his abſolute power; according whereto we know that he
can doe more then he doth, more then he will doe: but, <gap reason="foreign">

What could have been done more,</hi> in reſpect of the exigence of the

make all the World <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he could make all <hi>Iſrael</hi> Saints, he could have made
Devils men, men Angels. But God uſes not to proceed according to the rule of
an abſolute Omnipotency, but according to the Oeconomie of his moſt holy,
moſt wiſe, moſt juſt Decrees; whereby he hath chalked out unto men thoſe
waies and helps of Salvation, which he ſees fit for the attainment of that End<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
theſe are they wherein he hath not been failing to his <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe he ſayes, <hi>What could have been done more that I have not done?</hi> See
what notice God takes and what reckonings he keeps of all the good that he
doth to any Church or people; he files up all his Bleſſings: he is bountifull,
not profuſe; open-handed, but not ſo as that his largeſſe makes him reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
or forgetfull of his beneficences: he gives not, like the picture of <hi>Fortune,</hi>
blindfolded; or, like an Almoner in a throng, he knows not to whom; he notes
both the man and the favour. In our gifts, our <hi>left hand may not know what</hi> our
<hi>right hand doth;</hi> becauſe our weakneſſe is ſubject to a proud ſelf-conceit, and
a miſ-opinion of too much obligation in the Receiver: but he whoſe infinite
Goodneſſe is not liable to any danger of thoſe infirmities which follow our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
nature, ſets all his Mercies on the ſcore, and will not balk one of the leaſt.
He that could ſay to <hi>Iſrael, I took thee from among the Pots,</hi> and to <hi>David, I
took thee from following the Ewes great with Lamb:</hi> do ye not think he ſtill ſaies
to his Anointed, I brought you from weak in the Cradle, to ſtrong in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Throne; I kept you from treacherous hands; I return'd you ſafe from the
danger of your Southern Voiage; I have given you not the hands and knees,
but the hearts of your Subjects? Do I not think he ſaith to me, I brought
thee from the <hi>Ferula</hi> to a Paſtoral ſtaffe; to another, I brought thee from
the Bench of Juſtice to the ſeat of Honour; to another, I delivered thee from
the Sword of thine enemy, from the bed of thy Sickneſſe, from the walls of thy
reſtraint, from the Powder-mine; I made thee Noble, thee Rich, thee Potent;
I made this Country populous, that City wealthy, this Kingdome ſtrong? Be
ſure, if we be forgetfull, God will not miſreckon his own Mercies.</p>
            <p>Our favours are (like our ſelves) poor and impotent, worthy to be ſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
upon the ſand, that they may be waſh'd off with the next wave: his are full
of goodneſs and infinite compaſſion, fit for the Marble of an eternal remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
            <p>Honourable and beloved, why do not we keep one part of the Tally as
he keeps the other, that ſo we may hold even reckonings with our muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
God? How ſhould we meditate continually of the gracious and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Firſt, there is the advantage of the Place choſen: where hath he ſetled his
<hi>Vineyard</hi> but <hi>upon a very fruitfull Hill?</hi> A double advantage, an Hill, and very
fruitfull. Hills are held beſt for Vines, the declivity whereof gives much
ſtrength to the reflexion; ſo as the moſt generous Vines are noted to grow
upon the Hills. Yet there are barren hills; nothing but heaps of unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſands: this is a fruitfull hill, yea ſuperlatively fruitfull, <hi>the horn of the ſon
of oyle,</hi> as it is in the Original; that is, by an Hebraiſme, an hill eminently fat
and fertile.</p>
            <p>But what would it avail the ground to be fruitfull, if it be unfenced, that the
wilde Boar or the Foxes may ſpoil it? as good no fruit as to no purpoſe.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Loe then here, Secondly, both <hi>an Hedge,</hi> and, leſt that ſhould not be ſufficient,
<hi>a Wall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to what purpoſe ſhould it be fenced with ſtones without, if it be choked
with ſtones within? As therefore, Thirdly, <hi>the ſtones</hi> were laid together in the
Wall for defence; ſo they were <hi>gathered off</hi> from the ſoil to avoid offence.</p>
            <p>But to what purpoſe is the fruitfulneſſe, fencing, ſtoning, if the ground
yield a plentifull crop of Briers, Thiſtles, Weeds? <hi>Injuſſa vireſcunt gramina,</hi>
ill weeds grow faſt. Here is therefore, Fourthly, the main favour to this Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
that the owner hath <hi>planted it with choiceſt Vines.</hi> It is the praiſe of the
Earth, to foſter any Plant that is put into the boſome of it; it is the chief care

            <p>Now all this proviſion of ſoile, fencing, ſtoning, planting, were nothing

            <p>Laſtly, to what purpoſe were all this choice, fencing, ſtoning, planting,
overſight; if when the Grapes are grown to their due ripeneſſe, they ſhould
not be improved to any uſefull Vintage? This muſt be done by the <hi>Wine-preſs:</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> That is <hi>ſet up.</hi> And now what can remain, but the ſetting under of Veſſels
to receive the comfortable juice that ſhall flow from theſe ſo-well-husbanded
cluſters?</p>
            <p>All this hath God done for his Vineyard; what could have been done more?</p>
            <p>Not to dwell in the miſts of Allegories; God himſelf hath read this riddle.
<hi>The Vineyard of the Lord of Hoaſts is the houſe of Iſrael:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 7.</note> And the houſe of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> is his Church. The Church is God's Hill, conſpicuous for his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
favours (though not ever) even to the eye of the world; not an hidden
unheeded Valley. A fruitfull Hill, not by Nature, but by Grace. Nature was
like it ſelf in it, in the world: God hath taken it in from the barren Downs, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> gooded it; his choice did not finde, but make it thus.</p>
            <p>Thus choſen he hath fenced it about with the hedge of Diſcipline, with the
wall of his Almighty Protection.</p>
            <p>Thus fenced he hath ordained, by juſt Cenſures to pick out of it thoſe ſtones
of offence which might hinder their holy proceedings, and keep down the growth
of the Vines; whether ſcandalous Men, falſe Opinions, or evill Occurrences.</p>
            <p>Thus cleared, he hath planted it with the choiceſt Vines of gracious motions,
of wholſome Doctrines.</p>
            <p>Thus planted, he hath overlook'd it from the Watch-tower of Heaven, in a
carefull inſpection upon their waies, in a provident care of their preſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Thus overlooked, he hath endeavoured to improve it by his ſeaſonable
Wine-preſſe, in reducing all thoſe powers and favours to act, to uſe, whether
by Fatherly corrections, or by ſuggeſting meet opportunities of practice. And
now having thus choſen, fenced, cleared, planted, watched, and ordered to
ſtrain his Vines, he ſaies moſt juſtly, <hi>What could have been done more that I have
not done?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:44233:139"/>
Certainly it is not in the power of any humane apprehenſion to conceive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
what act could be added to perfect his culture, what Bleſſing could be added to
the indearing of a Church. If he have made choice of a people for his own;
if he have bleſſed them with good Government, with ſafe protection; if he
have removed all hinderances of their proficiencie; if he have given them
wholeſome inſtructions, and plied them with ſolicitations to good; if his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
eye have been ever over them for their deliverances; if, laſtly, he have
uſed both fair and foul means to wring from them the good juice of their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
Say men or Angels, what could have been done more? What Church
ſoever in the World can make good to it ſelf theſe ſpecialties of mercy, let it
know that God hath abated nothing to it of the height of his favour.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

Generally, whatever diſpoſition or act uncultured Nature doth or would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
of it ſelf, that is a wilde grape: Particularly, the Holy Ghoſt hath here
inſtanced in ſeveral ſins ſo ſtyled; a ſelf-greatning oppreſſion, verſ. 8. a ſetled

in their own waies, verſ. 21. Bribery in their Judges, v. 23. Pride

indeed, ſuch as corrupted Nature yields without a correction, without an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
ſhe her ſelf is wilde; ſhe can yield but what ſhe hath, what ſhe is. Pleaſe
your ſelves who liſt in the opinion of your fair and ſweet and plauſible diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
ye ſhall finde Nature at beſt but a wilde Vine. <hi>In me, that is, in my fleſh,
there dwelleth no good,</hi> faith the choſen Veſſel. Wilde grapes for the harſhneſſe
and ſowrneſſe of the taſt, for the odiouſneſſe of their verdure to the palate of the
Almighty. The beſt fruits of Nature are but glorious Sins, the worſt are hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Abominations. Such are the wilde grapes of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> which yet could not
have been ſo ill, if God had not been put into an exſpectation of better, and
if this exſpectation had not been croſſed with diſappointment: <hi>Wherefore, when
I looked that it ſhould bring forth Grapes, brought it forth wilde Grapes?</hi> Had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
onely Maples or Thorns or Willows grown there, God would not have look'd
for Grapes; had onely wilde Vines grown there, God would not have look'd
for pleaſing cluſters: but now that God furniſhed the ſoil with noble and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Plants, with what ſcorn and indignation doth he look upon wilde
Grapes? Favours beſtowed raiſe exſpectation, and exſpectation fruſtrated
doubles the Judgment. The very leaves and the high-way drew a curſe upon
the Fig-tree. <hi>Woe be to thee Chorazin, woe be to thee Bethſaida.</hi> Son of man,
what ſhall be done to the Vine of all trees? Woe be to thee, O Vineyard of

            </p>
            <p>My ſpeech ſhould now deſcend to the wofull vengeance that God threats
to and inflicts upon his <hi>Iſrael:</hi> A fit Theme for ſo heavy a day. The Hedge of
good Government and wholſome Laws ſhall be trodden down; the Wall of
Divine Protection ſhall be broken: the Beaſts of the field and foreſt ſhall be

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:44233:139"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> extirpate; to the full and final vaſtation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to the ſcorn and hiſſing of
all Nations, to the juſt terrour of the World; whiles that dearling people which
was once the example of God's Mercy, is now become the fearfull ſpectacle
of his Fury and Revenge, ſurviving only in ſome few abhorred and deſpiſed
Vagabonds, to ſhew that there was once ſuch a Nation. But the time and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
call my thoughts homeward, and invite me rather to ſpend the reſt of my
hour in paralleling <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Bleſſings, Sins, threats of Judgment with our own:
Wherein our Intereſt ſhall be a ſufficient motive of our attention. <hi>Gather you
together therefore, gather you, O Nation not worthy to be loved,</hi> and caſt back
your eyes upon thoſe incomparable favours wherewith God hath provoked
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and indeared this Iſland; in which I dare boldly ſay we are at the leaſt his
ſecond <hi>Iſrael.</hi> How hath he choſen us out of all the Earth, and divided us from
the reſt of the World, that we might be a ſingular pattern and ſtrange won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his Bounty? What ſhould I ſpeak of the wholſome temper of our Clime;
the rich proviſion of all uſefull Commodities? ſo as we cannot ſay only as
<hi>Sanchez</hi> did, <hi>I have moiſture enough within my own ſhell;</hi> but as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum
exuberans, My cup runs over,</hi> to the ſupply of our neighbour Nations.
What ſpeak I of the populouſneſſe of our Cities, defencedneſſe of our ſhoars?
Theſe are nothing to that Heavenly treaſure of the Goſpel which makes us the
Vineyard of God, and that ſweet Peace which gives us the happy fruition of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that ſaving Goſpel. <hi>Albion</hi> do we call it? nay (as he rightly) <hi>Polyolbion,</hi>
richly bleſſed. O God, what, where is the Nation that can emulate us in theſe
favours?</p>
            <p>How hath he fenced us about with the hedge of good Diſcipline, of whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Laws, of gracious Government; with the brazen wall of his Almighty
and miraculous protection? Never Land had more exquiſite Rules of Juſtice,
whether mute or ſpeaking. He hath not left us to the mercy of a rude Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,
or a Tyrannical violence, but hath regulated us by Laws of our own aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and ſwai'd us by the juſt Scepters of moderate Princes.</p>
            <p>Never Land had more convincing proofs of an Omnipotent Tuition whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> againſt forein Powers or ſecret Conſpiracies. Forget, if ye can, the year
of our Invaſion, the day of our <hi>Purim.</hi> Beſides the many particularities of our
deliverances filed up by the pen of one of our worthy Prelates.</p>
            <p>How hath he given us means to remove the rubs of our growth, and to
gather away the ſtones of falſe Doctrine, of Heretical pravitie, of miſchievous
machinations that might hold down his truth? And, which is the head of all,
how hath he brought our Vine out of the <hi>Egypt</hi> of Popiſh Superſtition, and
planted it? In plain terms, how hath he made us a truely-orthodox Church,
eminent for purity of Doctrine, for the grave and reverend ſolemnity of true
Sacraments, for the due form of Government, for the pious and Religious
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> form of our publick Liturgie? With what plenty hath he ſhowred upon us
the firſt and later rain of his Heavenly Goſpel? With what rare gifts hath
he graced our Teachers? With what pregnant ſpirits hath he furniſh'd our
Academies? With what competencie of maintenance hath he heartned all
learned Profeſſions? So as in theſe regards we may ſay of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Many Daughters have done vertuouſly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 31. 29.</note>

            </p>
            <p>How hath the vigilant eye of his Providence out of his tower of Heaven
watch'd over this Iſland for good? Not an helliſh Pionier could mine under
ground, but he eſpied him; not a dark Lantern could offer to deceive mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
but he deſcries it; not a Plot, not a purpoſe of evil could look out, but
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> he hath diſcovered it, and ſhamed the Agents, and glorified his Mercy in our
deliverance.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, how infinitely hath his loving care laboured to bring us to good?
What ſweet opportunities and incouragements hath he given us of a fruitfull
obedience? And when his Fatherly counſels would not work with us, how hath
he ſcruzed us in the Wine-preſſe of his Afflictions; one while with a raging
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:44233:140"/>
Peſtilence, another while with the inſolence and prevalence of Enemies; one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
while with unkindly Seaſons, another while with ſtormy and wracking Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts:
if by any means he might fetch from us the precious juice of true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
and faithfull Obedience, that we might turn and live? If the preſſe were
weighty, yet the wine is ſweet.</p>
            <p>Lay now all theſe together, <hi>And what could have been done more for</hi> our <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi>
O God, <hi>that thou haſt not done?</hi> Look about you, Honourable and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

never was any people ſo bound to a God. Other neighbouring Regions would
think themſelves happy in one drop of thoſe Bleſſings which have poured
down thick upon us. Alas! they are in a vaporous and mariſh vale, whiles we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
are ſeated on the fruitfull Hill: they lie open to the maſſacring knife of an
Enemy, whiles we are fenced: they are clogged with miſerable incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
whiles we are free: Briers and Brambles overſpread them, whiles we
are choicely planted: their Tower is of offence, their Winepreſſe is of blood.
Oh the lamentable condition of more likely Vineyards then our own! Who
can but weep and bleed to ſee thoſe wofull Calamities that are faln upon the
late-famous and flouriſhing Churches of Reformed Chriſtendome? Oh for that
<hi>Palatine</hi> Vine, late inoculated with a precious bud of our Royal Stem; that
Vine not long ſince rich in goodly cluſters, now the inſultation of Boars and

Sileſia, Moravia, Germany, Auſtria, the Valteline,</hi> that groan now under the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous

of our plentifull crop of Proſperity? How do they look up at us as
even now militantly-triumphant, whiles they are miſerably wallowing in duſt

drenched with ſtorm and tempeſt in the Valley?</p>
            <p>What are we, O God, what are we, that thou ſhouldſt be thus rich in thy

precedencie, as being commonly incident to none but the Great, (though a

racking of Rents, what detention of Wages, what incloſing of Commons,
what ingroſſing of Commodities, what griping Exactions, what ſtraining the

            <p>Drunkenneſſe is the next; not ſo odious in the weakneſſe of it, as in the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> this deluge of exceſſe in meats and drinks drowned the face of the Earth, and
riſen many cubits above the higheſt Mountains of Religion and good Laws?
Yea would God I might not ſay that which I fear and ſhame and grieve to ſay,
that even ſome of them which ſquare the Ark for others, have been inwardly
drowned, and diſcovered their nakedneſſe. That other inundation ſcoured the

            <p>Let no Popiſh Eaves-dropper now ſmile to think what advantage I give by

it as mortal: they palliate wickedneſſe with the fair pretence of Veniality.
Shortly, They accuſe us, we them, God both.</p>
            <p>But where am I? How eaſie is it for a man to loſe himſelf in the ſins of the

paſſe through them running. Where can a man caſt his eye not to ſee that

            <p>Here Bribery and Corruption in the ſeats of Judicature, there Perjuries at

            <p>Yet alas! were theſe the ſins of Ignorance, of Infirmity, they might be more

We draw iniquity with the ſtrings of vanity up to the head, up to the

and the ſhadow of death,</hi> as too many Pagan and Popiſh Regions do, theſe works
of darkneſſe would be leſſe intolerable: but now that the beams of the glorious
Goſpel have ſhined thus long, thus bright in our faces, Oh me, what can we
plead againſt our own confuſion? O Lord, where ſhall we appear, when thy
very Mercies aggravate our Sins and thy Judgments?</p>
            <p>How ſhouldſt thou expect fruit from a Vineyard ſo choſen, ſo husbanded?
and woe worth our wretchedneſſe that have thus repai'd thee. Be confounded
in thy ſelf, O my Soul, be confounded, to ſee theſe deplored retributions.
Are theſe grapes for a God? <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord, O fooliſh people and

            </epigraph>
            <p>HE that was once toſſed in the confluence of two Seas, <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 41.
was once no leſſe ſtreightned in his reſolutions betwixt life and
death, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. Neither doth my Text argue him in any other
caſe here. As there he knew not whether he ſhould chuſe, ſo here
he knew not whether he had. <hi>I am crucified,</hi> there he is dead; <hi>yet I live,</hi> there
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> he is alive again; <hi>yet not I,</hi> there he lives not; but <hi>Chriſt in me,</hi> there he more
then lives. This holy correction makes my Text full of wonders, full of ſacred
riddles. 1. The living God is dead upon the Croſſe, <hi>Chriſt crucified,</hi> 2. S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
who died by the ſword, dies on the Croſs. 3. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was not <hi>Paul</hi> till
after Chriſt's death, is yet crucified with Chriſt. 4. S. <hi>Paul</hi> thus crucified yet
lives. 5. S. <hi>Paul</hi> lives not himſelf whiles he lives. 6. Chriſt, who is crucified,
lives in <hi>Paul,</hi> who was crucified with him.</p>
            <p>See then here both a Lent and an Eaſter: A Lent of Mortification, <hi>I am cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
with Chriſt;</hi> an Eaſter of Reſurrection and life, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt
lives in me.</hi> The Lent of my Text will be ſufficient (as proper) for this ſeaſon;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> wherein my ſpeech ſhall paſſe through three long ſtages of diſcourſe: <hi>Chriſt
crucified,</hi> S. <hi>Paul crucified,</hi> S. <hi>Paul crucified with Chriſt.</hi> In all which your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and Chriſtian patience ſhall as much ſhorten my way, as my care
ſhall ſhorten the way to your patience.</p>
            <p>Chriſt's Croſs is the firſt leſſon of our infancy, worthy to be our laſt, and
all. The great Doctor of the Gentiles affected not to flie any higher pitch.
<hi>Grande crucis Sacramentum,</hi> as <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> This is the greateſt wonder that ever
earth or heaven yielded.<note place="margin">1. Tim.3.16.</note> God incarnate was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but God ſuffering
and dying was ſo much more, as Death is more penal then Birth. The God-head
of man and the blood of God are two ſuch Miracles, as the Angels of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Heaven can never enough look into, never admire enough.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ruffin</hi> tells us, that among the Sacred Characters of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> the Croſs
was antiently one, which was ſaid to ſignifie eternal life; hence their Learneder
ſort were converted to and confirmed in the Faith. Surely we know that in
God's Hieroglyphicks Eternal Life is both repreſented and exhibited to us by
the Croſſe. That the Croſſe of Chriſt was made of the Tree of Life, a ſlip
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:44233:142"/>
whereof the Angels gave to <hi>Adam's</hi> ſon out of Paradiſe, is but a Jewiſh Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <hi>Galatine</hi> may believe it, not we: but that it is made the Tree of Life to all
believers, we are ſure. This is the only ſcale of Heaven; never man aſcended
thither but by it. By this Chriſt himſelf climb'd up to his own glory. <hi>Dominus
regnavit à ligno,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> tranſlates that of the Pſalm. <hi>Father, glorifie thy
name;</hi> that is, ſaith he, <hi>Duc me ad crucem, Lift me up to the tree,</hi> not of my
ſhame, but of my triumph. <hi>Behold, we preach Chriſt crucified</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul)
to the Jews a ſtumbling-block, to the Greeks fooliſhneſſe; but to them which are
called, Chriſt the power of God, and the wiſdome of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 23. Fooliſh
men! that ſtumble at power, and deride wiſdome. Upbraid us now, ye fond
Jews and Pagans, with a Crucified Saviour: It is our glory, it is our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
which ye make our reproach. Had not our Saviour died, he could have
been no Saviour for us; had not our Saviour died, we could not have lived.
See now the flag of our dear Redeemer, this Croſs, ſhining eminently <hi>in loco
pudoris,</hi> in our foreheads; and if we had any place more high, more conſpicuous,
more honourable, there we would advance it. O bleſſed <hi>Jeſu, when</hi> thou art
thus <hi>lifted up on thy Croſs,</hi> thou <hi>draweſt all</hi> hearts <hi>unto thee:</hi> there thou <hi>leadeſt
captivity captive, and giveſt gifts unto men.</hi> Ye are deceived, O ye blinde Jews
and Painims, ye are deceived; it is not a Gibbet, it is a Throne of Honour to
which our Saviour is raiſed; a Throne of ſuch Honour, as to which Heaven
and earth and hell do, and muſt vail. The Sun hides his awfull head, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
earth trembles, the rocks rend, the graves open, and all the frame of Nature
doth homage to their Lord in this ſecret, but Divine, pomp of Crucifixion.
And whiles ye think his feet and hands deſpicably fixed, behold he is power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
trampling upon Hell and Death, and ſetting up trophees of his moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Victory, and ſcattering everlaſting Crowns and Scepters unto all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
O Saviour, I do rather more adore thee on the <hi>Calvary</hi> of thy Paſſion,
then on the <hi>Tabor</hi> of thy Transſiguration, or the <hi>Olivet</hi> of thine Aſcenſion:
and cannot ſo effectuouſly bleſſe thee for <hi>Pater, clarifica, Father, glorifie me,</hi> as
for, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> ſith it is no news for God to
be great and glorious; but for the Eternal and ever-living God to be abaſed,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
to be abaſed unto death, to the death of the Croſs, is that which could not but
amaze the Angels and confound Devils; and ſo much more magnifies thine
infinite Mercy, by how much an infinite perſon would become more ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious.
All <hi>Hoſannas</hi> of men, all <hi>Allellujahs</hi> of Saints and Angels come ſhort of
this Majeſtick humiliation. <hi>Bleſsing, honour, glory and power be unto him that
ſits upon the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever,</hi> Revel. 5. 13. And ye
(Honourable and beloved) as ever ye hope to make muſick in Heaven, learn to
tune your harps to the note and ditty of theſe Heavenly Elders. Rejoice in
this, and rejoice in nothing but this Croſs: not in your tranſitory Honours,
Titles, Treaſures, which will at the laſt leave you inconſolately ſorrowfull; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
but in this Croſs of Chriſt, whereby <hi>the world is crucified to you, and you to the
world.</hi> Oh clip and embrace this pretious Croſs with both your arms, and ſay
with that bleſſed Martyr, <hi>Amor meus crucifixus eſt, My Love is crucified.</hi> Thoſe
that have ſearched into the monuments of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> write that our Saviour
was crucified with his face to the Weſt: which howſoever ſpightfully meant
of the Jews, (as not allowing him worthy to look on the Holy City and
Temple) yet was not without a myſterie. <hi>Oculi ejus ſuper Gentes reſpiciunt, His
eyes look to the Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith the Pſalmiſt. As Chriſt therefore on his
Croſs looked towards us ſinners of the Gentiles; ſo let us look up to him.
Let our eyes be lift up to this Brazen Serpent, for the cure of the deadly ſtings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
of that old Serpent. See him, O all ye beholders, ſee him hanging upon the
Tree of ſhame, of curſe, to reſcue you from curſe and confuſion, and to feo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e
you in everlaſting Bleſſedneſſe: See him ſtretching out his arms to receive and
embrace you, hanging down his head to take view of your miſery, opening his
precious ſide to receive you into his boſome, opening his very heart to take
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:44233:142"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> you in thither, pouring out thence water to waſh you, and blood to redeem
you. O all ye <hi>Nazarites</hi> that paſſe by, out of this dead Lion ſeek and finde the
true honey of unſpeakable and endleſſe comfort.</p>
            <p>And ye great Maſters of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whoſe <hi>lips</hi> profeſſe to <hi>preſerve knowledge,</hi>
leave all curious and needleſie diſquiſitions, and with that Divine and extatical
Doctor of the Gentiles, <hi>care only to know,</hi> to preach, <hi>Chriſt and him crucified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this, though the ſum of the Goſpel, is not the main drift of my Text:
I may not dwell in it, though I am loth to part with ſo ſweet a meditation.
From Chriſt crucified turn your eyes to <hi>Paul</hi> crucified: you have read him
dying by the Sword; hear him dying by the Croſs, and ſee his moral, ſpiritual,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> living Crucifixion.</p>
            <p>Our Apoſtle is two men, <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi> the old man and the new: in reſpect
of the Old man he is crucified, and dead to the law of ſin, ſo as that ſin is dead
in him; neither is it otherwiſe with every regenerate. Sin hath a body, as well
as the man hath; <hi>Who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> Rom. 7. 24. a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that hath lims and parts; <hi>Mortifie your earthly members,</hi> ſaith our Apoſtle,
<hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3. 5. Not the lims of our humane body, which are made of earth, (ſo
ſhould we be <hi>hoſles naturae, as Bernard</hi>) but the ſinfull lims that are made of
corruption, <hi>Fornication, uncleanneſs, inordinate affection,</hi> &amp;c. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of ſin

               </gap>,

               </gap>
apprehenſions; the forehead of ſin, impudent profeſſion of evil; the back of
ſin, a ſtrong ſupportation and maintenance of evil: all this body of ſin is not
only put to death, but to ſhame too, ſo as it is dead with diſgrace, <hi>I am crucified.
S. Paul</hi> ſpeaks not this ſingularly of himſelf, but in the perſon of the Renewed:
ſin doth not, cannot live a vital and vigorous life in the Regenerate. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
then (ſay you) was the Apoſtles complaint, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Wretched
man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> Mark, I beſeech
you; it was the body of ſin, not the life of ſin; a body of death, not the life of
that body: or if this body had yet ſome life, it was ſuch a life as is left in the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> lims when the head is ſtruck off; ſome dying quiverings, rather as the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of a life that was, then any act of a life that is; or if a further life, ſuch a
one as in ſwowns and fits of Epilepſie, which yields breath, but not ſenſe; or if
ſome kinde of ſenſe, yet no motion; or if it have ſome kinde of motion in us,
yet no manner of dominion over us. What power, motion, ſenſe, relicks of life
are in a fully-crucified man? Such a one may waft up and down with the winde,
but cannot move out of any internal principle.</p>
            <p>Sin and Grace cannot more ſtand together in their ſtrength, then life and
death. In remiſſe degrees all contraries may be lodged together under one
roof. S.<hi>Paul</hi> ſwears that he <hi>dies daily,</hi> yet he lives: ſo the beſt man ſins hourly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> even whiles he obeys; but the powerfull and over-ruling ſway of ſin is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible
with the truth of Regeneration. Every <hi>Eſau</hi> would be carrying away a
Bleſſing: no man is willing to ſit out. Ye ſhall have ſtrong drinkers, as <hi>Eſay</hi>
calls them, <hi>Eſay</hi> 5. 22. neighing ſtallions of luſt, as <hi>Jeremy</hi> calls them,<hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 8.
mighty hunters in oppreſſion, as <hi>Nimrod, Gen.</hi> 10. 9. rotten talkers, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 29.
which yet will be challenging as deep a ſhare in Grace as the conſcionableſt.
Alas! how many millions do miſerably delude themſelves with a mere pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Chriſtianity? <hi>Aliter vivunt, aliter loquuntur,</hi> as he ſaid of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers.
Vain Hypocrites! they muſt know that every Chriſtian is a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
man. How are they dead to their fins, that walk in their ſins? how are
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> their ſins dead in them, in whom they ſtir, reign, flouriſh? Who doth not
ſmile to hear of a dead man that walks? Who derides not the ſoleciſm of
that Actor, which expreſt himſelf fully dead by ſaying ſo? What a mockery is
this? eyes full of luſt, itching ears, ſcurrilous tongues, bloody hands, hearts
full of wickedneſs, and yet dead? Deceive not your Souls, dear Chriſtians, if
ye love them. This falſe death is the way to the true, eternal, incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly-wofull
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:44233:143"/>
death of body and Soul. If ye will needs doe ſo, walk on, ye falſly-dead,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
in the waies of your old ſins: be ſure theſe paths ſhall lead you down to
the chambers of everlaſting death. If this be the hanging up of your corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
fear to hang in hell. Away with this hateful ſimulation; <hi>God is not
mocked:</hi> Ye muſt either kill, or die. Kill your ſins, or elſe they will be ſure to
kill your Souls: apprehend, arraign, condemn them, faſten them to the tree
of ſhame, and, if they be not dead already, break their legs and arms, diſable
them to all offenſive actions as was done to the Thieves in the Goſpel; ſo
ſhall you ſay with our Bleſſed Apoſtle, <hi>I am crucified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is it thus onely in matter of notorious crime and groſſe wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
but thus it muſt be in the univerſal carriage of our lives, and the whole <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
habitual frame of our diſpoſitions: in both theſe we are, we muſt be crucified.
Be not deceived, my Brethren, it is a ſad and auſtere thing to be a Chriſtian.
This work is not frolick, jovial, plauſible: there is a certain thing call'd true
Mortification required to this buſineſſe; and whoever heard but there was
pain in death? but among all deaths in crucifying? What a torture muſt there
needs be in this act of violence? what a diſtention of the body, (whoſe weight
is rack enough to it ſelf?) what ſtraining of the joynts? what nailing of hands
and feet? Never make account to be Chriſtians without the hard tasks of
Penitence. It will coſt you tears, ſighs, watchings, ſelf-reſtraints, ſelf-ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
ſelf-denials. This word is not more harſh then true. Ye delicate Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
what do you talk of Chriſtian profeſſion, when ye will not abate a diſh
from your belly, nor ſpare an hours ſleep from your eyes, nor caſt off an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
rag from your backs for your God? In vain ſhall the vaſſals of appetite
challenge to be the ſervants of God. Were it that the Kingdome of God did
conſiſt in eating and drinking, in pampering and ſurfeits, in chambering and
wantonneſſe, in pranking and vanity, in talk and oſtentation; O God, how rich
ſhouldſt thou be of ſubjects, of Saints? But if it require abſtinence, humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
contrition of heart, ſubjugation of our fleſh, renunciation of our wills, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
impoſitions of labourſome devotions; O Lord, what is become of true
Chriſtianity? where ſhall we ſeek for a crucified man? Look to our Tables,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
there ye ſhall finde exceſſe and riot; look to our Backs, there ye ſhall finde
proud diſguiſes; look to our Converſations, there ye ſhall finde ſcurril and
obſcene jollity. This liberty, yea this licentiouſneſſe, is that which opens the
mouths of our adverſaries to the cenſure of our reall impiety. That ſlander

to <hi>intemperance,</hi> the very ſame do they caſt upon us. They tell us of their
ſtrict Lents, frequent Faſtings, Canonical hours, ſharp Penances, their baſhfull
ſhriſts, their painfull ſcourgings, their ſolitary Cells, their woolward and
barefoot walks, their hard and tedious pilgrimages; whiles we (they ſay) deny
nothing to back or belly, fare full, lie ſoft, ſit warm, and make a wanton of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
fleſh, whiles we profeſſe to tend the ſpirit. Brethren, hear a little the words of
exhortation: The brags of their penal will-worſhip ſhall no whit move us:
All this is blown away with a <hi>Quis requiſivit? Baal</hi>'s Prieſts did more then
they, yet were never the holier. But for our ſelves, in the fear of God ſee that
we do not juſtifie their crimination. Whiles they are in one extreme, placing
all Religion in the out-ſide, in <hi>Touch not, taſte not, handle not:</hi> let us not be in
the other, not regarding the external acts of due Humiliation. It is true that
it is more eaſe to afflict the body then to humble the Soul; a dram of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe
is more then an ounce of pain. O God, if whippings and hair-cloaths
and watchings would ſatisfie thy diſpleaſure, who would not ſacrifice the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
blood of this vaſſall (his Body) to expiate the ſin of his Soul? who would
not ſcrub his skin to eaſe his Conſcience? who would not freez upon an
hurdle that he might not frie in hell? who would not hold his eyes open
to avoid an eternall unreſt and torment? But ſuch ſacrifices and oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
O God, thou deſireſt not. <hi>The ſacrifice of God is a broken ſpirit; a
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:44233:143"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe.</hi> Yet it is as true,
that it is more eaſie to counterfeit mortification of ſpirit then humiliation of
body; there is pain in the one, none in the other. He that cares not therefore
to pull down his body, will much leſſe care to humble his Soul; and he that
ſpares not to act meet and due penalties upon the Fleſh, gives more colour of
the Souls humiliation. Dear Chriſtians, it is not for us to ſtand upon nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly
terms with our Maker: he will have both; he that made both, will
have us crucified in both. The old man doth not lie in a lim or faculty; but
is diffuſed through the whole extent of Body and Soul, and muſt be crucified
in all that it is. <gap reason="foreign">

faſhion. The Court and City have led the way to exceſſe; your example ſhall
preſcribe, yea adminiſter, the remedy. The Heathen man could ſay, <hi>He is not

alwaies? <hi>In faſting often,</hi> ſaith S.<hi>Paul:</hi> what and we never? <hi>I faſt twice a week,</hi>
ſaith the Phariſee: and we Chriſtians when? I ſpeak not of Popiſh mock-faſts,
in change, not in forbearance; in change of courſer cates of the land for the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
dainties of the water, of the fleſh of beaſts for the fleſh of fiſh, of untooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
morſels for <hi>ſorbitiunculoe delicatoe,</hi> as <hi>Hierome</hi> calls them. Let me never
feaſt, if this be faſting. I ſpeak of a true and ſerious maceration of our bodies,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> by an abſolute and totall refraining from ſuſtenance: which howſoever in it
ſelf it be not an act pleaſing unto God, (for well may I invert Saint <hi>Paul,
neither if we eat not are we the better, neither if we eat are we the worſe,</hi> 1 Cor.
8. 8.) yet in the effect it is; <hi>ſingulare Sanctitatis aratrum,</hi> as that Father
terms it. The plow bears no Corn, but it makes way for it; it opens the
ſoil, it tears up the briers, and turns up the furrows: Thus doth holy Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence,
it chaſtiſes the fleſh, it lightens the ſpirit, it diſheartens our vitious
diſpoſitions, it quickens our Devotion. Away with all factious Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Every man is maſter of his own maw: Faſt at home and ſpare not; leave
publick exerciſes of this kinde to the command of Soveraign powers. <hi>Blow
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the trumpet in Zion, ſanctifie a Faſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Joel,</hi> 2. 15. Surely this trumpet is for
none but Royal breath. And now (that what I meant for a ſuit, may be turned
to a juſt gratulation) how do we bleſſe the God of Heaven, that hath put it
into the heart of his Anointed to ſet this ſacred Trumpet to his lips? Never
was it, never can it be more ſeaſonable then now: now that we are fallen into
a war of Religion, now that our friends and Allies grone either under miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:44233:144"/>
or danger, now that our diſtreſſed neighbours implore our help in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
tears and blood, now that our God hath humbled us with manifold loſſes,
now that we are threatned with ſo potent enemies, now that all Chriſtendome
is embroiled with ſo miſerable and perilous diſtempers; oh now it hath ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
pleaſed your Majeſty to <hi>blow the Trumpet in Zion,</hi> to <hi>ſanctifie a Faſt,</hi>
to <hi>call a ſolemn Aſſembly.</hi> The miraculous ſucceſſe that God gave to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
and your Kingdome in this holy exerciſe, may well incourage an happy
iteration. How did the publick breath of our Faſting-prayers cleanſe the aire
before them? How did that noiſome Peſtilence vaniſh ſuddenly away, as that
which could not ſtand before our powerfull Humiliations? If we be not
ſtreightned in our own bowels,<note place="margin">Jer. 6. 26.</note> the hand of our God is not ſhortned. <hi>O Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
of Zion, gird thee with ſackcloth, and wallow thy ſelf in aſhes, make thee mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and moſt bitter lamentation.</hi> Faſt and pray, and proſper. And in the mean
time, for us, let us not think it enough to forbear a meal, or to hang down our
heads like a bulruſh for a day; but let us break the bands of wickedneſs, and
in a true contrition of Soul vow and perform better Obedience. Oh then, as we
care to avert the heavy Judgments of God from our ſelves and our Land, as we
deſire to traduce the Goſpel with peace to our poſterity, let each man humble
one; let each man rend his heart with ſorrow for his own ſins and the ſins of
his people: ſhortly, let every man ranſack his own Soul and life, and offer an
holy violence to all thoſe ſinfull corruptions which have ſtirred up the God of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Heaven againſt us; and never leave, till in truth of heart he can ſay with our
bleſſed Apoſtle, <hi>I am crucified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ye have ſeen <hi>Chriſt crucified,</hi> S. <hi>Paul crucified;</hi> ſee now both crucified toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>I am crucified with Chriſt.</hi> It is but a cold word this, <hi>I am crucified;</hi> it is
the company that quickens it. He that is <hi>the Life,</hi> gives it life, and makes both
the word and act glorious; <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alas! there is many a one crucified, but not with Chriſt. The Covetous,
the Ambitious man is ſelf-crucified; he plaits a crown of thorny cares for his
own head; he pierces his hands and feet with toilſome and painfull underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings;
he drencheth himſelf with the vineger and gall of diſcontentments; he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
gores his ſide and wounds his heart with inward vexations. Thus the man is
crucified; but with the world, not with <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Envious man is crucified by his own thoughts; he needs no other gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
then another man's proſperity; becauſe anothers perſon or counſel is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to his, he leaps to hell in his own halter. This man is crucified; but it is
<hi>Achitophel's</hi> Croſſe, not <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>The Deſperate man is crucified with his own diſtruſt; he pierceth his own
heart with a deep, irremediable, unmitigable, killing ſorrow; he paies his
wrong to God's Juſtice with a greater wrong to his Mercy, and leaps out of
an inward Hell of remorſe to the bottomleſſe pit of damnation. This man is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
crucified; but this is <hi>Judas</hi>'s Croſſe, not <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>The Superſtitious man is profeſſedly mortifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d. The anſwer of that Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite
in the ſtory is famous, <hi>Why doſt thou deſtroy thy body? Becauſe it would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
me.</hi> He uſeth his body therefore not as a ſervant, but a ſlave, not as a
ſlave, but an enemy. He lies upon thorns, with the Phariſee; little eaſe is his
lodging, with <hi>Simeon</hi> the <hi>Anachoret;</hi> the ſtone is his pillow, with <hi>Jacob;</hi> the
tears his food, with exiled <hi>David;</hi> he lanceth his fleſh, with the <hi>Baalites;</hi> he
digs his grave with his nails; his meals are hunger, his breathings ſighs, his
linen hair-cloath, lined and laced with cords and wires; laſtly, he is his own
willing tormentor, and hopes to merit Heaven by ſelf-murder. This man is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
crucified, but not with <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Felon, the Traitor is juſtly crucified, the vengeance of the Law will
not let him live. The <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> Incendiary, that cares only to warm himſelf
by the fires of States and Kingdomes, cries out of his ſuffering. The world is
too little for the noiſe of our Cruelty, their Patience; whiles it judgeth of our
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:44233:144"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> proceedings by our Laws, not by our executions. But if they did ſuffer what

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lſly pretend, (as they now complain of eaſe) they might be crucified, but
not with Chriſt; they ſhould bleed for Sedition, not Conſcience: They may ſteal
the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> they ſhall not have his Society. This is not Chriſts Croſs,
it is the croſs of <hi>Barabbas,</hi> or the two malefactors, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Mark</hi> 15. 7.</p>
            <p>All theſe and many more are crucified, but not, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> was here, <hi>with
Chriſt.</hi> How <hi>with Chriſt?</hi> In partnerſhip, in perſon. In Partnerſhip of the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
every particularity of Chriſts Crucifixion is re-acted in us. Chriſt is the
model, we the metal; the metal takes ſuch form as the model gives it: ſo are
we ſpred upon the Croſs of Chriſt in an unanſwerable extenſion of all parts,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to die with him, as the Prophet was upon the dead child, to revive him. Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
men talk of the impreſſion of our Saviours wounds in their Idol
S. <hi>Francis:</hi> This is no news; S. <hi>Paul</hi> and every believing Chriſtian hath both the
lathes and wounds and transfixions of his <hi>Jeſus</hi> wrought upon him. The Crown
of thorns pierces his head, when his ſinful conceits are mortified; his lips are
drencht with gall and vineger, when tharp and ſevere reſtraints are given to his
tongue; his hands and feet are nailed, when he is by the power of God's Spirit
diſabled to the wonted courſes of ſin; his body is ſtripped, when all colour and
pretences are taken away from him; ſhortly, his heart is pierced, when the life-blood
of his formerly-reigning corruptions is let out. He is no true Chriſtian
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that is not thus crucified with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Woe is me, how many faſhionable ones are not ſo much as pained with their
ſins? It is no trouble to them to blaſpheme, oppreſs, debauch: yea rather
it is a death to them to think of parting with their dear Corruptions: the
world hath bewitched their love. That which <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſaith of <hi>Paris,</hi> that after
a man hath acquainted himſelf with the odious ſent of it (<hi>hoſpitibus magìs ac
magìs adlubeſcit</hi>) it grows into his liking more and more; is too true of the
world and ſenſual minds. Alas! they rather crucifie Chriſt again, then are
crucified with Chriſt. Woe to them that ever they were: for being not dead
<hi>with Chriſt,</hi> they are not dead <hi>in Chriſt;</hi> and being not dead in Chriſt, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but die eternally in themſelves; <hi>for the wages of ſin is death;</hi> death in their
perſon, if not in their ſurety. Honourable and beloved, let us not think it ſafe for
us to reſt in this miſerable and deadly condition. As ye love your Souls, give
no ſleep to your eyes nor peace to your hearts, till ye find the ſenſible effects of
the Death and Paſſion of Chriſt your Saviour within you, mortifying all your
corrupt affections and ſinful actions, that ye may truly ſay with S. <hi>Paul, I am
crucified with Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Six ſeveral times do we find that Chriſt ſhed blood; in his Circumciſion,
in his Agonie, in his Crowning, in his Scourging, in his Affixion, in his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion.
The inſtrument of the firſt was the Knife; of the ſecond, vehemence of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Paſſion; of the third, the Thorns; of the fourth, the Whips; of the fifth,
the Nails; of the laſt, the Spear. In all theſe we are, we muſt be Partners with
our Saviour.</p>
            <p>In his Circumciſion, when we draw blood of our ſelves by cutting off the
foreskin of our filthy (if pleaſing) Corruptions, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11. In his Agony, when
we are deeply affected with the ſenſe of God's diſpleaſure for ſin, and terrified
with the frowns of an angry Father. In his Crowning with thorns, when we
ſmart and bleed with reproches for the name of Chriſt; when that which the
world counts Honour, is a pain to us for his ſake; when our guilty thoughts pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
us, and wound our reſtleſs heads with the ſad remembrance of our ſins. In
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> his Scourging, when we tame our wanton and rebellious fleſh with wiſe rigor
and holy ſeverity. In his Affixion, when all the powers of our Souls and parts
of our body are ſtrictly hampered and unremovably faſtened upon the Royal
Commandements of our Maker and Redeemer. In his Transfixion, when our
hearts are wounded with Divine love (with the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi>) or our
Conſciences with deep ſorrow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:44233:145"/>
In all theſe we bleed with Chriſt, and all theſe (ſave the firſt onely) belong to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
his Crucifying. Surely, as it was in the Old Law, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>without blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
there</hi> was <hi>no remiſsion,</hi> Heb. 9. 22. ſo it is ſtill and ever in the New. If
Chriſt had not thus bled for us, no remiſſion; if we do not thus bleed with
Chriſt, no remiſſion.</p>
            <p>There is no benefit where is no partnerſhip. If Chriſt therefore bled with
his Agony, with his Thorns, with his Whips, with his Nails, with his Spear, in
ſo many thouſand paſſages as Tradition is bold to define; and we never bleed,
either with the Agony of our ſorrow for ſin, or the Thorns of holy cares for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
or the Scourges of ſevere Chriſtian rigour, or the Nails of holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
or the Spear of deep remorſe; how do we, how can we for ſhame ſay,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
we are <hi>crucified with Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Divine S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epiſt. 120. ad Honoratum.</note> in his Epiſtle or Book rather to <hi>Honoratus,</hi> gives us all the
dimenſions of the Croſs of Chriſt. The Latitude he makes in the tranſverſe;
this (ſaith he) pertains to good Works, becauſe on this his hands were ſtretched.
The Length was from the ground to the tranſverſe; this is attributed to his
longanimity and perſiſtance, for on that his Body was ſtayed and fixed. The
Height was in the head of the Croſs above the tranſverſe; ſignifying the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectation
of ſupernal things. The Depth of it was in that part which was
pitcht below within the earth; importing the profoundneſs of his free Grace,
which is the ground of all his beneficence.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            </p>
            <p>In all theſe muſt we have our part with Chriſt. In the Tranſverſe of his
Croſs, by the ready extenſion of our hands to all good Works of Piety, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
Charity: in the Arrectary or beam of his Croſs, by continuance and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted
perſeverance in good: in the Head of his Croſs, by an high ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
hope, and looking for of Glory: in the Foot of his Croſs, by a lively and
firm Faith, faſtening our Souls upon the affiance of his free Grace and Mercy.
And thus ſhall we be crucified with Chriſt upon his own Croſs.</p>
            <p>Yet laſtly we muſt goe further then this, from his Croſs to his Perſon. So
did S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and every Believer, die with Chriſt, that he died in Chriſt: For as
in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> we all lived, and ſinned; ſo in the ſecond all Believers died,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
that they might live.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> brought in death to all mankind, but at laſt actually died for
none but himſelf; the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> died for mankind, and brought life to all
Believers. Seeſt thou thy Saviour therefore hanging upon the Croſs? all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
hangs there with him; as a Knight or Burgeſs of Parliament voices his
whole Burrough or Country. What ſpeak I of this? The arms and legs take
the ſame lot with the head: Every Believer is a lim of that body; how can he
therefore but die with him, and in him? That real union then which is betwixt
Chriſt and us, makes the Croſs and Paſſion of Chriſt ours; ſo as the thorns
pierced our heads, the ſcourages blooded our backs, the nails wounded our hands <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
and feet, and the ſpear gored our ſides and hearts: by virtue whereof we receive
juſtification from our ſins, and true mortification of our corruptions. Every
Believer therefore is dead already for his ſins in his Saviour; he needs not fear
that he ſhall die again. God is too juſt to puniſh twice for one fault; to recover
the ſumme both of the ſurety &amp; principal. All the ſcore of our arrerages is fully
ſtruck off by the infinite ſatisfaction of our Bleſſed Redeemer. Comfort thy ſelf
therefore, thou penitent and faithful Soul, in the confidence of thy ſafety; thou
ſhalt not die, but live, ſince thou art already crucified with thy Saviour; he died
for thee, thou diedſt in him. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It
is God that juſtifies? Who ſhall condemn? It is Chriſt that died; yea rather that is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
again, and lives gloriouſly at the right hand of God, making interceſsion for us.</hi>
To thee, O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> together with thy Coeternal Father and Holy Spirit,
three Perſons in one infinite and incomprehenſible Deity, be all Praiſe, Honour
and Glory now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Preached to the
LORDS
OF THE
High Court of Parliament,
In their ſolemn Faſt held on Aſhwedneſday, <date>Feb. 18.</date> And, by their Appointment, publiſhed, by the
B. of EXCESTER.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Acts 2. 37, 38, 40.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>37. Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their hearts, and
ſaid to Peter and the reſt of the Apoſtles, Men and brethren, what
ſhall we doe?</p>
                  <p>38. Then ſaid Peter unto them, Repent and be baptized, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>40. And with many other words did he teſtifie, and exhort them, ſaying,
Save your ſelves from this untoward generation.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WHO knows not that <hi>Simon Peter</hi> was a Fiſher? That was his trade
both by Sea and Land: if we may not rather ſay, that as <hi>Simon</hi> he
was a Fiſher-man, but as <hi>Peter</hi> he was a Fiſher of men: he that call'd
him ſo, made him ſo. And ſurely his firſt draught of Fiſhes which,
as <hi>Simon,</hi> he made at our Saviours Command, might well be a trade Type
of the firſt draught of men which, as <hi>Peter,</hi> he made in this place: for as
then the nets were ready to crack, and the ſhip to ſink with ſtore; ſo here,
when he threw forth his firſt drag-net of Heavenly Doctrine and reproof,
three thouſand Souls were drawn up at once. This Text was as the ſacred
Cord that drew the Net together, and pull'd up this wondrous ſhoal of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
to God. It is the ſumme of Saint <hi>Peter's</hi> Sermon, if not at a Faſt, yet at a
general Humiliation, which is more and better; for wherefore faſt we but to
be humbled? and if we could be duely humbled without faſting, it would
pleaſe God a thouſand times better then to faſt formally without true Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.
Indeed for the time, this was a Feaſt, the Feaſt of Pentecoſt; but for
the eſtate of theſe Jews it was <hi>dies cinerum,</hi> a day of contrition, a day of deep
hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs; <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we doe?</hi>
Neither doubt I to ſay that the Feſtivity of the ſeaſon added not a little to
their Humiliation: like as we are never ſo apt to take cold as upon a ſweat;
and that winde is ever the keeneſt, which blows cold out of a warm coaſt.

No day could be more afflictive then an Aſhwedneſday that ſhould light upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
a ſolemn Pentecoſt: ſo it was here; every thing anſwered well. The Spirit

               </gap> in the deſcent; and behold here the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Soul were moved: Fiery tongues appeared; and here their breaſts
were inflamed: Cloven tongues; and here their hearts were cut in ſunder. The
words were miraculous, becauſe in a ſupernatural and ſudden variety of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
the matter Divine, laying before them both the truth of the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi>
and their bloody meaſure offered to that Lord of Life: and now <hi>Compuncti cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus,
they were pricked in their hearts.</hi> Wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>The words of the wiſe
are like goads and nails:</hi> here they were ſo. Goads, for they were <hi>compuncti</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               <hi>pricked:</hi> yea, but the goad could not goe ſo deep, that paſſeth but the skin;
they were Nails, driven into the very heart of the Auditors, up to the head;
the great Maſter of the Aſſembly, the divine Apoſtle had ſet them home, <hi>they
were pricked in their hearts.</hi> Never were words better beſtowed. It is an happy
blood-letting that ſaves the life; this did ſo here. We look to the figne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

S. <hi>Peter</hi> here ſaw the ſigne to be in the Heart, and he ſtrikes happily; <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puncti

            <p>Oh what ſweet Muſick was this to the Apoſtles ear? I dare ſay none but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Heaven could afford better. What a pleaſing ſpectacle was this anguiſh of their
wounded Souls? To ſee men come in their zealous Devotions, and lay down
their moneys (the price of their alienated poſſeſſions) at thoſe Apoſtolick feet,
was nothing to this, that they came in a bleeding contrition, and proſtrated
their penitent and humbled Souls at the beautiful feet of the Meſſengers of
Peace, with <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we doe?</hi> Oh when, when ſhall our
eyes be bleſſed with ſo happy a proſpect? How long ſhall we thunder out
God's fearful judgements againſt wilful ſinners? How long ſhall we threaten
the flames of Hell to thoſe impious wretches, who <hi>crucifie again to themſelves
the Lord of life,</hi> ere we can wring a ſigh or a tear from the rocks of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
hearts or eyes? Woe is me that we may ſay too truely, as this <hi>Peter</hi> did of his
other fiſhing, <hi>Maſter, we have travailed all the night, and have caught nothing.</hi>
Surely it may well goe for night with us, whiles we labour and prevail not.
Nothing? not a Soul caught? Lord, what is become of the ſucceſs of thy
Goſpel? <hi>Who hath believed our report, or to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</hi>
O God, thou art ever thy ſelf, thy Truth is eternal, Hell is where it was; if we
be leſs worthy then thy firſt Meſſengers, yet what excuſe is this to the beſotted
world, that through obduredneſs and infidelity it will needs periſh? No man
will ſo much as ſay with the Jews, What have I done? or with Saint <hi>Peter's</hi>
Auditors, What ſhall I doe? Oh fooliſh ſinners! ſhall ye live here always? care <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
ye not for your Souls? is there not an Hell that gapes for your ſtubborn im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence?
Goe on, if there be no remedy, goe on, and die for ever: we are guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
God is righteous, your Damnation is juſt. But if your life be fickle, death
unavoidable, if an everlaſting vengeance be the neceſſary reward of your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany
wickedneſs; Oh turn, turn from your evil waies, and in an holy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
of your remorſed Souls ſay, with theſe Jews, <hi>Men and Brethren, what
ſhall we doe?</hi> This from the general view of the occaſion; we deſcend to a little
more particularity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luke,</hi> the beloved Phyſician, deſcribes Saint <hi>Peter's</hi> proceeding here much
after his own trade, as of a true ſpiritual Phyſician; who finding his Country men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
the Jews in a deſperate and deadly condition, gaſping for life, ſtruggling
with death, enters into a ſpeedy and zealous courſe of their cure. And firſt he
begins with the Chirurgical part; and finding them ranck of blood, and
that foul and putrified, he lets it out, <hi>compuncti cordibus.</hi> Where we might
ſhew you the inciſion, the vein, the lancet, the orifice, the anguiſh of the ſtroke.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:44233:146"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> The Inciſion, <hi>compuncti, they were pricked.</hi> The Vein, <hi>in their hearts.</hi> Smile
not now, ye Phyſicians, if any hear me this day, as if I had paſſed a ſoleciſme, in
telling you theſe men were pricked in the vein of the heart; talk you of your
<hi>Cephalica</hi> and the reſt, and tell us of another ciſtern from whence theſe
<hi>tubuli ſanguinis</hi> are derived: I tell you again (with an addition of more
incongruities ſtill) that God and his Divine Phyſician do ſtill let blood in
the median vein of the heart. The Lancet is the keen and cutting reproof
of their late barbarous Crucifixion of their Holy and moſt innocent and
benigne Saviour. The Orifice is the ear, <hi>when they heard this.</hi> Whatever
the local diſtance be of theſe parts, ſpiritually the ear is the very ſurface of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the heart; and whoſoever would give a medicinal ſtroke to the heart, muſt
paſs it through the ear, the ſenſe of diſcipline and correction. The Anguiſh
bewrays it ſelf in their paſſionate exclamation, <hi>Men and brethren, what
ſhall we doe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is none of theſe which my ſpeech might not well take up, if not as an
houſe to dwell in, yet as an Inne to reſt and lodge in: But I will not ſo much
as bait here; onely we make this a through-fare to thoſe other ſacred pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
of ſaving remedies, which are three in number. The firſt is, Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation
of ſins by a ſpeedy repentance, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The ſecond, the ſoveraign Bath
or Laver of Regeneration, Baptiſme. The third, dietetical and prophylactical
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> receipts of wholeſome Caution; which I mean (with a determinate preterition
of the reſt) to ſpend my hour upon: <hi>Save your ſelves from this untoward genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
But ere I pitch upon this moſt uſeful and ſeaſonable particularity, let me
offer to your thoughts the ſpeedy application of theſe gracious remedies. The
bleſſed Apoſtle doth not let his Patients languiſh under his hand in the heats
and colds of hopes and feares; but ſo ſoon as ever the word is out of their
mouths, <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall we doe?</hi> he preſently adminiſtreth theſe
ſoveraign receipts, <hi>Repent, be baptized, ſave your ſelves.</hi> In acute diſeaſes wiſe
Phyſicians will loſe no time; onely delay makes ſome diſtempers deadly. It is
not for us to let good motions freeze under our fingers. How many gleeds have
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> died in their aſhes, which if they had been ſpeedily blown, had riſen into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
flames? The care of our zeal for God muſt be ſure to take all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of good. This is the Apoſtles <gap reason="foreign">

us ſtoop to it in the terms of the ſervile yieldance of <hi>Optatus</hi> his Donatiſts,
<hi>Omnia pro tempore, nihil pro veritate</hi>) not, I ſay, for conformity to it, but for
advantage of it. The Embleme teaches us to take occaſion by the fore-lock,
elſe we catch too late. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> muſt goe forth and gather their Manna ſo

               <hi>Save your ſelves.</hi> This is the very extracted quinteſſence of Saint

               </gap> 
               <hi>he teſtifies, he exhorts. He teſtifies,</hi>
what he thinks of the times; <hi>he exhorts,</hi> or <hi>beſeeches,</hi> (as the Syriack turns it)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
to avoid their danger: both of them, as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> well, referre to this one Divine
ſentence. The parts whereof then are, in S. <hi>Luke</hi>'s diviſion, <hi>Peter</hi>'s reprehenſory
Atteſtation, and his Obteſtation. His reprehenſory Atteſtation to the common
wickedneſs, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> His Obteſtation of their freedome and indemnity,

               </gap>, <hi>Save your ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To begin with the former. What is a <hi>generation?</hi> what is an <hi>untoward
generation?</hi> Either word hath ſome little miſt about it. The very word <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi>
hath begot multiplicity of ſenſes: without all perplexedneſs of ſearch,
we will ſingle out the properly-intended for this place. As times, ſo we in them,
are in continual paſſage; every thing is in motion: the Heavens do not more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
move above our heads in a circular revolution, then we here on earth do by a
perpetual alteration. Now all that are contained in one lift of time, whether
fixed or uncertain, are a Generation of men. Fixed; ſo <hi>Suidas</hi> under-reckons it
by ſeven years; but the ordinary rate is an hundred. It is a clear Text, <hi>Gen.</hi>
15. 16. <hi>But in the fourth generation they ſhall come hither again:</hi> when is that?
(to the ſhame of <hi>Galatinus,</hi> who clouds it with the fancy of the four kinds or
manners of mans exiſtence) <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf interprets it of four hundred years,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 13. Uncertain; ſo <hi>Solomon, One generation paſſeth, another cometh.</hi> The
very term implies tranſitorineſs. It is with men as with Raſps, one ſtalk is
growing, another grown up, a third withered, and all upon one root: Or as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
with flowers, (and ſome kinds of flies) they grow up, and ſeed, and die. Ye
ſee your condition, O ye Great men of the earth; it is no ſtaying here:
<hi>Orimur, morimur.</hi> After the acting of a ſhort part upon this ſtage, ye muſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
for ever. Make no other account but, with <hi>Abraham,</hi> to ſerve your genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and away. Ye can never more fitly hear of your Mortality then now that
ye are under that roof which covers the monuments of your dead and forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Progenitors.</p>
            <p>What is an <hi>untoward generation?</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; It is promiſcuouſly turned <hi>froward,
perverſe, crooked.</hi> The oppoſition to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. All is as one, what
ever ſwerves from the right is crooked. The Law is a right line; and what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
crookedneſs is in Nature, frowardneſs and untowardneſs is in Morality.
Shortly, there is a double crookedneſs and untowardneſs; one negative,
another poſitive. The firſt is a failing of that right we ſhould either have
or be; the ſecond, a contrary habit of vicious qualities: and both theſe are
either in <hi>credendis,</hi> or <hi>agendis,</hi> in matter of Faith, or matter of Fact. The firſt,
when we do not believe or doe what we ought; the ſecond, when we misbelieve
or miſ-live.</p>
            <p>The firſt is an untowardneſs of Omiſſion, the ſecond of Commiſſion.
The omiſſive untowardneſs ſhall lead the way; and that firſt, in matter of
Belief. This is it whereof our Saviour ſpake to the two Diſciples in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
warm walk to <hi>Emmaus, O fools and ſlow of heart to believe!</hi> whereof the
Proto-martyr <hi>Stephen</hi> to his auditors, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The ſtiff neck, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed
ear, the fat heart, the blinded eye, the obdurate ſoul (<hi>quae nec mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetur
precibus, nec cedit minis,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi>) are wont to be the expreſſions of
this untowardneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:44233:147"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> If theſe Jews then, after ſo clear Predictions of the Prophets, after ſo
miraculous demonſtrations of the Divine power of Chriſt, after ſo many
graves ranſack'd, dead raiſed, Devils ejected, lims and eyes new-created;
after ſuch teſtimonies of the Starre, Sages, Angels, God himſelf; after ſuch
triumphs over death and hell, do yet detrect to believe in him, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him for their <hi>Meſsias,</hi> moſt juſtly are they in this firſt kinde <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>a froward generation.</hi> And ſo is any Nation under Heaven that follows them
in the ſteps of their peeviſh incredulity, more or leſs ſhutting their eyes upon
the glorious light of Saving Truth; like that ſullen Tree in the <hi>Indies,</hi> which,
they ſay, cloſes it ſelf againſt the beams of the riſing Sun, and opens onely
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to the dampiſh ſhades of the night. Where we muſt take this Rule with us,
a Rule of moſt juſt proportion, That the means of Light to any Nation ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
the hainouſneſs and damnableneſs of their Unbelief. <hi>The time of
that ignorance God regarded not, but now,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Athenians,</hi>
Act. 17. 30. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken to them, they ſhould have had no ſin,</hi>
ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 22. Thoſe that walk in <hi>Cimmerian,</hi> in <hi>AEgypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
darkneſs, it is neither ſhame nor wonder if they either erre or ſtumble;
but for a man to ſtumble the Sun in the face, or to grope by the walls at noon
in the midſt of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> is ſo much more hateful as the occaecation is more
willing.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> The latter, which is the negative untowardneſs in Action, is, when any
Nation fails palpably in thoſe holy duties of Piety, Juſtice, Charity, which
the Royal Law of their God requireth. Of this kinde are thoſe uſual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints;
<hi>The fear of God is not before their eyes. God looked to ſee if there
were any that looked after God, and behold there was none. The righteous is
periſhed from the children of men. Behold the teares of the oppreſſed, and
none comforted them.</hi> The Prophets are full of theſe querulous notes, there
is not a page of them free; yea hardly ſhall ye meet with one line of
theirs, which doth not brand their <hi>Iſrael</hi> with this defect of Holineſs.</p>
            <p>From the negative, caſt your eyes upon the poſitive crookedneſs or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardneſs.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> That is, in matter of Faith, the maintenance or Impiety, Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
Hereſie, Superſtition, Atheiſme, and whatever other intellectual wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs.
In matter of Fact, Idolatries, Profane carriage, violation of Gods
Daies and Ordinances, Diſobediences, Murders, Adulteries, Theſts, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs,
Lyes, Detractions, or any other actual rebellion againſt God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
I have drawn forth before you an Helliſh rabble of ſins, enough to marre
a world: Whatever Nation now or ſucceſſion of men abounds either in theſe
ſinful omiſſions or theſe hainous commiſſions, whether in matter of Judgment
or Manners, is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>an untoward generation.</hi> That which makes a man
crooked or untoward makes a Generation ſo; for what is a Generation but
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> a reſultance of men? their number doth not vary their condition. But let
not our zeal (as it oft doth) make us uncharitable; when a whole Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is taxed for untowardneſs, think not that none are free. <hi>No, not one,</hi>
ſaith the Pſalmiſt, by way of ſervent aggravation: <hi>All ſeek their own,</hi> ſaith
the Apoſtle; all, in compariſon. But never times were ſo overgrown with ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
as that God hath not left himſelf ſome gracious remainders: when
the thieviſh <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> and <hi>Sabaeans</hi> have done their worſt, there ſhall be a
meſſenger, to ſay, <hi>I am eſcaped.</hi> Never was harveſt or vintage ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
inned, that ſome gleanings were not left in the field; ſome clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
among the leaves. But theſe few if they may give a bleſſing to the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> times, yet they cannot give a ſtyle; the denomination ſtill follows the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(though the worſe) part; let theſe be never ſo good, the Generation
is, and is noted for evil. Let me therefore here commend to your bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thoughts theſe three emergent conſiderations. 1. The irreparable
wrong and reproach that lewd men bring upon the very Ages and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
where they live. 2. The difference of times and Ages in reſpect of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:44233:148"/>
the degrees of evil. 3. The warrant of the free cenſure of ill-deſerving Times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
or Nations.</p>
            <p>It were happy if the injury of a wicked man could be confined to his
own boſome, that he only ſhould fare the worſe for his ſins; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c.
as the Greek rule runs; if it were but <hi>ſelf-doe, ſelf-have,</hi> as the old word
is. But as his lewdneſs is (like ſome odious ſent) diffuſed through the
whole room where he is; ſo it reacheth to earth and Heaven, yea to the
very times and generations upon which he is unhappily faln. Doubtleſs
there were many worthy Saints in theſe very times of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> there was
the Bleſſed Mother of Chriſt, the paragon of Sanctity; there was a beavy
of thoſe devout and holy dames that attended the Doctrine, bewailed the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
Death, and would have embalmed the Corps of our Bleſſed Saviour; there
were the twelve Apoſtles, the ſeventy Diſciples, the hundred and twenty names
that were met in one room at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 1. 15. the five hundred bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
that ſaw Chriſt after his glorious and victorious Reſurrection; beſides
thoſe many thouſands that believed through their word in all the parts of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea</hi>
and <hi>Galilee:</hi> yet for all that, the Apoſtle brands this with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>an
untoward generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not in the vertue of a few to drown the wickedneſs of the more. If
we come into a field that hath ſome good plenty of corn, and ſome ſtore of
weeds, though it be red with poppy, or yellow with carlock, or blew with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
wild-bottles or ſcabious, we ſtill call it a corn-field; but if we come into a
barn-floor, and ſee ſome few graines ſcattered amongſt an heap of chaffe, we
do not call it a corn-heap, the quantity of the offal devours the mention of
thoſe inſenſible grains. Thus it is with Times and Nations: A little good
is not ſeen amongſt much ill; a righteous <hi>Lot</hi> cannot make his City to be no
<hi>Sodom.</hi> Wickedneſs as it helps to corrupt, ſo to ſhame a very Age. The
Orator <hi>Tertullus,</hi> when he would plead againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> ſayes, <hi>We have found
this man</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>a peſtilence,</hi> Act. 24. 5. Fooliſh <hi>Tertullus!</hi> that miſtook the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote
for the Poiſon, the remedy for the diſeaſe. But had S. <hi>Paul</hi> been ſuch

               </gap>, <hi>the plague</hi> of thy people. A wicked man is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
contagion; he infects the world with ſin, the very Age with infamy.
<hi>Malus vir, malum publicum,</hi> is not a more old then true word. Are there then
in any Nation under Heaven lewd miſcreants, whoſe hearts are Atheiſts, whoſe
tongues are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the world: whereas now in the laſt (which is the wrangling and techy
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> dotage of the decrepit world) here is nothing but unquiet claſhings of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
nothing but foul Hereſie, either maintained by the guilty, or imputed
to the innocent; nothing but groſs Idolatry in Paganiſme, in miſ-believing
Chriſtianity; and (woe is me that I muſt ſay it) a coloured Impiety ſhares too
much of the reſt. My ſpeech is glided, ere I was aware, into the third Head of
our diſcourſe; and is ſuddenly faln upon the practice of that which S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s
example here warrants, the cenſure of ill-deſerving times: which I muſt crave
leave of your Honorable and Chriſtian patience with an holy and juſt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to proſecute.</p>
            <p>It is the peeviſh humour of a factious eloquence to aggravate the evils of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the times; which were they better then they are, would be therefore cried
down in the ordinary language of male contented ſpirits, becauſe preſent.
But it is the warrantable and neceſſary duty of S. <hi>Peter</hi> and all his true
Evangelical ſucceſſors, when they meet with a froward Generation, to call
it ſo.</p>
            <p>How commonly do we cry out of thoſe querulous <hi>Michaiahs</hi> that are ſtill
propheſying evil to us, and not good? No theme but ſins, no ſawce but
vineger. Might not one of theſe galled Jewes of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Auditory have
ſtarted up, and have thus challenged him for this tartneſs, What means this
hard cenſure? why do you ſlander the time? <hi>Solomon</hi> was a wiſe man, and he
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſayes, <hi>Say not thou, What is the cauſe that the former dayes were better then theſe?
for thou doſt not inquire wiſely concerning this:</hi> this is but a needleſs rigour, this
is but an envious calumny. The Generation were not untoward, if your
tongue were not uncharitable. The Apoſtle feares none of theſe curriſh ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrations;
but contemning all impotent miſacceptions, calls them what he
finds them, <hi>A froward generation.</hi> And well might he doe ſo; his great Maſter
did it before him, <hi>an evil and adulterous generation;</hi> and the Harbinger of
that great Maſter fore-ran him in that cenſure, <hi>O generation of Vipers,</hi> Mat. 3. 7.
and the Prophets led the ſame way to him in every page. And why do not
we follow <hi>Peter</hi> in the ſame ſteps wherein <hi>Peter</hi> followed Chriſt, and Chriſt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> his Fore-runner, and his Fore-runner the Prophets? Who ſhould tell the
times of their ſins, if we be ſilent? Pardon me, I beſeech you, moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
reverend, and beloved hearers; neceſſity is laid upon me: in this day
of our publick mourning, I may not be as <hi>a man in whoſe mouth are no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs.</hi>
Oh let us be thankful for our Bleſſings, wherein, through the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God, we outſtrip all the nations under Heaven; but withall let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:44233:149"/>
our ſins, which are ſo much more grievous, becauſe ours. Would to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
God it were no leſs unjuſt then unpleaſing to complain of this as an unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Generation. There be four things that are wont both to make up and
evince the pravity of any Generation; (woe is me that they are too appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
met in this) multitude of ſins, magnitude of ſins, boldneſs of ſin,
impunity of ſinning. Take a ſhort view of them all. You ſhall ſee that the
Multitude is ſuch, as that it hath covered the earth; the Magnitude
ſuch as hath reach'd to Heaven; the Boldneſs ſuch as out-faceth the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel;
the Impunity ſuch as fruſtrates the wholeſome Laws under which
we live.</p>
            <p>For the Multitude, where is the man that makes true conſcience of any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
the Laws of his God? And if every man violate all the laws of God, what
do all put together? Our Forefathers ſins were but as drops, ours are as
torrents. Inſtance in ſome few. Cannot we our ſelves remember ſince a
debauch'd Drunkard was an Owle among birds, a beaſt of men, a monſter
of beaſts, abhorred of men, ſhouted at by children? Is this ſight now any

their ſound ſtartled the hearer, as amazed at the ſtrange language of treaſon
againſt the God of Heaven? Now they fill every mouth, and beat every
eare in a neglected familiarity. What ſhould I tell you of the overgrown

malicious Suits? The neighbour walls of this famous adjoyning Palace can

What ſhould I tell you of the ſenſible declination to our once<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loathed
Superſtitions, of the common trade of contemptuous diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
to lawful Authority, the ſcornful undervaluing of Gods Meſſengers,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
the ordinary neglect of his Sacred Ordinances? what ſpeak I of theſe and
thouſands more? There are Arithmeticians that have taken upon them
to count how many corns of ſand would make up the bulk of Heaven
and earth; but no Art can reckon up the multitude of our provoking
ſins.</p>
            <p>Neither do they more exceed in number then Magnitude. Can there be
a greater ſin then Idolatry? Is not this (beſides all the reſt) the ſin of
the preſent <hi>Romiſh</hi> Generation? One of their own confeſſes (as he well may)
that were not the Bread tranſubſtantiate, their Idolatry were more groſs then
the heatheniſh. Lo, nothing excuſes them but an impoſſible Figment. Know,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
O ye poor ignorant ſeduced Souls, that the Bread can be no more turned
into God, then God can be turned into Bread, into nothing: The very
Omnipotent Power of God barrs theſe impious contradictions. My heart
trembles therefore and bleeds to think of your higheſt, your holieſt Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Can there be a greater ſin then robbing of God? This is done by our
Sacrilegious Patrons. Can there be a greater ſin then tearing God out of
Heaven with our bloody and blaſphemous Oathes, then the famiſhing of Souls
by a wilful or lazie ſilence, then rending in pieces the bowels of our dear
Mother the Church by our headſtrong and frivolous diſſentions, then furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Murders, then affronts of Authority? Theſe, theſe are thoſe huge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
mountains which our Giantlike preſumption rolls upon each other, to warre
againſt Heaven.</p>
            <p>Neither are the ſins of men more great then Audacious: yea it is their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency
that makes them hainous; baſhful offences riſe not to extremity of
evil. The ſins of exceſs as they are <hi>opera tenebrarum,</hi> ſo they had wont to

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> dare throw down the gantlet to Juſtice; and inſolent Diſobedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
doe ſo to Authority. And when we denounce the fearful Judgments of
God againſt all theſe abominable wickedneſſes, the obdured ſinner dares jeare us
in the face, and, in a worſe ſenſe, ask the Diſciples queſtion, <hi>Domine, quando
fient haec? Maſter, when ſhall theſe things be?</hi> Yea their ſelf-flattering incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity
dares ſay to their Soul, as <hi>Peter</hi> did to his Maſter, <hi>Favour thy ſelf, for
theſe things ſhall not happen to thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither, laſtly, would ſin dare to be ſo impudent, if it were not for Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity;
it cannot be but cowardly where it ſees cauſe of fear. Every hand
is not to be laid upon evil. If an Errour ſhould ariſe in the Church, it is not
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> for every unlearned Tradeſman to caſt away his yard-wand, and take up his
pen. Wherefore ſerve Univerſities, if every Blew apron may at his pleaſure
turn Licenciate of Divinity, and talk of Theological queſtions which he
underſtands not, as if they were to be meaſured by the Ell? O times! Lord,
whether will this preſumption grow? <hi>Deus omen,</hi> &amp;c. If folly, if villany
be committed in our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it is not for every man to be an Officer. <hi>Who
made thee a Judge?</hi> was a good queſtion, though ill asked. But I would to
God we had more cauſe to complain of the preſumption of them who meddle
with what they ſhould not, then the neglect of them who meddle not with
what they ſhould. Woe is me, the flood-gates of evil are (as it were) lift

upon Sacred Soveraignty: No, bleſſed be God for his dear Anointed,
of whom we may truly and joyfully ſay, that in imitation of him whom he
repreſents, he <hi>loves Juſtice, and hates Iniquity.</hi> It is the partiality or flack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the ſubordinate inferiour executions that is guilty of this prevalence
of ſin. What can the head doe where the hands are wanting? to what
uſe is the water derived from the ciſtern into the pipes, if the cock be not
turned? What availes it if children are brought to the birth, if they want
a midwifty to deliver them? Can there poſſibly be better Laws then have
in our times been enacted againſt Drunkenneſs? where or when are they exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted?
Can there be a better Law made for the reſtraint of too-too common
Oathes? who urges, who payes that juſt mulct? Can there be better Laws
againſt wilful Recuſancy, againſt Simony, againſt Sacriledge? how are they elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by fraudulent evaſions? Againſt neglect of Divine Service? yet how are
they ſlighted? Againſt the lawleſs wandring of lazie Vagabonds? yet how
full are our ſtreets, how empty our Correction-houſes? Laſtly, (for it were

of Fornications, Adulteries, and all other fleſhly inordinateneſſes? how doth
bribery and corruption ſmother theſe offences, as if the ſins of men ſerved on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to inrich covetous Officers? Now put all theſe together, the Multitude,
the Magnitude, the Boldneſs, the Impunity of ſin, and tell me whether all
theſe do not make this of ours <hi>generationem pravam, a froward generation.</hi>

what aſhes can be enough for us? Oh that our faces could be covered with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>

            </p>
            <p>And ſo from St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Atteſtation to their wickedneſs, we deſcend to
his Obteſtation of their redreſs, <hi>Save your ſelves.</hi> We muſt be ſo much
ſhorter in the remedy, as we have been longer in the diſeaſe. The remedy
is but of a ſhort ſound, but of a long extent, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. I urge not the paſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of this advice, that it is not, <hi>Save your ſelves,</hi> but, <hi>Be ye ſaved.</hi> God
is jealous of aſcribing to us any power unto good: we have ability, we have
will enough to undo our ſelves, ſcope enough to hell-ward; neither motion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
nor will to doe good; that muſt be put into us by him that gives both <hi>poſſe, &amp;
velle, &amp; poſſe velle,</hi> power to will, and will to do. This <hi>Saving</hi> compriſes in it
three great duties; Repentance for our ſin, Avoidance of ſinners, Reluctation
to ſin and ſinners.</p>
            <p>Repentance. Perhaps, as St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Cyrill</hi> think, ſome of theſe
were the perſonal Executioners of Chriſt. If ſo, they were the worſt of this
Generation; and yet they may, they muſt ſave themſelves from this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
by their unfeigned Repentance: howſoever they made up no ſmall
piece of the evil times, and had need to be ſaved from themſelves by their
hearty contrition. Surely thoſe ſins are not ours whereof we have truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
The skin that is once waſhed, is as clean from ſoile as if it had never
been foul. Thoſe Legal waſhings and rinſings ſhewed them what they muſt doe
to their Souls, to their lives. This remedy as it is univerſal, ſo it is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual:
the warm waters of our teares are the ſtreams of <hi>Jordan</hi> to cure our Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie,
the <hi>Siloam</hi> to cure our Blindneſs, the Pool of <hi>Betheſda</hi> to cure all our
Lameneſs and defects of Obedience. Alas! there is none of us but have our
ſhare in the common ſins; the beſt of us hath help'd to make up the froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of our Generation. Oh that we could un-ſin our ſelves by our ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
repentance. <hi>Cleanſe your hands, ye ſinners, and purge your hearts, ye double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </p>
            <p>Avoidance is the next; avoidance of all unlawful participation. There
is a participation Natural, as to live in the ſame aire, to dwell in the ſame
earth, to eat of the ſame meat: this we cannot avoid, unleſs we would go
out of the world, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells his <hi>Corinthians.</hi> There is a Civil participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in matter of commerce and humane neceſſary converſation: this we
need not avoid with Jews, Turks, Infidels, Hereticks. There is a Spiritual
participation in moral things, whether good or evil: In theſe lyes this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
And yet not univerſally neither; we are not tied to avoid the ſervices
of God and holy duties for the commixture of leud men, as the fooliſh Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
have fancied: it is participation in evil that we are here charged to avoid.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
Although alſo intireneſs even in civil converſation is not allowed us with
notoriouſly wicked and infectious perſons. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> muſt hye them
from the Tents of <hi>Corah;</hi> and, <hi>Come out of her my people.</hi> Chiefly, they
are the ſins from which we muſt ſave our ſelves, not the men; if not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the men for the ſins. <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitfull works
of darkneſs,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 5. 11. commenting upon this <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>There is nothing more ordinary with our Caſuiſts, then the nine waies of
participation; which <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and the Schools following him, have ſhut up
in two homely verſes, <hi>Juſsio, conſilium, &amp;c.</hi> The ſumme is, that we do not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
ſave our ſelves from evil if either we command it, or counſel it, or conſent to
it, or ſooth it, or further it, or ſhare in it, or diſſwade it not, or reſiſt it not,
or reveal it not. Here would be work enough (you ſee) to hold our preaching
unto St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s hour, midnight: but I ſpare you, and would be loath to have
any <hi>Eutychus.</hi> Shortly, if we would ſave our ſelves from the ſin of the time,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:44233:150"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> we may not command it, as <hi>Jezabel</hi> did to the Elders of <hi>Jezreel;</hi> we may not
adviſe it, as <hi>Jonadab</hi> did to <hi>Amnon;</hi> we may not conſent to it, as <hi>Bathſheba</hi>
did to <hi>David;</hi> we may not ſooth it, as <hi>Zidkijah</hi> did to <hi>Ahab;</hi> we may not
further it, as <hi>Joab</hi> did to <hi>David;</hi> we may not forbear to diſſwade it, as <hi>Hirah</hi>
the <hi>Adullamite</hi> to <hi>Judah;</hi> to reſiſt it, as partial Magiſtrates; to reveal it, as
treacherous Confeſſaries.</p>
            <p>But of all theſe, (that we may ſingle out our laſt and utmoſt remedy) here
muſt be a zealous reluctation to evil. All thoſe other negative carriages of not
commanding, not counſelling, not conſenting, not ſoothing, not abetting, not
ſharing, are nothing without a real oppugnation of ſin. Would we then
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> throughly quit our ſelves of our froward Generation? we muſt ſet our
faces againſt it to diſcountenance it; we muſt ſet our tongues againſt it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll
it; we muſt ſet our hands againſt it to oppoſe it. It goes farre that of the
Apoſtle, <hi>Ye have not yet reſiſted unto blood, ſtriving againſt ſin,</hi> Heb. 12. 4. Lo
here is a truly heroical exerciſe for you great Ones; to ſtrive againſt ſin, not
<hi>ad ſudorem</hi> onely, as Phyſicians preſcribe, but <hi>ad ſanguinem.</hi> Ye cannot better
beſtow your ſelves then (in a loyal aſſiſtance of Sacred Authority) upon the
debellation of the outragious wickedneſs of the times. Theſe are the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,
and Giants, and Monſters, the vanquiſhing whereof hath moralized the
Hiſtories of your famous Progenitors. Oh do ye conſecrate your hands and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> your hearts to God in beating down the headſtrong powers of evil; and as
by repentance and avoidance, ſo by reluctation, <hi>Save your Souls from this
untoward generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what need I waſte the time in dehorting your Noble and Chriſtian
ingenuity from participation of the Epidemical ſins of a froward Generation?
It is enough motive to you, that ſin is a baſe, ſordid, diſhonourable thing.
But withall let me adde onely one diſſwaſive from the danger, implyed in
the very word <hi>Save,</hi> for how are we ſaved but from a danger? The danger
both of Corruption, and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>Corruption. Ye ſee before your eyes that one yawing mouth makes
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> many: This pitch will defile us: One rotten kernell of the Pomegranate
infects the fellows. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> made that verſe of the Heathen Poet Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical,
<hi>Evil converſation corrupts good manners.</hi> What woful experience
have we every day of thoſe, who by this means from a vigorous heat of
zeal have declined to a temper of lukewarm indifferencie, and then from
a careleſs mediocrity to all extremity of debauchedneſs; and of hopeful
beginners, have ended in incarnate Devils? Oh the dangerous and inſenſible
inſinuations of ſin! If that crafty Tempter can hereby work us but to one
dram of leſs deteſtation to a familiarly-inured evil, he promiſeth himſelf the
victory. It is well noted by Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> of that chaſte Patriarch <hi>Joſeph,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that ſo ſoon as ever his wanton Miſtreſs had laid her impure hand upon
his Cloak, he leaves it behind him, that he might be ſure to avoid the danger
of her contagious touch. If the Spouſe of Chriſt be <hi>a Lily among Thorns,</hi>
(by the mighty Protection of her Omnipotent Husband) yet take thou heed
how thou walkeſt amongſt thoſe Thorns for that Lily. Shortly, wouldſt
thou not be tainted with wickedneſs? abhorre the peſtilent ſociety of leud
men; and by a ſeaſonable ſubduction, thus <hi>Save thy ſelf from a froward

            <p>The laſt and utmoſt of all dangers is Confuſion. That charge of God
by <hi>Moſes</hi> is but juſt, <hi>Numb. 16. 26. Depart, I pray you, from the tents of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> theſe men, and touch nothing of theirs, leſt ye periſh in all their ſins.</hi> Lo, the
very ſtation, the very touch is mortal. Indeed what reaſon is there to hope
or to plead for an immunity? if we ſhare in the work, why ſhould we not
take part of the wages? <hi>The wages of ſin is death.</hi> If the Stork be taken
damage faiſant with the Cranes, ſhe is enwrapped in the ſame net, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
complain to be ſurprized. <hi>Qui cum lupis eſt, cum lupis ululet,</hi> as he
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:44233:151"/>
ſaid, <hi>He that is with wolves, let him howl with wolves.</hi> If we be <hi>fratres <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
in malo, brethren in evil,</hi> we muſt look to be involved in the ſame curſe.
Be not deceived, Honourable and beloved, here is no exemption of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
nay, contrarily, Eminence of place aggravates both the ſin and the
judgement. When <hi>Ezra</hi> heard that the hand of the Princes and Rulers had
been chief in that great offence, then he rent his cloaths and tore his hair,
<hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 3.</p>
            <p>Certainly this caſe is dangerous and fearful, whereſoever it lights.
Hardly are thoſe ſins redreſſed that are taken up by the Great: Eaſily
are thoſe ſins diffuſed that are warranted by great Examples. The
great Lights of Heaven, the moſt conſpicuous Planets, if they be eclipſed,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
all the Almanacks of all Nations write of it; whereas the ſmall Stars
of the Galaxy are not heeded. All the Country runs to a Beacon on
fire; no body regards to ſee a Shrub flaming in a valley. Know then
that your ſins are ſo much greater as your ſelves are: and all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
that I can give you without your true repentance, is, That <hi>mighty
men ſhall be mightily tormented.</hi> Of all other men therefore be ye moſt
careful to keep your ſelves untainted with the common ſins, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
your covenant with God. No man cares for a ſpot upon a plain
ruſſet riding-ſuit; but we are curious of a rich robe, every mote there is
an eye-ſore. Oh, be ye careful to preſerve your Honour from all the foul <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
blemiſhes of corruption; as thoſe that know Vertue hath a greater ſhare in
Nobility then Blood. Imitate in this the great frame of the Creation, which
ſtill, the more it is removed from the dregs of this earth, the purer it is. Oh
<hi>ſave</hi> ye <hi>your ſelves from this untoward Generation;</hi> ſo ſhall ye help to ſave
your Nation from the imminent Judgements of our juſt God; ſo ſhall ye ſave
your Souls in the day of the appearance of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: to whom,
with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, one infinite God, be all Honour and Glory
aſcribed now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>IT is an unperfect Clauſe, you ſee, but a perfect Deſcription of an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite;
and that an Hypocrite of our own times, the laſt: which are ſo
much the worſe, by how much they partake more of the craft and
diſeaſes of age.</p>
               <p>The Prophets were the Seers of the Old Teſtament, the Apoſtles were the
Seers of the New; thoſe ſaw Chriſt's day and rejoyced, theſe foreſaw the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:44233:152"/>
reign of Antichriſt and complained. Theſe very times were as preſent to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
S. <hi>Paul</hi> as to us: our Senſe doth not ſee them ſo clearly as his Revelation. <hi>I am
with you in the Spirit,</hi> (ſaith he to his abſent <hi>Coloſsians) rejoycing and beholding
your order:</hi> he doth as good as ſay to them, I am with you in the Spirit la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting,
and beholding your miſdemeanours. By theſe Divine Opticks
he ſees our formal Piety, real Wickedneſs: both which make up the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
Hypocriſie in my Text; <hi>Having a form of Godlineſs, but denying the
power thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I doubt not but ſome will be ready to ſet this ſacred Prognoſtication to
another Meridian. And indeed we know a Generation that loves themſelves
too well, much more then Peace and Truth; ſo covetous, that they would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
catch all the world in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s net; proud boaſters of their own merits, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
ſupererogations: it would be long (though eaſie) to follow all. We
know where too many Treaſons are hatched; we know who in the height of
minde exalts himſelf above all that is called God; we know where pleaſure
hath the moſt delicate and debauch'd Clients; we know where Devotion is
profeſſedly formal, and lives impure: and ſurely, were we clearly innocent
of theſe crimes, I ſhould be the firſt that would caſt this ſtone at <hi>Rome.</hi> But
now that we ſhare with them in theſe ſins, there is no reaſon we ſhould be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
in the Cenſure. Take it among ye therefore, ye Hypocrites of all
profeſſions, for it is your own, <hi>Ye have a form of Godlineſs, denying the power <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is an Hypocrite but a Player, the <hi>Zani</hi> of Religion (as ye heard lately?)
A Player acts that he is not; ſo do ye, act good and are wicked. Here is a
ſemblance of good, a form of Godlineſs; here is a real evil, a denial of the
power of Godlineſs. There is nothing ſo good as Godlineſs, yea there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
good but it; nothing makes Godlineſs to be good, or to be Godlineſs,
but the power of it: for it is not, if it work not, and it works not, if not power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.
Now the denial of good muſt needs be evil; and ſo much more evil,
as the good which is denied is more good: and therefore the denial of the
power of Godlineſs muſt needs be as ill as the form or ſhew of Godlineſs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
would ſeem good, and as the power of Godlineſs is good. This is therefore
the perfect Hypocriſie of faſhionable Chriſtians; they have the form, they
deny the power. Here is then a direct and profeſſed oppoſition betwixt <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the form and the power; and no leſs between the actions employed
about them both, the one <hi>having,</hi> the other <hi>denying; having the form, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As all ſin is originally from the Devil, ſo eſpecially Hypocriſie: he is <hi>the
father of Lies;</hi> and what is Hypocriſie but a real Lie? that is his Darling:
and theſe two are well put together, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>in Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie
ſpeaking Lies.</hi> Now as all things are more eminent in their Cauſes and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
then in the Effects derived from them; ſo it muſt needs be ſaid that the
greateſt Hypocrite in the World is the Devil. I know he hears what I ſay, but
we muſt ſpeak truth and ſhame him. For <hi>Satan is transformed into an Angel of
light,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; not he was, but he is; ſo transformed, that he never did,
never will put off that counterfeit. And as all his Imps are partakers of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical
nature; ſo in every Hypocrite there is both the Angel and the Devil:
the ſeeming Angel is the <hi>form of Godlineſs,</hi> the real Devil is the <hi>denial of the
power of Godlineſs.</hi> It muſt be in another ſenſe that that Father ſaid, <hi>Innocentis
tempore poſterior eſt quàm malitia.</hi> I am ſure the Angel of light was before the
Satan; and now becauſe he is Satan, he puts on the Angel of light. Such ſhall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
be our method in this Hypocrite we treat of; firſt we will begin with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
of Hypocriſie, and then ſhew you the Devil in his true ſhape.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, here is a form, and but <hi>a form of Godlineſs.</hi> A form does well;
but if it be but a form, it is an immaterial ſhadow of Piety. Such was this of
theſe men; for they were <hi>unnatural, traitors, heady, high-minded,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:44233:152"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Surely if they were unnatural, they muſt needs be unchriſtian; if they
were traitors to their King, they could be no Subjects to God; if heady
and high-minded, they had nothing to doe with him whoſe firſt Leſſon
was, <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">No Creature is more humble then God.</note> 
                  <hi>Nulla creatura humilior Deo,</hi> as <hi>Laurentius</hi>
well: if they had Pleaſure for their Idol, they could not have the Lord for
their God. So as even without God, they had yet <hi>a form of Godlineſs.</hi> God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
is a thing much talk'd of, little underſtood. Whiles the ancient School
had wont to ſay, that it is not practical, not ſpeculative, but affective, their
meaning was, that it is in all theſe, in the heart, in the brain, in the hand; but
moſt in the heart. It is Speculative in the knowledge of God; Practical in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Service to God; Affective in our fear of him, love to him, joy in him.
Shortly then, to apprehend God as he hath revealed, to ſerve him as he
hath required, to be affected to him as we ought, is Godlineſs; and the
outward expreſſion and counterfaiſance of all theſe is the <hi>form of Godlineſs.</hi>
To this outſide of Godlineſs then belongs all that glorious Pageant of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable
profeſſion which we ſee made in the World, whether in words, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
carriage.</p>
               <p>Firſt here is a world of good Words, whether to God, or of him. Here are
words of ſacred complement with God: for the Hypocrite courts God in his
Prayers; no man ſpeaks fairer, no man louder then he. Here is <hi>Saul</hi>'s <hi>benedictus;</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> here is the Phariſees <hi>Lord, I thank thee;</hi> here is the colloguing Jews <hi>Domine,
Domine, Lord, Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to him, ſo of him. Here are words of religious proteſtation for God,
like to the Jews <hi>Templum Domini,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Temple of the Lord.</note> or <hi>Herod</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Mat. 2. 8. I will worſhip
the Babe.</hi> The mans ſecret fire of zeal ſmoaks forth into the holy breath of a
good confeſſion. Here are words of fervent excitation to the frozen hearts of
others; yea, if need be, words of deep cenſure of the cold moderation which he
apprehends in his wiſer Brethren:<note place="margin">Neat in words, if foul in fact.</note> ſo as he is <hi>comptus in verbo,</hi> if <hi>turpis in facto,</hi>
as <hi>Bernard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet more, here is a perfect Scene of pious Geſtures; knees bowed, hands
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> erected, turn'd up eyes, the breaſt beaten, the head ſhaken, the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
dejected, ſighs aſcending, tears dropping, the Bible hugged and
kiſſed, the ear nailed to the Pulpit: what formality of devout Godlineſs
is here unacted? if the man were within as he is without, there were no
Saint but he.</p>
               <p>Yet this is not all to make up a perfect <hi>form of Godlineſs,</hi> here is a ſmooth
face of holy carriage in Actions. Devout <hi>Saul</hi> will be ſaving the fatteſt of the
<hi>Amalekitiſh</hi> flocks and herds for ſacrifice to the Lord his God. Good man!
he will not have God take up with the worſt. Every man is not of this diet;
too many think any offall good enough for their Maker: but here is one that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> holds the beſt fitteſt for thoſe ſacred Altars; when in the mean time the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
had already ſacrificed them to his own Mammon, and God muſt take up
with the reverſion. Shall I tell you of another as good, as devout as he?
Do ye not remember that <hi>Abſolom</hi> would go to pay his vow in <hi>Hebron?</hi> The
fair Prince of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was courteous before, now he will be Godly too. It was
Pietie that he would make a Vow to God. Our Gallants have ſomewhat elſe
to doe then to make holy vows: at every word they proteſt and vow, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ſwear; but all like themſelves, vainly and idly: But <hi>Abſolom</hi> makes a
ſolemn and religious Vow. It was more piety that he would perform it. This
is not every mans care: too many care not how much they run upon God's
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſcore; this man will pitch and pay. Unnatural Parricide! Firſt he had ſtoln
the ſubjects hearts, and now he would ſteal his Fathers Crown; and all this
villany muſt ſtalk under a beaſts hide, a Sacrifice at <hi>Hebron:</hi> Blood was in his
thoughts whiles the Sacrifice was in his mouth. The old word is, <hi>Full of
courteſie, full of craft:</hi> when ye ſee too glittering pretences in unapproved per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
ſuſpect the inſide. Had you but ſeen a Jews Faſt, you would ſay ſo; <hi>Eſa.</hi> 58. 6.
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:44233:153"/>
Here was nothing but drooping and aſh-ſtrawed heads, torn garments, bare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
feet, ſtarved cheeks, ſcrubbed skins, pined maws, afflictive devotions; yet
a Jew ſtill. But had you ſeen <hi>Herod</hi>'s formality, you would have ſaid it yet
more: mark a little, and ſee <hi>Herod</hi> turn'd Diſciple to <hi>John Baptiſt.</hi> What, <hi>Saul
among the Prophets? Herod</hi> among the Diſciples? Surely ſo; for he hears
him. Tuſh, hears him? what's that? There are thoſe that hear and would
not, forced to hear by compulſion of Laws; who may ſay to Authority, as
the Pſalmiſt ſays to God, <hi>Aurem perforaſti mihi, Mine ear haſt thou boared:</hi>
their ear is a Proteſtant, while their heart is a Recuſant. There are thoſe that
hear and hear not; that come faſhionably, and hear perfunctorily, whoſe
ears are like the Pſalmiſts Idols, for form onely, not for uſe. There are thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

with pleaſure: he heard becauſe he loved to hear. Yea ſo doth many a hollow
heart ſtill: ye ſhall have ſuch an one liſten as if he were <hi>totus auris, all ear,</hi> as if he
would latch every word from the Preachers mouth ere it could get out:
perhaps it is new, perhaps witty, perhaps elegant, or ſome way pleaſing. Yea
there are ſome not onely willing, but greedy hearers, they have <hi>aures bibulas,</hi>
they hear hungrily and thirſtily; but it is but to catch advantages; ſomewhat
they hope may fall to pay the Preacher. <hi>Herod</hi> is better then ſo, <gap reason="foreign">

the world; but where is the doing? or if there be doing, yet it is ſmall doing
(God wot.) Some things we may be drawn to doe, not many; one good deed
in a life is well; one fault amended meriteth: to doe many is not incident to
many. So as too many of us are upon a form of Godlineſs; but it is a lower
form then <hi>Herod</hi>'s, who heard, and heard gladly, and obſerv'd his teacher, and

               <p>All theſe and many others of the ſame kind are Swans, which under white
feathers have a black skin. Theſe have a form of Godlineſs, and are the worſe
for it. For as it is the moſt dangerous and killing flattery that is brought
in under a pretence of liberty; ſo it is the moſt odious and perilous Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that is hid under <hi>a form of Godlineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe men, I ſay, have a form, and nothing elſe ſave a form of Godlineſs.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> But withall let me adde, that whoſoever makes a good profeſſion hath this
form; and is ſo farre commendable, as he profeſſes well. If there be not
matter to this form, the fault is in what is not, and not in what there is. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
Religion is not <hi>Chaos</hi> like without form. As not Civility, ſo Godlineſs
cannot be without due form: ye cannot think Gods Service to be all lining,
no out-ſide; a form there muſt be. It was a Law written in Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
Letters over the gate of the firſt peculiar partition of the Temple, which
was <hi>atrium Judaeorum, Every ſtranger that paſſes into the Holy place muſt dy.</hi>
If he had not the mark of a Jew upon his fleſh, it was capital to tread in thoſe
holy Courts. The Temple was the type of the Church: If we have not ſo
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> much as <hi>a form of Godlineſs, procul, ô procul: without ſhall be dogs;</hi> and, <hi>if a
Beaſt touch the Mount, it ſhall dye.</hi> What ſhall we ſay to thoſe Gallants that
hate to have ſo much as <hi>a form of Godlineſs?</hi> there cannot be a greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement
caſt upon them, then the very ſemblance of Devotion. To ſay
Grace at meales, to bow a knee in Prayer, to name God other then in an
Oath, to once mention Religion, is a baſe, mortifi'd, puſillanimous tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
What talk ye of a Sermon? a Play if you will: What ſpeak you of
weeping for ſins? talk of drinking healths, ſinging of rounds, courting of
Dames, revels, matches, games, any thing ſave goodneſs. What ſhould we
ſay of theſe men? even this, He that hath but a form is an Hypocrite; but
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> he that hath not a form is an Atheiſt. I know not whether I ſhould ſever
theſe two; both are humane Devills well met: An Hypocrite is a masked
Devil; an Atheiſt is a Devil unmasked. Whether of them ſhall without their
repentance be deeper in Hell, they ſhall once feel, I determine not. Onely
let me aſſure them, that if the infernal <hi>Tophet</hi> be not for them, it can challenge
no gueſts.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the <hi>form of Godlineſs,</hi> which is the Angel of Hypocriſie:
our ſpeech deſcends to the Devil in Hypocriſie, which is the <hi>deniall of the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> upon the <hi>power of Godlineſs,</hi> ere we fall upon the <hi>deniall</hi> of that <hi>power.</hi> What

is the means. All ye that hear me this day, either ye are alive, or would be:
Life is ſweet; every one challenges it. Do ye live willingly in your ſins? Let
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> me tell you, ye are dead in your ſins: This life is a death. If you wiſh to
live comfortably here and gloriouſly hereafter, it is Godlineſs that muſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
this life in ſin, that muſt quicken you from this death in ſin. Flatter your
ſelves how you pleaſe, ye great Gallants of both Sexes: ye think your ſelves
goodly pieces; without Godlineſs ye are the worſt kinde of carkaſſes: for as
death or not-being is the worſt condition that can befall a creature; ſo death
in ſin is ſo much the worſt kind of death, by how much Grace is better then
Nature. A living Dog or Toad is better then a thus-dead ſinner. Would ye
riſe out of this loathſome and woful plight? it is Godlineſs that muſt breath
Grace into your dead lims, and that muſt give you the motions of holy Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>Is it not a wonder to caſt out Devils? I tell you, the corporal poſſeſſion of
ill ſpirits is not ſo rare, as the ſpiritual is riſe. No natural man is free. One
hath <hi>the ſpirit of errour,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 1. another <hi>the ſpirit of fornications,</hi> Oſe 4. 12.
another <hi>the ſpirit of fear,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 7. another <hi>the ſpirit of ſlumber,</hi> another <hi>the

Surely there need none of theſe eyes to diſcern every natural mans Soul haunted

God will give them repentance, that they may recover themſelves out of the

               <p>What ſpeak I of power? I had like to have aſcribed to it the acts of Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie:
And if I had done ſo, it had not been much amiſs; for what is God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs

what but that ſame <hi>Dextra Excelſi,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The right hand of the moſt High.</note> whereby he works mightily upon the

is it that God can doe, which Prayer and Faith cannot doe? Will ye ſee ſome
inſtances of the further acts of Godlineſs? Is it not an act of Omnipotence
to change Nature? <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Sorcerers, may juggle
away the Staffe, and bring a Serpent into the room of it; none but a Divine
power (which <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought by) could change the Rod into a Serpent, or the
Serpent into a Rod. Nothing is above Nature but the God of Nature; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can change Nature but that which is above it: for Nature is regular
in her proceedings, and will not be croſt by a finite power, ſince all finite
Agents are within her command. Is it not a manifeſt change of the nature

How ſhall this be? It is an idle conceit of the Hebrews, that ſavage beaſts

ſhall alter their diſpoſitions. The ravenous Oppreſſor is the <hi>Wolf,</hi> the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Perſecutor is the <hi>Leopard,</hi> the venemous Heretick is the <hi>Aſpe;</hi> theſe
ſhall turn innocent and uſeful by the power of Godlineſs: for then <hi>the earth

This is done when <hi>thoſe doe good which are accuſtomed to evil,</hi> Jer.

to turn men into beaſts (a cup too much can doe it;) but to turn beaſts into men,
men into Saints, Devils into Angels, it is no leſs then a work of Omnipotencie.
And this Godlineſs can doe.</p>
               <p>But to riſe higher then a change: Is it not an act of Omnipotencie to create?
Nature can go on in her track whether of continuing what ſhe actually finds
to be, or of producing what ſhe finds to be potentially in pre-exiſting Cauſes;
but to make new matter tranſcends her power. This Godlineſs can doe:

right hand of</hi> true wiſedome, <hi>and in her left hand riches and honour,</hi> Prov.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 3. 16. Lo, honour and wealth are but gifts of the left hand; common and
mean favours: length, yea eternity, of dayes is for the right, that is the
height of bounty. <hi>Godlineſs hath the promiſes of this life and of that which
is to come,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: the promiſe, that is enough; Gods promiſes
are his performances; with men to promiſe and to pay are two things, they
are one with God. <hi>To them that by patient continuing in well-doing ſeek glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and honour and immortality, eternal life,</hi> Rom. 2. 7. Briefly (for I could
dwell here alwaies) it is Godlineſs that onely can give us the beatifical ſight
of God. The ſight? yea the fruition of him, yea the union with him; not by
appoſition, not by adheſion, but by a bleſſed <hi>participation of the divine nature,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 2 Pet. 1. 4. I can goe no higher; no, the Angels and Arch-angels cannot look
higher then this.</p>
               <p>To ſumme up all then; Godlineſs can give wiſedome to the fool, eyes to
the blind, life to the dead; it can eject Devils, change the courſe of Nature,
create us anew, free us from evil, feoffe us in good, honour, wealth, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
everlaſting happineſs. O the wonderful, O the beneficial <hi>power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs!</hi>
And now what is the deſire of my Soul, but that all this could make
you in love with Godlineſs; that in ſtead of the ambitions of Honour, the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
for Wealth, the purſuit of Pleaſure, your hearts could be ſet on fire with
the zealous affectation of true Godlineſs? Alas! the leaſt overture of any of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> theſe makes us mad of the world; if but the ſhadow of a little Honour, Wealth,
Promotion, Pleaſure be caſt before us, how eagerly do we proſecute it to the
eternal hazard of our Souls? Behold, the ſubſtance of them all put together
offers it ſelf in Godlineſs. How zealouſly ſhould we embrace them, and never
give reſt to our Souls, till we have laid up thoſe true grounds of Happineſs,
which ſhall continue with us when all our Riches and earthly Glory ſhall lye
down with us in the duſt? Alas, Noble and Chriſtian hearers, ye may be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
great, and inwardly miſerable: it was a great <hi>Caeſar</hi> that ſaid, <hi>I have
been all things, and am never the better.</hi> It is not your Bags, ye wealthy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
that can keep the Gout from your joints, or Care from your hearts: It
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> is not a Coronet, ye great Peers, that can keep your heads from aching; all
this earthly pomp and magnificence cannot keep out either death or conſcience.
Our Proſperity preſents us as goodly Lilies, which whiles they are whole look
fair and ſmell ſweet, but if once bruiſed a little as naſty both in ſight and ſent.
It is only Godlineſs that can hold up our heads in the evil day, that can bid
us make a mock at all the bluſtering ſtorms of the world, that can protect us
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:44233:156"/>
from all miſeries, (which if they kill, yet they cannot hurt us) that can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
our ſufferings, and inveſt us with true and eternal Glory. O then be
covetous, be ambitious of this bleſſed eſtate of the Soul: and as <hi>Simon Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabaeus</hi>
with three yeares labour took down the top of mount <hi>Acra</hi> in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
that no hill might ſtand in competition of height with the Temple of God;
ſo let us humble and proſtrate all other deſires to this one, that true Godlineſs
may have the ſway in us.</p>
               <p>Neither is this conſideration more fit to be a whetſtone to our zeal, then a
touchſtone to our condition. Godlineſs? why, it is an herb that grows in
every ſoil. As <hi>Platina</hi> obſerves that for 900 yeares and upwards, none of thoſe
Popes to whom Sanctity is aſcribed in the abſtract, were yet held Saints after <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
their death, except <hi>Celeſtine</hi> the 5, which gave up the Pontifical Chair after
ſix Moneths weary ſitting in it: ſo on the contrary, we may live Ages ere we
heare a man profeſs himſelf God-leſs, whiles he is abominably ſuch. He is
too bad that will not be thought Godly; as it is a brazen-fac'd Curtezan that
would not be held honeſt.</p>
               <p>That which <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſaid of the Heathen Philoſophers, that they had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Scholars, few followers, I cannot ſay of the Divine; we have enough to
learn, enough to imitate, but few to act. Be not deceived, Godlineſs is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent;
whereever Godlineſs is there is power. Hath it then prevailed to
open our eyes, to <hi>ſee</hi> the great <hi>things of our peace?</hi> hath it raiſed us up from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
the grave of our ſins, ejected our helliſh corruptions, changed our wicked
natures, new created our hearts? well may we applaud our ſelves in the
confidence of our Godlineſs. But if we be ſtill old, ſtill corrupt, ſtill blind,
ſtill dead, ſtill deviliſh; away, vain Hypocrites, ye have nothing to doe with
Godlineſs, becauſe Godlineſs hath had no power on you. Are ye godly, that
care to know any thing rather then God and ſpiritual things? Are ye godly,
that have neither ability nor will to ſerve that God whom ye faſhionably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to know? Are ye godly, which have no inward awe of that God whom ye
pretend to ſerve, no government of your Paſſions, no Conſcience of your Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
no care of your Lives? Falſe Hypocrites! ye do but abuſe and profane that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
name which ye unjuſtly arrogate. No, no; Godlineſs can no more be without
power then the God that works it. Shew me your Godlineſs in the true fervor
of your Devotions, in the effectual ſanctification of your hearts and tongues,
in the conſcionable carriage of your lives; elſe <hi>to the wicked ſaith God, what
haſt thou to doe to take my Covenant in thy mouth, ſeeing thou hateſt to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med?</hi>
Pſal. 50. 16.</p>
               <p>Ye have heard <hi>the power of Godlineſs;</hi> hear now <hi>the denial of</hi> this <hi>power.</hi>
How then is it denied? Surely there is a verbal, there is a real denial; <hi>&amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
&amp; verbis,</hi> as <hi>Hilary.</hi> It is a miſtaking of Logicians, that Negation is the
affection of a Propoſition onely: No; God and Divinity find it more in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
practice. This very <hi>power</hi> is as ſtoutly challenged by ſome men in words, as true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
denyed in actions. As one ſayes of the Phariſees anſwer concerning <hi>John</hi>'s
Calling,<note place="margin">They told truth, and yet lyed.</note> 
                  <hi>verum dicebant, &amp; mentiebantur;</hi> ſo may I of theſe men. It is not in
the power of words to deny ſo ſtrongly as deeds can: both the hand and the
tongue interpret the heart, but the hand ſo much more lively, as there is more
ſubſtance in acts then ſounds. As he ſaid, <hi>Spectamur agendo;</hi> we are both ſeen
and heard in our actions. He that ſayes there is no God, is a vocal Atheiſt; he
that lives as if there were no God, is a vital Atheiſt: he that ſhould ſay Godlineſs
hath no power, is a verbal Atheiſt; he that ſhall live as if Godlineſs had
no power, is a real Atheiſt: they are Atheiſts both. We would fly upon a man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
that ſhould deny a God with <hi>Diagoras,</hi> though (as <hi>Anſelm</hi> well) no man can do
this <hi>interius, from within;</hi> we would burn a man that ſhould deny the Deity
of Chriſt with <hi>Arrius;</hi> we would rend our cloths at the blaſphemy of that
man who, with the <hi>Epicures</hi> and <hi>Apelleians,</hi> ſhould exempt the cares and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of God from the things below; we would ſpit at a man that durſt ſay,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:44233:156"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> There is no <hi>power</hi> in <hi>Godlineſs.</hi> Theſe monſters (if there be ſuch) hide their ugly
heads, and find it not ſafe to look on the light. Faggots are the beſt language to
ſuch miſcreants. But theſe reall denials are ſo much more rife and bold, as they
can take the advantage of their outward ſafety and unconvincibleneſs.</p>
               <p>Their words are honey, their life poiſon, as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaid of his <hi>Arnoldus.</hi> And
theſe actions make too much noiſe in the world. That which S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>
ſaies of the Laſt day, that mens works ſhall ſpeak, their tongues ſhall be ſilent;
is partly true in the mean time; their works crie out, whiles their tongues
whiſper. There is then really a double <hi>deniall of the power of Godlineſs;</hi> the one
in not doing the good it requires, the other in doing the evil it forbids: the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> one a privative, the other a poſitive deniall.</p>
               <p>In the former, what power hath Godlineſs if it have not made us good? A
feeble Godlineſs it is that is ineffectual: If it have not wrought us to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
to God, juſt to men, ſober and temperate in the uſe of God's creatures,
humble in our ſelves, charitable to others, where is the Godlineſs? where is
the power? If theſe were not apparently done, there were no form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
if theſe be not ſoundly and heartily done, there is a palpable <hi>deniall</hi> of
<hi>the power of Godlineſs.</hi> Hear this then, ye ignorant and ſeduced ſouls, that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
your Devotions by number, not by weight; or that leaning upon your
idle elbow, yawningly patter out thoſe Prayers whoſe ſound or ſenſe ye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not; ye that bring liſtleſſe ears ſevered from your wandring hearts
to the Meſſages ſent from Heaven; ye that come to God's boord as a ſurfeited
ſtomack to an Hony-comb, or a ſick ſtomack to a Potion; ſhortly, ye that
pray without feeling, hear without care, receive without appetite: ye <hi>have a
form of Godlineſs, but deny the power of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hear this, ye that wear out the floor of God's houſe with your frequent
attendance; ye that have your ears open to God's Meſſengers, and yet ſhut to
the cries of the Poor, of the Orphan, of the Labourer, of the diſtreſſed Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
ye that can lift up thoſe hands to Heaven in your faſhionable Prayers,
which ye have not reached out to the relief of the needy members of your
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Saviour; (whiles I muſt tell you by the way that hard rule of <hi>Laurentius, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis
delinquit dives non largiendo ſuperflua, quàm pauper rapiendo neceſſaria, The
rich man offends more in not giving his ſuperfluities, then the poor man in ſtealing
neceſſaries</hi>) ye that have a fluent tongue to talk unto God, but have no tongue
to ſpeak for God, or to ſpeak in the cauſe of the dumb: ye <hi>have a form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
but deny the power thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Shortly, ye that have no fear of God before your eyes, no love to Goodneſs,
no care of Obedience, no conſcience of your actions, no diligence in your
Callings; ye have <hi>denied the power of Godlineſs.</hi> This very privative deniall
ſhall, without your repentance, damn your Souls. Remember, oh remember
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that there needs no other ground of your laſt and heavieſt doom then, <hi>Ye have
not given, Ye have not viſited:</hi> But the poſitive denial is yet more irrefragable.
If very Privations and ſilence ſpeak, much more are Actions vocal. Hear this
then, ye vizors of Chriſtianity, who notwithſtanding all your civil ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
when ye are once moved, can tear Heaven with your Blaſphemies, and
bandy the dreadfull name of GOD in your impure mouths by your bloody
Oaths and Execrations; ye that dare to exerciſe your ſawcie wits in profane
ſcoffs at Religion; ye that preſume to whet your lawleſſe tongues, and lift up
your rebellious hands againſt lawfull Authority whether in Church or State;
ye that grinde faces like edge-tools, and ſpill blood like water; ye that can
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> neigh after ſtrange fleſh, and upon your voluptuous beds act the filthineſs of
<hi>Sodomitical Aretiniſmes;</hi> ye that can quaff your drunken carouſes till you have
drowned your Reaſon in a deluge of deadly Healths; ye whoſe foul hands
are belimed with Briberie, and beſineared with the price of blood; ye whoſe
Sacrilegious throats have ſwallowed down whole Churches and Hoſpitals,
whoſe maws have put over whole Pariſhes of ſold and affamiſhed Souls; ye
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:44233:157"/>
whoſe faction and turbulency in novel Opinions rends the ſeamleſſe Coat, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
conſidering that of <hi>Melanchthon,</hi> that Schiſm is no leſſe ſin then Idolatry, and
there cannot eaſily be a worſe then Idolatry; either of them both are enough
to ruine any Church under Heaven (now the God of Heaven ever keep this
Church of ours from the miſchief of them both) ye whoſe tongues trade in
Lies, whoſe very profeſſion is Fraud and cozenage; ye cruell Uſurers, falſe
Flatterers, lying and envious Detractors; in a word, ye, whoever ye are, that
goe reſolutely forward in a courſe of any known ſins, and will not be reclaimed:
ye, ye are the men that ſpit God in the face, and <hi>deny</hi> flatly <hi>the power
of Godlineſſe.</hi> Woe is me, we have enough of theſe Birds every where at home.
I appeal your eyes, your ears; would to God they would convince me of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
ſlander.</p>
               <p>But what of all this now? <hi>The power of Godlineſſe</hi> is <hi>denied</hi> by wicked men:
How then? what is their caſe? Surely inexplicably, unconceivably fearfull.
<hi>The wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all ungodlineſſe,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.
How revealed? ſay you; wherein differ they from their neighbours, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it be perhaps in better fare? no gripes in their Conſcience, no afflictions in
their life, <hi>no bands in their death: Impunitas auſum, auſus exceſſum parit,</hi> as <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,
Their impunity makes them bold, their boldneſs outragious.</hi> Alas, wretched
Souls! The world hath nothing more wofull then a Sinners welfare. It is for
ſlaughter that this Ox is fatned: <hi>Eaſe ſlayeth the ſimple, and the proſperity of fools <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
ſhall deſtroy them,</hi> Prov. 1. 32. This <hi>bracteata felicitas</hi> which they injoy here, is
but as Carpets ſpread over the mouth of Hell: For if they <hi>deny the power of
Godlineſs,</hi> the God of power ſhall be ſure to deny them; <hi>Depart from me ye wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of iniquity, I know you not.</hi> There cannot be a worſe doom then <hi>Depart
from me;</hi> that is, depart from peace, from bleſſedneſs, from life, from hope,
from poſſibility of being any other then eternally, exquiſitely miſerable. <hi>Qui
te non habet, Domine Deus, totum perdidit, He who hath not thee, O Lord God,
hath loſt all,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> truly. Dying is but departing; but this departing is the
worſt dying; dying in Soul, ever dying: ſo as if there be an <hi>Ite, depart,</hi> there
muſt needs be a <hi>maledicti, depart ye curſed;</hi> curſed that ever they were born,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
who live to die everlaſtingly: For this departure, this curſe ends in that fire
which can never, never end. Oh the deplorable condition of thoſe damned
Souls that have ſlighted <hi>the power of Godlineſs!</hi> what tears can be enough to
bewail their <hi>everlaſting burnings?</hi> what heart can bleed enough at the thought
of thoſe tortures which they can neither ſuffer, nor avoid? Hold but your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
for one minute in the weak flame of a farthing Candle, can fleſh and blood
indure it? With what horror then muſt we needs think of Body and Soul
frying endleſly in that infernal <hi>Tophet?</hi> Oh think of this ye that forget God,
and contemn Godlineſſe; with what confuſion ſhall ye look upon the frowns
of an angry God rejecting you, the ugly and mercileſſe Fiends ſnatching you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
to your torments, the flames of Hell flaſhing up to meet you? with what hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
ſhall ye feel the gnawing of your guilty Conſciences, and hear that helliſh
ſhreeking, and weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing? It is a pain to mention
theſe woes, it is more then death to feel them: <hi>Perhorreſcite minas, formidate
ſupplicia,</hi> as <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> Certainly, my beloved, if wicked ſinners did truly
apprehend an Hell, there would be more danger of their deſpair and diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then of their ſecurity. It is the Devil's policy, like a Raven, firſt to pull out
the eyes of thoſe that are dead in their ſins, that they may not ſee their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
damnation. But for us; tell me, ye that hear me this day, are ye
Chriſtians in earneſt, or are ye not? If ye be not, what doe ye here? If ye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
be, there is an hell in your Creed. Ye do not leſſe believe there is an Hell
for the godleſſe, then an Earth for men, a Firmament for Stars, an Heaven for
Saints, a God in Heaven: and if ye do thus firmly believe it, caſt but your
eyes aſide upon that fiery gulf, and ſin if ye dare. Ye love your ſelves well
enough to avoid a known pain; we know there are Stocks, and Bride-wells,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:44233:157"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and Gaols, and Dungeons, and Racks, and Gibbets for malefactors, and our
very feare keeps us innocent: were your hearts equally aſſured of thoſe Helliſh
torments, ye could not, ye durſt not continue in thoſe ſins for which they are
prepared.</p>
               <p>But what an unpleaſing and unſeaſonable ſubject am I fallen upon, to ſpeak
of Hell in a Chriſtian Court, the embleme of Heaven? Let me anſwer for my
ſelf with devout <hi>Bernard, Sic mihi contingat ſemper be are amicos terrendo ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briter,
non adulando fallaciter, Let me thus ever bleſſe my friends with wholeſome
frights, rather then with plauſible ſoothings. Sumenda ſunt amara ſalubria,</hi> ſaith
Saint <hi>Auſtin:</hi> Bitter wholſome is a ſafe receipt for a Chriſtian: and what is
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> more bitter or more wholſome then this thought? The way not to feel an
Hell, is to ſee it, to fear it. I fear we are all generally defective this way; we
do not retire our ſelves enough into the Chamber of Meditation, and think
ſadly of the things of another world. Our Self-love puts off this torment (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
our willing ſins) with <hi>David</hi>'s plague, <hi>non appropinquabit, It ſhall
not come nigh thee.</hi> If we do not make a league with Hell and Death, yet with
our ſelves againſt them. <hi>Fallit peccatum falsâ dulcedine,</hi> as Saint <hi>Auſtin, Sin
deceives us with a falſe pleaſure.</hi> The pleaſure of the world is like rhat <hi>Colchian</hi>
honey, whereof <hi>Xenophon</hi>'s ſouldiers no ſooner taſted, then they were miſerably
diſtempered; thoſe that took little were drunk, thoſe that took more were
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> mad, thoſe that took moſt were dead: thus are we either intoxicated, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated,
or kil'd out-right with this deceitfull world, that we are not ſenſible
of our juſt fears; at the beſt we are beſotted with our ſtupid ſecurity, that we
are not affected with our danger. Woe is me, the impenitent reſolved ſinner
is already faln into the mouth of Hell, and hangs there but by a ſlender twig
of his momentany life; when that hold fails, he falls down headlong into
that pit of horrour and deſolation. Oh ye my dear brethren, ſo many as love
your Souls, have mercy upon your ſelves: Call aloud out of the deeps of your
ſins to that compaſſionate Saviour, that he will give you the hand of Faith,
to lay hold upon the hand of his <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>plenteous redemption,</hi> and pull you
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> out of that otherwiſe-irrecoverable deſtruction; elſe ye are gone, ye are gone
for ever. Two things, as <hi>Bernard</hi> borrows of Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> make a man both
good and ſafe, <hi>To repent of evil, To abſtain from evil.</hi> Would ye eſcape the
wrath of God, the fire of Hell? Oh waſh you clean, and keep you ſo. There
is no Laver for you but your own teares, and the blood of your Saviour: Bathe
your Souls in both of theſe, and be ſecure. Conſider how many are dying
now which would give a world for one hour to repent in. Oh be ye carefull
then to improve your free and quiet hours in a ſerious and hearty contrition
for your ſins: ſay to God with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Deliver me from the evilman,</hi>
that is, from my ſelf, as that Father conſtrues it. And for the ſequel, in ſtead
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of the <hi>denying the power of Godlineſſe,</hi> reſolve to deny your ſelves, to <hi>deny all
ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this
preſent world;</hi> that having felt and approved <hi>the power of Godlineſſe</hi> in the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
our eyes, in raiſing us from our ſins, in ejecting our corruptions, in
changing our lives, and creating our hearts anew, we may at the laſt feel the
happy conſummation of this power, in the full poſſeſſing of us in that eternall
Bleſſedneſſe and Glory which he hath prepared for all that love him. To the
perfect fruition whereof he bring us that hath dearly bought us, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt

BEAUTY AND UNITY
OF
THE CHURCH;
In a SERMON preached at White-hall
By J. H.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Cant. 6. 9.</bibl>
               <q>My Dove, my Undefiled is One.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>OUR laſt daies diſcourſe was (as you heard) of War and diſſipation;
this ſhall be of Love and unity. Away with all profane thoughts:
Every ſyllable in this Bridal-ſong is Divine. Who doubts that the
Bride-groom is Chriſt, the Bride his Church? the Church, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at large in all the Faithfull, or abridged in every faithfull Soul. Chriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
the Bride-groom praiſes the Bride his Church for her Beauty, for her Entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
For her Beauty, ſhe is <hi>Columba, a Dove;</hi> ſhe is <hi>perfecta, undefiled.</hi> Her
Entireneſs is praiſed by her Propriety in reſpect of him, <hi>Columba mea, my
Dove;</hi> by her Unity in reſpect of her ſelf, <hi>Una, one</hi> alone. <hi>My Dove, my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled
is but one.</hi> So as the beautifull Sincerity, the dear Propriety, the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
Unity of the whole Church in common, and of the Epitome thereof
every Regenerate Soul, is the matter of my Text, of my ſpeech. Let your
holy attention follow me, and finde your ſelves in every particular.</p>
            <p>The two firſt titles, <hi>Columba</hi> and <hi>perfecta,</hi> are in effect but one. This crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath a pleaſing Beauty, and an innocent Simplicity: <hi>Columba</hi> imports the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
one, and <hi>perfecta</hi> the other; yea, each both: for what is the Perfection which
can be attained here, but Sincerity? and what other is our honeſt Sincerity,
then thoſe gracefull proportions and colours which make us appear lovely in
the eyes of God?</p>
            <p>The <hi>undefiled</hi> then interprets the <hi>Dove,</hi> and convertibly: for therefore is
the Church undefiled, becauſe ſhe is a Dove; ſhe is, as Chriſt bade her, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>

Neither doth God look upon us with our eyes, but with his own; <hi>He

our beſt ſide with favour, whiles we ſee our worſt with rigour. Not that his

Doſt thou juſtifie the wicked? doſt thou feather the Raven with the wings

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> deck a Blackmore with white? even with the long white robes which are the
juſtifications of Saints? God forbid. Curſed be he (O Lord) that makes thy
Mercies unjuſt. No; whom thou accounteſt holy, thou makeſt ſo: whom thou
juſtifieſt, him thou ſanctifieſt. No man can be perfectly juſt in thee, who is not

each of them undefiled. It is with both, as he ſaid long ſince of Phyſicians, <hi>The

taught them to ſeek for a ſpotleſneſs above: And if their furious cenſures had
left but one man in their Church, yet that one man would have need to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
the greater half of himſelf, the Old man in his own boſome.
Our Church may too truly ſpeak of them in the voice of God, <hi>Woe to them,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for they have fled from me,</hi> Oſe 7. 13. It is not in the power of their uncharity
to make the reſt of God's Church, and ours, any other then what it is, <hi>The
Dove</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>the undefiled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Harmleſneſs follows. A quality ſo eminent in the Dove, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
hath hereupon ſingled it out for an Hieroglyphick of Simplicity. Whence
it was, queſtionleſſe, that God of all fowls choſe out this for his Sacrifice; <hi>Sin
ex aliqua volucri,</hi> Levit. 1. 14. And before the Law, <hi>Abraham</hi> was appointed no
other (<hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 9.) then a Turtle and a Pigeon: neither did the Holy Virgin of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
any other at her Purifying then this embleme of her ſelf and her bleſſed
Babe. Shortly, hence it was that a Dove was imployed for the meſſenger of the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> exſiccation of the Deluge; no fowl ſo fit to carry an Olive of peace to the
Church, which ſhe repreſented. And laſtly, in a Dove the Holy Ghoſt deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the meek Saviour of the world; whence (as <hi>Illyricus</hi> and ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
have gueſſed) the ſellers of Doves were whipt out of the Temple, as Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacal
chafferers of the Holy Ghoſt. The Church then is a Dove. Not an
envious Partridge, not a careleſſe Oſtridge, not a ſtridulous Jay, not a petulant
Sparrow, not a deluding Lapwing, not an unclean-ſed Duck, not a noiſome
Crow, not an unthankfull Swallow, not a death-boding Schrich-owl; but an
harmleſſe Dove, that fowl in which alone envy it ſelf can finde nothing to
tax. Hear this then, ye violent ſpirits, that think there can be no Piety that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> is not cruell; the Church is a Dove: not a Glead, not a Vultur, not a Falcon,
not an Eagle, not any bird of prey or rapine. Who ever ſaw the rough foot
of the Dove armed with griping talons? who ever ſaw the beak of the Dove
bloody? who ever ſaw that innocent bird pluming of her ſpoil, and tiring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
bones? Indeed we have ſeen the Church crimſon-ſuited, like her celeſtial

Faction with knives in their hands, ſtained with maſſacres; with firebrands in
their hands, ready to kindle the unjuſt ſtakes, yea woods of Martyrdome; with
piſtols and poniards in their hands, ambitiouſly affecting a canonization by the
death of God's Anointed; with matches in their hands, ready to give fire unto
that powder which ſhall blow up King, Prince, State, Church; with thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts
of cenſures, ready to ſtrike down into Hell whoſoever refuſes to receive
novell opinions into the Articles of Faith? If ye finde theſe diſpoſitions and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
actions Dove-like, applaud them, as beſeeming the true Spouſe of Chriſt, who
is ever like her ſelf, <hi>Columba perfecta,</hi> yea, <hi>perfecta columba,</hi> a true Dove for
her quiet Innocence. For us, let our Dove-ſhip approve it ſelf in meekneſs of
Suffering, not in actions of Cruelty. We may, we muſt delight in blood; but

            </p>
            <p>From the Propriety, turn your eyes to the beſt of her Properties, Unity.
Let me leave Arithmeticians diſputing whether Unity be a number. I am ſure,
it is both the beginning of all numbring numbers, and the beginning and end
of all numbers numbred. All Perfection riſes hence, and runs hither; and every
thing the nearer it comes to perfection, gathers up it ſelf the more towards
Unity; as all the virtue of the Loadſtone is recollected into one point. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah
our God is one; from him there is but one World, one Heaven in that
world, one Sun in that Heaven, one uniform face of all that glorious Vault:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the nature of the holy Angels is one and ſimple as creatures can be: the head of
Angels and Saints, one Saviour; whoſe bleſſed Humanity if it carry ſome ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of compoſition, yet it is anſwered by a threefold Union of one and the
ſame Subject, a double union of the Deity with the Humanity, a third union of
the Humanity in it ſelf. So that as in the Deity there is one Eſſence and three
Perſons; in Chriſt is one Perſon, and three Eſſences united into that one. If
from Heaven we look to earth, from God to men; we have but one Earth, one
Church in that earth, one King in that Church, and (for us) one Deputy of
that King, one Scepter, one Law of both; <hi>one Baptiſm one Faith; Cor unum,
viam unam:</hi> and all theſe make up <hi>Columbam unam, one Dove.</hi> It would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be no unneceſſary excurſion to take hereupon occaſion to diſcourſe of the
perfecteſt form of Church-government, and to diſpute the caſe of that long
and buſie competition betwixt Monarchy and Ariſtocracy. Ingenuous <hi>Richier,</hi>
the late eye-ſore of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> hath made (methinks) an equal arbitration,
That the State is Monarchical, the Regiment Ariſtocratical. The State ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
Monarchical in Chriſt, diſpenſatively Monarchical in reſpect of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Churches; foraſmuch as that power which is inherent in the Church,
is diſpenſed and executed by ſome prime Miniſters, like as the faculty of See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given to the man, is exerciſed by the Eye, which is given for this uſe to
man. And if, for the Ariſtocratical Regiment, there be in the native Senate
of the Church (which is a General Council) a power to enact Canons for the
wielding of this great body, (as more eyes ſee more then one) yet how can this
conſiſt without Unity? <hi>Concilium</hi> is not ſo much a <hi>concalando,</hi> as <hi>Calepine</hi>
hath miſtaken, as a <hi>conciliando,</hi> or, as <hi>Iſidore, à ciliis oculorum,</hi> which ever
move together. In this Ariſtocracy there is an Unity; for, as that old word
was long ſince, <hi>Epiſcopatus unus eſt, cujus à ſingulis in ſolidum pars tcnetur.</hi> In a
word, no Regiment, no State can have any form, but deformity, without Unity.</p>
            <p>Neither is there more Perfection then Strength in Unity. Large bodies, if of
a ſtronger compoſition, yet becauſe the ſpirits are diffuſed, have not that vigor
and activity which a well-knit body hath in a more ſlender frame. The praiſe
of the invincible ſtrength of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was not ſo much in the natural walls,
the hills round about it, as in the mutual compactedneſſe within it ſelf. And
<hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, it is the twiſted Cord that is not eaſily broken. The Rule of
<hi>Vegetius</hi> that he gives for his beſt ſtratagem is, (that which our <hi>Jeſuites</hi> know
too well) to ſet ſtrife where we deſire ruine. Our Saviour ſaies that of every
City which one ſaid anciently of <hi>Carthage,</hi> That diviſion was the beſt engine to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:44233:160"/>
batter it. <hi>A City divided cannot ſtand.</hi> On the contrary, of every happy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
Church, of every firm State is that verified which God ſpeaks in the whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde
of <hi>Leviathan</hi>'s ſcales, <hi>una uni conjungitur; one is joyned to another, that
the winde cannot paſſe between them: they ſtick together that they cannot be ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi>
Job 41. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>That there is Perfection and Strength in Unity cannot be doubted; but how
agrees this Unity to Chriſt's Dove, his Church? It ſhall be thus abſolutely <hi>in
patria,</hi> at home; but how is it <hi>in via,</hi> in the paſſage? Even here it is One too:
not divided, not multiplied. To begin with the former. It hath been a ſtale
quarrel that hath been raiſed from the diviſions of the Chriſtian world, worn
thredbare even by the pens and tongues of <hi>Porphyrie, Libanius, Celſus, Julian:</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
and after them <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperour was puzzled with it, till <hi>Themiſtius,</hi> that
memorable Chriſtian Philoſopher, in a notable Oration of his convinced this
idle cavil, telling the Emperour, <q>He ſhould not wonder at the diſſenſions of
Chriſtians; that theſe were nothing in compariſon of the differences of the
Gentile Philoſophers, which had above three hundred ſeverall Opinions in
agitation at once; and that God meant by this variety of judgments to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
his own Glory, that every man might learn ſo much more to adore his
Majeſty, by how much harder it is rightly to apprehend him.</q> The juſtice of
this exception hath been confeſſed and bewailed of old by the antient Fathers:
St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſhall ſpeak for all; <hi>Deridiculo facti ſumus &amp; Gentibus &amp; Judaeis,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
dum Eccleſia in mille partes ſcinditur, We are made a ſcorn to Jews and Gentiles</hi>

that ſtumble at theſe contentions, know the weight of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Oportet, There

Hath he not ſet contrary motions in the very Heavens? Are not the Elements
(the main ſtuffe of the world) contrary to each other in their forms and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
Hath he not made the natural Day to conſiſt of light and darkneſſe? the
Year of ſeaſons contrarily tempered? yea all things (according to the gueſſe of

darkneſſe, or upbraid the fair beauty of the Year with ice-icles and wrinkles? or
condemn that reall Friendſhip that ariſes from debate? If the wiſe and holy
Moderator of all things did not know how by theſe fires of contradiction to trie
men, and to purifie his Truth, and to glorifie himſelf, how eaſie were it for him
to quench them, and confound their Authors?</p>
            <p>Can they commend it in a wiſe <hi>Scipio,</hi> that he would not have <hi>Carthage</hi>
(though their greateſt enemy) deſtroied, <hi>ut timore libido premeretur, libido preſſa

and ſhall not the moſt wiſe God have leave to permit an exerciſe to keep his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
children in breath, that they be not ſtuft up with the foggy unſound humors
of the world? When theſe preſuming fools have ſtumbled, and faln into the

            <p>But yet when all is done, in ſpight of all diſſentions, the Church is <hi>Columba
una, one Dove.</hi> The word is not more common then equivocal: whether ye
conſider it as the aggregation of the outward, viſible, particular Churches of
Chriſtian profeſſors, or as the inward, ſecret, univerſal company of the Elect, it
is ſtill One. To begin with the former. What is it here below that makes the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
Church one? <hi>one Lord, One Faith, One Baptiſm. One Lord,</hi> ſo it is one in the
Head; <hi>One Faith,</hi> ſo it is one in the Heart; <hi>One Baptiſm,</hi> ſo it is one in the Face.
Where theſe are truly profeſſed to be, though there may be differences of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations
and ceremonies, though there may be differences in opinions, yet
there is <hi>Columba una:</hi> all thoſe are but diverſly-coloured feathers of the ſame
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:44233:160"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Dove. What Church therefore hath one Lord, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, one
Faith in that Lord, one Baptiſm into that Faith, it is the One Dove of Chriſt.
To ſpeak more ſhort, one Faith abridges all. But what is that one Faith? what
but the main fundamental Doctrine of Religion neceſſary to be known, to be
believed unto Salvation? It is a golden and uſefull diſtinction that we muſt take
with us, betwixt Chriſtian Articles and Theological Concluſions. Chriſtian
Articles are the Principles of Religion neceſſary to a Believer; Theological
Concluſions are School-points, fit for the diſcourſe of a Divine. Thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
are few and eſſential; theſe Concluſions are many, and unimporting (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
neceſſity) to Salvation either way. That Church then which holds thoſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Chriſtian Articles both in terms and neceſſary conſequences (as every viſible
Church of Chriſt doth) however it vary in theſe Theological Concluſions, is
<hi>Columba una.</hi> Were there not much latitude in this Faith, how ſhould we fetch
in the antient Jewiſh Church to the unity of the Chriſtian? Theirs and ours
is but one Dove, though the feathers, according to the colour of that fowl, be
changeable. It is a fearfull account then that ſhall once be given before the
dreadfull Tribunal of the Son of God, the only Husband of this one Church, by
thoſe men who, not like the children of faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> divide the Dove,
multiplying Articles of Faith according to their own fancies, and caſting out of
the boſome of the Church thoſe Chriſtians that differ from their either falſe or
unneceſſary concluſions. Thus have our great Lords of the Seven hills dared
to doe, whoſe faction hath both devoured their Charity and ſcorned ours, to
the great prejudice of the Chriſtian world, to the irreparable damage of the
glorious Goſpel of our Lord <hi>Jeſus.</hi> The God of Heaven judge in this great
caſe betwixt them and us; us, who firmly holding the foundation of Chriſtian
Religion in all things according to the antient, Catholick, Apoſtolick Faith,
are rejected, cenſured, condemned, accurſed, killed, for refuſing their gainfull
Novelties. In the mean time we can but lament their fury no leſſe then their

            <p>From them, to ſpeak to our ſelves, who have happily reformed thoſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours

Conſubſtantiation; another, I am <hi>Calvin</hi>'s for Diſcipline; another, I am <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi>'s
for Predeſtination; another, I am <hi>Barrow</hi>'s or <hi>Brown</hi>'s for Separation.
What frenzy poſſeſſes the brains of Chriſtians thus to ſquander themſelves into
Factions? It is indeed an envious cavil of our common adverſaries, to make
theſe ſo many Religions. No; every branch of different Opinion doth not
conſtitute a ſeveral Religion: were this true, I durſt boldly ſay, old <hi>Rome</hi> had
not more Deities then the modern <hi>Rome</hi> hath Religions. Theſe things, though
they do not vary Religions and Churches, yet they trouble the quiet unity of
the Church. Brethren, ſince our Religion is one, why are not our tongues one?
why do we not bite in our ſingular conceits, and binde our tongues to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Peace? But if from particular viſible Churches (which perhaps you may
conſtrue to be the threeſcore Queens here ſpoken of) you ſhall turn your eyes
to the true, inward, univerſal company of Gods Elect and ſecret ones, there
ſhall you more perfectly finde <hi>Columbam unam, one Dove:</hi> for what the other
is in profeſſion, this is in truth; that <hi>one Baptiſm</hi> is here the true <hi>Laver of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation;</hi>
that <hi>one Faith</hi> is a ſaving repoſal upon Chriſt; that <hi>one Lord</hi> is
the Saviour of his Body. No natural body is more one then this myſtical: one
Head rules it, one Spirit animates it, one ſet of joynts moves it, one Food nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
it, one Robe covers it. So it is one in it ſelf, ſo one with Chriſt, as Chriſt
is one with the Father; <hi>That they may be one, even as we are one; I in them, and
thou in me,</hi> John 17. 22. Oh bleſſed Unity of the Saints of God, which none of
the makebates of Hell can ever be able to diſſolve!</p>
            <p>And now, ſince we are thus and every other way one, why are we not united
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:44233:161"/>
in Love? why do we in our ordinary converſation ſuffer ſlight weakneſſes to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
ſet off our Charity? <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> was a cripple; yet the perfect love of <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
either cures or covers his impotency. We can no more want infirmities,
then not be men; we cannot ſtick at infirmities if we be Chriſtians. It is but a
poor love that cannot paſſe over ſmall faults; even <hi>quotidianae incurſionis,</hi> as
that Father ſpeaks. It is an injurious niceneſs to condemn a good Face in each
other for a little mole. Brethren, let us not aggravate, but pity each others
weakneſſes; and ſince we are but one Body, let us have but one Heart, one
Way: And if we be the Dove of Chriſt, and his Dove is one, oh let us be ſo
one with each other as he is one with us.</p>
            <p>And as the Church and Commonwealth are twins, ſo ſhould this be no leſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
one with it ſelf and with her temporal head. <hi>Diviſum eſt cor eorum, Their heart is
divided,</hi> was the judgment upon <hi>Iſrael, oſe</hi> 10. 2. Oh how is every good heart di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
in ſunder with the grief for the late diviſions of our <hi>Reuben?</hi> We do not
mourn, we bleed inwardly for this diſtraction. But I do willingly ſmother theſe
thoughts; yea my juſt ſorrow choaks them in my boſome, that they cannot come
forth but in ſighs and groans. O thou that art the God of peace, unite all hearts
in Love to each other, in loyal Subjection to their Soveraign Head. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Church is one in not being divided; ſo ſhe is but one in not being
multiplied. Here is <hi>unus, uni, unam,</hi> as the old word is. He, the true Husband
of the Church, who made and gave but one <hi>Eve</hi> to the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> will take <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
but one wife to himſelf, the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> There are many particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
all theſe make up but one univerſal: as many diſtinct lims make up but
one intire body, many grains one bach, many drops and ſtreams one Ocean.</p>
            <p>So many Regions as there are under Heaven that do truly profeſſe the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
name, ſo many National Churches there are; in all thoſe Nations there
are many Provincial, in all thoſe Provinces many Dioceſan, in all thoſe Dioceſes
many Parochial Churches, in all thoſe Pariſhes many Chriſtian Families, in all
thoſe Families many Chriſtian Souls: now all thoſe Souls, Families, Pariſhes,
Dioceſes, Provinces, Nations make up but one Catholick Church of Chriſt
upon earth. The God of the Church cannot abide either Conventicles of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
or pluralities of profeſſions, or appropriations of Catholiciſm. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<hi>Romane</hi> is an abſurd <hi>Donatian</hi> Soleciſm: This is to ſeek <hi>Orbem in urbe,</hi>
as that Council ſaid well. Happy were it for that Church; if it were a ſound
lim (though but the little toe) of that mighty and precious body, wherein
no believing Jew or <hi>Indian</hi> may not challenge to be jointed. Neither difference
of time, nor diſtance of place, nor rigor of unjuſt cenſure, nor any uneſſential
errour can barre our intereſt in this bleſſed Unity. As this flouriſhing Church
of great <hi>Britain</hi> (after all the ſpightfull calumniations of malicious men) is
one of the moſt conſpicuous members of the Catholick upon earth; ſo we in her
Communion do make up one body with the holy Patriarchs, Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
Martyrs, Confeſſors and faithfull Chriſtians of all ages and times. We
ſucceed in their Faith, we glory in their Succeſſion, we triumph in this Glory.
Whither go ye then, ye weak, ignorant, ſeduced ſouls, that run to ſeek this Dove
in a forein cote? She is here, if ſhe have any neſt under Heaven. Let me never
have part in her or in Heaven, if any Church in the world have more part in the
Univerſal. Why do we wrong our ſelves with the contradiſtinction of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
and Catholick? We do only proteſt this, that we are perfect Catholicks.
Let the pretenſed look to themſelves; we are ſure we are as Catholick as true
Faith can make us; as much one as the ſame Catholick Faith can make us:
and in this undoubted right we claim and injoy the ſweet and inſeparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
with all the bleſſed members of that myſtical body, both in earth and
Heaven; and by virtue thereof, with the glorious Head of that dear and happy
body, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, the Husband to this one Wife, the Mate to
this one Dove: to whom, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, three Perſons
and one God, be given all Praiſe, Honour and Glory, now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <q>Faſhion not your ſelves like to this World; but be ye changed by the renewing of
your minde, &amp;c.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THAT which was wont to be upbraided as a ſcorn to the Engliſh, may
be here conceived the Embleme of a Man; whom ye may imagine
ſtanding naked before you with a paire of ſheers in his hand ready to
cut out his own faſhion. In this deliberation, the World offers it
ſelf to him with many a gay, misſhapen, fantaſticall dreſſe: God offers himſelf
to him with one onely faſhion, but a new one, but a good one. The Apoſtle
(like a friendly monitor) adviſeth him where to pitch his choice; <hi>Faſhion not
your ſelves like to this world; but be ye changed by the renewing of your minde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How much Chriſtianity croſſes Nature, we need no other proof then my
Text. There is nothing that Nature affects ſo much as the Faſhion, and no
faſhion ſo much as the worlds; for our uſuall word is, <hi>Doe as the moſt.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
that is it which is here forbidden us, <hi>Faſhion not your ſelves like to this
world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All faſhions are either in Device, or Imitation. There are vain heads that
think it an honour to be the founders of Faſhions: there are ſervile fools that
ſeek onely to follow the Faſhion once deviſed. In the firſt rank is the World,
which is nothing but a mint of Faſhions; yet (which is ſtrange) all as old as
miſ-beſeeming. We are forbidden to be in the ſecond: If the World will be ſo
vain as to miſ-ſhape it ſelf, we may not be ſo fooliſh as to follow it.</p>
            <p>Let us look a little (if you pleaſe) at the Pattern here damn'd in my Text,
<hi>The world.</hi> As in extent, ſo in expreſſion the World hath a large ſcope; yea
there are more Worlds then one. There is a world of creatures, and within
that there is a world of men, and yet within that a world of believers, and yet
within all theſe a world of corruptions. More plainly, there is a good world, an
evil world, an indifferent. A good world, as of the creatures in regard of their
firſt birth, ſo of men in regard of their ſecond, a world of renewed Souls; in the
firſt act of their renovation believing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 20. upon their belief reconciled,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. upon their reconcilement ſaved, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
            <p>An evil world, yea ſet in evil, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 19. a world of corrupt unregenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that hates Chriſt and his, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 18. that is hated of Chriſt, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
            <p>An indifferent world, that is good or evil as it is uſed; whereof St. <hi>Paul,
Let thoſe that uſe the world be as not abuſing it,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 31. This indifferent
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:44233:162"/>
world is a world of commodities, affections, improvement of the creature; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
which (if we will be wiſe Chriſtians) we muſt faſhion to us, framing it to our
own bent, whether in want or abundance.</p>
            <p>The good world is a world of Saints, whoſe <hi>Souls are purified in obeying the
truth through the Spirit,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 22. To this world we may be faſhioned. The
evil world is a world of mere men and their vicious conditions. God hath made
us the lords of the indifferent world; himſelf is the Lord of the good; Satan
is lord of the evil, <hi>Princeps hujus Seculi.</hi> And that is moſt properly the world,
becauſe it contains the moſt, as it is but a chaffe-heap wherein ſome grains of
wheat are ſcattered. To this evil world then we may not faſhion our ſelves in
thoſe things which are proper to it as ſuch: in natural, in civil actions we may,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
we muſt follow the world; ſingularity in theſe things is juſtly odious; herein the
World is the true maſter of Ceremonies, whom not to follow is no better
then a Cynicall irregularity: in things poſitively or morally evil we may not.</p>
            <p>There is no material thing that hath not his form; the outward form is
the faſhion; the faſhion of outward things is variable with the times; ſo as
every external thing, cloaths, building, plate, ſtuffe, geſture is now in, now
out of faſhion: but the faſhions of Morality, whether in good or evil, are fixed
and perpetual. <hi>The world paſſeth and the faſhion of it;</hi> but the evil of the faſhions
of the world is too conſtant and permanent, and muſt be ever the matter of our
deteſtation, <hi>Faſhion not your ſelves like to this world.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe evils are infinite, as wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> hath obſerved; it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to call them to their heads, and to reduce theſe forbidden faſhions to
the ſeveral parts whereto they belong. I cannot dream with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that
the Soul hath a Body; but I may well ſay that the Soul follows the body; and
as it hath parts aſcribed to it according to the outward proportion, ſo are theſe
parts ſuited with ſeverall faſhions. Let your patient attention follow me through
them all.</p>
            <p>Begin with the Head, a part not more eminent in place then in power. What
is the head-tire of the world? Surely, as outwardly we ſee in this Caſtle of the
Body the flag of vanity hang'd out moſt conſpicuouſly in feathers, perukes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
wires, locks, frizzles, powders, and ſuch other traſh; ſo the inward diſguiſe of
this part is no leſſe certain, no leſſe obvious to wiſe and holy eyes. And what
is that but fancies, miſ-opinions, miſ-judgment? all, whether vain thoughts,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 11. or evil thoughts, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 59. 7. To this head refer novelties of device,
Hereſies, capricious, ſuperſtitious conceits, whereof the inſtances would have
no end. And theſe errors of the Minde are either in falſe Principles or falſe
Concluſions: and both whether in matter of Speculation or Practice.</p>
            <p>It is a world to ſee what falſe Maximes the world laies down to it ſelf; all
which are as ſo many grounds of diſguiſes of this great and graceleſſe head. I
do not tell you that <hi>the fool hath ſaid, there is no God;</hi> or, hath pent up that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
God in the circle of the Heavens; or whatever other imagination the very
impudence of the world is aſhamed to juſtifie, (as even in outward Pride there
are certain <hi>pudenda myſteria,</hi> which vain Dames uſe, but hide:) I ſpeak of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and current Axioms, which the world takes for granted, and fears not
to aver; ſuch as theſe, We muſt doe according to cuſtome; If it be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
an ill weed wel rooted, we may not pull it up; Wrongs may not be
offered, they may be returned; There can be no better Juſtice then retaliation;
The Lye muſt be anſwered with a blow, the Challenge with a combat; Our
Honour muſt be tendred, whatever becomes of our Soul; Reaſon muſt be
done in drinking, though without reaſon; We may lye for an advantage; We <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
may ſwear upon provocation; We may make the beſt of our own; Each man
for himſelf; Youth muſt have a ſwindge; It is good ſleeping in a whole skin;
Religion muſt be tuned to reaſons of State; and a thouſand of this kind. And
from theſe falſe Premiſſes are raiſed pernicious Concluſions of reſolution to the
Soul. What ſhould I ſpeak of profane and wilde thoughts, of ſenſuall and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:44233:162"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> beaſtly thoughts, of cruell and bloody thoughts? Theſe are the faſhions of the
world whereto we may not faſhion our ſelves, remembring that of wiſe <hi>Solomon,
The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 15. 26. Theſe
dreſſes, perhaps, ſeem not uncomely to carnall eyes; but God tells us how he
likes them: they are as naught as old; he ſpits at them in a juſt deteſtation,
and will ſpit at us for them. Say not now therefore, Thought is free: No;
it is ſo farre from that, as that it may be unpardonable, as <hi>Simon Peter</hi> intimates
to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Acts 8. 22. Away then with all the falſe poſitions and miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions,
all the fantaſticall or wicked thoughts of the world: It is <hi>filthy, let it
be filthy ſtill. Let not us faſhion our Heads like unto the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Now not onely the whole Head in common, but every part, every power of
ſenſe in this Head, hath a faſhion of its own, that we muſt not follow in the
world. Look firſt at the Eyes. The Eyes of the world have a four-fold evil caſt
that we may not imitate; the adulterous, the covetous, the proud, the envious.
The adulterous roves and looks round about, the covetous looks downward,
the proud looks a oft, the envious looks aſquint.</p>
            <p>The firſt are <hi>eyes full of Adulteries,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 14. every glance whereof is an
act of beaſtlineſſe: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 28. the very
ſight is a kind of conſtupration. The ſame word in the Greek (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) ſignifies
both <hi>the apple of the eye</hi> and <hi>a virgin:</hi> I may not now diſcuſſe the reaſon. Sure
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> I am, many an eye proves a bawd to the Soul; and I may ſafely ſay, Virginity
is firſt loſt in the eye.</p>
            <p>The ancient Philoſophers before <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that held the Sight to be by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
out of beams, imagined the Eye to be of a fiery nature; wherein they
were the rather confirmed, for that they found, that if the Eye take a blow, fire
ſeems to ſparkle out of it. But certainly how wateriſh ſoever better experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
hath found the ſubſtance of the Eye, it is ſpiritually fiery; fiery both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
and paſſively. Paſſively, ſo as that it is inflamed by every wanton
beame; actively, ſo as that it ſets the whole heart on fire with the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
flames of concupiſcence. What ſhould a Chriſtian doe with a burning-glaſſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in his head, that unites pernicious beams for the firing of the heart?
I mean, a beaſtly and fornicating eye (<hi>Ezec.</hi> 6. 9.) Out with it, if it thus offend
thee, as thou lookſt to eſcape the fire of hell. For this flame, like that unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
one of <hi>Sodome,</hi> ſhall burn downward, and never leave till it come to the
bottome of that infernall <hi>Tophet.</hi> Make covenants with your eyes, O ye Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
as <hi>Job</hi> did; and when ye have done, hold them cloſe to your covenants
once made: and if they will needs wilfully break, take the forfeit to the utmoſt.
How much better were it for a man to be blind, then to ſee his own damnation?
Thus faſhion not your eye to the Uncleanneſſe of the world.</p>
            <p>The Covetous follows. Even this is a <hi>luſt of the eye</hi> too, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Libido
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> aeris,</hi> as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> calls it. As the eye in its own nature is covetous, in that it <hi>is
not ſatisfied with ſeeing,</hi> Eccleſ. 1. 8. ſo the eye of the covetous hath a more
particular inſatiableneſſe. <hi>Non ſatiatur oculus divitiis, The eye is not ſatisfied
with riches,</hi> Eccleſ. 4. 8. And yet theſe riches can goe no further then his eye;
the owner hath nothing but their ſight, 5. 11. Hence wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> parallels
Hell and deſtruction with the eye; neither are ſatisfiable, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 20. He that
is a true glutton of the world, may fill his belly, his eye never. For it is in theſe
deſires as in Drunkenneſſe, his drought increaſeth with his draughts, and the
more he hath the leſſe he thinks he hath, and the more he would have. This
diſeaſe is popular and, as the Prophet tells us, <hi>à minimo ad maximum, Jer.</hi> 6. 13.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> The world could not be ſo wicked, if it had not this caſt of the eye; for this
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>love of money, is the root of all evil,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 10. From hence come
Simonies in the Spiritualty, Sacriledge in the Laity, immoderate fees in Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
unreaſonable prices in Merchants, exactions in Officers, oppreſſions in
Landlords, incroachments in neighbourhood, falſhood in ſervants, and laſtly
cozenages in all ſorts. But, <hi>woe to him that increaſeth that which is not his, and to
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:44233:163"/>
him that ladeth himſelf with thick clay,</hi> ſaith <hi>Abacuc</hi> 2. 6. Was there ever a more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
perfect conviction of a vice? This deſired metall is <hi>not his,</hi> firſt; and then if it
were his, it is but <hi>denſiſsimum lutum, thick clay;</hi> it may load him, it cannot eaſe
him. Away therefore with thoſe <hi>two</hi> greedy <hi>daughters</hi> of the <hi>Horſeleach, that cry
ſtill, Give, give,</hi> Prov. 30. 15. Give is for Chriſtians; but Give, give, is for
worldlings; as it was the doubling of the ſtroke upon the Rock that offended.
If we be Chriſtians, we are richer then the world can make us. <hi>Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
food and raiment, let us be therewith content,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 8. But if thou wilt needs
inlarge thy boundleſſe deſires, take this with thee, there is ſomewhat as unſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as thine eye; <hi>The grave and hell never ſay, It is enough,</hi> Prov. 30. 16. Thus
faſhion not your eye to the Covetouſneſſe of the world.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </p>
            <p>The next is the Proud looks. <hi>There is a generation, O how lofty are their
eyes! and their eye-lids are lifted up,</hi> Prov. 30. 13. There is? nay, where is
there any other? The world is all ſuch? admiring it ſelf, ſcorning all others.
And if ever, now is that of the Prophet verified, <hi>The childe ſhall behave himſelf
proudly againſt the ancient, and the baſe againſt the honourable,</hi> Eſa. 3. 5. One prides
himſelf in his bags, another in his gay coat; one in his titles, another in his
fame; one in agility, another in skill; one in ſtrength, another in beauty:
Every one hath ſomething to look big upon. Oh fools, either ignorant, or
forgetfull of what ye are, of what ye ſhall be! goe on to wonder at your
poor miſerable glory and greatneſs: ye are but lift up for a fall: your height is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
not ſo ſure as your ruine; ruine to the duſt, yea to hell. <hi>Him that hath a proud
heart will I not ſuffer,</hi> faith God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. 5. Faſhion not your eye therefore to
the Pride of the world.</p>
            <p>The laſt is the Envious eye; by an eminence called <hi>Oculus nequam, an evil
eye. Is thine eye evil, becauſe I am good?</hi> ſaith the Houſholder, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 15. As
if Envy had ingroſſed all malignity. into her own hands. This caſt of the eye the
World learned of the Devil, who, when himſelf was fallen, could not abide
that man ſhould ſtand. Far be it from us to learn it of the World. As happy is,
this vice is executioner enough to it ſelf: <hi>Putredo oſsium invidentia, Envy is
the rotting of the bones,</hi> Prov. 14. 30. And where other earthly torments die <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
with men, this follows them into Hell, and ſhall there torture them eternally.
<hi>The wicked ſhall ſee it, and ſhall be grieved, (&amp; frendens contabeſcet,) and ſhall

            <p>We have done with the Eye in the Uncleanneſs, Covetouſneſs, Pride, Envy

that can boldly bear out a ſin committed, either out-facing the fact, as <hi>Gehezi,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
or the fault, as <hi>Saul.</hi> This is the faſhion of the world, by lyes, imprecations,
perjuries to outbrave the moſt juſt reproof; <hi>A wicked man hardneth his face,</hi>
Prov. 21. 29. This faſhion is not for us Chriſtians. If we cannot be guiltleſſe,
we cannot be ſhameleſſe: at leaſt we can bluſh at our ſins. The dye of our
Repentance ſtrives with the crimſon of our Offence; and we can out of the true
remorſe of our Souls ſay with the Prophet, <hi>We lie down in our ſhame; and our
confuſion covereth us; for we have ſinned againſt the Lord our God,</hi> Jer. 3. 25.
Thus, faſhion not your Forehead to the Impudence of the world.</p>
            <p>We paſſe to the Eare; wherein there is a double faſhion to be avoided. Firſt,
there is a Deaf eare, ſhut up againſt all inſtruction, like the Adder's againſt the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
charm, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58. 5. How ſhut up? A filme or fore-skin is grown over it, which
hinders the way of the voice: <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Behold, their eare is uncircumciſed, and
they cannot hearken.</hi> Hence it is that we preach in vain, we labour in vain:
to what purpoſe do we tear our throats, and ſpend our lungs, and force our
ſides, in ſuing to a deaf world: <hi>Who hath believed our report, or to whom is the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:44233:163"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> If ever we will hear the voice of the Son of God
and live, we muſt therefore have our eares opened, this our fore-skin muſt be
pierced. <hi>Aurem perforaſti mihi, Thou haſt digged my eare,</hi> as the word originally
ſounds, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 6. The finger of our Omnipotent Saviour muſt doe it, and his
<hi>Ephphatha,</hi> Mar. 7. 34. Let the deaf world periſh in their infidelity and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
but for us, let us ſay with <hi>Samuel, Speak, Lord, for thy Servant heareth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, there is an Itching eare, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3. that out of a wanton curioſity
affects change of doctrine. How commonly do we ſee a kinde of Epicuriſme
in the eare? which when it hath fed well of many good diſhes, longs to ſurfeit
of a ſtrange compoſition. Yea there is an <hi>appetitus caninus,</hi> that paſſing by
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> wholſome viands, falls upon unmeet and foul-feeding morſels. We have heard
Sermons enough; Oh now for a Maſſe: We have heard our owne Divines;
Oh for a <hi>Jeſuite</hi> at a Veſpers. Oh fooliſh <hi>Iſraelites!</hi> who hath bewitched you,
that loathing the Manna of Angels, your mouth ſhould hang towards the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
garlick? God hath a medicine in ſtore for this itch, if we prevent him
not: <hi>Tinnient aures,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Jer.</hi> 19. 3. If our eares itch after ſtrange doctrine,
others ears ſhall tingle at our ſtrange Judgements. The God of Mercy prevent
it: and ſince we accurſe our ſelves if we ſpeak any other words then our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
ſay you to Chriſt ſpeaking by us, <hi>Maſter, whither ſhall we goe from thee?
thou haſt the words of eternall life.</hi> Thus faſhion not your Eare to the deafneſſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to the inconſtancy of the world.</p>
            <p>The ill faſhions of the Tongue call me to them; whereof the variety is no
leſſe infinite then of words forbidden and offenſive. The Eye and the Eare are
receivers, but the Tongue is a ſpender; and it layes out according to the
ſtore of the heart: For, <hi>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh,</hi> ſaith
our Saviour. No words can expreſſe the choice of ill words. I will limit my
ſpeech to three ill faſhions of the Tongue, Falſhood, Maliciouſneſſe, Obſcenity.</p>
            <p>1. The world hath a Falſe tongue in his head: falſe every way; in broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of errours, in ſophiſtry of their maintenance, in deceits and cozenages of
contracts, in lies, (whether aſſertory, which breed miſreports, or promiſſory,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which cauſe diſappointments) in perjuries, in equivocations, in flatteries, and
humouring of men or times. What a world of untruth offers it ſelf here to us?
Lord, whom can a man ſpeak with that he dares believe? whom dares he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that deceives him not? How is that of the Pſalm verified, <hi>Diminutae ſunt
veritates, Truth is miniſhed from the children of men?</hi> Yea, let it be from the
children of men, it is a ſhame it ſhould be thus with Chriſtians; Let us <hi>ſpeak
truth every man to his neighbour.</hi> Farre, farre be it from any of you to have a
mercenary tongue, either ſold or let out to ſpeak for injury, for oppreſſion.
Where the juſtice of the cauſe ſeems to hang in an even poiſe, there exerciſe
the power of your wit and eloquence in pleadings: but where the caſe is foul,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> abhor the Patrocination; diſcourage an unjuſt, though wealthy, Client, and
ſay rather, Thy gold and <hi>thy ſilver periſh with thee;</hi> reſolving that the richeſt
fee is a good conſcience; and therefore, with the Apoſtle, that <hi>
                  <hi>ye</hi> can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
againſt the truth, but for the truth.</hi> Thus faſhion not your Tongue to the
falſhood of the world.</p>
            <p>2. The world hath a tongue as Malicious as falſe; he carries poiſons, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
ſwords, razors in his mouth, whether in reviling the preſent, or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
the abſent. What have our tongues to walk in but this round of detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
Barre this practice, there would be ſilence at our bords, ſilence at our
fires-ſide, ſilence in the Tavern, ſilence in the way, ſilence in the Barbers-ſhop,
in the Mill, in the Market, every where; yea very Goſſips would have nothing
to whiſper. Lord, what a wilde licentiouſneſſe are we grown to in this kinde?
Every mans mouth is open to the cenſures, to the curſes of their betters; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it cared how true the word be, but how ſharp. Every Fidler ſings Libels
openly; and each man is ready to challenge the freedome of <hi>David</hi>'s Ruffians,
<hi>Our tongues are our own, who ſhall controll us?</hi> This is not a faſhion for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:44233:164"/>
whoſe tongues muſt be ranged within the compaſſe, as of Truth, ſo of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
Charity and ſilent Obedience: we know our charge, <hi>Diis non detrahes, Thou
ſhalt not revile the Gods, nor curſe the ruler of thy people,</hi> Exod. 22. 28. No,
<hi>not in thy bed-chamber,</hi> no, <hi>not in thy thoughts,</hi> Eccleſ. 10. 20. And for our
equalls, God hath ſaid it, <hi>Whoſo privily ſlandereth his Neighbour, him will I cut
off,</hi> Pſal. 101. 5.</p>
            <p>The ſpightfull tongue as it is a fire, and is kindled by the fire of hell, <hi>Jam.</hi>
3. 6. ſo ſhall it be ſure once to torment the Soul that moves it with flames un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable.
Thus, faſhion not your Tongue to the maliciouſneſſe of the world.</p>
            <p>3. As the world hath a ſpightfull tongue in his anger, ſo a Beaſtly tongue in
his mirth. No word ſounds well that is not unſavoury: The onely minſtrell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
to the world is ribaldry. Modeſty and ſober Merriment is dulneſſe. There is
no life but in thoſe <hi>cantiones cinaedicae,</hi> which are too bad even for the worſt of
red Lattices: yea even thoſe mouths which would hate to be palpably foul,
ſtick not to affect the witty jeſts of ambiguous obſcenity. Fye upon theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
brothelries. Oh that ever thoſe tongues which dare call God Father,
ſhould ſuffer themſelves thus to be poſſeſſed by that unclean ſpirit: that ever
thoſe mouths which have received the Sacred body and blood of the Lord of
Life, ſhould indure theſe dainty morſels of the Devil! For us, <hi>Let no corrupt
communication proceed out of our mouth, but that which is edifying and gracious,</hi>
Epheſ. 4. 29. and ſuch as may become thoſe tongues which ſhall once ſing <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujahs</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
in the Heavens. Faſhion not your Tongues to the obſcenity of the world.</p>
            <p>From the Tongue we paſſe to the Palate, which (together with the gulf,
whereto it ſerves, the throat and the paunch) is taken up with the beaſtly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
of Gluttony and exceſſe, whether wet or dry, of meats or liquors; ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits
in the one, drunkenneſſe in the other: inſomuch as that the vice hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the name of the part, <hi>Gula;</hi> as if this piece were for no other ſervice. The
Pſalmiſt deſcribes ſome wicked ones in his time by, <hi>Sepulcrum patens guttur
eorum, Their throat is an open Sepulchre,</hi> Pſal. 5. 9. How many have buried all
their Grace in this tomb? how many their Reputation? how many their
Wit? how many their Humanity? how many their Houſes, Lands, Livings,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
Wives, Children, Poſterity, Health, Life, Body and Soul? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tels his
<hi>Philippians,</hi> that their falſe teachers made their <hi>belly</hi> their <hi>God.</hi> Oh God, what
a Deity is here? what a naſty Idol? and yet how adored every where? The
Kitchins and Taverns are his Temples; the Tables his Altars. What fat Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
are here of all the beaſts, fouls, fiſhes, of all three Elements? what
pouring out, yea what pouring in of drink-offerings? what incenſe of <hi>Indian</hi>
ſmoak? what curiouſly-perfumed cates, wherewith the noſe is firſt feaſted,
then the maw?</p>
            <p>More then one of the Ancients, as they have made <hi>Nebuzaradan principem
Coquorum,</hi> Jer. 52. 12. the chief Cook of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> ſo they have found a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
myſticall alluſion in the ſtory; that the chief Cook ſhould burn the Temple
and Palace, both Gods houſe and the Kings, and ſhould deſtroy the walls of
<hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Surely gluttonous exceſſe deſtroies that which ſhould be the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Holy Ghoſt; and is enough to bring a fearfull vaſtation both upon
Church and State. I could even ſink down with ſhame to ſee Chriſtianity every
where ſo diſcountenanced with beaſtly Epicuriſme: what ſtreet ſhall a man
walk in, and not meet with a Drunkard? what rode ſhall he paſſe, and not meet
ſome or other hanging upon the ſtirrup, waving over the pummel? Saint
<hi>Peter</hi>'s argument from the third hour of the day, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s from the
night, would be now a <hi>non ſequitur;</hi> Day is night, night is day, no hour is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
priviledged. I cannot ſpeak a more fearfull word then that of Saint <hi>Paul,
Whoſe belly is their God, whoſe end is damnation.</hi> Oh wofull, wofull condition
of that damned glutton in the Goſpel! Oh the flames of that delicious tongue,
which beg'd for a drop, but ſhould in vain have been quenched with
rivers, with Oceans! As ye deſire to be freed from thoſe <hi>everlaſting burnings,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:44233:164"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Awake ye drunkards, and howl ye drinkers of wine,</hi> Joel 1. 5. Return your ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
liquors into tears of repentance, which onely can quench that fire; and
for the ſequel, put your knife to your throats: <hi>Take heed leſt at any time your
hearts be overtaken with ſurfeiting and drunkenneſſe,</hi> Luk. 21. 34. Thus faſhion
not your ſelves to the Exceſſe of the world.</p>
            <p>From the pampered Belly we paſſe to the proud Back of the world: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he is blind that ſees not a world of faſhions; in all which, the price of the
ſtuffe ſtrives with the vanity of the form. There is a Luxury in very Cloaths,
which it is hard to look beſides. O God, how is the world changed with us
ſince our Breeches of fig-leaves and Coats of skin? The Earth yields Gold,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
Silver, rich Stones, the Sea Pearls, the Aire feathers, the Field his ſtalks, the
Sheep her Fleece, the Worm her web; and all too little for one back. After
neceſſity, Cloaths were once for diſtinction, as of Sexes, ſo of Degrees. How
curious was God in theſe differences? the violation whereof was no leſſe then
deadly, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 5. What ſhall we ſay to the Dames, yea to the Hermaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites
of our time, whom it troubles that they may not be all man? But if Sexes
be known by cloaths, what is become of Degrees? Every baſe <hi>Terrivague</hi>
wears <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his coat: ſoft raiments are not for Courts, Peaſants degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
into Gallants, and every <hi>Midianitiſh</hi> Camel muſt ſhine with gold, <hi>Judg.</hi>
8. 26. But oh the mad diſguiſes of the world, eſpecially in that weaker Sex,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
which in too much variety is conſtant ſtill to a prodigious deformity of attire,
to the ſcorn of other Nations, to the diſhonour of their Husbands, to the ſhame
of the Goſpel, to the forfeit of their modeſty, to the miſshaping of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
to the proſtitution of their Souls, to the juſt damnation of both. It is not
for me to urge this here in a maſculine aſſembly; wherein I fear there cannot
be want of faults enough in this kind. Away with this abſurd and apiſh vanity
of the world. <hi>They that gliſter in ſcarlet, ſhall once embrace danghils,</hi> Lam.
4. 5. Yea it were well if no worſe. Let us that are Chriſtians affect that true
bravery which may become the bleſſed Spouſe of Chriſt; <hi>The Kings Daughter
is all glorious within;</hi> and ſay, with the Prophet, <hi>My ſoul ſhall be joyfull in my
God, for he hath cloathed me with the garments of ſalvation; he hath covered me
with the robe of righteouſneſſe,</hi> Eſay 61. 10. Thus faſhion not your Back to the
diſguiſe of the world.</p>
            <p>We had like to have forgotten the Neck and Shoulders of the world, which
have an ill faſhion of ſtiffneſſe and inflexible obſtinateneſſe, ſtubbornly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to ſtoop to the yoke of the Law, of the Goſpel. This is every where the
complaint of God; <hi>They have hardened their necks,</hi> Exod. 32. 9. Amongſt all
faſhions of the world this is the worſt; and that which gives an height to all
other wickedneſſes. Let all the other parts be never ſo faulty, yet if there be
a readineſſe to relent at the Judgements of God, and a meek pliableneſſe
to his Corrections, there is life in our hopes. But if our iron ſinews will not
bowe at all, bearing up themſelves with an obdured reſolution of ſinning, the
caſe is deſperate: what can we think other, then that ſuch a ſoul is branded
for Hell? <hi>He that being often reproved hardneth his neck, ſhall ſuddenly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
and that without remedy,</hi> Prov. 29. 1. Faſhion not your Neck therefore
to the ſtiffneſſe of the world.</p>
            <p>But the Cyclopean furnace of all wicked faſhions, the Heart, calls my ſpeech
to it; which I could not have forborn thus long, were it not that beſides the
importunity of theſe other parts, I have heretofore at large out of this place
diſplaied to you and the world the wicked faſhions thereof. Shortly yet, (for
we may not utterly balk them) all the corrupt deſires and affections of the
Soul are ſo many ill faſhions of the Heart to be avoided. Theſe affections are
well known: inordinate Love, uncharitable Hate, immoderate Grief, intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Joy, unjuſt Fears, unſound Hopes, and whatſoever either diſtemper
or miſplacing of theſe Paſſions. If we love the world more then God, if we
hate any enemy more then Sin, if we grieve at any loſſe more then of the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:44233:165"/>
favour of God, if we joy in any thing more then the writing of our names in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
Heaven, if we fear any thing more then offence, if we hope for any thing
more then Salvation; and much more if we change Objects, loving what we
ſhould hate, joying in what we ſhould grieve at, hoping for what we ſhould
feare, and the contrary; in one word, if our deſires and affections be earthly,
groveling, ſenſuall, not ſpirituall, ſublimed, heavenly; we fall into the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
faſhion of the world. Away therefore with all evil concupiſcence, all ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
affectations, all ſpightfull emulations, all worldly ſorrows, all cowardly
fears, all carnall heats of falſe joy. Let the World <hi>dote upon vanity, and follow
after lyes;</hi> let our <hi>Affections and converſation be above, where Chriſt Jeſus
ſitteth at the right hand of God.</hi> Let the baſe earthworms of this world be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
taken up with the beſt of this vain traſh; the deſires of us Chriſtians muſt
ſoar aloft, and fix themſelves upon thoſe Objects which may make us perfectly
and unchangeably bleſſed. Thus faſhion not your Hearts to the carnall deſires
and affections of the world.</p>
            <p>Affections eaſily break forth into Actions; and Actions perfect our Deſires.
Let us from the heart look to the Hands and Feet, the inſtruments of motion
and execution of the world. Faſhion not your ſelves laſtly therefore to the
practice and carriage of the world. The World makes a God of it ſelf, and
would be ſerving any God but the true one. Hate ye this curſed Idolatry, and

            </p>

Pſal. 119. 128.</p>
            <p>The World cares not how it rends and tears the Sacred Name of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker

            </p>

            <p>The World is a very brothel, given over to the proſecutions of noiſome and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
abominable luſts. Hate ye this Impurity, and poſſeſſe your veſſels in hoineſſe

Wickedneſſes of the world. All theſe are the unfruitfull works of darkneſſe;

            <p>And now I have laid before you ſome patterns, if not models, of the ill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions
of the World, in the thoughts, diſpoſitions, affections, actions thereof <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
Like them if ye can, O ye Chriſtian Hearers, and follow them. I am ſure, from

and misbecoming. And what ſhall I need to tell you how loathſomely
deformed theſe faſhions of the world make us to appear in the ſight of God?
The Toad or the Serpent are lovely objects to us, in compariſon of theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to the pure eyes of the Almighty: yea ſo perfectly doth God hate them,
that he profeſſes thoſe hate him that like them. <hi>Whoſoever will be a friend
to the world, is an enemy to God,</hi> Jam. 4. 4. Oh then, if we love our Souls, let
us hate thoſe faſhions that may draw us into the deteſtation of the Almighty;
for <hi>our God is a conſuming fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides misbeſeeming, it is a juſt plea againſt any Faſhion that it is painfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For though there be ſome Pain allowed in all Pride, yet too much we indure
not: and behold theſe Faſhions ſhall pinch and torture us to death; to an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
death of body and Soul. The ill gueſt in the Parable was thus clad,
Mat. 22. 12. the King abhorres his ſuit, and after expoſtulation gives the

Magnificence, there ſhall be darkneſſe; in the conceit of Pleaſure and

            <p>Laſtly, commonneſſe and age are the uſuall diſparagements of Faſhions. The

            <p>THE true method of Chriſtian practice is firſt deſtructive, then
aſtructive; according to the Prophet, <hi>Ceaſe to doe evil, learn to doe
good.</hi> This our Apoſtle obſerves; who firſt unteacheth us ill faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and then teacheth good. We have done with the negative duty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
of a Chriſtian, what he muſt not doe; hear now the affirmative, what he muſt
doe: wherein our ſpeech, treading in the ſteps of the bleſſed Apoſtle, ſhall
paſſe through theſe four heads; Firſt, that here muſt be a change; ſecondly,
that this change muſt be by transformation; thirdly, that this transformation
muſt be by renewing; fourthly, that this renewing muſt be of the minde: <hi>But
be ye changed,</hi> or <hi>transformed, by the renewing of your minds.</hi> All of them points
of high and ſingular importance; and ſuch as do therefore call for your beſt
and carefulleſt attention.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more changing then the faſhion of the world: <hi>Mundus tranſit,
The world paſſeth away,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 17.</note> ſaith S. <hi>John.</hi> Yet here, that we may not faſhion our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
ſelves to the world, we muſt be changed; we muſt be changed from theſe
changeable faſhions of the world to a conſtant eſtate of Regeneration. As there
muſt be once a perfect change of this mortall to immortality, ſo muſt there be
onwards, of this ſinfull to gracious: and as holy <hi>Job</hi> reſolves to <hi>wait all the
daies of his appointed time,</hi> for that <hi>changing;</hi> ſo this change contrarily waits for
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:44233:166"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> us, and may not be put off one day. What creature is there wherein God will
not have a change? They needed not as he made them; nothing could fall from
him but good: we marr'd them; and therefore they both are changed, and muſt
be. Even of the very Heavens themſelves it is ſaid, <hi>As a veſture ſhalt thou
change them, and they ſhall be changed:</hi> how much more theſe ſublunary bodies
that are never themſelves? We know the Elements are in a perpetual tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
ſo are thoſe bodies that are compounded of them: as he ſaid of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
we cannot ſtep down twice into the ſame ſtream. And every ſeven years
(as Philoſophy hath obſerved) our bodies are quite changed from what they
were. And as there is a natural change in our favours, colour, complexion,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> temper; ſo there is no leſſe voluntary change in our diets, in our diſpoſitions,
in our delights. With what ſcorn do we now look upon the Top which our
Childhood was fond on? how do we either ſmile or bluſh in our mature age,
to think of the humours and actions of our youth? How much more muſt the
depravedneſs of our ſpiritual condition call for a change?</p>
            <p>It is a rule in Policy, Not to alter a well-ſetled evil. I am ſure it holds not in
the Oeconomy of the Soul, wherein length of preſcription pleads rather for a
ſpeedy removal: no time can prejudice the King of Heaven. In ſome caſes
indeed change is a ſign of a weak unſetledneſs: It is not for a wiſe man, like
Shel-fiſh, to riſe or fall with the Moon; rather, like unto the Heaven, he muſt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> learn to move, and be conſtant. It was a good word of <hi>Baſil</hi> to the Governour,
<hi>Utinam ſempiterna ſit hoec mea deſipientia, Let me dote thus alw aies.</hi> It was not
for nothing that <hi>Socrates</hi> had the reputation of Wiſdome: that famous Shrew
of his, <hi>Xantippe,</hi> could ſay, ſhe never but ſaw him return with the countenance
that he went out with. Give me a man that in the changes of all conditions
can frame himſelf to be like an Auditors counter, and can ſtand either for a
thouſand, or an hundred, or (if need be) for one: this man comes neareſt to him
<hi>in whom there is no ſhadow of turning.</hi> But in caſe of preſent ill, there can be
no ſafety but in change. I cannot blame the Angels and Saints in Heaven, that
they would not change; I bleſſe them that they cannot, becauſe they are not
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> capable of better, and every motion is out of a kind of need. I cannot wonder
at the damned ſpirits, that they would be any thing but what they are. We
that are naturally in the way to that damnation, have reaſon to deſire a change;
worſe we cannot be upon earth then in a ſtate of ſin. Be changed therefore,
if ye wiſh well to your own Souls; that it may be ſaid of you, in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
words, <hi>Such ye were.</hi> What an enemy would upbraid by way of reproch, is the
greateſt praiſe that can be, Faults that were. Oh happy men that can hear,
Ye were profane, unclean, idolatrous, oppreſſive, riotous! Their very ſins ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
them; as the very Devils that <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> had, are mentioned for her
glory; ſince we do not hear of them, but when they were caſt out. As there
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> are ſome careleſſe naſty creatures, that can abide to weare none but their old,
patched, ſordid rags (ſuch as that miſcreant <hi>Ciſtercian,</hi> Spaniſh Deiſt, whom
we ſaw walk in and pollute our ſtreets) men that out of ſullenneſſe or affection
are habited as the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> were out of craft; ſo there are ſpiritually ſuch,
natural men, yea natural fools, that pleaſe themſelves in a falſe conſtancy, and
brag they are no changelings, <hi>whoſe glory is their ſhame, whoſe end</hi> (if they go
on ſo) <hi>is damnation.</hi> Let the great Bridegroom come in, and finde one of theſe
crept into his Feaſt, he ſhall be ſure to ſend him out with a miſchief; <hi>How
cameſt thou in hither? Binde him hand and foot, and caſt him into utter darkneſs,
there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> Mat. 22. 13. Away with this frippery
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of our Nature. <hi>Old things are paſſed:</hi> if ever we look to have any party in
God, in Heaven, we muſt be changed.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, every change will not ſerve the turn. The word is not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>alteration,</hi> nor <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <hi>Metamorphoſis;</hi> a word whoſe ſound we are better
acquainted with then the ſenſe: the meaning is, There muſt be a change in
our very form. There is no motion, no action we paſſe through without a
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:44233:167"/>
change; as there is no ſtep wherein we change not our Meridian, ſo there is no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
act which works not ſome mutation in us. But there are ſlight changes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the places, habits, actions vary, without any change of the form; as <hi>Caelum,
non animum,</hi> was an old word; and we know the Body is the ſame, whiles the
Sutes are divers. And again, there are changes that reach to the very forms,
whence all actions ariſe; as when of evil we are made good, of carnal ſpiritual:
This is the Metamorphoſis that is here called for. Indeed it hath been a not
more antient then true obſervation, that the change of ſome things makes all
things ſeem changed: as when a man comes into an houſe wherein the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are pulled down, the roof raiſed up, the floor paved, bay-windows ſet
out, the out-ſide rough-caſt, he ſhall think all the frame new, and yet the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
old foundation, beams, ſtuds, roof ſtand ſtill; ſo it is here, the very ſubſtance
of the Soul holds ſtill, but the Diſpoſitions and qualities and the very caſt of
it are altered, as when a round piece of paſt is formed into a ſquare; or, which
is the higheſt of all patterns, as our Bleſſed Saviour was transformed in the
Mount <hi>Tabor.</hi> His Deity was the ſame, his Humanity the ſame, the ſame
Soul, the ſame body; yet he was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (it is the very word that the
Holy Ghoſt uſes both there and here) in that the Deity did put a glorious
ſplendor upon his humane body which before it had not. Thus it muſt be in
our Transformation, onwards; the Spirit of God doth thus alter us through
Grace, whiles we are yet for eſſence the ſame. <hi>Can a Leopard change his ſpots,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
or a Blackmore his skin?</hi> ſaith the Prophet. See, I beſeech you, how this change
is not eaſie, though not ſubſtantial. The ſpots are not of the eſſence of that
beaſt; the blackneſs is not of the eſſence of an <hi>Aethiopian:</hi> yet how hard theſe
are to put off, we know.</p>
            <p>Our Mythologiſts tell us of many ſtrange Metamorphoſes, of men turn'd
into Beaſts, Birds, Trees; wherein doubtleſſe they had morall alluſions: Let
me tell you of a Metamorphoſis as ſtrange as theirs, and as true as theirs fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
They tell us of men turn'd into Swine by <hi>Circe;</hi> I tell you of Swine turn'd
into men, when Drunkards and obſcene perſons turn ſober and well-governed.
They tell you of men turn'd into Stones, and of ſtones turn'd into men, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
upon their Deluge; I tell you that of very ſtones Sons are raiſed
up to <hi>Abraham.</hi> They tell us of a <hi>Lycaon</hi> turn'd into a Wolf; I tell you of a
Wolf turn'd into a man, when a ravenous Oppreſſor turns mercifull. They
tell us of men turn'd into Oaks and Rocks; I tell you of the oaky, rocky,
flinty hearts of men turn'd into fleſh, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks. They tell us of an
<hi>Actaeon</hi> turn'd into the beaſt which he loved to hunt, and devoured of thoſe
beaſts wherewith he was wont to hunt; I tell you of a voluptuous beaſt aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
thoſe pleaſures which had wont to ſpend him. They tell us of a ſelf-loving
man turn'd to a Flower; I tell you of a fading tranſitory creature chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into the image of the Son of God. They tell us of a <hi>Proteus</hi> turn'd into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
all forms; I tell you of a man of all hours, all companies, all religions, turn'd
into a conſtant Confeſſour and Martyr for the name of Chriſt. They tell us,
laſtly, of their <hi>Jupiter</hi> and other Deities turn'd into the ſhape of beaſts, for the
advantage of their Luſt; I tell of men naturally of a beſtial diſpoſition made
the Sons of God, <hi>partakers of the Divine nature,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh.
Theſe changes are not imaginary, as in the caſe of Lycanthropie and deluſions
of jugling Sorcerers, but reall and unfeigned; truly wrought by God, truly
felt by us, truly ſeen by others. Not that we can alwaies judge of theſe things
by the mere outſides: for even Satan himſelf is transformed into an Angel of
light; neither do any faces look fairer then the painted: But <hi>ex fructibus</hi> is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
the rule of our Saviour, that will trie out the truth of all our Transformations.
Let us not flatter our ſelves, (Honourable &amp; beloved) we are all born Wolves,
Bears, Tigers, Swine, one beaſt or other: It muſt needs be a notable change if
of beaſts we become men, of men Saints. Thus it muſt be, elſe we are not
transformed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:44233:167"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Neither is this transformation reall only, but totall, not reſting in the parts,
but enlarged to the whole perſon: and therefore the charge is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Be ye transformed;</hi> not ſome pieces of you, but the whole. There are thoſe
which are changed in the face (that look civil at leaſt, if not Saint-like;) but
their <hi>mouths are full of curſing, and bitterneſs,</hi> and blaſphemies. There are thoſe
whoſe tongues are ſmooth-filed, abounding not only with plauſible words, but
holy and ſeemingly gracious too; when <hi>their right hand is a right hand of
wickedneſs.</hi> If they have the faces and tongues of men, they have the talons of
Griſons, full of rapine, cruelty, oppreſſion. There are thoſe whoſe one half
(the upper part) is man, the lower is ſtill, Centaur-like, no other, no better then
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> beaſt; as if, according to that old fooliſh Hereſie, God had not made both.
There are thoſe whoſe hands are white, and clean from bribes, from extortion;
but <hi>their feet are</hi> yet <hi>ſwift to ſhed blood</hi> upon their own private revenge. Let
not theſe men ſay they are transformed. Let the firſt ſay their face is changed;
let the next ſay their tongue is changed; let the other ſay their breaſts or
hands are changed: but unleſſe face, and tongue, and breaſt, and hand, and foot,
and all be changed, the man is not changed. God be mercifull to us; the world
is full of ſuch monſters of Hypocriſie, who care onely for an appearing change
of ſome eminent and noted part, neglecting the whole: as ſome ſorry Tap-houſe
white-limes and glazes the front towards the ſtreet, and ſets out a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſign, when there is nothing in the inward parts but ſticks, and clay, and
ruines, and cold earthen floors, and fluttery. This is to no purpoſe. If any piece
of us be unchanged, we are ſtill our old ſelves, odious to God, obnoxious to
death.</p>
            <p>But (as all motions have their termes) what is that into which we muſt be
transformed? I ſee transformations enough every where; God knows, too
many. I ſee zealous Profeſſors transformed to key-cold worldlings, reformed
Catholicks turn'd to Romiſh Factioniſts: I ſee men transformed into women, in
their effeminate diſpoſitions and demeanours; women transform'd to men, in
their affectation of maſculine boldneſs and faſhions: I ſee men and women
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> transform'd into Beaſts of all kindes; ſome into drunken Swine, others into
cruell Tigers, others into ranck Goats, others into mimick Apes; yea I ſee
thoſe beaſts transform'd again into Devils, in the delight they take in ſin, in
their miſchievous tempting of others to ſin. All theſe are transformed ſo as it
is, from good to ill, from bad to worſe; ſo transformed that, as <hi>Cypran</hi> ſaid of
painted faces, it is no marvell if God know them not, for they have made
themſelves quite other from what he made them. That whereinto we muſt
be transformed, is the image of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. conſiſting in holineſſe and
righteouſneſs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 24. That Image we once had and loſt; and now muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
by our transformation. Oh bleſſed change, that of the Sons of men, we
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> become the children of the ever-living God; of the firebrands of hell (ſuch we
are naturally) we become the heirs of Heaven! That as the eternal Son of
God, having the form of God, did yet graciouſly change this glorious habit
for the form of a ſervant; ſo we that are the ſons of men, ſhould change the
ſervile form of our wretched nature into the Divine form of the Son of God!
This is a change not more happy then needfull. It was another change that
<hi>Job</hi> ſaid he would wait for: but of this change we muſt ſay, <hi>I will not ſuffer
mine eyes to ſleep nor mine eye-lids to ſlumber, untill</hi> an happy change have
wrought this heart of mine (which by Nature is no better then a ſtie of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
devils) to be <hi>an habitation for the God of Jacob.</hi> Wo be to the man whoſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> laſt change overtakes him ere this change be wrought in him. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more wretched then a mere man. We may brag what we will, how
noble a creature man is above all the reſt; how he is the Lord of the world,
a world within himſelf, the mirrour of Majeſty, the viſible model of his
Maker: but let me tell you, if we be but men, it had been a thouſand times
better for us to have been the worſt of beaſts. Let it not ſeem to ſavour of
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:44233:168"/>
any Miſanthropie to ſay, that as all thoſe things which are perfections in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
are eminently in God, ſo all the vicious diſpoſitions of the creature are
eminently in man: in that debauch'd and abuſed Reaſon is the quinteſſence of
all Beſtialitie. What ſpeak I of theſe ſilly brutes? In this ſtreight triangle of
man's Heart there is a full Conclave of Cardinal wickedneſſes, an Incorporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Cheaters, a Goal of Malefactors, yea a legion of Devils. Seeſt thou then
the moſt loathſome Toad that crawls upon the earth, or the moſt deſpiſed Dog
that creeps under thy feet? thou ſhalt once envy their condition, if thou be not
more then a man. Thou ſeeſt the worſt of them, thou canſt not conceive the
worſt of thine own. For <hi>fleſh and blood cannot inherit the kingdome of God;</hi> and
<hi>fores canes, without ſhall be Dogs,</hi> Revel. 22. 15. When they ſhall be vaniſhed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
into their firſt nothing, thou ſhalt be ever dying in thoſe unquenchable flames,
which ſhall torment thee ſo much the more, as thou hadſt more Wit and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
without Grace. But oh, what a wofull thing it is to conſider, and how may
we bemone our ſelves to Heaven and earth, that yet men will not be transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med?
All the menaces, all the terrors of God cannot move men from what
they are; but <hi>he that is filthy</hi> will <hi>be filthy ſtill.</hi> In ſpight of both Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
men have obdured their ſelves againſt the counſel of God: they have an
<hi>iron neck,</hi> Eſa. 48. 4. an <hi>uncircumciſed care,</hi> Jer. 6. 10. a <hi>brawny heart,</hi> Mark 3. 5.
Say God and man what they will, theſe enchanted creatures will rather be
beaſts ſtill, then return to men. If we will not change, be ſure God will not; He <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
hath ſaid it, and he will perform it, <hi>After thine hardneſs and heart that cannot
repent, thou treaſureſt up unto thy ſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath and revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the righteous judgment of God,</hi> Rom. 2. 5. Far, far be this obſtinacy from
us (Honorable and beloved.) For God's ſake, for your Souls ſake yield your
ſelves willingly into the hands of God, and ſay, <hi>Convert me, O Lord, and I ſhall
be converted.</hi> As we love our ſelves, and fear hell, let us not content our ſelves
with the ſhape, with the faculties of men, but let us be transformed; and think
that we were only made men, that we might paſſe through the eſtate of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to Regeneration. This for the Transformation: See now that this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
muſt be by Renewing.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Spirit that by <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid, <hi>There is nothing new under the Sun,</hi>
ſaith by S. <hi>Paul, All things are become new.</hi> Nothing is ſo new that it hath not
been: All things muſt be ſo new as they were. This <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>renovation,</hi>
implies that which once was, and therefore was new before. That God who is
<hi>the Antient of daies,</hi> doth not diſlike any thing for mere Age; for Time is his:
and continuance of Time is ſo much more excellent as it comes nearer to the
duration of Eternity. <hi>Old age is a crown of glory.</hi> Neither is ought old in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to God, but to us; neither is age faulty in reſpect of Nature, but of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption:
for as that word of <hi>Tertullian</hi> is true, <hi>Primum verum, the firſt is true;</hi>
ſo may I as truly ſay, <hi>Primum bonum, the firſt is good.</hi> Only now, as our Nature <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
ſtands depraved, our Old man is the body of corruptions, which we brought
with us, and carry about us; and there can be no ſafety, unleſſe we be transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by renovation. <hi>Behold,</hi> God ſaies, <hi>I make all things new, a new Heaven and
a new earth,</hi> Eſay 65. 17. The year renews; and to morrow (we ſay) is a new day:
we renew our clothes when they are worn, our leaſes when they grow towards
expiring; only our hearts we care not to renew. If all the reſt were old, ſo that
our Heart were new, it were nothing. Nothing but the main of all is neglected.
What ſhould I need any other motives to you then the view of the eſtate of
both theſe? Look firſt at the old; <hi>Put off, concerning the former converſation, the
old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitfull luſts,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 22. Lo, the old <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
man is corrupt; this is enough to caſhier him: what man can abide to carry
rotten fleſh about him? If but a wound feſter and gather dead fleſh, we draw
it, we corrode it, till it be clear at the bottome. Thoſe that make much of
their old man, do, like that monſtrous twin, willingly carry about a dead half
of themſelves, whoſe noiſomneſſe doth torment and kill the living. Look at
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:44233:168"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the new; <hi>Being freed from ſin, and made ſervants to God, ye have your
fruit in holineſs, and the end everlaſting life,</hi> Rom. 6. 22. Holineſs is a
lovely thing of it ſelf: there is a <hi>beauty of Holineſs, Gloria Sanctitatis,</hi> as the
Vulgar turns it, Pſal. 144. and goodneſs doth amply reward it ſelf: Yet this
Holineſs hath beſides infinite recompence attending it. Holineſs is life begun;
eternal life is the conſummation of Holineſs: Holineſs is but the way; the
end whereto it leads is everlaſting life. As therefore we would avoid the
annoiance and danger of our ſinful corruptions, as we would ever aſpire to
true and endleſs bleſſedneſs, Oh let us be transformed by renewing. But
how is this renewing wrought, and wherein doth it conſiſt? Surely as there
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> are three ways whereby we receive a new being, by Creation, by Generation,
by Reſuſcitation: ſo according to all theſe is our ſpiritual renewing; it is by
Creation, <hi>Whoſoever is in Chriſt is a new Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. it is by
Regeneration, <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdome of God,</hi>
Joh. 3. 3. it is by Reſuſcitation, <hi>Even when we were dead in ſins, hath he
quickened us together with Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 5. From whence ariſes this double
Corollary.</p>
            <p>1. That we can give (of our ſelves) no active power to the firſt act of our
Converſion; no more then <hi>Adam</hi> did to his firſt Creation, no more then the
child doth to his own Conception, no more then the dead man to his raiſing
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> from the grave.</p>
            <p>2. That there muſt be a Privation of our old corrupt forms, and a reducing
us from our either nothing, or worſe, to an eſtate of Holineſs and new Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
This is that which is every where ſet forth unto us by the Mortification
of our earthly members, and putting off the old man, on the one part; and by
the firſt reſurrection, and putting on the new, on the other. Nothing is more
familiar then theſe reſemblances. But of all Similes, none doth ſo fitly (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks)
expreſs the manner of this renewing as that of the Snake, which by
leaving his old ſlough in the ſtreights of the Rock, glides forth glib and nimble.
I remember <hi>Holcot</hi> urges the Similitude thus;<note place="margin">In librum Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientia.</note> To turn off the Snakes skin

of the paſſage;</hi> elſe he muſt needs draw the old skin through with him: the
latter is <hi>ſtabilitas ſaxi,</hi> the <hi>firmneſs of the ſtone;</hi> elſe in ſtead of leaving the skin
he ſhall draw the ſtone away with him. So muſt it be in the buſineſs of our
renovation: Firſt, we muſt paſs through the ſtreight way of due Penitence;
ſecondly, we muſt hold the firm and ſtable purpoſe of our perſeverance in
good. True ſorrow and contrition of heart muſt begin the work, and then an
unmoved conſtancy of endeavour muſt finiſh it. Whoſoever thou art there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if thy heart have not been toucht, yea torn and rent in pieces, with a
ſound Humiliation for thy ſins, the old ſlough is ſtill upon thy back; thou art
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> not yet come within the ken of true Renovation. Or if thou be gone ſo farre, as
that the skin begins to reave up a little in a ſerious grief for thy ſins, yet if thy
reſolutions be not ſteadily ſetled and thine endeavours bent to go through with
that holy work, thou comeſt ſhort of thy renewing; thine old looſe filme of
corruption ſhall ſo cumber thee, that thou ſhalt never be able to paſs on
ſmoothly in the ways of God.</p>
            <p>But becauſe now we have a conceit that man (as we ſay of fiſh) unleſs he be
new, is naught; every man is ready to challenge this honour of being renewed:
and certainly there may be much deceit this way. We have ſeen plate or
other veſſels that have look'd like new, when they have been but new guilded
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> or burniſh'd; we have ſeen old faces that have counterfeited a youthly
ſmoothneſs and vigorous complexion; we have ſeen Hypocrites act every
part of renovation, as if they had falne from Heaven. Let us therefore take a
trial by thoſe proofs of examination that cannot fail us: And they ſhall
be fetcht from thoſe three ways of our renewing which we have formerly
ſpecified.</p>

If we be renewed by Creation, here muſt be a clean Heart. <hi>Cor mundum crea,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 10. For as at the firſt God look'd on all his works,
and found them very good; ſo ſtill, no work of his can be other then like
himſelf, holy and perfect. If thy heart therefore be ſtill full of unclean thoughts,
wanton deſires, covetouſneſs, ambition, profaneneſs, it is thine old heart of
Satans marring: it is no new heart of God's making; for nothing but clean can
come from under his hands. But if we plead the cloſeneſs of the heart, which
may therefore ſeem impervious even to our own eyes, ſee what the Apoſtle
ſaith, Epheſ. 2. 10. <hi>We are his workmanſhip created unto good works.</hi> The cleanneſs
of the heart will ſhew it ſelf in the goodneſs of the Hands. But if our hands
may deceive us, as nothing is more eaſily counterfeited then a good action, yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
our Feet will not, I mean the trade of our wayes. That therefore from our
Creation we may look to our Regeneration; if we be the ſons of God, we are
renewed: and how ſhall it appear whether we be the ſons of God? It is a
golden Rule, <hi>Whoſoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God,</hi> Rom.
8. 14. Yet if in both of theſe life could be counterfeited, death cannot. That
therefore from our Creation and Regeneration we may look to our Reſuſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and from thence back to our grave; <hi>Mortifie your members which are
on earth,</hi> Col. 3. 5. There is a death of this body of ſin, and what manner of
death? <hi>Thoſe that are Chriſt's, have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts,</hi>
Gal. 5. 24. Lo, as impoſſible as it is for a dead man to come down from his gibbet,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
or up from his coffin, and to doe the works of his former life; ſo impoſſible it is
that a renewed man ſhould doe the old works of his unregeneration. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you find your Hearts unclean, your Hands idle and unprofitable, your
Ways crooked and unholy, your Corruptions alive and lively, never pretend
any renewing; you are the old men ſtill; and however ye may go for Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ains,
yet ye have denied the power of Chriſtianity in your lives: and if ye ſo
continue, the fire of Hell ſhall have ſo much more power over you, for that it
finds the Baptiſmal water upon your faces.</p>
            <p>Our laſt head is the ſubject of this <hi>Renewing, The Minde.</hi> There are that
would have this Renovation proper to the inferiour (which is the affective) part <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
of the Soul; as if the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. Theſe are met with here by out-Apoſtle, who placeth
this renewing upon the Mind. There are contrarily that ſo appropriate this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
to the Mind, which is the higheſt loſt of the Soul, as that they diffuſe
it not to the lower rooms, nor to the our houſes of the body; as if onely the
Soul were capable as of Sin, ſo of Regeneration. Both theſe ſhoot too ſhort,
and muſt know that as the Mind, ſo not the Mind only, muſt be renewed. That
part is mentioned not by way of excluſion, but of principality. It is the man that
muſt be renewed; not one piece of him. Except ye pleaſe to ſay according to
that old Philoſophical Adage, <hi>The Mind is the man;</hi> and the Body, as the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
wiſeſt Ethnick had wont to ſay, nothing but the Caſe of that rich Jewel. To ſay
as it is, the moſt Saint-like Philoſophy was ſomewhat injurious in diſparaging
the outward man. Whatever they thought, this Body is not the hung-by, but
the partner of the Soul; no leſs intereſſed in the man then that Spirit that
animates it, no leſs open to the inhabitation of God's Spirit, no leſs free of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Man therefore that is made of two parts, muſt be renewed in both: but
as in the firſt birth whole man is born, onely the Body is ſeen; ſo in the ſecond,
whole man is renewed, onely the Soul is inſtanced in. Our Apoſtle puts both
together, 1 Theſ. 5. 23. <hi>The God of peace ſanctifie you wholly, that your whole ſpirit
and ſoul and body may be preſerved blameleſs to the coming of our Lord Jeſus.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
Why then is the Mind thus ſpecified? Becauſe it is the beſt part, becauſe as it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livens
and moves, ſo it leads the reſt. If the Mind therefore be renewed, it boots
not to urge the renovation of the body. For as in Nature we are wont to ſay, that
the Soul follows the temperature of the Body; ſo in Spiritual things we ſay
rather more truly, that the Body follows the temper and guidance of the Soul.
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:44233:169"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Theſe two companions, as they ſhall be once inſeparable in their final con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
ſo they are now in their preſent diſpoſitions. Be renewed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in your Minds, and, if you can, hold off your earthly parts. No more
can the Body live without the Soul, then the Soul can be renewed without
the Body.</p>
            <p>Firſt then the Mind, then the Body. All defilement is by an extramiſſion
(as our Saviour tels us.) <hi>That which goeth into the body defileth not the man;</hi>
ſo as the ſpring of corruption is within. That muſt be firſt cleanſed, elſe in vain
do we ſcour the channels. Ye ſhall have ſome Hypocrites that pretend to
begin their renewing from without. On foul hands they will wear white
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Gloves; on foul hearts, clean hands, and then all is well. Away with theſe
Phariſaical diſhes, filthy within, clean without, fit onely for the ſervice of
unclean Devils. To what purpoſe is it to lick over the skin with precious
oyle, if the Liver be corrupted, the Lungs rotten? To what purpoſe is
it to crop the top of the weeds, when the root and ſtalk remains in the
earth? Pretend what you will, all is old, all is naught, till the Mind be
renewed.</p>
            <p>Neither is the Body more renewed without the Mind, then the renewing
of the Mind can keep it ſelf from appearing in the renewing of the Body. The
Soul lies cloſe, and takes advantage of the ſecrecy of that Cabinet whereof
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> none but God keeps the Key; and therefore may pretend anything: we ſee
the man, the Soul we cannot ſee; but by that we ſee we can judge of that we
ſee not.</p>
            <p>He is no Chriſtian that is not renewed; and he is worſe then a beaſt that
is no Chriſtian. Every man therefore lays claim to that renovation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he cannot be convinced; yea there want not thoſe, who though they
have a ribaldiſh tongue and a bloody hand, yet will challenge as good a
Soul as the beſt. Hypocrite, when the Conduit-head is walled in, how ſhall
we judge of the ſpring, but by the water that comes out of the pipes?
Corrupt nature hath taught us ſo much craft as to ſet the beſt ſide out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> If therefore thou have obſcene lips, if bribing and oppreſſing hands,
if a gluttonous tooth, a drunken gullet, a lewd converſation, certainly the
Soul can be no other then abominably filthy: It may be worſe then it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
better it cannot lightly be. The Mind then leads the Body, the Body
deſcries the Mind; both of them at once are old, or both at once new.
For us, as we bear the face of Chriſtians, and profeſs to have received
both Souls and Bodies from the ſame hand, and look that both Bodies
and Souls ſhall once meet in the ſame Glory, let it be the top of all our
care, that we may <hi>be transformed in the renewing of our minds;</hi> and let the
renewing of our Minds bewray it ſelf in the renewing of our Bodies. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> have we had the powerful Goſpel of our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt ſo long
amongſt us, if we be ſtill our ſelves? What hath it wrought upon us, if we
be not changed? Never tell me of a Popiſh Tranſubſtantiation of men; of an
inviſible, inſenſible, unfeiſible change of the perſon, whiles the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
life and carriage are ſtill the ſame. Theſe are but falſe Hypocritical
juglings to mock fools withall. If we be transformed and renewed, let it be ſo
done, that not onely our own eyes and hands may ſee and feel it, but others
too; that the by-ſtanders may ſay, How is this man changed from himſelf? He
was a blaſphemous Swearer, a profane Scoffer at goodneſs; now he ſpeaks
with an awful reverence of God and holy things: He was a Luxurious wanton;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> now he poſſeſſeth his veſſel in Holineſs and honour: He was an unconſcionable
Briber, and abettor of unjuſt cauſes; now the world cannot ſee him to ſpeak for
wrong: He was a wild roaring Swaggerer; now he is a ſober Student: He was
a Devil; now he is a Saint. Oh let this day (if we have ſo long deferr'd it) be the
day of the renovation, of the purification of our Souls. And let us begin with a
ſound humiliation, and true ſorrow for our former and preſent wickedneſſes.

            <p>I need not tell you how great, how wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> was. The Great are wont
to be moſt haunted with pride; the Wiſe can beſt ſee the danger of that Pride
which haunts the great: Great and wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> therefore makes it one of
his chief common-places, the crying down of Pride: a Vice not more general
then dangerous;<note place="margin">Eccluſ. 10. 13.</note>
as that which his witty Imitator can tell us is <hi>initium omnis
peccati, the beginning of all ſin.</hi> Now Pride can never be ſo much ſpighted as
by honouring her contemned rival, Humility. Nothing could ſo much vex that
inſolent <hi>Agagite,</hi> as to be made a Lacky to a deſpiſed Jew. Beſides her own
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> portion therefore, which is Ruine, <hi>Solomon</hi> torments her with the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her abaſed Oppoſite.</p>
            <p>My Text then is like unto <hi>Shuſhan,</hi> in the ſtreets whereof Honour is proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to an humble <hi>Mordecai;</hi> in the Palace whereof is erected an engine of
death to a proud <hi>Haman; A mans Pride ſhall bring him low; but Honour ſhall
uphold the humble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Propoſitions are Antithetical; wherein Pride is oppoſed to Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
Honour to Ruine. Hear, I beſeech you, how wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> hath learn'd
of his Father <hi>David</hi> to <hi>ſing of Mercy and Judgement:</hi> Judgement to the
Proud, Mercy to the Humble; both together with one breath. The Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to the Proud is their humbling; the Mercy to the Humble is their rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to Honour.</p>
            <p>It is the noted courſe of God to work ſtill by contraries: as indeed this is
the juſt praiſe of Omnipotence, to fetch light out of darkneſs, life out of
death, order out of confuſion, Heaven out of Hell, honour out of humility,
humiliation out of pride; according to that of the ſacred Way-maker of Chriſt,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:44233:171"/>
               <hi>Every hill ſhall be caſt down, every valley raiſed.</hi> But in this particular above all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
other; he delights to croſs and abaſe the Proud, to advance the Humble, as
bleſſed <hi>Mary</hi> in her <hi>Magnificat,</hi> to <hi>pull down the mighty from their ſeat, and to
exalt the humble and meek.</hi> For God hath a ſpecial quarrel to the Proud as thoſe
that do more nearly conteſt with his Majeſty, and ſcramble with him for his
Glory. He <hi>knows the Proud afarre off,</hi> and hath a ſpecial favour in ſtore for the
Humble, as thoſe that are veſſels moſt capable of his Mercy, becauſe they are
empty. This in common: we deſcend to the ſeveral parts.</p>
            <p>The Judgement begins firſt, as that which is fit to make way for Mercy.
Therein there are two ſtrains; one is the Sin, the other is the Puniſhment. The
Sin is <hi>a mans Pride. A mans,</hi> not for the diſtinction of one Sex from another,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
but Firſt, for the comprehenſion of both Sexes under one. The Woman was
firſt proud, and it ſticks by her ever ſince: She is none of the daughters of
<hi>Eve</hi> that inherits not her childs-part in this ſin. Neither is this Feminine Pride
leſs odious, leſs dangerous. Rather the weakneſs of the Sex gives power and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the vice; as the fagot-ſtick will ſooner take fire then the log.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the intimation of the reflex action of Pride. A mans Pride
therefore is the Pride of himſelf. Indeed the whole endeavour, ſtudy, care of
the proud man, is the hoiſing of himſelf; yea, this Himſelf is the adequate
ſubject of all ſinful deſires. What doth the Covetous labour but to inrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?
the Voluptuous but to delight himſelf? the Proud but to exalt himſelf?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
whether in contempt of others, or in competition with God himſelf. For
Pride hath a double caſt of her eye; downwards to other men in ſcorn, upwards
to God in a rivalty. To men firſt, as the proud Phariſee, <hi>I am not as others,
nor as this Publican.</hi> He thinks he is made of better clay then the common lump;
it is others happineſs to ſerve him. He magnifies every act that fals from him,
as that proud <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Is not this great Babel that I have built?</hi> yea his
own very excretions are ſweet and fragrant, whiles the perfumes of others are
ranck and ill-ſented.</p>
            <p>To God, ſecondly. For whereas Piety makes God our Alpha and Omega,
the beginning and the end; the beginning to which we aſcribe all, the end <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
whereto we referre all: the Proud man makes himſelf his own Alpha, thanks
himſelf for all; makes himſelf his own Omega, ſeeks himſelf in all; begins at
himſelf, ends at himſelf.</p>
            <p>Which muſt needs be ſo much more odious to God, as it conforms us more
to the enemy of God, of whom we ſay commonly, <hi>As proud as the Devil.</hi> For
that once-glorious Angel looking upon his own excellency wherewith he
was inveſted in his creation, began to be lift up in himſelf, made himſelf his
own Alpha and Omega, acknowledging no eſſential dependance upon God as
his beginning, no neceſſary reference to God as his end; and therefore was
tumbled down into that bottomleſs dungeon, and <hi>reſerved in everlaſting chains <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
of darkneſs unto the judgement of the great day.</hi> This is it which ſome think
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alludes to, when he charges that a Biſhop ſhould <hi>not be a novice, left
he ſhould be puffed up, and fall</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>into the condemnation of the
Devil,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 6.</p>
            <p>Now there are ſo many kinds of Pride as there are imaginary cauſes of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exaltation;
and there are ſo many cauſes imagined hereof, as there are things
reputed more precious and excellent in the eyes of the world. I might ſend you
to <hi>Hugo's</hi> Chariot of Pride, drawn with four horſes, (that Age knew no more)
and the four wheels of it, if I liſted to mount Pride curiouſly: but I will ſhew
you her on foot. To ſpeak plainly therefore, Theſe five things are wont com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
to be the matter of our Pride, Honour, Riches, Beauty, Strength, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
Every of them ſhall have a word.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that are tainted with the firſt, are State-proud; Bladders puft up with
the wind of Honour. Thus <hi>Ninive, Behold I ſit as a Queen; I am, and there
is none elſe:</hi> Thus the inſolent officer of <hi>Sennacherib, Who art thou, that
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:44233:171"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> thou deſpiſeſt the leaſt of my Maſters ſervants? Vicina potentibus ſuperbia,</hi> as that
Father ſaid, <hi>Pride is an uſual neighbour to greatneſs.</hi> How hard is it for eminent
Perſons, when they ſee all heads bare, all knees bowed to them, not to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
up in their conceits, not to applaud their own glory, and to look overly upon
the ignoble multitude, as thoſe which are <hi>Terrae filii,</hi> muſhroms, worthy of
nothing but contempt? Hence it is that proud ones are incompatible with each
other. Look upon other Vices, ye ſhall ſee one Drunkard hug another, one
debauch'd Wanton love another, one Swearer, one Profane beaſt delight in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:
but one Proud man cannot abide another; as one twig cannot bear
two Red-breaſts. Both would be beſt: <hi>Caeſar</hi> will not indure an equal, nor <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a ſuperiour.</p>
            <p>The ſecond are Purſe-proud. <hi>Vermis divitiarum ſuperbia,</hi> as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
<hi>Pride is in the Purſe, as the worm</hi> in the Apple. Thus <hi>Nabal,</hi> becauſe he hath
money in his bags and ſtock on his ground, ſends a ſcornful meſſage to poor
<hi>David,</hi> though a better man then himſelf; <hi>Many ſervants run away from their
Maſters now adaies.</hi> How many examples meet us every where of this kind;
of them which having ſcrap'd together a little money more then their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
look big upon it, and ſcorn the need of the better deſerving, and bluſter
like a tempeſt, and think to bear down even good cauſes before them? <hi>Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das
fortunas decent ſuperbiae,</hi> as the Comedian, <hi>Pride becomes the wealthy.</hi> Thus
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> notes in his time that the rich ſpeaks with commands; the words
weigh according to the Purſe.</p>
            <p>The third are the Skin-proud; for Beauty goes no deeper: ſuch as with <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebel</hi>
lick themſelves, and with <hi>Narciſſus</hi> dote upon their own Faces; thinking
it a wrong in any that ſees them, and admires them not; ſpending all their
thoughts and their time in faſhions and complexion, as if their Soul lay in their
hide; deſpiſing the ordinary forms of vulgar perſons, yea of the moſt beneficial
nature. <hi>Elatus erat animus tuus propter pulcritudinem, Thine heart was lifted
up becauſe of thy beauty,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 28. 17.</p>
            <p>The fourth are the Sinew-proud, which preſume upon their own Strength
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and vigor. <hi>Elatum cor robore,</hi> ſaies the ſame <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 28. 5. As <hi>Goliah,</hi> who

            <p>The fifth is the Skill-proud, puffed up with the conceit of Knowledge; as
Knowledge is indeed of a ſwelling nature. There is much affinity betwixt
Knowledge and Pride: both came out of one Country; for Pride is alſo <hi>nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one
coeleſtis,</hi> as <hi>Hierom</hi> well: and ſince ſhe cannot climbe up thither again, ſhe will
be mounting as high as ſhe can towards it.</p>
            <p>Every ſmatterer thinks all the Circle of Arts confined to the cloſet of his
breaſt; and, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of his haughty friends, that <hi>all wiſdome lives in him,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and dyes with him.</hi> Hence is that curioſity of knowing vain querks of ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
hence ſingularity of opinion hating to go in the common track; hence
impatience of contradiction; hence contempt of the mediocrity of others.
Out of this impatience <hi>Zidkijah</hi> could ſmite <hi>Michaiah</hi> on the eare, and, as buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feting
him double, ſay, <hi>Which way went the Spirit of God from me to thee?</hi> Out
of this contempt the Scribes and Phariſees could ſay, <hi>Turba haec, this Laity, that
knows not the Law, is accurſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beſides theſe five a man may be proud of any thing, yea of nothing, yea
of worſe then nothing, Evil. There may be as much Pride in rags as in tiſſues.
<hi>Diogenes</hi> tramples upon <hi>Plato's</hi> pride, but with another pride. And we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> obſerve, that none are ſo proud as the fouleſt. In what kind ſoever it be,
the more a man reflects upon himſelf, by ſeeking, loving, admiring, the more
proud he is, the more damnable is his Pride. But as in all other caſes Pride is odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to God; ſo moſt of all in point of Religion, and in thoſe matters wherein we
have to doe with God. A proud face, or a proud back, or a proud arm, or a proud
purſe are hateful things: but a proud Religion is ſo much worſe as the ſubject
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:44233:172"/>
ſhould be better. Let this then be the juſt <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> or Teſt of true or falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
That which teacheth us to exalt God moſt, and moſt to depreſs our
ſelves, is the true: that which doth moſt pranck up our ſelves and detract from
God, is the falſe. It was the rule of <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> whom the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> honour
for a Saint, <hi>Hoc piarum mentium eſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This is the part of pious Souls, to aſcribe
nothing to themſelves, all to the Grace of God.</hi> So as how much ſoever a man at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
to the Grace of God, he ſhall not ſwerve from Piety in detracting from
Nature; but if he ſubſtract never ſo little from the Grace of God, and give it
to Nature, he indangers himſelf, and offends.</p>
            <p>In the ſafety of this proof our Doctrine triumphs over the <hi>Romiſh</hi> in all thoſe
Points wherein it oppoſeth ours. Ours ſtands ever on Gods ſide, exalting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
his free Grace and mere Mercy as the cauſes of our Salvation; theirs divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this great work betwixt God and themſelves, Gods Grace and mans Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
and aſcribing that to Merit which we to Mercy. Herein Popery is pure

            </p>
            <p>Thus from the Sin, which is Pride, we deſcend to the Puniſhment, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
is Ruine; <hi>A mans Pride ſhall bring him low.</hi> How can a bladder ſink? Yet Pride,
though it be light in reſpect of the inflation, is heavie in reſpect of the offence:
The guiltineſs is as a milſtone to which it is tied, that will bear it down to
the bottome of the deep. As therefore there is a reflex action in the Sin, ſo is
there in the Puniſhment; it ſhall ruine it ſelf. No other hands ſhall need to be
uſed in the Judgement beſides her own. As the lightning hath ever a ſpight at
the high ſpires and tall pines, ſtriking them down or firing them, when the
ſhrubs and cotages ſtand untouched: ſo hath the God that made it, at a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advanced
Greatneſs; whether out of a ſcorn of rivality, or a juſt puniſhment of
theft; for the Proud man both in a curſed emulation makes himſelf his own <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

How many have we known that have been faſtidious of their Diet, which have

is a cloſe one, it will cleave faſt to you; yea ſo cloſe, that ye can hardly diſcern

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> The ſweeter part of this Ditty follows, which is of Mercy; Mercy which
hath two ſtrains alſo, the Grace, the Reward. The gratious diſpoſition, (for
a Vertue properly it is not) is Humility, expreſſed here in the Subject, <hi>The hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in ſpirit.</hi> Not he that is forcibly humbled by others, whether God or man;
(ſo a wicked <hi>Ahab</hi> may walk ſoftly and droop for the time, and be never the
better: What thank is it if we bow when God ſets his foot upon us?) but he
that is voluntarily humble in ſpirit. And yet there are alſo vicious kinds of this
ſelf-humility.</p>
            <p>As firſt, when man having only God <hi>ſupra ſe,</hi> and therefore owing religious
worſhip to him alone, worſhips Angels or Saints that are but <hi>juxta ſe.</hi> It is the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> charge that S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives to his <hi>Coloſsians, Let no man deceive you in a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
humility, and worſhipping of Angels:</hi> much leſs then of ſtocks and ſtones. Theſe
very walls, if they had eyes and tongues, could teſtifie full many of theſe impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Idolatrous cringes and proſtrations. So as if wood or ſtone could be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of pollution, here was enough; till this abuſed frame was happily wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
by the clear ſtreams of the Goſpel, and re-ſanctified by the Word and
Prayer. This is a Superſtitious Humility.</p>
            <p>2. When a man baſely ſubjects himſelf to ſerve the humors of the Great by
groſs ſupparaſitation, by either unjuſt or unfit actions and offices; yielding
himſelf a ſlave to the Times, a pander to Vice. This is a Servile Humility.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 3. When a man affects a courteous affability and lowly carriage for oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for advantage; or when a man buries himſelf alive in an homely cowle, in
a pretence of mortification; as if he went out of the world, when the world is
within him. <hi>To be proud of Humility,</hi> as a Father ſaid well, <hi>is worſe then to be
ſuperciliouſly and openly proud.</hi> This is an Hypocritical Humility.</p>
            <p>4. When out of puſillanimity or inordinateneſs a man proſtitutes himſelf to
thoſe unworthy conditions and actions of ſinful pleaſure that miſ-beſeem a man,
a Chriſtian. This is a Brutiſh Humility. All theſe ſelf-humiliations are thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and faulty. It will be long enough ere the Superſtitious, Servile, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical,
Brutiſh Humility ſhall advance us other then to the ſcaffold of our
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> execution.</p>
            <p>The True Humility is, when a man is modeſtly lowly in his own eyes, and
ſincerely abaſed in his heart and carriage before God. And this ſelf-humiliation
is either in reſpect of Temporal or Spiritual things. Of Temporal, when a
man thinks any condition good enough for him; and therefore doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly
intrude himſelf into the preferments of the world, whether in Church or
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:44233:173"/>
Commonwealth. When he thinks meanly of his own parts and actions, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
and reverently of others; and therefore in giving honour goes before others,
in taking it behind them.</p>
            <p>Of Spiritual, when he is vile in himſelf, eſpecially in reſpect of his ſins, and
therefore abhors himſelf in ſackcloth and aſhes: when the Grace that he hath
he can acknowledge, but not over-rate; yea he takes it ſo low as he may do
without wrong to the giver: when for all Bleſſings he can awfully look up to
his Creator and Redeemer, aſcribing all to him, referring all to him, depending
for all upon him; ſo much more magnifying the Mercy of God, as he is more
ſenſible of his own Unworthineſs.</p>
            <p>This is the true, though ſhort, character of Humility. A plain Grace, ye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
ſee, but lovely. From which let it pleaſe you to turn your eyes to the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
allotted to it: which is ſo expreſſed in the Original, that it may either
run, <hi>The humble in ſpirit ſhall enjoy honour,</hi> as in the former Tranſlation; or,
<hi>Honour ſhall uphold the humble in ſpirit,</hi> as in the latter. In both, Honour is the
portion of the humble; for the raiſing of him in the one, for the preſerving of
him in the other.</p>
            <p>Honour, from whom? From God, from men. Even the good man of the
houſe will ſay, <hi>Friend, ſit up higher.</hi> For though with vain men he is moſt ſet
by that can moſt ſet our himſelf: yet with the wiſer, the more a man dejects
himſelf, the more he is honoured. It cannot ſtand with the juſtice of the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-vertuous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
to ſuffer a man to be a loſer by his Humility: Much leſs will
God abide it. <hi>A broken heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt;
and, <hi>Pullati extolluntur ſalute, The mourners are exalted with ſafety,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi>
in <hi>Job</hi> 5. 11. <hi>The Lord lifteth up the meek,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> out of good
proof; and needs muſt he riſe whom God lifteth. What ſhould we need any
other precedent of this Vertue, or other example of this Reward, then our
Bleſſed Saviour himſelf? all other are worthy of forgetfulneſs in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
<hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equall with God;
but made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>and being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
unto death, even the death of the Croſs.</hi> O God, what an incomprehenſible
dejection was here! that the living God ſhould deſcend from the higheſt Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Heaven, and put upon him the rags of our Humanity; and take on him
not the man onely, but the ſervant, yea the malefactor; abaſing himſelf to our
infirmities, to our indignities, to be reviled, ſpat upon, ſcourged, wounded, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified:
yea all theſe are eaſie tasks to that which follows; to be made a mark
of his Fathers wrath in our ſtead, ſo as in the bitterneſs of his Soul he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to cry out, <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> What heart of
man, yea what apprehenſion of Angels can be capable of fadoming the depth of
this Humiliation?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwerable to thy dejection, O Saviour, was thine exaltation; as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit-water
riſes at leaſt as high as it falls. Now is thy <hi>name above every name;
that at the name of JESUS every knee ſhould how, of things in Heaven, in
earth, under the earth.</hi> Neither meaneſt thou to be our Saviour onely, but our
pattern too. I do not hear thee ſay, Learn of me for I am Almighty, I am
Omniſcient; but, <hi>Learn of me that I am meek.</hi> If we can go down the ſteps
of thine Humiliation, we ſhall riſe up the ſtairs of thy Glory. Why do we
not then ſay, <hi>I will be yet more vile for the Lord?</hi> Oh <hi>caſt down</hi> your <hi>crowns</hi>
with the twenty four Elders (<hi>Apoc.</hi> 4. 10.) <hi>before the Throne of God: Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

            </p>
            <p>Indeed there is none of us but hath juſt cauſe to be humbled, whether we
conſider the wretchedneſs of our Nature or of our Eſtate. What is the beſt
fleſh and blood but a pack of duſt made up together into a ſtirring heap, which
in the diſſolution molders to duſt again?</p>

falling aſunder; for even of the greateſt and beſt-compoſed is that of the Pſalm
verified, <hi>Univerſa vanitas omnis homo, Every man is all vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alas then, what is it we ſhould be proud of? Is it Wealth? What is the
richeſt metal but red and white earth? And that whereof too we may ſay,
as the Sons of the Prophets of their hatchet, <hi>Alas, Maſter, it was but lent.</hi>
What ſpeak I of this, when our very breath is not our own? The beſt praiſe
of Coin is, that it is current, it runs from us; yea it is <hi>volatile,</hi> as wiſe <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,

            <p>Is it our Land? How long is that ours? That ſhall be fixed when we are

he calls for a Map, looks for <hi>Greece,</hi> and finding it, asks <hi>Alcibiades</hi> where
his lands lay. When he anſwered they were not laid forth in the Map. Why
(ſaid <hi>Socrates</hi>) art thou proud of that which is no part of the earth? What
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> a poor ſpot is the dominion of the greateſt King? but what a nothing is the

            <p>Is it our Honour? Alas, that is none of ours; for Honour is in him that
gives it, not in him that receives it. And if the Plebeians will be ſtubborn
or uncivil and reſpectleſs, where is Honour? and when we have it, what a

            <p>THere cannot be a more loyal ſpeech as it may be uſed; One Sun is
enough for Heaven, one King for earth: But as it is uſed, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a worſe. For in ſo few words, theſe Jews flatter <hi>Caeſar,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
Chriſt, oppoſe Chriſt to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Firſt, pretending they were
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s ſubjects; ſecondly, profeſſing they were not Chriſts ſubjects; thirdly,
arguing, that they could not be Chriſt's ſubjects becauſe they were <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s.
The firſt by way of affirmation, <hi>Caeſar is our King:</hi> the ſecond by way of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
<hi>No King but Caeſar:</hi> the third by way of implication, <hi>Chriſt is not our
King, becauſe Caeſar is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt was a truth; <hi>Caeſar</hi> was indeed now their King, but againſt their
wils. Conqueſt had made his name unwelcome. They ſay true then, and yet
they flatter. Wonder not at this; a man may flatter, yea lye, in ſpeaking truth,
when his heart believes not the title that his tongue gives. So it was with
theſe Jews; they call'd him King, whom they malign'd as an Uſurper. For
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> they feeding themſelves with the conceit of being God's free people, wherein
<hi>Judas Gaulonites</hi> and <hi>Sadducus</hi> the Phariſee had ſoothed them, hated him as an
enemy, whom they were forced to fear as their King, holding it no better then
a ſinful vaſſalage to ſtoop unto an Heathen ſcepter. Ye know the queſtion
moved upon the Tribute-money, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 17. <hi>Is it lawful to pay tribute
to Caeſar?</hi> Lo, they ſay not, <hi>Is it needful?</hi> but, <hi>Is it lawful?</hi> The <hi>Herodians</hi>
were a Faction that had never moved this queſtion, unleſs the Phariſees and
their ſcrupulous clients had denied it. They make it a difficulty not of purſe,
but of conſcience, <hi>Licetne? Is it lawful?</hi> Yet here, <hi>Regem habemus Caeſarem,
Caeſar is our King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> They liked well enough to have a King; yea hereupon they were ſo ready
to ſwagger with God and his <hi>Samuel:</hi> They had learn'd of Nature and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

of their own. As God ſaid of the great Prophet, ſo they are glad to hear him
ſay of their King, <hi>De numero fratrum tuorum, From among thy brethren.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
is in nothing more pleaſing then in matter of Government. It is a joy
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:44233:175"/>
to think we have a King of our own; our own blood, our own Religion; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
to the motto of our Princes, Ich Dicn: Otherwiſe next to Anarchy
is Heterarchy; neither do we find much difference betwixt having no head at all,
and having another mans head on our ſhoulders. The Bees love to have a King,
but one that is of their own hive: If an Hornet come in and offer to rule
amongſt them, (though ſtronger) they abide not the colour. It was <hi>Edomitiſh</hi>
blood that made <hi>Herod</hi> ſo hateful, though otherwiſe of no ſmall merit. Now
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> though he were their King actually in regard of power, yet they held
him no better then an Intruder in regard of right. For at firſt here was no

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
and <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi> now <hi>Judaea</hi> was glad to turn tributary, and of a friend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a vaſſal, as ye ſee in the taxation of <hi>Auguſtus, Luk.</hi> 2. 1. and ſo continued
with no ſmall regret. <hi>Caeſar</hi> therefore was to them a Pagan for Religion, a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for Uſurpation; at the beſt, <hi>an alien from the Commonwealth of Iſrael;</hi>
and therefore (as they imagined) not capable of being the head of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> This
of the <hi>Romans</hi> is taken for that <hi>regnum Gentium, the Kingdome of the Gentiles,
Hagg.</hi> 2. 22. by an Antonomaſie; which was therefore ſo much more hated, as
it was more prevalent and imperious. And ye know their fearful ſuggeſtion,
<hi>Venient Romani, the Romans will come,</hi> Joh. 11. 48. It was obſerved of old by
<hi>Hierome,</hi> and ſince by <hi>Galatinus</hi> and others, indeed who could look beſide it?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
that the <hi>Thalmud</hi> and the ancient Rabbins, whereſoever they find the name of
<hi>Edom</hi> or <hi>Idumaea</hi> in the Old Teſtament, there they think ſtraight <hi>Rome</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood;
and this was with them that <hi>Onus Duma,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſay 21. 11.</note> in the Prophet <hi>Eſay.</hi> A miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſion
that ariſes (as <hi>Jerome</hi> gueſſes aright) by occaſion of the letters of <hi>Duma</hi>

and the ſame letter in the Hebrew forms both <hi>O</hi> and <hi>U.</hi> Hence
they gave out <hi>Caeſar</hi> for an <hi>Idumaean,</hi> and branded all that Nation with the
curſes of <hi>Edom.</hi> Abſurdly, as we well know; for <hi>Edom,</hi> or <hi>Eſau,</hi> was <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s
Son, whereas we <hi>Europeans</hi> came of <hi>Japhet.</hi> But this ſhews their good will
both to <hi>Caeſar</hi> and his Country; no Nation under Heaven was more odious to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
them, againſt whom they heartily praied in their ſenſe, <hi>Remember, O Lord, the
children of Edom,</hi> Pſal. 137. 7. Yet here, <hi>Regem habemus Caeſarem, Caeſar is our
King.</hi> Neither was this the note of the chief Prieſts onely, which had learn'd
to flatter by art; but of the hollow multitude, who had ſaid (verſ. 12.) <hi>If thou
let this man go, thou art not Caeſar</hi>'s <hi>friend.</hi> As if all were now grown fond of
that Soveraignty which they hated.</p>
            <p>This is enough to let our <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſee that fair tongues are not alwaies true.
In the Pſalm which our late <hi>Auguſtus</hi> of ever-Bleſſed Memory choſe for the
Anniverſaries of his deliverance both from the <hi>Cowries</hi> and the Powder, (<hi>Pſal.</hi>
18.) ye find this clauſe (verſ. 45.) <hi>ſtrange children ſhall diſſemble with me;</hi> which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

not at the difference; the Hebrews take the word <gap reason="foreign">

more ſubmiſs then the falſeſt; ſome whereof, whiles with deep proteſtations
of fidelity they were writing quodlibetical invectives againſt the perfidiouſneſs
of ſome buſioſpirits of their own Faction, we have ſeen fall foul upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
Treaſon. It was not for nothing that under the picture of that lame
Souldier which at laſt hath ſhouldred into the Calender, was written, <hi>Cavete
vobis, Principes, Look to your ſelves, ye Great Ones.</hi> Believe Actions, believe not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
Words. If thoſe that refuſe to profeſs Allegeance muſt needs be unſound, would
to God they were all ſound that ſwear it. Even <hi>Judas</hi> could ſay, <hi>Hail, Maſter;</hi>
and theſe colloguing Jews, <hi>Regem habemus Caeſarem, We have Caeſar for our
King.</hi> Do ye not mark how this note is changed? The chief Prieſts ſaid here,
<hi>Non habemus Regem niſi Caeſarem, We have no King but Caeſar:</hi> Now there is an
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:44233:175"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> High-Prieſt that ſays, <hi>Non habemus Regem Caeſarem;</hi> yea <hi>Caeſar</hi> is his Eſculer,
or his Lacky. The exemption of the Spiritualty from <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the ſubjection of
<hi>Caeſar</hi> to the head of the Spiritualty, are points that would have been as ſtrange
to the chief Prieſts of thoſe times as they are familiar to ours. But, O Souls
not unworthy of a proud inſultation, that thus willingly abaſe their Crowns to
a tyrannous Mitre!</p>
            <p>It was too good a word this for Jews, <hi>Regem habemus, we have a King:</hi>
That which they held their miſery, was more happineſs then they could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
to be Subjects. The very name of a King carries protection, order, peace:
For <hi>Rex judicio,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The King by judgement eſtabliſheth the Land,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 4. Who knows not that, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17. 6. <hi>In thoſe days there was no King in
Iſrael:</hi> and what of that? <hi>Every one did that which was right in his own eyes.</hi>
Anarchy is lawleſs, diſſolute, confuſed. What other is the King then the Head
of the body, the Eye in the head, the Ball in that eye? <hi>Lucernam aptavi uncto meo,
I have prepared a light for mine anointed,</hi> Pſal. 132. 17. without which the whole
State muſt needs, like a blinded <hi>Polyphemus,</hi> reel, and ſtagger, and grovel. If
<hi>Solomon</hi> note it as a wonder in the Locuſts, <hi>That they have no King, and yet go
forth by bands;</hi> S. <hi>John</hi> notes it in the infernal Locuſts, that <hi>they have a King,
and his name is Abaddon,</hi> Revel. 9. 11. Not to ſpeak of Heaven or Earth then,
even Hell it ſelf ſtands not without a Government; the very region of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> conſiſts not without ſo much Order: Take this away, Earth would be
Hell, and what would Hell be?</p>
            <p>There are Nations, I doubt not, that may ſay, <hi>Dediſti Regem in ira, Thou haſt
given us a King in thine anger,</hi> Hoſ. 13. 11. But for us, we may ſay, <hi>ut ros ſuper
herbam, His favour is as the dew upon the graſs,</hi> Prov. 19. 12. and ſhall juſtly ſhut
up with old <hi>David, Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, who hath thus repleniſhed
our Throne, as our eyes ſee it this day,</hi> 1 Kings 1. 48. And if we do in the joy of
our hearts ſay, <hi>Habemus Regem;</hi> why ſhould not he with equal reflection of joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
heart ſay, <hi>Habemus Subditos.</hi> Tribute, Honour, Fear, Prayers, Love, Life is
not too dear for our <hi>Caeſar.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> This is enough for the Affirmation, <hi>Caeſar</hi> is our King: the Negation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<hi>We have no King but Caeſar.</hi> The negative as it is univerſal, excluding all;
ſo it ſpecially ſingles out Chriſt, whom <hi>Pilate</hi> had lately nam'd for their King.
None, therefore not this <hi>Jeſus.</hi> A Rebellious proteſtation, and no better then
Blaſphemie in the mouth of Jews, of Prieſts: For could they be ignorant of the
Kingdome of the <hi>Meſsiah?</hi> yea of this <hi>Meſsiah?</hi> Was not this King of the Jews
Fore-figured by <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> King of <hi>Salem? ſedec,</hi> we know, is <hi>Juſtice, ſalem</hi> is
<hi>Peace;</hi> the fruit of his Juſtice is Peace. Fore-propheſied to be <hi>the Prince of

throne, O God, is for ever, and the ſcepter of thy Kingdome is a right ſcepter.</hi>
Honoured with due homage? <hi>The Kings of the earth ſhall bring preſents to thee,</hi>
ſaith the Pſalmiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> And yet this King, thus Preſigured, Fore-propheſied, Conſtituted, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,

Roman Government which they honoured in a corrivality and oppoſition
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:44233:176"/>
to Chriſt, ſhall revenge the quarrel of Chriſt in the utter ſubverſion of theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
unthankful Rebels. <hi>Oh fooliſh people and unjuſt! do ye thus requite the Lord?</hi> Did
he empty himſelf of his Celeſtial Glory, and put on weak Manhood and all the
ſymptoms of wretched Mortality; and do ye deſpiſe him for this Mercy? Is he
ſo vile to you, becauſe he was ſo vile for you? Did his Love make him humble,
that his Humility ſhould make him contemptible? Did <hi>he chuſe</hi> you <hi>out of all
the kingdomes of the earth,</hi> and do ye wilfully reject him? Hear therefore, ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſers,
and tremble; hear the juſt doom of him who will be your Judge, if he
ſhall not be your Saviour: <hi>Thoſe mine enemies that would not I ſhould reign over

            <p>
               <hi>Lord, it is done as thou haſt commanded, and yet there is room.</hi> Do we think <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
that Chriſt hath no Rebels but Jews? Would to God we ſinners of the
Gentiles had not ſaid, <hi>Diſrumpamus vincula, Let us break his bonds, and caſt his
cords from us.</hi> What are his bonds but his Laws; his cords but Religious inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions?
Theſe flie about mens ears like rotten tow, binding none but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent.
The bounds of his <hi>Kingdome are the ends of the earth.</hi> It is an hard word
(yet I muſt ſay it;) Oh that there were not more Traitors in the world then
Subjects! Tell not me what mens Tongues ſay; their Lives ſay loud enough,
<hi>Nolumus hunc,</hi> Chriſt is no King for us. Obedience is the true touch-ſtone of
Loyalty; not Proteſtations, not outward Cringes, not disburſement of Tribute.
We have all ſolemnly ſworn allegeance to the God of Heaven; we are ready <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
to bow at the dear name of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> we ſtick not, perhaps, to give <hi>obedientiam
burſalem,</hi> as <hi>Gerſon</hi> cals it, to God: but when it comes once to the deniall of

children of our own accurſed wombs, to the offering up our <hi>bodies</hi> and Souls
<hi>as a reaſonable and lively ſacrifice; hîc Rhodus, hîc ſaltus.</hi> Kings rule by their

continuance in wilful ſins cannot ſtand with our Subjection. <hi>Quomodo legis?
How readeſt thou</hi> then? as our Saviour asks. What ſaies thy Law-giver in <hi>Sinai?
Thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me.</hi> If now thou rear up in thy boſome altars

thou haſt defied Chriſt for thy King. God ſaies, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the Name

out of the helliſh track of Oaths, Blaſphemies, prophane Scoffs, thou haſt defied
Chriſt. God ſayes, <hi>Thou ſhalt keep holy the Sabbath day.</hi> If now thou ſhalt

do we think thus to ſhake off the yoak of Chriſt? In ſpight of men and devils,
he will be their King who do moſt grin and gnaſh at his Soveraignty. Feel, O

Let me have leave to ſay that this charge is there given to the great

            <p>Thus much of the Negation, <hi>Chriſt is not our King.</hi> The Implication follows,
<hi>Chriſt is not our King, becauſe Caeſar is.</hi> The Anabaptiſt and the Jew are ſo croſs,
that I wonder how one <hi>Amſterdam</hi> can hold them both: The Anabaptiſt ſaies,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>Caeſar</hi> is not our King, becauſe Chriſt is; the Jew ſaies, Chriſt is not our King,
becauſe <hi>Caeſar</hi> is: Both of them equally abſurd. Could there be a more ignorant
Paralogiſme then this wherewith the fooliſh Jews beguiled themſelves? as if
theſe two, Chriſt and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> had been utterly incompatible. This ſenſeleſs
miſpriſion was guilty of all the plots againſt Chriſt. <hi>Herod</hi> no ſooner hears of
a King of the Jews, then he ſtartles up, and is ſtraight jealous of his Crown:
the Jews hear of a King, and they are jealous of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Crown: the <hi>Caeſars</hi>
following hear of a King, and they are jealous of the Jews; for, as <hi>Suetonius</hi>
tels us in the Life of <hi>Veſpaſian, Percrebuerat in Oriente toto vetus &amp; conſtans opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,
eſſe in fatis at Judaei hoc tempore rerum potirentur, It was an old and conſtant
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> conceit all the Eaſt over, that the Jews were about this time deſtin'd to rule.</hi> This
was on all hands an ignorant, an injurious ſcrupuloſity. O vain men! could they
but have known that this was he that truly ſaid, <hi>Per me Reges regnant, By me
Kings reign,</hi> they had concluded, <hi>Caeſar</hi> could be no King but from him:
Earthly juriſdiction is derived from this Heavenly. It is he that makes
this a Monarch, that a Prince, that other a Peer; <hi>Omnis poteſtas, All power
is given to</hi> him <hi>both in Heaven and earth,</hi> and from him to men. <hi>Caeſar</hi>
hath his Crown from Chriſt; ſo farre is Chriſt from pulling the Crown
from <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were two points of State, which if they had known, would have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> them from theſe idle fears; the Subordination, the Diverſity of Chriſts
Kingdome and <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s. Subordination, for Chriſt is the founder of all juſt
Soveraignty, he can be no enemy to it. Plainly, Chriſt is <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Lord, <hi>Caeſar</hi>
is Chriſts Deputy: The deputed power is not againſt the Original, but as by
it, ſo for it. As <hi>Caeſar</hi> was Chriſts Lord <hi>in forma ſervi;</hi> (ye know his charge,
<hi>Give to Caeſar the things that are Caeſar's;</hi> and the liquid cofer of the Sea ſhall
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:44233:177"/>
rather yield the <hi>Didrachma</hi> then he will not pay it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 27.) ſo Chriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
is <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Lord in the Soveraignty of his Deity; <hi>Solus ſupra Caeſarem Deus,
qui fecit Caeſarem, None above Caeſar, but the God that made Caeſar,</hi> as that Father
ſaid. There can be no Contrariety in Subordination. So is <hi>Caeſar</hi> to Chriſt, as
Earth is to Heaven; under, not againſt it. All the life and motion of any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
creature is from the influences of Heaven; without which this whole Globe
were nothing but a dull and droſſie clod.</p>
            <p>And as here is Subordination one way, ſo Diverſity another. <hi>Pilate</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd
our Saviour punctually of his kingdome, <hi>Art thou a King?</hi> He denies
not, but diſtinguiſhes; <hi>My kingdome is not of this world,</hi> Joh. 18. 36. Lo, Chriſts
kingdome was not of this world; <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s was not of the other: here can be no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
danger of oppoſition. <hi>Audite Judaei, audite Gentes,</hi> as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> wittily, <hi>Hear,
O Jews, hear, O Gentiles, I hinder not your Dominion in this world, for mine is
of another. Fear not</hi> Herod<hi>'s vain fear, who killed the Infants to rid Chriſt
(timendo magìs quam iraſcendo crudelior) more cruel in his fear then in his rage.
My Kingdome,</hi> he ſaies, <hi>is not of this world. Oh come then to that Kingdome
which is not of this world; come in believing, and do not tyrannize in fearing.</hi>
Thus he. <hi>This King came not into the world to ſubdue Kings by fighting, but to
win them by dying,</hi> as <hi>Fulgentius</hi> well. <hi>Neither doth he take away mortal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
who gives Heavenly,</hi> as the Chriſtian Poet ſaid aright.</p>
            <p>Upon both theſe grounds therefore, it is a blaſphemous inconſequence, <hi>Caeſar</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
is our King, therefore not Chriſt: yea, therefore <hi>Caeſar,</hi> becauſe Chriſt. Religion
doth not croſs Policy, but perfects it rather. Give me leave, I beſeech you, to
preſs this Point a little.</p>
            <p>It is Religion that teacheth us that God hath ordained Kingly Soveraignty,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. ordained it immediately. That Poſition was worthy of a Red Hat,

the book <hi>de Laicis;</hi> purpoſely raiſed to depreſs the Dignity of Kings, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the Prieſthood. I am ſure, <hi>Samuel</hi> (when it was) ſaid, <hi>Ecce, prafecit vobis
Jehova Regem, Behold, God hath ſet a Kiog over you,</hi> 1 Sam. 12. 13. And Kings are
wont to have no leſs title then <hi>Unctus Jehove,</hi> the <hi>Anointed of the Lord;</hi> not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>unctus populi,</hi> the anointed of the people, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 6. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>Daniel</hi>
could ſay of God, <hi>He removes Kings, and ſetteth up Kings,</hi> Dan. 2. 21. What
need I perſwade Chriſtian Kings and Princes, that they hold their Crowns and
Scepters as in fee from the God of Heaven? <hi>Cyrus</hi> himſelf had ſo much Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<hi>Ezra</hi> 1. 2.</p>
            <p>It is Religion that teaches us that the ſame power which ordained <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
injoyns all faithful Subjection to <hi>Caeſar; not for fear, but for conſcience,</hi> Rom.
13. 5. <hi>Tribute to whom tribute, honour to whom honour;</hi> yea all devout prayers
for a <hi>Nero</hi> himſelf, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. curbing both the tongue and the heart,
<hi>Thou ſhalt not curſe the King in thy thoughts, nor the rich in thy Bed-chamber,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
Eccleſ. 10. 20. It is Religion that teaches us that vengeance ſhall be ſure to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Rebellion, <hi>Nuntius crudelis,</hi> Prov. 17. 21. yea, no leſs then Hell and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2.</p>
            <p>Curſed be they that ſay Religion is onely to keep men in awe; and curſed
be he that ſays there is any ſo ſure way to keep men in awe as Religion. Go ye
crafty Politicks, and rake hell for reaſons of State; ye ſhall once find that
<hi>there is no wiſdome, nor underſtanding, nor counſel againſt the Lord.</hi> It was a true
and well-grounded reſolution of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> That <hi>they cannot be faithful to
their King, who are perfidious to their God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the great <hi>Caeſars</hi> of the world then know, that the more ſubject they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
are to Chriſt, the more ſure they are of the Loyalty of their Subjects to them.
Neither is there in all the world any ſo firm and ſtreight bond to tye the
hearts of their people to them, as true Religion to God. To conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Chriſt is not <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s rival, but <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Lord and Patron. <hi>Caeſar</hi> rules by his
Laws, Chriſt by Religion. If Execution be the Life of Laws, I am ſure Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:44233:177"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is the life of Execution. In ſhort, Religion is the ſtrongeſt pillar of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
the baſe of the Palace, the feet and armes of the Chair of State, the frame
of the Councel-bord. As ye love your Peace, ye Great ones, make much of
it; plant it where it is not, enlarge it where it is, maintain it at home, incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
it abroad. And if diſtreſſed Religion ſhall come with her face blubber'd
and her garments rent, wringing her hands and tearing her hair, and ſhall
proſtrate her ſelf at the feet of earthly Greatneſs for lawful ſuccour, with <hi>veni
opitulari, come and help,</hi> as <hi>Macedonia</hi> in the <hi>Acts;</hi> wo be to the power that
fails it; and bleſſed, thrice bleſſed from Heaven be that hand that ſhall raiſe her
on her feet, and wipe off her teares, and ſtretch out it ſelf mightily for her
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſafe-guard. Let me never proſper if that hand make not that head immortally
glorious.</p>
            <p>For us, bleſſed be God, we live here in the warm Zone, where the hot
beams of the Sun of Righteouſneſs beat right down upon our heads. But what
need I tell your Sacred Majeſty that in the North-weſt part of your Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
there are ſome that live in the frozen and dark Climate of Ignorance and
Superſtition, whoſe eyes have ſeldome (if ever) been bleſt with ſo much as
an oblique irradiation of the Goſpel? I know the bowels of your Princely
compaſſion cannot but be ſtirred with the miſery of theſe poor <hi>Cimmerian</hi>
ſouls, that have not ſo much light as to wiſh more. Oh may it pleaſe your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Majeſty to ſhine into thoſe darkſome corners, by improving your Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Authority to the commanding of a Learned and Powerful Miniſtry
amongſt them. Let true Religion be letled in them, and true Religion ſhall
ſettle their hearts to your Majeſty more then all conqueſts, lawes, violences,
oaths, indearments whatſoever. And for theſe happy Regions which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
illuminated with the ſaving Doctrine of <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt, may it pleaſe you
to forbid their impuration by the noiſome fogs and miſts of thoſe miſ-opinions,
whoſe very Principles are profeſſedly rebellious; as being well aſſured that
the more your Majeſty ſhall advance the Spiritual Kingdome of Chriſt, the
more he ſhall advance the ſtrength and glory of your Temporal: the more
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> perfectly he is your Chriſt, the more unmoveably ſhall you be his <hi>Caeſar.</hi> And
may he ſtill and ever be yours, and you his, till earth and time be no more; till

            <p>THE ſame Pſalme that lately yielded us a Song of Thankſgiving,
now affords us a Prayer for Victory: Such variety of ſpiritual
Flowers grows in every bed of this Divine Garden. Our occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
cannot change ſo oft, as God can fit us with change of notes.
The laſt verſe before my Text, was a prediction of Kings bringing Preſents to
God; this is a Prayer for diſſipation of enemies. It is not for nothing that
the Pſalmiſt interrupts his Prophecy with a Petition. Hoſtility blocks up the
way to Devotion. Even the Laws of God are ſilent in the claſhing of Armes; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
That Kings may bring preſents to God, God muſt give an happy ceſſation of
armes to them. It is not long ſince we ſaw the Lords Anointed approach to
this altar of God with preſents of Thankſgiving, for our late deliverance from
the raging Peſtilence: Now we come to ſue, and expect that God would
crown his Royal head with garlands of Victory; and <hi>rebuke the company of
ſpear-men, the multitude of Bulls, with the calves of the people;</hi> and <hi>ſcatter the
people that delight in war.</hi> May it pleaſe you, firſt, to ſee the Enemies, then
the Defeat. The Enemy is deſcribed by a threefold title. 1. <hi>Fera arundinis,
the company of the ſpear-men,</hi> or, <hi>beaſts of the reeds. 2. The multitude of Bulls,
with the calves of the people. 3. The people that delight in warre.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
is double, <hi>Increpa,</hi> and <hi>Diſsipa, Rebuke,</hi> and <hi>Scatter. Rebuke</hi> is for the
two firſt; yet not abſolutely, but with limitation, (<hi>Till they ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with pieces of ſilver.) Diſsipation</hi> is for the laſt; <hi>Scatter the people that
delight in warre.</hi> Thoſe that will be unjuſtly warring are worthy of rebuke;
but thoſe that delight in warre are fit for nothing but confuſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:44233:178"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> To begin with the firſt. Why doth the ſame Hebrew word ſignifie <hi>a Beaſt,</hi>
and <hi>a Company?</hi> Is it becauſe the Multitude is <hi>bellua multorum capitum, a
beaſt of many heads?</hi> Or is it becauſe of the ſociable nature even of brute crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which ſtill affect to herd and flock together? For, leſt any man ſtumble
at the word, that which is here tranſlated <hi>fera,</hi> is by the ſame hand turned <hi>pecus,</hi>
ver. 11.</p>
            <p>Both the ſenſes doe well, a Beaſt, or a Company: The one implyes the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of the Churches Enemies, that they are of a fierce and beſtial diſpoſition;
the other, their number and combination. For the former, Who can expreſs
the ſavage Cruelty of the enemies of the Goſpell? Look into the ancient ſtory
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of the infancy of Chriſtianity, ye ſhall ſee how men ſet their wits on the rack
to deviſe torments. To ſhew you that in a painted table which poor Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
felt, would be a ſpectacle of too much horror. What ſhould I lay before
you their Gibbets, Wheels, Stakes, Caldrons, Furnaces, and all their fearful
pomps of death? What ſhould I tell you of men dreſſed every way that meats
were for the palate? Here was ſlaying, frying, boiling, broiling, roaſting, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
haching, and all poſſible kinds of hideous forms of Murder. To forget
all old immanities, what ſhould I ſhew you the flames of our late <hi>Marian</hi> times?
what ſhould I bring you into the holy inquiſition, and ſhew you there all the
bloody engines of torture, an Hell upon earth? what ſhould I preſent you
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with the whips, halters and knives of Eighty eight? or raiſe up your hair with
the report of thoſe <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cruelties which were exerciſed upon our men in
the <hi>Indies</hi> during the late warre? Death was but a ſport in reſpect of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in dying. Lo here, a Beaſt; yea, not <hi>Beſtia,</hi> but <hi>Fera,</hi> a Savage beaſt;
yea worſe then either. Did ever man doe thus to beaſt? If a <hi>Baptiſta Porta</hi>
have deviſed a way to roaſt a Foul quick; or ſome <hi>Italian</hi> executioner of glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony
have beaten a Swine dead with gentle blows, to make a Cardinals mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel;
every ingenuous man is ready to cry out of this barbarous Tyranny, yea
the very <hi>Turks</hi> would puniſh it with no leſs then death: yea if a <hi>Syracuſan</hi>
boy ſhall but pick out a Crows eyes, thoſe Pagans could mulct him with
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> baniſhment. Nay, what beaſt did ever thus to man? nay, did ever one
beaſt doe thus to another? If they gore and graſp one another in their fury,
or feed on each other in the rage of their hunger, that is all; they do not take
pleaſure in ſaucing each others death with varieties or delaies of pain. None
but man doth thus to man; and in none lightly but the quarrel of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Falſe Zeal takes pleaſure in ſurfeits of blood, and can injoy others tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Hence are bloody Maſſacres, treacherous Aſſaſſinations, helliſh Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-plots,
and whatever ſtratagem of miſchief can be deviſed by that ancient
man-ſlayer; from whoſe malicious and ſecret machinations good Lord deliver us.</p>
            <p>As the enemies of the Church are <hi>Fera, a Beaſt,</hi> ſo they are <hi>coetus, a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> yea, a multitude. Well may they ſay with the Devil in the poſſeſſed man,
<hi>My name is Legion, for we are many;</hi> a Legion of many thouſands: yea, <hi>Gad,

and they are enemies. Of thoſe other five that remain, there is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian
Faction that challenges univerſality; and they are enemies. Stand

ſcattered like graſhoppers in the valley, and tell me whether the Church have
not reaſon to ſay, <hi>Lord, how many are they that riſe up againſt me?</hi> Yet when
all is done, (that no man may be diſcouraged) if we have but our eyes opened
with <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s ſervant, to ſee the hoaſt of Heaven glittering about us, we ſhall
boldly ſay, <hi>There are more with us then againſt us.</hi>

Yet if theſe that are againſt us were many, and not united, it were nothing.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
A large ſhowr loſeth it ſelf, whiles the drops are ſcattered in the ſands; but
many drops met make a torrent, yea an Ocean. Here is <hi>coetus;</hi> their heads,
their hearts, their hands are laid together. And why do not we learn wit
and will of thoſe that hate us? why are we ſeveral, whiles they are conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
why ſhould partial Factions and private fancies diſtract us, when the

            </p>
            <p>But why <hi>fera arundinis, the beaſt of the reeds?</hi> I do not tell you of S.<hi>Jerome</hi>'s <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
deſcant upon <hi>beſtia calami, the beaſt of the quill,</hi> that is, writers for falſhood;
though theſe, theſe are the great Incendiaries of the world, and well worthy of
the deepeſt increpation. Here doubtleſs, either the beaſts of the reeds are
the beaſts that lye among the reeds; (as <hi>Caſsiodorus</hi> hath given us an hint,
<hi>Leones domeſtica canneta reliquerunt, The Lions have leſt the reedy thickets</hi>)
or elſe the reed is here the ſpear, or dart. We know ſome regions yield
groves of reeds; ye would think them ſo many ſaplings or ſamplars at the
leaſt; <hi>arboreſcere ſolent calami,</hi> as <hi>Calvin.</hi> Theſe were of uſe in warre for
darts or ſpears. The vant-gard therefore of <hi>David</hi>'s enemies are Spear-men
or Darters; for they were wont to dart their ſpears (as you ſee in <hi>Saul,</hi>
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 33.) And why this? In a ſword-fight we come to cloſe hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blows; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
ſuch as a quick eye and nimble hand may perhaps avoid: but the
ſpear and dart ſtrikes afarre off, pierces where it ſtrikes, ſmites unſeen, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably.
For the remoteneſs, violence, irreſiſtableneſs of the blow, are the
enemies of the Church deſcribed by the ſpear and dart; where they cannot
come, they ſend dangerous emiſſaries, headed on purpoſe to wound the beſt
State to death; felt ere they can be ſeen, and ſo ſoon as they are felt, killing.
What doe theſe but follow their General, whoſe ſpiritual weapons are fiery
darts? <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 16. Much and lamentable experience hath this State (if
ever any) had of theſe miſchievous engines of commotion, that have been <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
hurled hither from beyond the <hi>Alpes</hi> and <hi>Pyrenees.</hi> What is the remedy,
but the ſame which is againſt the Devil, <hi>the ſhield of prevention?</hi> Stir up
your vigilant care, O ye great Leaders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the ſtrict execution of
wholeſome laws, to avoid the dint of theſe murderous ſubornations. And
when ye have done your beſt, it muſt be the Lord of hoaſts, the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that muſt <hi>break the bow, and knap the ſpear in ſunder,</hi>
Pſal. 46. 9.</p>
            <p>Their ſecond title is <hi>Bulls,</hi> for their ferocity, for their ſtrength. The Lion
is a more Lordly beaſt, but the Bull is ſtronger; and, when he is enraged,
more impetuous. Such are the Enemies of the Church. How furiouſly do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
they bellow out threats, and ſcrape up the earth, and advance their creſt, and
brandiſh their horns, and ſend out ſparkles from their eyes, and ſnuffe out
flames from their noſtrils, and think to bear down all before them? What
ſhould I tell you of the fierce aſſalts of the braving enemies of the Church,
whoſe Pride hath ſcorned all oppoſition, and thinks to puſh down all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
powers, not of men only, but of God himſelf? <hi>Let us break their bonds,
and caſt their cords from us. Who is the Lord, that I ſhould let Iſrael goe?
Where is the God of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the Gods of Sephar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaim,

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> poor menaced Church, that the mighty God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who ſayes to the raging
Sea, <hi>Here ſhalt thou ſtay thy proud waves,</hi> can tame at pleaſure theſe violent

            <p>Theſe Bulls are ſeconded with their own brood, <hi>the Calves of the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who are they, but thoſe which follow, and make up the herd? the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
ſeduced multitude, which not out of choice, but example, join in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to God. Silly calves, they go whither their dams lead them, to the
field or to the ſlaughter-houſe. Blinde obedience is their beſt guide. Are
they bidden to adore a God which they know the baker made? they fall
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> down upon their knees, and thump their breaſts, as beating the heart that
will not enough believe in that paſtry-Deity. Are they bidden to goe on
pilgrimage to a Chappel that is a greater pilgrim then themſelves, that hath
four ſeveral times removed it ſelf, and changed ſtations, (as <hi>Turſelline</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently?)
they muſt goe, and adore thoſe wandring walls. Are they bidden
to forſwear their Allegiance, and to take armes againſt their Lawful and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Soveraign? they ruſh into the battel without either fear or wit; though
for the aide of a ſure enemy, which would make them all (as he threatned in
Eighty eight) alike good Proteſtants. Very calves of the people, whoſe ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
were a fitter ſubject for pity, then their fury can be of malice; were
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it not that their power is wont to be imployed to the no ſmall prejudice of
the cauſe of God. And would it boot ought to ſpend time in perſwading
theſe Calves that they are ſuch? to lay before them the ſhame of their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and ſtupidity? <hi>Hear now this, O fooliſh people and without underſtanding,
which have eyes and ſee not, which have eares and hear not,</hi> Jer. 5. 20. How
long will ye ſuffer your ſelves to be befooled and beſlaved with the tyranny
of Superſtition? God hath made you men, why will ye abide men to make
you <hi>vitulos populorum, the calves of the people?</hi> We muſt leave you as ye
are, but we will not leave praying for your happy change; that God would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate
you to himſelf, as the calves of his altar, that ye may be offered up to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> him <hi>an holy, lively, reaſonable, acceptable ſacrifice</hi> in your bleſſed Converſion.
Amen.</p>
            <p>The laſt and worſt title of theſe enemies is, <hi>The people that delight in warre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Warre is to the State as <hi>Ignis</hi> and <hi>Ferrum, the Knife</hi> and <hi>the Searing-iron,</hi>
to the body; the laſt and moſt deſperate remedy: alwaies evill, if ſometimes
neceſſary; it is not for pleaſure, it is for need. It muſt needs be a cruel heart
that delights in warre. He that well conſiders the fearful effects of warre, the
direption of goods, the vaſtation of Countries, the ſacking and burning of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
the murdering of men, raviſhing of women, weltring of the horſe and
rider in their mingled blood, the ſhrieks and horror of the dying, the ghaſtly
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> rage of the killing, the helliſh and tumultuous confuſion of all things; and
ſhall ſee the ſtreets and fields ſtrewed with carkaſſes, the chanels running
with ſtreams of blood, the houſes and Churches flaming, and, in a word, all
the woful tyrannies of death; will think the heathen Poets had reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
Warre ſent up from Hell, uſhered and heralded by the moſt peſtilent of
all the Furies, every of whoſe haires were ſo many ſnakes and adders to affright
and ſting the world withall. Little pleaſure can there be in ſuch a ſpectacle.
It is a true obſervation of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> that warre to any Nation is as a
tempeſt to the Sea, toſſing and claſhing of the waves together. And fain
would I hear of that Mariner that takes delight in a Storm. The executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of peaceable Juſtice are wont to be hateful; no man abides to conſort
with a publick Headſman: and what metal then ſhall we think thoſe men made
of who delight in cutting of throats, and joy to be the furious executioners of
a martial vengeance? where, beſides the horror of the act, the event is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
The dice of Warre run ſtill upon hazard. <hi>David</hi> could ſend this meſſage
to <hi>Joab, The ſword devoures at randome,</hi> ſo, and ſuch, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 25. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:44233:180"/>
is not more ſweet then uncertain. And what man can love to periſh?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
It is true that Warre is a thing that ſhould not, but muſt be; neither is it
other then an unavoidable act of vindicative Juſtice; an uſeful enemy, an harſh
friend; ſuch an enemy as we cannot want, ſuch a friend as we entertain upon
force, not upon choice; becauſe we muſt, not becauſe we would: It challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
admittance if it be juſt, and it is never juſt but where it is neceſſary; if
it muſt, it ought to be. Where thoſe three things which <hi>Aquinas</hi> requires to
a lawful warre are met, Supreme Authority, a warrantable Cauſe, a juſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;
a Supreme Authority in commanding it, a warrantable Cauſe in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
it, a juſt Intention in executing it; it is no other then <hi>Bellum Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,
Gods warre;</hi> God made it, God owns it, God bleſſes it. What talk I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
of the good Centurion? the very Angels of God are thus, Heavenly ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
The wiſe <hi>Lacedamonians</hi> had no other ſtatues of their Deities but armed.
Yea, what ſpeak I of theſe Puppets? the true God rejoyces in no title more
then of <hi>the Lord of Hoaſts.</hi> In theſe caſes ſay now, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord who
teaches my hands to warre and my fingers to fight.</hi> But if Ambition of enlarging
the bounds of dominion, Covetouſneſs of rich booties, emulation of a rival
Greatneſs, ſhall unſheath our ſwords; now every blow is Murder. Wo to
thoſe hands that are thus imbrued in blood: Wo to thoſe Tyrants that are
the authors of this laviſh effuſion; every drop whereof ſhall once be required
of their guilty Souls. God thinks he cannot give a worſe Epithet to thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
whom he would brand for death then, <hi>Wicked and blood-thirſty men. David</hi> might
not be allowed to build God an Houſe, becauſe he had a bloody hand; the
cauſe was holy, yet the colour offends. How hateful muſt thoſe needs be to
the God of Mercies that delight in Blood? the true brood of him that is the
man-ſlayer from the beginning. There are ſtrange diets of men, as of other
creatures; whereof there are ſome that naturally feed on poiſon and fatten
with it; and it may be there are Cannibals that finde mans blood ſweet: yet
I think it would be hard to finde a man that will profeſs to place his felicity in
a cruel hazard. So doth he that delights in warre: and if no man (for ſhame)
will be known to doe ſimply and directly ſo, yet in effect men bewray this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
if they be, firſt, <hi>oſores pacis, haters of peace,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt calls
them, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 120. 7. ſtubbornly repelling the fair motions and meet conditions
thereof: if, ſecondly, they take up ſlight and unjuſt cauſes of warre, as it is
noted by <hi>Suetonius</hi> of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> (which this Iland had experience of) that
he would refrain from no occaſion of warre if never ſo unjuſt; contrary to the
better temper and reſolution of wiſer <hi>Romans</hi> then himſelf, who would rather
ſave one Subject then kill a thouſand Enemies: if, thirdly, they give wilful
provocations of this publick revenge by groſs, open, intolerable injuries; as
<hi>Hanun</hi> did to <hi>David;</hi> ſuch are incroachments upon their neighbour-territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
violating the juſt covenants of league and commerce by main violences:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
if, fourthly, they refuſe to give juſt ſatisfaction where they have unjuſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked;
as the <hi>Benjamites</hi> in caſe of the Sodomitical villany of their <hi>Gibeah.</hi>
Where all, where any of theſe are found, well may we brand that people with
delight in warre. And ſince they will needs delight in warre, God ſhall fit
them accordingly. <hi>With the froward thou ſhalt ſhew thy ſelf froward, Pſ.</hi> 18. 26.
He ſhall delight in warring againſt them. He ſhall <hi>rouze up himſelf as a Giant
refreſhed with new wine. Therefore thus ſaith the Lord of Hoaſts, the mighty one
of Iſrael, Ah, I will eaſe me of my adverſaries, and revenge me of mine enemies,</hi>
Eſ. 1. 24.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Enemies. The Defeat follows, <hi>Rebuke and ſcatter.</hi> The two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
firſt, though bad enough, muſt be rebuked; the laſt muſt be ſcattered. All
Gods enemies may not be to us alike, neither <hi>aequè</hi> nor <hi>aqualiter.</hi> Some are
<hi>Calves,</hi> ſimple, though violent; ſome others are <hi>Bulls,</hi> fierce and furious; ſome
other Lions from among the reeds, ravenous and devouring: all theſe, though
cruel, yet perhaps are not malicious; an <hi>increpa</hi> is enough for them. <hi>Saul</hi>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:44233:180"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was one of theſe wild Buls, <hi>breathing out threatnings againſt the Church,</hi> and
toſſing upon his horn many worthy Chriſtians; had it not been pity he had
been deſtroyed in that height of his rage? an increpation brought him home:
God had never ſuch a Champion. Now, <hi>certamen bonum certavi, I have fought
a good fight,</hi> ſaith he juſtly of himſelf, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7. This <hi>increpa</hi> then is, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance
them, diſhearten them, diſcomfit them, disband them. <hi>Put them
down, O Lord, and let them know they are but men:</hi> humble them to the very
duſt, but not to the duſt of death; to correction, as <hi>Habacuc</hi> ſpeaketh, not to a
full deſtruction; onely till they humbly bring pieces of ſilver, till they come in
with the tributes of peacefull ſubmiſſion, of juſt ſatisfaction. The end of all
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> juſt was is Peace. As we are firſt bidden to <hi>inquire of Abel</hi> ere we inferre it,
(<hi>offeres ei pacem,</hi> Deut. 20. 10.) ſo when we hear of <hi>Abel</hi> we muſt ſtint it. Warre
to the State is Phyſick to the body. This is no other then a civil evacuation,
whether by potion or phlebotomy. What is the end of Phyſick but health?
when that is once recovered, we have done with the Apothecary. He wantons
away his life fooliſhly that, when he is well, will take Phyſick to make him ſick.
It is far from us to wiſh the confuſion of the ignorant and ſeduced enemies of
God's Church, thoſe that follow <hi>Abſalom</hi> with an upright heart: No, we pity
them, we pray for them. Oh that they would come in with their pieces of
ſilver, and tender their humble obediences to the apparent Truth of God, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> yield to the laws of both Divine and humane Juſtice! Oh that God would
perſwade <hi>Jap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>t</hi> to <hi>dwell in the tents of Sem! Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they doe. O thou ſword of the Lord, how long will it be ere thou be
quiet? put up thy ſelf into thy ſcabbard, reſt and be ſtill,</hi> Jer. 47. 6.</p>
            <p>But for thoſe other that delight in war, <hi>Diſsipa, Domine, Scatter them, O Lord.</hi>
Confuſion is but too good for them; bring them to worſe then nothing. The
perfection and ſuddenneſs of this diſſipation is expreſſed emphatically in the
beginning of this Pſalm by a double Metaphor; <hi>as ſmoak before the wind, as
wax before the fire,</hi> ſo ſcatter them. Of all light bodies nothing is more volatile
then ſmoak, of all ſolid none more flitting then wax: As wind is to the ſmoak,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and fire to the wax, ſo are the Judgements of God to his enemies; the wax
melteth, the ſmoak vaniſheth before them. The conceit is too curious of thoſe
that make the Gentiles to be ſmoak, who mount up in the opinion of their
wiſdome and power; the Jews wax, dropp'd from the honey-comb of their
many Divine priviledges. No, all are both, ſmoak and wax. Even ſo do
thou ſcatter them, O Lord; and be not merciful to <hi>them that offend on mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
wickedneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two thoughts onely remain now for us. The firſt, that it muſt be God onely
who muſt rebuke and ſcatter. The ſecond, that it is our Prayer onely that muſt
obtain from God this rebuke, this diſſipation. Both which when I have touched
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> a little, I ſhall put an end to this exerciſe of your patient Devotion.</p>
            <p>It is God onely that muſt doe it; for <hi>vain is the help of man.</hi> And how eaſie
is it for the Almighty to <hi>ſtill the enemy and avenger?</hi> They are as a potters
veſſel to his iron Scepter; as the thorns or wax to his fire; as chaff or ſmoak
to his wind. To our weakneſs the oppoſite powers ſeem ſtrong and unconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
the <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> was reach up to Heaven; and who can ſtand before the
ſons of <hi>Anak?</hi> When we ſee their Bulwarks, we would think they roll <hi>Pelion</hi>
upon <hi>Oſſa</hi> with the old Giants; when we ſee their Towers, we would think they
would ſcale Heaven with the builders of <hi>Babel;</hi> when we ſee their Mines, we
would think they would blow up the earth. Let the wind of Gods Power but
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> breath upon them, they vaniſh as ſmoak; let the fire of his wrath but look
upon them, they melt as wax. Tyrannous <hi>Aegypt</hi> had long made ſlaves of God's
people, and now will make ſlaughter of them; following them armed at the
heels into the chanel of the Sea. <hi>Stand ſtill, and ſee the Salvation of the Lord;
for the Aegyptians which you have ſeen to day, ye ſhall ſee no more for ever,</hi>
Exod. 14. 13.</p>

The great Hoaſt of proud <hi>Benhadad</hi> will carry away all <hi>Samaria</hi> in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
pockets for pin-duſt: Ere long ye ſhall ſee their haughtie King come in haltred

their King, and defies their God: Stay but till morning, all his hundred four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
and five thouſand ſhall be dead corpſes. Vain fools! What is a finite
power in the hands of an infinite? Where there is an equality of force, there
may be hard tugging; but where braſs meets with clay, how can that brittle
ſtuff eſcape unſhattered? Let this cool your courages, and pull down your
plumes, O ye inſolent enemies of God. When ye look to your own ſword,
there is no rule with you; <hi>Mihi perfacile eſt, &amp;c. It is eaſie for me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Uldes</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
in the ſtory) <hi>to deſtroy all the earth that the Sun looks upon:</hi> but when God
takes you to task, what toyes, what nothings ye are? Behold, <hi>we come
againſt you in the Name of the Lord of Hoaſts:</hi> It is he that ſhall rebuke and
ſcatter you.</p>
            <p>He will doe it; but he will doe it upon our Prayers. Not that our poor
Petitions can put mercy into God, who is infinitely careful for the good of his
Church above all poſſible reaches of our deſires; but that we may be raiſed up
to a meet capacity of Mercy. God cannot hate his enemies or love his own ever
the more upon our intreaties; yet he will be ſued to for the particular effects
of both, if ever we look to taſt of his Mercy in either. If we have not a heart to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
pray, God hath not an hand to help. So did God hate <hi>Amalek,</hi> that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
it to be rooted out of the earth; ſo did he love <hi>Iſrael</hi> as the apple of
his eye: Yet unleſs <hi>Moſes</hi> hold up his hand, <hi>Amalek</hi> ſhall prevail againſt <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
Theſe are our beſt, our ſureſt weapons, even our Prayers; and bleſſed be God
that hath put it into the heart of his Anointed to ſeek his face in theſe powerful
Humiliations. We ſought him againſt the Peſtilence, and prevailed almoſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly
againſt that deſtroying Angel; why ſhould we not hope to find
him againſt unſeaſonable Clouds, againſt the oppoſite powers of fleſh and
blood? Here is your ſafety, here is your aſſurance of victory, O ye great Princes
and Potentates of the earth: if ye truſt to the arm of fleſh it will fail you.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
Let your Navies be never ſo well rigg'd and mann'd; let your Forces be never
ſo ſtrong and numberleſs; let them have not onely hands and feet (that is,
horſemen and footmen) but a bulk of body too, that is, full ſubſtance of wealthy
proviſion, (as the word of <hi>Flaminius</hi> was;) let your counſel be vigilant, your
munition ready, your troops trained and valiant; yet if there be not Devotion
enough in our boſome to make God ours, in vain ſhall we hope to ſtand before
our enemies. This onely (whatſoever the profane heart of Atheous men may
imagine) this is the great Ordnance which can batter down the wals of our
enemies, yea the very black gates of Hell it ſelf; in compariſon whereof all
humane powers are but paper-ſhot. Yea this is that Petar which onely can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
blow open the gates of Heaven, and fetch down victory upon our heads, and
make us another <hi>thundring Legion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is it that made us ſo happily ſucceſsful in Eighty eight beyond all
hope, beyond all conceit, but the fervency of our humble Devotions? That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Navie came on dreadfully floating like a moving wood in the ſight of
our coaſt; thoſe vaſt Veſſels were as ſo many lofty Caſtles raiſed on thoſe liquid
foundations: Then ſtraight, as if thoſe huge bottoms had been ſtuft with Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts,
there was nothing but thunder and lightning and ſmoak, and all the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
apparitions of death. We, what did we? we fought upon our knees, both
Prince and people. Straight God fought for us from Heaven. Our Prayers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
were the gale, yea the guſt that tore thoſe miſ-conſecrated flags and ſails, and
ſcattered and drencht thoſe preſumptuous piles, and ſent them into the bottom
of the deep, to be a Parlour for Whales and Sea-monſters. There lay the Pride
of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Terrour of <hi>England.</hi> And is the hand of our God ſhortned? Is
he other then what he was? We may be (as we are) weakned and effeminated
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:44233:181"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by a long, luxurious peace: Our God is <hi>yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for
ever.</hi> If we be not wanting to him in our Prayers, he cannot be wanting to our
Protection.</p>
            <p>Look up to him (O dear Chriſtians) that is the God of our Salvation. Behold,
the Lions out of their reeds, the Buls out of their foreſts, and theſe in banded
multitudes conſpire againſt us; and the miſ-led Calves of the people are apt
enough to back their attempts. Neither is this a fair hoſtility; our enemies
are thoſe that hate peace, and delight in war, offering inſolent provocations to
our State, in diſ-inheriting part of the Royal Iſſue, violating their faiths, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
their unjuſt affronts, ambitiouſly aſpiring to undue Soveraignty. What
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſhall we then doe? O <hi>put not your truſt in Princes, nor in the ſons of men, whoſe
breath is in their noſtrils. O put not</hi> your <hi>truſt,</hi> ye Princes and Peers, <hi>in</hi> your
<hi>ſword, in</hi> your <hi>bow;</hi> in your powers and confederacies. Truſt onely to the great
God of hoaſts, who alone can but blow upon all the proudeſt preparations of
your enemies, and ſcatter them to the loweſt Hell. Come to him in your hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
devotions, with an <hi>Increpa</hi> and <hi>Diſsipa;</hi> he <hi>ſhall</hi> ſoon <hi>make your enemies to

            </p>
            <p>But what ſhall I ſay (Honorable and Beloved?) we have pray'd, and have not
been heard; and thou, O Lord, <hi>haſt not</hi> of late <hi>gone forth with our hoaſts:</hi> yea

               <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the hot chace of all their victory, is foiled more then once by a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanite.</hi>
Whence was this? There was a pad in the ſtraw, an <hi>Achan</hi> in the camp.
Theft and Sacriledge fought againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> more then the men of <hi>Ai:</hi> the wedge
of Gold wounded them more then the enemies ſteel; the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> garment
diſarmed and ſtripped them: <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſinned, and muſt flee. Alas, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
what do we pray for victory over our enemies, when our ſins (which are
our deadlieſt enemies) conquer us? To what purpoſe are our Prayers loud,
when our ſins are louder? to what purpoſe are our Bodies this day empty, if
our Souls be full of wickedneſs? whiles we provoke God to his face with our
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> abominable licentiouſneſs, with our fearful profanations, with our outragious
lives, how do we think to glaver with him in our formal Devotions? What
care he for our ſmooth tongues, when our hearts are filthy? what cares he for
an elevated eye, when our Souls are depreſſed to vile luſts? what cares he for
the calves of our lips, when the iniquity of our heels compaſſes us about? The
very Sacrifice of the wicked is abomination to the Lord; his very Prayer is
turned into ſin, even that whereby he hopes to expiate it. <hi>Oh that my people
had hearkned to me, and Iſrael had walked in my waies</hi> (faith God;) <hi>I ſhould ſoon
have ſubdued their enemies, and turned my hand againſt their adverſaries: The
haters of the Lord ſhould have ſubmitted themſelves to him; but their time ſhould
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> have endured for ever,</hi> Pſal. 81. 13, 14, 15.</p>
            <p>Oh then <hi>cleanſe your hands, ye ſinners, and purge your hearts, ye double-minded;
waſh your hands in innocence,</hi> and then <hi>compaſs the Altar of God.</hi> Then ſhall the

Nation of ours victoriouſly glorious to the ends of the world, even to all ages
and times; then ſhall he be known to be our God, and we ſhall be known to be
his people for ever: Which he of his infinite mercy vouchſafe to grant us for

               <p>OUR Saviour foretold us that theſe laſt days ſhould be quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome;
all the world doth either act or talk of fighting: Give
me leave therefore to fall upon the common Theme of the

there are many knots in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles: this may well go for one of
them, which is the relation of his Conflict at <hi>Epheſus.</hi> There are that

Lion, of the beaſt couching at the feet of the Saint, of the hail-ſtorm ſending
away the beholders with broken heads and the Governour with one ear ſhorn
off, of the Lions eſcape to the mountains. It is a wonder in what mint he
had it.<note place="margin">Act. 19. 29.</note> There was indeed a Theatre at <hi>Epheſus</hi> for ſuch purpoſes; and, <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
ad leonem,</hi> was a common word, as we find in <hi>Tertullian. Ignatius, Tecla,
Priſca,</hi> and many other bleſſed Martyrs were corn allotted to this mill. But
what is this to S.<hi>Paul</hi>'s Combat? It is one thing to be caſt to the beaſts as an
offender, another thing to fight with beaſts as a Champion; a difference which I
wonder the ſharp eyes of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſaw not. Thoſe were forced by the ſentence
of condemnation, theſe Voluntaries as in the <hi>Jogo de toros;</hi> thoſe were brought
to ſuffer, theſe came to kill; thoſe naked, theſe armed. Can any man be ſo
ſenſeleſs as to think that S. <hi>Paul (tricubitalis ille,</hi> as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> cals him) would
put himſelf into the Theatre with his ſword and target to maintain a duel
with the Lion? Thus he muſt doe, elſe he did not according to the Letter <gap reason="foreign">

But if it be pleaded that ſome bloody ſentence might caſt him into the
Theatre to be devoured, and his will and natural care of ſelf-preſervation incited
him to his own defence; is it poſſible that ſo faithful an Hiſtorian as S. <hi>Luke</hi>
ſhould in his Acts omit this paſſage more memorable then all the reſt that he
hath recorded? Indeed S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had reaſon to keep the beſt regiſter of his
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:44233:182"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> own life, hath reported ſome things of himſelf which S. <hi>Luke</hi> hath not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularized:

at leaſt amongſt that catalogue of leſs dangers his own Pen would not have
ſmothered it. Yea let me be bold to ſay that this not onely was not done, but
could not be. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Citizen of <hi>Rome;</hi> if that priviledge ſaved him from
laſhes, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 25. much more from the beaſts; their contemptible jaws were
no death for a <hi>Roman.</hi> I am with thoſe Fathers, (<hi>Tertullian, Chryſoſtome, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,
Theophylact,</hi> others) who take this metaphorically of men in ſhape, beaſts
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in condition, paralleling it with 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>I was delivered out of the mouth of
the Lion,</hi>
that is, <hi>Nero:</hi> and with that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Ne tradas beſtiis animas
confitentes tibi, Give not unto the beaſts the ſouls that confeſs thee,</hi> as the Vulgar
reads, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 19.</p>
               <p>Who then were theſe beaſts at <hi>Epheſus?</hi> Many and great Authors take it
of <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Faction and their buſie tumult, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. Neither will I ſtrictly
examine with S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> whether S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſent away this former Epiſtle
from <hi>Epheſus</hi> before thoſe broils of their <hi>Diana</hi> and her Silver-ſmiths, as may
ſeem to be gathered by conferring of S. <hi>Luke's</hi> journal with S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle.
Others take it of thoſe <hi>Epheſian</hi> Conjurers, <hi>Acts 19. Tertullian</hi> hits it home,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> whiles in a generality he conſtrues it of thoſe beaſts of the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> preſſure,
whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 8. That text gloſſes upon this at large; turn
your eyes to that Commentary of S. <hi>Paul: For we would not have you ignorant
of our trouble which came to us in Aſia, that we were preſſed out of meaſare above
ſtrength; inſomuch as that we deſpaired of life. But we had the ſentence of death
in our ſelves.</hi> Lo here the Beaſts; lo here the Combat. <hi>Epheſus</hi> was the mother-City
of <hi>Aſia;</hi> there S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpent three years with ſuch perpetual and hot
bickerings, that his very life was hopeleſs. As ſome great Conquerour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
deſires to have his prime and moſt famous victory ingraven in his laſt
Monument, ſo doth our Apoſtle ſingle out this <hi>Epheſian; I fought with beaſts
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> at Epheſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Text then ſhall be this one word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But as this word is a
compound, ſo it compounds my Text and diſcourſe of two parts: the firſt
comprehends the Beaſts wherewith S. <hi>Paul</hi> conſlicts; the latter the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
that he had with thoſe Beaſts. Both of them worthy of your moſt
careful attention. My firſt ſubjects is harſh, and therefore will need a fair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>The world is a wide Wilderneſs, wherein we converſe with wild and ſavage
creatures; we think them men, they are beaſts. It is contrary to the deluſions of
Lycanthropy: there, he that is a man thinks himſelf a beaſt; here, he that is a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> beaſt thinks himſelf a man, and draws others eyes into the ſame errour. Let
no man miſconſtrue me, as if, in a <hi>Timon</hi>-like or Cynick humour, I were fallen
out with our creation. I know what the Pſalmiſt ſaies, <hi>Thou haſt made man little
lower then the Angels</hi> (Pſal. 8. 5.) there is but <hi>paulò minùs;</hi> I know ſome of whom
it is ſaid <hi>ſicut Angeli, as the Angels</hi> of God; yea yet more, there are thoſe of
whom it is ſaid, <hi>Dii eſtis, ye are Gods;</hi> beſides theſe, every renewed man is a
Saint, his Regeneration advances him above the ſphere of mere Humanity:
but let him be but a very man, that is, a man corrupted, I dare ſay, though he
be <hi>ſet in honour,</hi> he is more then <hi>compared to the beaſt that periſheth.</hi> Far be it
from us then to caſt mire into the face of our Creator: God never made man
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſuch as he is; it is our ſin that made our Soul to grovel; and if the mercy of
our Maker have not condemned our hands to fore-legs, how can that excuſe us
from beſtiality? Neither let us be thought to ſtrike Grace through the ſides of
Nature: when it pleaſeth God to breath upon us again in our Renovation, we
ceaſe to be what we made our ſelves; then do we uncaſe the beaſt, and put on
an Angel. It is with depraved man in his impure naturals, that we muſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:44233:183"/>
this quarrel: we cannot challenge a worſe enemy then what we were, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
what in part we are, and what without Gods mercy we ſhould be.</p>
               <p>Let degenerated Nature then fee her beſt Advocate at this barre; he can but
plead Shape, Speech, Ratiocination to make himſelf no beaſt: and if theſe prove
but ſome jugling miſts to make him ſeem other then he is, he ſhall be forced to
grant himſelf other then he ſeems, a beaſt.</p>
               <p>To begin with the firſt. The true eſſence of Humanity lies not in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide:
God hath hid the Form of every creature deeper, much more of him that
ſhould be reaſonable. Let us give leave to holy <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s credulity, that a man
was by a piece of an inchanted Cheeſe turned into an Aſs: tell me now, ye
Philoſophers, what creature ye will call this. His Soul is the ſame, the Shape is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
altered: Reaſon is where ſhe was, but otherwiſe attended. If ye dare ſay, it
might be a beaſt with Reaſon, your beſt fort is loſt. The Hide was now rough,
the Ears long, the Hooves round and hard, and the whole Habit beſtial; but if
Reaſon had not more power to make him no beaſt then theſe outward parts
had to make him no man, I have what I would. You muſt of force therefore
ſay it was a man clothed with a beaſt, and ſo ſhall fall upon that of <hi>Cleanthes,</hi>
which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> mentions, that the <hi>Soul is the man.</hi> What is the Body then
but the Habit of this Spirit, which it may change or put off without change, as
under divers ſutes we ſtill wear the ſame skin? If we had been on the Scaffold
to ſee a man challenging the dogs in the diſguiſe of a Bears-hide, would we have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
ſaid, Now two beaſts are fighting? The Shape therefore may well belie the
Subſtance. Our Engliſh Navigations report that on ſome <hi>Indian</hi> ſhores men
have been ſeen with the faces of beaſts; and ye know the old verſe, <hi>Simia quàm
ſimilis?</hi> Yea both our ſtories and the Netherlandiſh tell us of Sea-monſters
that have been taken up in the full form of men: if the outſide ſeemed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
whiles the inſide was mute and reaſonleſs, who would honour that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with the ſtyle of man? What ſhould I tell you that evil ſpirits have not
ſeldome appeared in the ſhipes of men, as that Devil of <hi>Endor</hi> in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
If the outward Figure could have made the man, the Prophet had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
his death. To theſe let me adde, that the Shape is changed with diſeaſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
or caſualty or age, whiles the man is the ſame: The Face that was fair, is now
diſtorted and morphew'd; the Hair that was yellow or black, turn'd white or
vaniſhed; the Body that was erect, bowed double; the Skin that was white and
ſmooth, turn'd tawnie and writhel'd; and the whole frame ſo altered, as if it
had been molded anew, that whiles all others miſ-know it, he that dwels in
that tenement can ſcarce know it to be his own: and yet the owner will not ſay
with that mortified ſpirit, <hi>Ego non ſum ego.</hi> What ſhall we ſay of the proud
Monarch of <hi>Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> during the ſeven years of his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation?
His outward Shape was not changed, his heart was; it was the
word of his Viſion, <hi>Let his heart be changed from mans, and let a beaſts heart be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
given unto him,</hi> Dan. 4. 16. What was he now for the time but a beaſt even in his
own ſenſe? His diet was with the oxen, his hair like Eagles fethers, his nails
like birds claws; all was, <hi>obbruteſcebat animus,</hi> his heart was beſtial in a caſe of
humane fleſh. It is not therefore the Shape that can forbid man to be a beaſt.
And it was not for nothing that the Cynick ſought in the full ſtreets for a man,
and would not allow that acclamation to <hi>Doxippus</hi> in the Olympian games,
<hi>Doxippus viros vicit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us ſee what Speech and Reaſon can doe, <hi>Ratio &amp; Oratio.</hi> Every living
creature hath a peculiar ſound whereby to expreſs it ſelf; and that not without
ſome variety of ſignification and change of note. If man onely ſpeak articulately <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
words of voluntary formation and arbitrary impoſition, yet even brutes have
ſuch natural language as whereby each of the ſame kind do mutually under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
other; and what can our words obtain more? If an <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus</hi>
could conſtrue them in their ſenſe, it is all one as if he liſtened to his Goſſips.
But beſides the natural tone, have we not heard Birds taught ſo to imitate the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:44233:183"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> voice of men, that they have received replies, as not diſtinguiſhed? Do not
our books tell us of the <hi>Hyaena,</hi> that learns the Shepherds name, and calls him
forth to his coſt, ſo cunningly counterfeiting the voice that the man paies his
blood for his credulity? A dumb man is no leſs a man then a pratler. <hi>Balaam</hi>'s
Aſs was a beaſt ſtill, and yet not only ſpake, but ſpake in a mans voice, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 16. Beſides that, man when he comes to his beſt, ſhall have no uſe of
Speech; (although there want not ſome, as <hi>Gerſon, Salmeron</hi> and others, that
hold a vocal Quire in Heaven.) The Angels praiſe God and underſtand each
other, without uſe of a tongue; once we ſhall be like them. It is not Speech
therefore that makes the man, ſince man ſhall be moſt himſelf when he ſhall
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> not ſpeak.</p>
               <p>It is Reaſon that mainly differenceth man from beaſt, and the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it in a free deduction of conſequences and concluſions: that Divine
power dwells onely in the immortal Soul of man, and is not communicable
to the lower forme of creatures. Let me have leave ſtill to put you in mind
that I ſpeak not of man created in innocence; I ſpeak not of man as renewed
by Grace, and by that initiated in Glory: I ſpeak of man as depraved by
ſin. Now he hath indeed the light of Reaſon, but ſo dim and duskie, that
we may well ſay he looks through horn, not through Cryſtal: He that was
an Eagle, is now an Owle to this Sun. As his beſt Graces are loſt, ſo his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> powers are marr'd: he is therefore now <hi>become like the beaſt that periſheth,</hi>
not in frailty only, but in ignorance; for it follows, <hi>This their way is their folly,</hi>
Pſal. 49. 13.</p>
               <p>Beſides, we ſee the outſide of thoſe creatures we call brute, we ſee not
what is within them. Not to ſpeak of the excellency of their Common ſenſe
and ſtrength of Memory; ſurely their Phantaſie yields ſuch inferences as
would ſeem to evince an inferiour and mungrel kind of Ratiocination. Who
that ſhould ſee <hi>Plutarch's</hi> Crow coming to the pail to drink, and finding it
not full enough for her reach, carrying ſtones to raiſe up the water; who
that ſhould ſee the Beavers framing their den, or ſome Birds building their
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> neſts; who that ſhould ſee the Lion plaining the impreſſion of his paws
with his ſterne; who that ſhould ſee the Cranes ballaſting themſelves when
they are to fly over the mountains; who that ſhall ſee the wily tricks of the
Fox, or the witty feats of the Monkey or Baboon; who that ſhall read of
the Elephant learning letters and numbers, and plotting his cunning revenges,
would not ſay that theſe, and a thouſand the like, muſt needs argue a baſer
kinde of ſenſitive diſcourſe, ſuch as wherein Imagination doth notably coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Reaſon, and in ſome weak ſubjects ſo tranſcend it, as that <hi>Lactantius</hi>
dares ſay,<note place="margin">De Ira Dei, l. 1. c. 7.</note> (I dare not) <hi>Iſta non facerent, niſi ineſſet illis intelligentia &amp; cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio?</hi>
It is true, our reaſonable Soul is furniſhed with higher powers; but
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> it is not more honour to have had them, then ſhame to have impair'd them.
If God doth not breath upon our dim glaſſes and wipe them clear, they ſhew
us nothing. To ſpeak plainly; Indeed it is our Illumination that perfects
Reaſon; and that Illumination is from the Father of lights, without whoſe
Divine light natural Reaſon is but as a Dial without the Sun, eyes without
light: <hi>For the natural man perceiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14.
And in that perſon it is that <hi>Agar</hi> the Son of <hi>Jakeh</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>I am more brutiſh
then man, I have not the underſtanding of a man,</hi> Prov. 30. 2. Why this? <hi>I
have not the knowledge of the holy,</hi> verſ. 3. The word is remarkable; no other
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> then <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Jumentum, a Beaſt;</hi> the ſame that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> uſes, when
he ſayes, <hi>I will give thee over into the hands of brutiſh men,</hi> Ezec. 21. 31. and the
Pſalmiſt, when he ſaies, <hi>Oh ye fooliſh,</hi> or <hi>brutiſh, among the people, when will ye
underſtand?</hi> So as, notwithſtanding this muddy and imperfect Reaſon, God
ſees a kinde of brutality in the natural man. Whereto it may pleaſe you
to adde, that in a man debauch'd Reaſon is ſo much worſe then brutiſhneſs,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:44233:184"/>
by how much wickedneſs is worſe hainous then ſimplicity; and if want of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
Reaſon make a Beaſt, abuſe of Reaſon makes a Devil. It is a miſerable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
that make us onely apt to evil, and capable of an Hell: ſmall cauſe
have we to brag of thoſe powers which ſo diſtinguiſh us from beaſts, that
they make us worſe then beaſts. In ſhort therefore, notwithſtanding Shape,
Speech, Reaſon, a natural (and thereby a vicious) man may well paſs for a
beaſt.</p>
               <p>And now that we ſee it apparent that he is ſo, let us a little inquire how
he became ſo. Certainly, God made man upright, as in ſhape, ſo in diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition:
What wrought this miſerable Metamorphoſis? What could do it
but Sorcery? and what Witch could this be but the old <hi>Circe</hi> of the world,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
Senſuality? Man is led and informed by Reaſon, Beaſts by Senſe: now when
man abandons Reaſon, and gives himſelf up to Senſe, he caſts off the man,
and puts on the beaſt. Neither is this ſenſuality in the Affection only, but
it goes through the whole Soul: there is a ſenſual Underſtanding as well as
a ſenſual Appetite: the one makes a beaſt in Opinion, the other in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
Groſs Errour doth the one, Vice the other. Whoſoever therefore
is tranſported with either, is turn'd Beaſt. Give me a man that is given up
to his filthy Luſts, give me a man whoſe Reaſon is drawn through his maw
or his ſpleen; let him be otherwiſe what he will, I dare ſay he is no other then
a beaſt.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               </p>
               <p>And now what variety think you is there of ſeveral kinds? no wilderneſs
affords ſo many. <hi>Nero</hi> is a Lion, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>Herod</hi> a Fox, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 32.
the Jewiſh falſe-teachers Dogs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>David</hi>'s perſecutors Bulls of <hi>Baſan,</hi>
and Unicorns, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 22. 12, 21. the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> enemies Dragons, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 74. 13.
the Scribes and Phariſees Serpents, Vipers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 33. the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
an Eagle-winged Lion, the <hi>Perſian</hi> a Bear, the <hi>Macedonian</hi> a Leopard,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 4, 5, 6. the enemies of the Church wild Boares, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 80. 13. Greedy
Judges evening Wolves, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 3. Schiſmaticks Foxes cubs, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 15.
The time and my breath would fail me if I ſhould reckon up all the ſeveral
kinds of beaſts in the skins of men. Surely as there is thought to be no beaſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
upon earth which hath not his fellow in the ſea, and which hath not his ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
in Plants; ſo I may truly ſay, there is no beaſt in the vaſt deſart of the
world which is not parallel'd in man. Yea, as Effects and Qualities are in
an higher degree found in Cauſes and Subjects equivocal then in their own,
(as Heat is more excellently in the Sun then in the Fire;) ſo certainly is bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs
more eminent and notorious in man then in beaſt.</p>
               <p>Look into all heards and droves, and ſee if you can find ſo very a beaſt
as the Drunkard. It was S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s reaſon of old, Thoſe beaſts will drink no
more then they think enough; and if the Panther (which they ſay is the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſt
beaſt) or the Swine be overtaken with unaccuſtomed liquor, it is upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
ignorance of the power of it; (ſo a <hi>Noah</hi> himſelf may be at firſt miſtaken.)
But mans Reaſon foretells him that thoſe intoxicating draughts will bereave
him of Reaſon, yet he ſwills them down wilfully; as if it were a pleaſure to
forgoe that whereby he is a man. The beaſt when he hath his load, may frisk
a little, and move inordinately, and then lye down in an ordinary poſture of
harmleſs reſt: but for the Drunkard, his tongue reel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſtraight either into rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or ribaldry, his hands into ſwaggering and bloomed; all his motions
are made of diſorder and miſchief, and his reſt is no leſs odious then his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
See how he lies wallowing in his own filthy excretions, in ſo loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
a faſhion as were enough to make the beholder hate to be a man.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
And now, when we have all done, after all the ſhame and ſcorn, here is <hi>Sus
ad volutabrum.</hi> All the world cannot reclaim an habituated Drunkard; that
which the beaſts know not how to doe, his wit projects when he is ſober how
he may be drunk; and, which St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> well obſerves, as more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
all humors of beaſts, how he may force others to his own ſhameful
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:44233:184"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> exceſs. Far, far be this abominable vice from any of you, Courtiers. That
which the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> ſcorned in their very Slaves, that which our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times had wont to diſdain in Beggers, let not that ſtain the honour of a
Chriſtian Court. Or if any ſuch ſhould hear me this day, <hi>Awake ye drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards
and weep, and howle ye drinkers of wine,</hi> Joel 1. 5. return back your
ſuperfluous liquor into teares: or if ye will not weep, ye ſhall howl, if
ye will not weep with penitents, ye ſhall howl with hell-hounds; and ye
that now pour down veſſels more to make then quench thirſt, ſhall one
day in vain wiſh to give all the world for but one drop of water to cool
that flaming tongue which a whole Ocean cannot ſo much as moiſten.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Look if in all the mountains or falls there be any ſuch Goat or Stalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as the Voluptuous man. Thoſe ſilly beaſts are carried with the ſway of
their natural deſires into thoſe actions of luſt which are uncapable both of
ſhame and ſin; but in their own ſeaſons, and within their own line: theſe
high-fed ſteeds are ever neighing after ſtrange fleſh, and, as was ſaid of
beaſtly <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> may be wearied, cannot be ſatisfied. Thoſe beaſts affect
not to go in any other then the ordinary road of Nature: but theſe prodigies
of Sodomitical lewdneſs, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to his <hi>Romans</hi> (even then infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
for this not-to-be-named villany) <hi>burn in luſt one towards another, and
man with man work that which is unſeemly.</hi> In that impure City beaſts
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> might have been Saints to the men; even out of that reaſon which the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
<hi>Roman</hi> Dame gave of old for their filly innocence, becauſe they are
beaſts.</p>
               <p>Look into all the cribbs and troughs of brutiſh diet, and ſee whether you
can finde ſuch a beaſt as a Glutton. Thoſe irrational creatures take that ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
proviſion which Nature yields them but to a ſufficiency; not affecting
curioſity of dreſſings, varieties of mixtures, ſurcharges of meaſures: whereas
the liquorous palate of the Glutton ranges through ſeas and lands for uncouth
delicacies, kills thouſands of creatures for but their tongues or giblets, makes
but one diſh of the quinteſſence of an hundred fouls or fiſhes, praiſes that for
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the beſt fleſh that is no fleſh, cares only to ſolicit that which others would be
glad to ſatisfie, appetite. What ſhall I ſay more? this Gourmand ſacrifices
whole hecatombs to his paunch, and whiffs himſelf away in Necotian Incenſe to
the Idol of his vain intemperance, and teares his own bowels, yea his Soul, with
his teeth.</p>
               <p>Look into all the caves and dens of the wildeſt deſart, ſee if there be any
ſuch Tiger or Wolf as an Enemy, as an Uſuring oppreſſor. Even the ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
beaſts agree with themſelves, elſe the wilderneſs would ſoon be unpeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
of her four-footed inhabitants. Cruel man falls upon his own kinde, and
ſpills that blood which, when both are ſhed, he cannot diſtinguiſh from his own.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> The fierceſt beaſt, if he ſeize upon a weaker prey, is incited by a neceſſity of
hunger, and led by a natural law of ſelf-preſervation, which once ſatisfind,
puts an end to his cruelty: man is carried with a furious deſire of revenge,
which is as unſatiable as hell it ſelf. Hence are Murders of men, rapes of
Virgins, braining and broaching of Infants, mangling of carkaſſes, carouſing of
blood, refoſſion of graves, torturing of the ſurviving, worſe then many deaths;
firing of Cities, demoliſhing of Temples, whole Countries buried in rubbiſh
and aſhes, and even the Chriſtian World turn'd to a Shambles or Slaughter-houſe.</p>
               <p>It were too eaſie for me to proſecute the reſt, and in every vicious man to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> find more beaſts then hides, or horns, or hoofs, or paws can diſcover. Brag
of thy ſelf therefore, O man, that thou art anoble creature, and vaunt of thine
own perfections, look big and ſpeak high; but if thou be no other then
thou haſt made (yea marr'd) thy ſelf, the very brute beaſts, if they could
ſpeak as thou doſt, would in pity call thee, as the Philoſopher did in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertius,</hi>

Angels and good men look upon thee with no leſs ſcorn then thou look'ſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
upon that which thou art and think'ſt not, a beaſt; yea it were well if no
worſe. Let me ſay, there is not the moſt loathly and deſpicable creature
that crawls upon the earth, which thou ſhalt not once envy, and wiſh to have
been rather then what thou art. Raiſe up thy ſelf therefore from this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
condition of depraved humanity (<hi>naturam vincat inſtitutio,</hi> as <hi>Ambroſe</hi>)
and let it be thine holy ambition to be advanced to the bleſſed participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Divine nature, and thereby to be more above thy ſelf then the
beaſt is below thee. Fight with thy ſelf till thou haſt beaten away the

               <p>But from the common view of theſe beaſts may it pleaſe you to caſt down
your eyes to the ſpecials. There are beaſts of Game, there are beaſts of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
neither of theſe are for this place. They are harmful beaſts with
which this fight is maintained, and yet not every harmful beaſt neither. Ye
know the Philoſopher, when he was ask'd which was the harmfulleſt of all
beaſts, anſwered, Of tame, the Flatterer; of wild, the Detractor. We have
nothing to doe with the former; and never may that peſtilent beaſt have
ought to doe with this Preſence: thoſe Serpents that ſwell up the Soul with
a plauſible poiſon, that kill a man laughing and ſleeping, thoſe Dogs that
worry their maſters, thoſe Vultures that feed on the eyes, on the hearts of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

ſword,</hi> Pſ. 57. 4. (It was a great vaunt that the witty Captain made of his

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that a man can make his own fingers, or that thoſe fingers can make that
wheat whereof the wafer is made, were a ſtrange folly: but that a man can
make the God that made him, and eat the God that he hath made, is ſuch

               <p>I Have carried you into S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Theatre at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> I have ſhew'd you
his Beaſts; you muſt now ſee his Fight. It was his charge to <hi>Timothy</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
that he ſhould be an example; know then that what he bids, he practiſes.
It is an exemplary combat which S. <hi>Paul</hi> fought, and that wherein we muſt
follow him as Teachers, as Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Here he ſaies, <hi>I have fought;</hi> afterwards, in imitation of him that ſaw his
own works and approved them, he ſaies, <hi>I have fought a good fight;</hi> doubtleſs,
as with principalities and powers elſewhere, ſo even with theſe beaſts at
<hi>Epheſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let it pleaſe you to ſee, firſt, the perſon of the combatant; then, ſecondly,
the manner of the fight.</p>
               <p>In the former ye may not look at S. <hi>Paul</hi> as a common ſouldier, but as a
ſelected Champion of God; not merely as <hi>Paul,</hi> but as an Apoſtle, as a publick <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
perſon, as the ſpiritual Leader of God's people: ſo <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>I have fought
with beaſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no trained man in the whole troup of God but muſt have his
bout with the beaſts of the Time. <hi>Vita hominis militia ſuper terram;</hi> we are
here in a militant Church. As we have all received our preſs-money in
Baptiſme, ſo we muſt every one according to our ingagement maintain this
fight againſt the world. But if a man be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as S. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſingled out
to a publick calling, now he muſt think himſelf made for combats, becauſe for
victories: for <hi>Bellum durius contra victores,</hi> as <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>It was the charge of the Apoſtle, that a Biſhop ſhould be no ſtriker,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
and <hi>Clericus percuſſor</hi> is an old brand of irregularity: But if in this kind he
ſtrike not, I muſt ſay of him as S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Ananias, God ſhall ſmite thee, thou
whited wall.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 15. 10.</note> All his whole life muſt be ſpent in theſe blows: he muſt be, as
<hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 23.</note>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a man of ſtrife and contention;</hi>
there is no beaſt comes in his way but he muſt have a fling at him. When
<hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Baſil</hi> deſigned to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> If
any man, ſaith he, pretend his weakneſs, <hi>non athletem, ſed doctorem creabitis.</hi>
But in this ſpiritual ſenſe, if he be a Doctor in the Chair, he muſt be a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
in the Theatre. No S. <hi>Martin</hi> may plead here, <hi>I am Chriſts Souldier, I
may not fight;</hi> yea therefore muſt he fight, becauſe he is Chriſts Souldier.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
Whoſoever then would be a fit combatant for God, to enter into theſe liſts
againſt the beaſts of the world, muſt be a S. <hi>Paul</hi> in proportion; ſo muſt he
<hi>be a follower of him, as he is of Chriſt.</hi> Will it pleaſe you to ſee him firſt quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
then armed.</p>
               <p>Qualified firſt, with Holineſs, Skill, Courage. Holineſs: For he muſt be a

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> man of God, and, as the Apoſtle charges, <gap reason="foreign">

he is a beaſt himſelf, and had need of ſome body to bait him. Wo be to
thoſe Champions of God that take upon them to wield the ſword of the
Spirit with unclean hands. That divine weapon is not ſo fit to wound any as
their own Souls. <hi>Ex ore tuo, ſerve nequam.</hi> Let me ſay truly, It were an happy
and hopeful thing, that even our external and ſecular Wars ſhould be managed
with pure and innocent hands. I ſhall tell you that which perhaps few of you
have either known or conſidered, that of old a ſouldier was a ſacred thing; and
it is worth your notice what in former times was the manner of our Anceſtors
in conſecrating a Souldier or a Knight to the wars. Some ſix hundred years
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> agoe and upward, as I find in the hiſtory of <hi>Ingulphus,</hi> the manner was this;
<hi>Anglorum erat conſuetudo, quod qui militiae legitimae conſecrandus eſſet, &amp;c.</hi> He
that ſhould be devoted to the trade of war, the evening before his conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
came to the Biſhop or Prieſt of the place, and in much contrition and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction
of heart made a confeſſion of all his ſins; and, after his abſolution,
ſpent that night in the Church, in watching, in prayers, in afflictive devotions:
on the morrow being to hear Divine Service, he was to offer up his Sword
upon the Altar, and after the Goſpel, the Prieſt was with a ſolemn benediction
to put it about his neck; and then after his communicating of thoſe ſacred
myſteries, he was to remain <hi>miles legitimus.</hi> Thus he; who tels us how that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> valiant and ſucceſsful Knight <hi>Heward</hi> came thus to his uncle, one <hi>Brandus,</hi> the
devout Abbot of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> for his conſecration; and that this Cuſtome
continued here in <hi>England</hi> till the irreligious <hi>Normans</hi> by their ſcorns put
it out of countenance, accounting ſuch a one <hi>non legitimum militem, ſed
equitem ſocordem, &amp; Quiritem degenerem.</hi> This was their ancient and laudable
manner (ſome ſhadow whereof we retain, whiles we hold ſome Orders of
Knighthood Religious.) And can we wonder to hear of noble victories at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved
by them, of Giants and Monſters ſlain by thoſe hands that had ſo pious
an initiation? Theſe men profeſſed to come to their combats as <hi>David</hi> did to
<hi>Goliah,</hi> in the name of the Lord; no marvel if they proſpered. Alas! now, <hi>Nulla
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> fides pietáſque,</hi> &amp;c. ye know the reſt: the name of a ſouldier is miſconſtrued by
our Gallants as a ſufficient warrant of debauchedneſs; as if a Buff-Jerkin were a
lawful cover for a profane heart. Wo is me for this ſinful degeneration. How
can we hope that bloody hands of lawleſs Ruffians ſhould be bleſſed with palms
of triumph; that adulterous eyes ſhould be ſhaded with garlands of victory;
that profane and atheous inſtruments, if any ſuch be imployed in our wars,
ſhould return home loaded with ſucceſs and honour? How ſhould they proſper
whoſe ſins fight againſt them more then all the ſwords of enemies; whoſe
main adverſary is in their own boſome and in Heaven? If the God of Heaven
be the Lord of hoſts, do we think him ſo laviſh that he will grace impiety? Can
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> we think him ſo in love with our perſons, that he will overlook or digeſt our
crimes? Be innocent, O ye warriours, if ye would be ſpeedful; be devout, if ye
would be victorious. Even <hi>upon the Bridles of the horſes</hi> in <hi>Zachary</hi> muſt be
written, <hi>Holineſs to the Lord:</hi> how much more upon the fore-heads of his Prieſts,
the Leaders of his ſpiritual war? With what face, with what heart can he fight
againſt beaſts that is a beaſt himſelf?</p>
               <p>It is not Holineſs yet that can ſecure us from blows: <hi>Job's Behemoth,</hi> as he
is conſtrued, durſt ſet upon the holy Son of God himſelf. To our Holineſs
therefore muſt be added Skill; skill to guard, and skill to hit; skill in choice of
weapons, places, times, ways of aſſault or defence: elſe we cannot but be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and toſſed at pleaſure. Hence the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Thou teacheſt my hands to war
and my fingers to fight.</hi> The title that is given to <hi>David</hi>'s Champions was not
<hi>diſpoſiti ad clypeum,</hi> as <hi>Montanus</hi> hath it (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) but <hi>diſponentes,</hi> ſuch as <hi>could
handle the ſhield and the buckler,</hi> 1 Chron. 12. 8. Alas, what is to be look'd for
of raw, untaught, untrained men, (if ſuch ſhould be called forth of their ſhops
on the ſudden) that know not ſo much as their files or motions or poſtures,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:44233:188"/>
but either ſlight or filling of ditches? He that will be a <hi>Petus</hi> in <hi>Jovius</hi> his hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
or a <hi>Servilius</hi> in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> to come off an untouch'd victor from frequent
challenges, had need to paſs many a guard and <hi>Veny</hi> in the fence-ſchool. So skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
muſt the man of God be, that he muſt know (as S.<hi>Paul</hi>) even <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
the very plots and devices of that great challenger of hell. We live in a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
age; and yet how many teachers are very novices in the practick part of
this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and therefore are either born down, or toſſed up with the vices
of the Time? whoſe miſcarriages would God it were as eaſie to remedy as to
lament.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, what is Skill in our weapon without an heart and hand to uſe it?
<hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> could ſay, <hi>Counſel and ſtrength are for the warre,</hi> 2 Kings 18. 20.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
Strength without Counſel is like a blind Giant, and Counſel without Strength
is like a quick-ſighted Criple. If heart and eyes and lims meet not, there can be
no fight, but <hi>tu pulſas, ego vapulo.</hi> What are men in this caſe but <hi>lepores galeati,</hi>
or as Sword-fiſhes, that have a weapon, but no heart? Hear the ſpirit of a right
Champion of Heaven; <hi>I am ready not to be bound onely, but to die for the name
of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Here was a man fit to grapple with beaſts. It is the word of
the ſluggiſh Coward, <hi>There is a Lion</hi> or a Bear <hi>in the way.</hi> What if there be? If
thou wilt be a <hi>Sampſon,</hi> a <hi>David,</hi> incounter them. There is no great glory to be
look'd for but with hazard and difficulty. When the Souldier ſaid, <hi>The enemy is
ſtrong,</hi> it was bravely anſwered of the Captain, <hi>The victory ſhall be ſo much more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
glorious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have ſhew'd you the man Qualified; I ſhould ſtay to ſhew you him Armed;
armed with Authority without, with Reſolution within: but I long to ſhew
you the Fight.</p>
               <p>A Fight it muſt be; which I beſeech you obſerve in the firſt place. Neither
doth he ſay, I plai'd with beaſts, except you would have it in <hi>Joab</hi>'s phraſe; as
neither did the beaſts play with him, except, as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Ludus exiit in
rabiem:</hi> He ſaies not, I humor'd their beſtiality; I ſtruck up a league or a truce
with the vices of men: No, S. <hi>Paul</hi> was far from this; he was at a perpetual
defiance with the wickedneſs of the times, and, as that valiant Commander ſaid,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
would die fighting.</p>
               <p>The world wanted not of old plauſible ſpirits, that, if an <hi>Ahab</hi> had a mind to
go up againſt <hi>Ramoth,</hi> would ſay, <hi>Go up and proſper,</hi> and would have horns of iron
to puſh him forward. S. <hi>Paul</hi> was none of them, neither may we. He hath indeed
bidden us (<hi>if it be poſsible) to have peace with all men;</hi> not with beaſts. If wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſhall go about to glaver with us, <hi>Is it peace, Jehu?</hi> we muſt return a ſhort
anſwer, and ſpeak blows. Far, far be it from us to fawn upon vicious Greatneſs,
to favour even Court-ſins. If here we meet with bloody Oaths, with ſcornful
Profaneneſs, with Pride, with Drunkenneſs, we muſt fly in the face of it with ſo
much more fierceneſs as the eminence of the ſin may make it more dangerouſly-exemplary:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  <hi>quò grandius nomen, eò grandius ſcandalum,</hi> as <hi>Bernard.</hi> Let the
cleareſt water mix with the beſt earth, it makes but mire. If we be the true Sons
of Thunder, even the talleſt Cedar-ſins muſt be blaſted with our Lightning, and
riven with our bolts. <hi>Cato</hi> would not (they ſay) have a dumb ſouldier; I am ſure
Chriſt will not. <hi>Wo be to</hi> us <hi>if we preach not the Goſpel:</hi> yea, wo be to us if we
preach not the Law too; if we do not laſh the guilt of the Great with the ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
of Judgement. What ſtand we upon bulk? if the Sin be an Elephant, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed,
and carrying Caſtles upon his back, we muſt with <hi>Eleazar</hi> creep under
his belly, and wound that vaſt enemy with the hazard of our own cruſhing. It is
the charge of God, <hi>Cry aloud, ſpare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and ſhew my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
people their tranſgreſsions, and the houſe of Jacob their ſins,</hi> Eſ. 58. 1. The words are
Emphatical, whereof the firſt ſignifies a ſtraining of the throat with crying; and
the next (the <hi>trumpet</hi>) implies a ſound of war. This ſame <hi>bellu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cum vitiis, war with
ſins,</hi> muſt be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, uncapable of ſo much as a truce, yea as a reſpiratió.
As that undaunted ſouldier therefore held firſt with his right hand, and when
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:44233:188"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that was cut off, with his left, and when both were cut off, with his teeth; ſo
muſt we reſolve to doe. That which is the praiſe of the Maſtives of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
muſt be ours, to leave our life with our hold. <hi>Profectò ſtabimus, &amp; pugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimus
uſque ad mortem, We will ſtand, and fight it out to the very death,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi>
ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>The manner of the Fight follows, and that muſt needs vary according to the
divers faſhions of the onſet. For all beaſts aſſail not alike: one fights with
his tusks, another with his paws, another with his horn, another with his heel,
another with his ſting; one rampeth upon us, another leaps in to us, a third
either ruſheth us down, or caſts us upward, a fourth galls us afarre, a fifth
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> wounds us unſeen; one kils by biting, another by ſtriking, another by piercing,
another by envenoming. According to theſe manifold changes of aſſaults
muſt the expert champion diſpoſe of himſelf. To ſpeak morally; as theſe
Men-beaſts are either Beaſts of Opinion, or beaſts of Practice, and both of
them maintain the fight either by cloſe ſubtilty or by open violence; ſo did
S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s oppoſition ſuit them, ſo muſt ours, whether for defence or for offence.
The beaſts of Opinion were either Idolatrous Ethnicks, or refractary Jews;
the one worſhipping <hi>Diana</hi> for their Goddeſs, the other refuſing the true
<hi>Meſsias</hi> for their Saviour. The one he beats with the down-right blows of
right Reaſon; the other he hews with the two-edged ſword of the Spirit, the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Word of God. The beaſts of Practice he ſmites through with the darts of the
Law, whereof <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 13. If a beaſt touch the Mount he ſhall be ſhot through.
Their ſubtilty he declined by a wiſe evaſion, their violence he repelled with
an irreſiſtible force. The particularities would be infinite; neither do any of
you exſpect that I ſhould turn the Pulpit into a Fence-ſchool or a Paris-garden.
Onely let me reduce S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s practice herein to ſome few uſeful rules, as to
expreſs his beaſt-combat, ſo to direct our own. Whereof the firſt (to begin
with the beaſts of Opinion) was and ſhall be, To fight ſtill at the head. When
he comes to the Theatre of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> he deals not with collateral matters of a
ſecondary nature, but flies upon the main heads of the higheſt contradiction,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> whether one true God onely ſhould be worſhipped, whether Chriſt ſhould be
acknowledged for the <hi>Meſsiah.</hi> No doubt, <hi>Epheſus</hi> was full of curious and
nice ſcruples: the wiſe Apoſtle waves all theſe; and, as ſome magnanimous
Maſtive, that ſcorns to ſet upon every Curre that barks at him in the way, he
reſerves himſelf for theſe Lions and Tigers of Errour. Oh how happy were it
for Chriſtendome, if we that profeſs to ſit at S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s feet (as he at <hi>Gamaliel</hi>'s)
could learn this wit of him! It is true which <hi>Chromatius</hi> hath, <hi>Non ſunt
parva quae Dei ſunt, None of Gods matters are ſlight:</hi> but yet there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and that would be obſerved. The working brains of ſubtile man have
been apt to mince Divinity into infinite Atomes of ſpeculation; and every one
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of thoſe ſpeculations breeds many queſtions, and every queſtion breeds
troubles in the Church; like as every corn of powder flies off and fires his
fellow. Hence are thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>fooliſh and unlearned diſquiſitions,</hi> 2 Tim.
2. 23. that have ſet the whole Chriſtian world together by the ears. <hi>Ex utraque
parte ſunt qui pugnare cupiunt,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaid of his time, <hi>There are enough on both
ſides that would fight.</hi> The main Fort of Religion is worth not our ſweat, but
our blood: thus muſt we ſtrive <hi>pro aris:</hi> ſo even Hereſie ſhall be found (as
<hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> obſerves) not more dangerous then profitable. But if it be onely
matter of rite, or of unimporting conſequence, (<hi>de venis capillaribus,</hi> as he ſaid)
Oh what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>adneſs is it in us to draw the world into ſides, and to pour out the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſouls of Gods people like water? what is this, but as if ſome generous Bandog
ſhould leave the Bear or Lion (<hi>primae formae feram</hi>) which he comes to bait, and
run after a Mouſe? <hi>Melanchthon</hi> cites and approves that ſaying of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of
<hi>Corinth</hi> in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> that Schiſme is no leſs ſin then idolatry. And if the Fiſh be
the better where the ſeas are moſt unquiet, I am ſure the Souls are worſe where
the Church is tumultuous. I cannot skill of theſe Swans eggs that are never
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:44233:189"/>
hatcht without thunder, nor of that unnatural brood that eats through the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
dam to make paſſage into the light of reputation. Oh for <hi>the unity of the ſpirit
in the bond of peace.</hi> Juſtly did <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> lament the ſtate of <hi>Greece,</hi> that had loſt
as many ſouldiers in domeſtick wars as might have made them Maſters of the
world. Let me ſay, Had all our ſwords and pens been happily bent againſt the
common enemy of Chriſtendome, long agoe had that <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Moon waned
to nothing, and given way to the glorious Sun of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Our ſecond rule muſt be, When we do ſmite, to ſtrike home: It is S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s,
<hi>I ſo fight,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>as not beating the aire,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 26. Here is not a
blow loſt, <hi>non verberat ictibus auras.</hi> How doth he cut the throat of the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi>
beaſt, Idolatry, whiles he argues, They are not Gods that are made with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
hands? All the Silver-ſmiths of <hi>Diana</hi> cannot hammer out a reply to this charge.
It is no flouriſhing when we come to this combat. Weak proofs betray good
cauſes. Demonſtrations muſt have place here, not Probabilities. How power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
doth he convince the unbelieving Jews of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Rome, out of Moſes
and the Prophets,</hi> Act. 28. 23. This, this is the weapon whereby our grand
Captain vanquiſhed the great challenger of the bottomleſs pit, <hi>Scriptum eſt.</hi>
All other blades are but Lead to this Steel. Councils, Fathers, Hiſtories are
good helps; but <hi>ad pompam</hi> rather then <hi>ad pugnam.</hi> Theſe Scriptures are

certain, <hi>Aufer ab haereticis quaecunque Ethnici ſapiunt, ut de Scripturis ſolis que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiones

of Pagans, and hold them cloſe to the trial by the Scriptures alone, they cannot
ſtand.</hi> Bring but this fire to the wildeſt beaſt, his eye will not indure it; he
muſt run away from it: for theſe kind of creatures are all (as that Father)
<hi>Lucifugae Scripturarum.</hi> What worlds of volumes had been ſpared, how infinite
diſtractions of weak and wavering ſouls had been prevented, if we had confined
our ſelves to S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s fence?</p>
               <p>Our third rule muſt be, To redouble our ſtrokes unceſſantly, unweariably,
not giving breath to the beaſt, not fainting for want of our own. S. <hi>Paul</hi> laid <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
on three months together in the Synagogue of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> two years more in
the ſchool of <hi>Tyrannus,</hi> Act. 19. 8, 9. and accordingly gives us our charge, <hi>State

ſouldier, who when he heard <hi>Xenophantus</hi> by his muſick ſtirring up <hi>Alexander</hi>
to the fight, wiſht rather to hear a Muſician that could take him off: but ſince
we have to doe with an enemy which <hi>nec victor nec victus novit quieſcere,</hi> as
<hi>Annibal</hi> ſaid of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> there is no way but to fight it out. <hi>Ye have not

weaken your hands from laying load upon the beaſt of Errour: Fight
zealouſly, fight indefatigably, and prevail. In the battails of Chriſt, as S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi>

               <p>Our laſt rule is, To know our diſtance; and where we find invincible reſiſtance,
to come off fairly. So did S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Theatre of the <hi>Epheſian</hi> Synagogue,
when after three months diſputation ſome were hardened, and in ſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving

Act. 19. 9. Thoſe beaſts we cannot maſter, we muſt give up: If <hi>Babylon</hi> will not

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be cur'd, ſhe muſt be left to her ſelf. To apply this to the Theatre of the
times. There is no challenge either more frequent or more heavy then that
we have left that Church which they miſcal our Mother. Had we gone from
her that is gone from her ſelf, we had but followed her in leaving her; had
we left her that hath blaſphemed her forſaken truth, we had but followed S.<hi>Paul:</hi>
but now let the world know, we have not left her, ſhe hath abandon'd us;
<hi>Non fugimus, ſed fugamur,</hi> as <hi>Caſaubon</hi> cites from our late Learned Soveraign.
It is her violence, not our choice, that hath excluded us: Becauſe we could
not but leave her errors, ſhe hath ejected our perſons. This ſchiſm ſhall one day
before that great Tribunal of Heaven fall heavily upon thoſe perverſe ſpirits,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that had rather rend the Church then want their will, and can be content to
ſacrifice both Truth and Peace, together with millions of Souls, to their own
ambition.</p>
               <p>Let this ſuffice for the beaſts of Opinion, which are Errours. Turn your
eyes now (if you pleaſe) to S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s fight with the beaſt of Practice, Vices. And
in the firſt place, ſee how the <hi>Epheſian</hi> beaſts fought with S. <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 19. 28, 29.
Ye find them as ſo many enraged Bulls, ſcraping the earth with their feet, and
digging it with their horns, ſnuffing up the aire with their raiſed noſtrils,
ruſhing furiouſly into the Theatre, toſſing up <hi>Gaius</hi> and <hi>Ariſtarchus, Paul</hi>'s
companions, into the aire, and with an impetuous violence carrying all before
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them. This hath been ever the manner of wickedneſs, to be headſtrong in the
purſuit of it's own courſes, impatient of oppoſition, cruel in revenge of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers.
Doth <hi>Eliah</hi> cry out againſt the murders and Idolatries of <hi>Ahab?</hi> the
beaſt hath him in chace for his life, and earths him in his cave. Doth <hi>Michaiah</hi>
croſs the deſignes of the falſe Prophets in the expedition of <hi>Ramoth?</hi> the

dungeon. Doth <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> bend his <hi>Non licet</hi> againſt <hi>Herodias</hi>'s inceſt? the
beaſt flies in his throat, and with one graſp tears his head from his ſhoulders.
So it ever was, ſo it ever will be. <hi>Am I become your enemy becauſe I tell you the

My new and dearly-affected CHARGE,
the Dioceſe of
EXCESTER,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
All Grace and Benediction.</head>
               <p>THE truth of my heart gives me boldneſs to profeſs before
him who onely knows it, that the ſame God who hath called
me to the over-ſight of your Souls, hath wrought in me a zealous
deſire of your Salvation. This deſire cannot but incite me to a
careful prevention of thoſe dangers which might threaten the diſappointment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
of ſo happy an end. Thoſe Dangers are either Sins of Practice, or Errours
of Doctrine. Againſt both theſe I have faithfully vowed my utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
I ſhall labour againſt the firſt by Preaching, Example, Cenſures;
wherein it ſhall be your choice to expect either the Rod, or the Spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Againſt the latter my Pen hath riſen up in this early aſſault. It
hath been aſſured me that in this time of late Vacancie, falſe Teachers,
catching the fore-lock of Occaſion, have been buſie in ſcattering the tares of
Errours amongſt you. I eaſily believe it, ſince I know it is not in the power
of the greateſt vigilancie to hinder their attempts of evil. Even a full See
is no ſufficient barre to crafty Seducers; their Suggeſtions we cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
their Succeſs we may. This I have here aſſay'd to doe, bending my
ſtyle againſt Popiſh Doctrine with ſuch Chriſtian moderation as may argue
zeal without malice, deſire to win Souls, no will to gall them. And ſince the
commoneſt of all the grounds of Romiſh deceit is the pretence of their Age
and our Novelty, and nothing doth more dazle the eyes of the ſimple then the
name of our Fore-fathers, and the challenge of a particular recital of our
Profeſſours before <hi>Luther</hi>'s revolt; I have (I hope) fully cleared this coaſt,
ſo as out of the right apprehenſion of theſe differences my Reader ſhall evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſee the vanity of this cavill, and finde cauſe to bleſs God fox the ſafety of
his ſtation in ſo pregnant and undeceivable a truth.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               </p>
               <p>For me, I ſhame not to profeſs, that I have paſſed my moſt and beſt hours
in quiet Meditations; wherein I needed not bend mine edge againſt any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
but Satan and mine own corruptions. Theſe controverſary points I have
rather croſt in my way, then taken along with me. Neither am I ignorant
what incomparably-clear beams (in this kind) ſome of the worthy Lights of
our Church have caſt abroad into all eyes, to the admiration of preſent and
future times; no corner of truth hath lyen unſearch'd, no plea unargued: the
wit of man cannot make any eſſential additions either to our proofs or anſwers.
But as in the moſt perfect diſcovery, where Lands and Rivers are ſpecially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
there may be ſome ſmall obſcure inlets reſerved for the notice of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
experience; ſo is it in the buſineſs of theſe ſacred quarrels: that brain
is very unhappy which meets not with ſome traverſe of diſcourſe more then
it hath borrowed from anothers Pen. Beſides which, having faln upon a
method and manner of Tractation which might be of uſe to plain underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
the familiarity whereof promiſed to contribute not a little to the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:44233:191"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and ſetling of weaker Souls, I might not hide it from you, to whoſe
common good I have gladly resolved to ſacrifice my ſelf. Let it be taken
with the ſame conſtruction of love wherewith it is tendred. And that
you may improve this and all other my following labours to a ſenſible ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
give me leave to impart my ſelf to you a little in this ſhort and free
Preamble.</p>
               <p>It is a large body, I know, and full of ordinate variety, to which I How direct
my words: Let me a while in theſe lines ſever them, whom I would never
abide really disjoined.</p>
               <p>Ye, my dear fellow-labourers (as my immediate Charge) may well challenge
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the firſt place. It is no ſmall joy to me to expect ſo able hands, upon whom
I may comfortably unload the weight of this my ſpiritual care. If Fame do
not over-ſpeak you, there are not many ſoils that yield either ſo frequent
Flocks or better fed. Goe on happily in theſe high ſteps of true Bleſſedneſs,
and ſave your ſelves and others. To which purpoſe let me commend to you
(according to the ſweet experience of a greater Shepherd) two main helps of our
Sacred trade; firſt, the tender Paſtures, and ſecondly, the ſtill Waters: By the
one I mean an inuring of our people to the principles of wholeſome Doctrine;
by the other, an immunitie from all Faction and diſturbance of the publick
peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> It was the obſervation of the learnedſt King that ever ſate hitherto on the
Engliſh Throne, that the cauſe of the miſcarriage of our People into Popery
and other Errours was, their ungroundedneſs in the points of Catechiſm. How
ſhould thoſe Souls be but <hi>carried about with every winde of Doctrine,</hi> that
are not well ballaſted with ſolid informations? Whence it was that his ſaid
late Majeſtie (of happy memory) gave publick order for beſtowing the latter
part of Gods Day in familiar Catechiſing; then which nothing could be devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
more neceſſary and behoveful to the Souls of men. It was the Ignorance and
ill-diſpoſedneſs of ſome cavillers that taxed this courſe, as prejudicial to Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
ſince, in truth, the moſt uſeful of all Preaching is Catechetical. This
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> layes the Grounds, the other raiſeth the Walls and Roof; this informs the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that ſtirs up the Affections. What good uſe is there of thoſe Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that run before the Judgment, or of thoſe walls that want a Foundation?
For my part, I have ſpent the greater half of my life in this ſtation of our
holy ſervice; I thank God, not unpainfully, not unprofitably. But there is no
one thing whereof I repent ſo much, as not to have beſtowed more hours in
this publick Exerciſe of Catechiſm; in regard whereof I could quarrel with
my very Sermons, and wiſh that a great part of them had been exchanged for
this Preaching conference. Thoſe other Divine Diſcourſes enrich the Brain
and the Tongue, this ſettles the Heart; thoſe other are but the deſcants to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> this plain-ſong. Contemn it not, my Brethren, for the eaſie and noted home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs:
the moſt excellent and beneficial things are moſt familiar. What can
be more obvious then Light, Aire, Fire, Water? Let him that can live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
theſe, deſpiſe their commonneſs. Rather, as we make ſo much more uſe
of the Divine bounty in theſe ordinary benefits, ſo let as the more gladly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
theſe ready and facile helps to the Salvation of many Souls; the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
whereof breeds inſtability of Judgment, miſpriſion of neceſſary Truths,
faſhionableneſs of profeſsion, frothineſs of diſcourſe, obnoxiouſneſs to all Errour
and Seduction. And if any of our people loath this Manna becauſe they may
gather it from under their Feet, let not their palates be humour'd in this
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> wanton nauſeation. They are worthy to faſt, that are weary of <hi>the bread
of Angels.</hi> And if herein we be curious to ſatisfie their roving appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
our favour ſhall be no better then injurious. So we have ſeen an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet School-maſter, whiles he affects the thanks of an over-weening Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
marre the progreſs of a forward child, by raiſing him to an higher form
and Authour, ere he have well learned his firſt rules; whence follows an
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:44233:192"/>
empty oſtentation, and a late diſappointment. our fidelity and care of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
muſt teach us to drive at the moſt ſure and univerſal good, which
ſhall undoubtedly be beſt attained by theſe ſafe and needful ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works.</p>
               <p>From theſe tender Paſtures let me leade you (and you others) to the ſtill
Waters. Zeal in the Soul is as natural heat in the body; there is no life
of Religion without it: But as the kindlieſt heat, if it be not tempered
with a due equality of moiſture, waſtes it ſelf and the body; ſo doth Zeal,
if it be not moderated with diſcretion and charitable care of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good. It is hard to be too vehement in contending for main and
evident truths; but litigious and immaterial verities may ſoon be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriven <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
for: in the proſecution whereof, I have oft lamented to ſee how heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
too many have been of the publick welfare; whiles in ſeeking for one
ſcruple of truth, they have not cared to ſpend a whole pound-weight of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Peace.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>England,</hi> in whoſe Motherhood we have all juſt cauſe to
pride our ſelves, hath in much Wiſdom and Piety delivered her judgement
concerning all neceſſary points of Religion, in ſo compleat a body of Divinity
as all hearts may reſt in: Theſe we reade, theſe we write under, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsing
not their truth onely, but their ſufficiency alſo. The voice of God
our Father in his Scriptures, and (out of theſe) the voice of the Church <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
our Mother in her Articles, is that which muſt both guide and ſettle our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions:
Whatſoever is beſides theſe, is but either private, or unneceſſary
and uncertain. Oh that whiles we ſweat and bleed for the maintenance of
theſe oracular Truths, we could be perſwaded to remit of our Heat in the
purſuit of Opinions! Theſe, theſe are they that diſtract the Church, violate
our peace, ſcandalize the weak, advantage our enemies. Fire upon the Hearth
warms the Body, but if it be miſplaced, burns the Houſe. My brethren, let
us be Zealous for our God; every hearty Chriſtian will pour Oyle and not
Water upon this holy flame: But let us take heed leſt a blind ſelf-love,
ſtiffe prejudice and factious partiality impoſe upon us, in ſtead of the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
of God. Let us be ſuſpicious of all New Verities, and careleſs of all
unprofitable; and let us hate to think our ſelves either wiſer then the Church,
or better then our Superiours. And if any man think that he ſees fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then his fellows in theſe Theological proſpects, let his tongue keep the
counſel of his eyes; left whiles he affects the fame of deeper learning, he
embroile the Church, and raiſe his glory upon the publick ruines.</p>
               <p>And ye worthy Chriſtans, whoſe Souls God hath entruſted with our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Guardianſhip, be ye alike minded with your Teachers. The motion of
their tongues lies much in your eares: your modeſt deſires of receiving need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and wholeſome Truths ſhall avoid their labour after frivolous and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
Curioſities. God hath bleſſed you with the reputation of a wiſe and
knowing people: In theſe Divine matters let a meek Sobriety ſet bounds to
your inquiries. Take up your time and hearts with Chriſt and Him crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
with thoſe eſſential Truths which are neceſſary to Salvation: leave all
curious diſquiſitions to the Schools, and ſay of thoſe Problems as the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
did of the <hi>Athenian</hi> ſhops, <hi>How many things are here that we have
no need of?</hi> Take the neareſt cut you can, ye ſhall find it a ſide-way to
Heaven; ye need not lengthen it with undue circuitions. I am deceived
if (as the times are) ye ſhall not find work enough to bear up againſt the
oppoſitions of profeſſed hoſtility. It is not for us to ſquander our thoughts
and hours upon uſeleſs janglings; wherewith if we ſuffer our ſelves to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
be ſtill taken up, Satan ſhall deal with us like ſome crafty Cheater, who
whiles he holds us at gaze with tricks of jugling, picks our pockets.</p>
               <p>Dear Brethren, whatever become of theſe worthleſs driblets, be ſure to
look well to the free-hold of your Salvation. Errour is not more buſie then
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:44233:192"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſubtile; Superſtition never wanted ſweet inſinuations: make ſure work
againſt theſe plauſible dangers. Suffer not your ſelves to be drawn into the
net by the common ſtale of the Church. Know that outward Viſibility may
too well ſtand with an utter excluſion from Salvation. Salvation conſiſts
not in a formalitie of Profeſsion, but in a Soundneſs of Belief. A true
body may be full of mortall diſeaſes: So is the <hi>Roman</hi> Church of this day;
whom we have long pitied, and labored to cure in vain. If ſhe will not be
healed by us, let us not be infected by her. Let us be no leſs jealous of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion,
then ſhe is of our remedies. Hold faſt that precious Truth which
hath been long taught you by faithful Paſtors, confirmed by clear evidences
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of Scriptures, evinced by ſound Reaſons, ſealed up by the blood of our bleſſed
Martyrs: So whiles no man takes away the crown of your conſtancie, ye ſhall
be our <hi>Crown and rejoycing in the day of our Lord Jeſus;</hi> to whoſe all-ſufficient
Grace I commend you all, and vow my ſelf</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> It muſt be onely under the garment of our elder Brother that we dare come
in for a Bleſſing; His Righteouſneſs made ours by Faith, is that whereby we
are juſtified in the ſight of God. This Doctrine is that which is blaſted with a
<hi>Tridentine</hi> curſe.</p>
               <p>Heat now the Hiſtory of this Doctrine of Juſtification, related by their
<hi>Andrew Vega (de Juſtif. lib. 7. cap. 24.) Magnafuit,</hi> &amp;c. <q>Some Ages ſince
(ſaith he) there was a great concertation amongſt Divines what ſhould be
the formal cauſe of our Juſtification. Some thought it to be no created
Juſtice infuſed into man, but onely the favour and merciful acceptation
of God. In which opinion the Maſter of Sentences is thought by ſome to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> have been. Others, whoſe opinion is more common and probable, held it
to be ſome created quality informing the Souls of the Juſt. This Opinion
was allowed in the Council of <hi>Vienna:</hi> and the School-Doctors, after the
Maſter of Sentences, delivered this not as probable onely, but as certain.
Afterwards, when ſome defended the oppoſite part to be more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
it ſeemed good to the holy Synod of <hi>Trent</hi> thus to determine it.</q>
                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:44233:197"/>
So as till the late Council of <hi>Trent</hi> (by the confeſſion of <hi>Vega</hi> himſelf) this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
Opinion was maintained as probable onely, not as of Faith: Yea, I adde, (by
his leave) the contrary was till then moſt current.</p>

                  <p>IN very Reaſon, where all is of mere Duty, there can be no Merit; for how
can we deſerve reward by doing that, which if we did not we ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend?
It is enough for him that is obliged to his task, that his work is well
taken. Now all that we can poſſibly doe, and more, is moſt juſtly due unto
God by the bond of our Creation, of our Redemption, by the charge
of his Royal Law, and that ſweet Law of his Goſpel: Nay, alas! we are
far from being able to compaſs ſo much as our duty; <hi>In many things we
ſin all.</hi> It is enough that in our Glory we cannot ſin: though their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Stapulenſis</hi> would not yield ſo much, and taxeth <hi>Thomas</hi> for ſaying ſo:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

then abſurd.</p>
                  <p>We cannot merit of him whom we gratifie not: we cannot gratifie a man
with his own. All our good is God's already, his gift, his propriety:
<hi>What have we that we have not received?</hi>

                  <p>And as well might they take away the Bread as the Cup; both depend upon

neceſſary; the ſame command of Chriſt equally enjoynes the Cup; both do

                  <p>And could this Myſtery be hid from the eyes of the Bleſſed Authours of this

not ſeen it uſeful, why did he not then ſpare the labour and coſt of ſo needleſs

held at <hi>London</hi> in the days of Pope <hi>Conſtantine, Anno</hi> 714. wherein the
worſhip of Images was publickly decreed; the occaſion whereof was this:
<hi>Egwin</hi> the Monk (after made Biſhop) had a Viſion from God, wherein he was
admoniſhed to ſet up the Image of the Mother of God in his Church. The
matter was debated, and brought before the Pope in his See Apoſtolick:

ſent his Legate <hi>Boniface</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> who called a Council at <hi>London;</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> wherein, after proof made of <hi>Egwin</hi>'s Viſion, there was an act made for Image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip.

upon it, with a <hi>facilè inducimur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>we are eaſily induced to believe it to be a lie.</hi>
Their ground is, that it is deſtitute of all teſtimony of Antiquity; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
that it doth directly croſs the report of <hi>Beda,</hi> who tels us that our
Engliſh, together with the Goſpel, received that uſe of Images from their

                  <hi>Polydore Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Machiavel</hi> (and who not?)
tell us, <hi>Boniface</hi> the Eighth, who lived <hi>Anno</hi> 1300. was the firſt that extended
Indulgences to Purgatory, the firſt that deviſed a Jubilee for the full utterance
of them. The Indulgences of former times were no other then relaxations of
Canonical Penances, which were enjoined to hainous ſinners; whereof <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
the Biſhop of <hi>Wormes</hi> ſets down many particulars, about the year 1020.
For example, if a man had committed wilfull murther, he was to faſt forty
daies together in bread and water, (which the common people calls a Lent) and
to obſerve a courſe of Penance for ſeven years after. Now theſe years of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and theſe Lents were they which the Pardons of former times were uſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
to ſtrike off or abate, according as they found reaſon in the diſpoſition of the
Penitent: which may give light to thoſe terms of ſo many Lents and years
remitted in former Indulgences. But that there ſhould be a ſacred treaſure of
the Church, wherein are heaped up piles of ſatisfaction of Saints, whereof only
the Pope keeps the keyes, and hath power to diſpenſe them where he liſts, is
ſo late a device,<note place="margin">Greg. de Val. &amp; Bellarm. l. 2. de Indulgent.</note> that <hi>Gregorie</hi> of <hi>Valence</hi> is forced to confeſſe, that not ſo much
as <hi>Gratian</hi> or <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> (which wrote about 400 years before him) ever
made mention of the name of Indulgence.</p>
               <p>Well therefore might <hi>Durand</hi> and <hi>Antonine</hi> grant it not to be found either
in the Scriptures or in the writings of the antient Doctors: and our B. <hi>Fiſher</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
goes ſo far in the acknowledgement of the Newneſs thereof, that he hath run
into the cenſure of late Jeſuites.</p>
               <p>Juſt and warrantable is that challenge of Learned <hi>Chemnitius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chemn. Exam. de Indulgent. c. 4.</note> that no teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
can be produced of any Father or of any antient Church, that either ſuch
Doctrine or Practice of ſuch Indulgences was ever in uſe untill towards 1200
years after Chriſt. <hi>Talium indulgentiarum:</hi> Some there were in the time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly

                  <hi>Per
annos ferme mille ducentos. Bellarmine</hi> inſtances in the third Council of <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi>
about the year 1116. wherein Pope <hi>Paſchal</hi> the ſecond gave Indulgences of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
forty daies to thoſe which viſited the threſhold of the Apoſtles. But it muſt
be conſidered, that we muſt take this upon the bare word of <hi>Conrad. Urſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſis.</hi>
Secondly, that this Indulgence of his is no other but a relaxation of
Canonical Penance. For he addes, (which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> purpoſely concealeth) <hi>iis
qui de capitalibus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to thoſe that ſhould doe Penance for capital ſins, he releaſed
forty daies Penance.</hi> So as this inſtance helps nothing; neither are the reſt,
which he hath raked together within the compaſſe of a few preceding years,
of any other alloy.</p>
               <p>Neither hath that Cardinal offered to cite one Father for the proof of this
Practice, the birth whereof was many hundred years after their expiration; but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
cunningly ſhifts it off with a cleanly excuſe,<note place="margin">Bellaum. l. 2. de Indul. cap. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Neque mirum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Neither may it
ſeem ſtrange if we have not many antient Authours that make mention of theſe
things in the Church, which are preſerved only by uſe, not by writing.</hi> So he. He
ſaies, <hi>Not many Authours;</hi> he ſhews not one. And if many matters of rite have
been traduced to the Church without notice of Pen or Preſſe; yet let it be
ſhewn what one Doctrine or Practice of ſuch importance as this is pretended
to be hath eſcaped the report and maintenance of ſome Eccleſiaſtick Writer or
other, and we ſhall willingly yield it in this. Till then, we ſhall take this but for
a mere colour, and reſolve that our honeſt <hi>Roſſenſis</hi> deals plainly with us, who
tells us, <hi>Quamdiu nulla fuer at de Purgatorio cura,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So long as there was no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>

who can marvel concerning Indulgences, that there was no uſe of them in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

                  <p>NOT to ſcan particulars, which all yield ample exceptions, but to wind them
all up in one bottome. Whoſoever ſhall look into the Scripture, ſhall finde
it apparent, that as in the time of mans Innocency there were but Two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the Tree of Life; and the Tree of Knowledge: ſo before and under
the Law, however they had infinite Rites, yet in the proper ſenſe they had but
Two Sacraments, the ſame in effect with thoſe under the Goſpel; the one, the
Sacrament of Initiation, which was their Circumciſion, parallel'd by that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Baptiſme which ſucceeded it; the other the Sacrament of our holy Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that ſpirituall meat and drink, which was their Paſchall Lambe and
Manna, and water from the rock, prefiguring the true Lambe of God, and bread
of life, and blood of our Redemption. The great Apoſtle of the Gentiles,
that well knew the Analogy,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> hath compared both; <hi>Moreover, brethren, I
would not have you ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all
paſſed through the ſea; and all were baptized in the cloud, and in the ſea; and all
did eat the ſame ſpirituall meat, and all did drink the ſame ſpirituall drink: for
they drank of that ſpirituall Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Chriſt.</hi>
What is this in any juſt conſtruction, but that the ſame two Sacraments of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, which we celebrate under the Goſpel, were
the very ſame with thoſe which were celebrated by Gods ancient people under
the Law; they two, and no more? <hi>Hoc facite, Doe this,</hi> is our warrant for the

                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s eluſion is not a little prejudicial to his own Cauſe.
He tells us that Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of thoſe Points which are ſimply neceſſary

<hi>But beſides theſe, there are many other things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which we have

of Chriſtians need not look at his Traditions? that commonly men may be
ſaved without them? that Heaven may be attained though there were no Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions?
Who will not now ſay, Let me come to Heaven by Scripture, goe
you whither you will by Traditions? To which adde, that agreat, yea the
greater part (if we may believe ſome of their own) of that which they call <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Religion is grounded upon onely Tradition. If then Tradition be onely of
ſuch things as are not ſimply neceſſary to Salvation, then the greater part of
their miſ-named Religion muſt needs be yielded for ſimply unneceſſary to all

he requires us to know him, to obey him, it muſt needs follow that he hath left

&amp;c. <hi>In the time of the antient Councils, Popes were like to the other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of thoſe Councils, ſo as there was no need of any act for holding them back
from this immoderate licence of diſpenſing; yea, if we do well turn over the laws
and hiſtories of the Antient, we ſhall finde that Popes did not preſume ſo eaſily
and commonly to diſpenſe with Decrees of Councils, but obſerved them as the
Oracles of God himſelf; yea, not onely did they forbear to doe it ordinarily, but
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> perhaps not once did they ever diſpenſe at all, againſt the Decrees of Councils:

               <p>But will not this ſeem to ſavour of too much indifferency? What need we

zeal. If they be acquainted with the juſt value of Truth, they ſhall not enquire
ſo much into the Perſons as into the Cauſe. Whatever the Church be, if the
Errours be damnable, our blood is happily ſpent in their impugnation; and we
muſt rather chuſe to undergoe a thouſand deaths, then offend the Majeſty of

               <p>Nothing can be ſo well ſaid or done, but may be ill taken. Whiles I thus
ſincerely plead for Truth, the well-meaning ignorance of ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
hath paſſed as deep, as unjuſt cenſures upon me, as if Preferment
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> had changed my note, and taught me to ſpeak more plauſible language
concerning the <hi>Roman</hi> Church then I either did or ought. Wherein as I pity their
Uncharitableneſſe, ſo I earneſtly deſire to rectifie their Judgement; leſt their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
may turn more to their ſin then to my wrong.</p>
               <p>The main ground of the Exception is, That I yield the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> a true
viſible Church; wherein the harſh noiſe of a miſ-conſtrued phraſe offends their
eare, and breeds their quarrell. For this (belike) in their apprehenſion ſeems to
ſound no leſſe then as if I had ſaid, The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a true-believing Church,
or a true part of the myſticall body of Chriſt: a ſenſe which is as far wide from my
words or thoughts, as from truth it ſelf. Wherefore ſerves this Book but to evince
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the manifold Corruptions of that foul Church? That ſhe is truely viſible, abates
nothing of her abominations: For who ſees not that <hi>Viſible</hi> refers to outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion,
<hi>True</hi> to ſome eſſentiall Principles of Chriſtianity, neither of them to ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Belief? So as theſe two may too well ſtand together, A true viſible Church,
in reſpect of outward Profeſsion of Chriſtianity; and an Hereticall, Apoſtaticall,
Antichriſtian Synagogue, in reſpect of Doctrine and Practice. Grant the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi>
to be but Chriſtians, how corrupt ſoever, and we cannot deny them the name
of a Church. Outward Viſibility gives them no claim either to Truth or Salvation.</p>
               <p>Shortly then, in two things I muſt crave leave to vindicate my ſelf: One,
that I do no whit differ from my ſelf; the other, that I differ not from the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of our beſt, Orthodox, and approvedly-claſsicall Divines. Both which cleared,
what have I done?</p>
               <p>It is a grievous challenge, this of Inconſtancy: for though, whiles we are here
in this region of Mutability, our whole man is ſubject to change, yet we do all herein
affect a likeneſſe to the God of Truth, <hi>in whom there is no ſhadow by turning;</hi>

a raſh and ignorant Zeal thus to lye palpably in your way to Truth? Be but pleaſed
to caſt your eyes upon the firſt Chapter of that Book of mine (which is thus objected
to me in a cauſeleſſe exprobration) that which long ſince I wrote, of the Irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lableneſſe
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſee if that Section be not a full expreſsion of the ſame
Truth (and that in the ſame words) which I have here publiſhed. There ſhall you
finde taught, That there is no other difference betwixt us and <hi>Rome,</hi> then betwixt
a Church miſerably corrupted, and happily purged; betwixt a ſickly, languiſhing,
dying Church, and one that is healthfull, ſtrong, and flouriſhing: That <hi>Valdus,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  <hi>Wiclef, Luther,</hi> did never goe about to frame a new Church, which was not, but to
cleanſe, reſtore, reform that Church which was: That they meant onely to be Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
to heal, not Parents to beget a Church. There you ſhall finde, That we are all the
ſame Church by virtue of our outward Vocation, whoſoever all the world over
worſhip <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the only Son of God, the Saviour of the world, and profeſſe the
ſame common Creed; that ſome of us doe this more purely, others more corruptly;
that in the mean time we are all Chriſtians, but ſound Chriſtians we are not. There
ye ſhall finde this very Objection ſo fully anſwered, as if it had been either formerly
moved, or ſo long ſince prevented: the words are theſe;</p>
               <q>
                  <p>But how harſhly doth this ſound to a weak reader, and more then ſeems to need <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
reconciliation with it ſelf, that the Church ſhould be one, and yet cannot be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled?
Certainly yet ſo it is. The dignity of the outward forme (which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
this Unity in it ſelf) avails nothing to Salvation, nothing to Grace, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the ſoundneſſe of Doctrine. The Net doth not ſtraight make all to be
Fiſh that it hath dragg'd together; ye ſhall finde in it vile weeds, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
elſe that devouring element hath diſgorged. The Church is at once one in
reſpect of the common Principles of Faith; and yet in reſpect of conſequences and
that rabble of opinions which they have raked together, ſo oppoſed, that it cannot
(as things now ſtand) by any glew of Concord (as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaketh) nor bond
of Unity, be conjoined. That which <hi>Rome</hi> holds with us, makes it a Church; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
that which it obtrudes upon us, makes it Hereticall: the truth of Principles
makes it one; the Error and impiety of Additions makes it irreconcilable, &amp;c.
Look on the face therefore of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, ſhe is ours, ſhe is Gods: look on
her back, ſhe is quite contrary, Antichriſtian. More plainly, <hi>Rome</hi> doth both hold
the Foundation, and deſtroy it; ſhe holds it directly, deſtories it by conſequent:
In that ſhe holds it, ſhe is a true Church, howſoever impured; in that ſhe deſtroies
it, (what ſemblance ſoever ſhe makes) ſhe is a Church of malignants. If ſhe did
altogether hold it, ſhe ſhould be ſound and Orthbox; if altogether ſhe deſtroied it,
ſhe ſhould be either no Church, or deviliſh: but now that ſhe profeſſes to hold thoſe
things directly which by inferences ſhe cloſely overthrows, ſhe is a truely viſible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
Church, but an unſound one.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This I freely both taught and publiſhed, with the allowance, with the applauſe of
that moſt Reverend Synod; and now, doth the addition of a Dignity bring envy
upon the ſame Truth? Might that paſſe commendably from the pen or tongue of a

Church, a multitude of Chriſtians profeſsing to agree in the main Principles

Church of <hi>Rome</hi> both a Church, and truely viſible? So as ſhortly, in a large
ſenſe of <hi>True Church,</hi> theſe Divines cannot but deſcend to us; in a ſtrict
ſenſe of both, we cannot but aſcend to them: in fine, both agree in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

rejects all Errours in Doctrine whereby the ſame Religion is corrupted: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that well-allowed Author ſpeaks home to my meaning, though in other
terms. That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church holds the neceſſary Heads of Religion,
gives it a right, in my ſenſe, to a true Viſibilitie; that it holds foul Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
whereby the Doctrine is corrupted, makes it falſe in belief, whiles it
hath a true Being.</p>
               <p>This then may give ſufficient light to that paſſage in my ſixth page, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
ſome have heedleſly ſtumbled. That which I cited from <hi>Luther</hi> out of <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus,</hi>
I finde alſo alledged by Doctor <hi>Field</hi> out of <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf;<note place="margin">Append. ubi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note> the
words are, that <hi>under the Papacy is the very kernel of Chriſtianity, much
good, yea all.</hi> Know, Reader, the words are <hi>Luther</hi>'s, not mine: neither
doth he ſay, in the Papacy, but, <hi>under</hi> it; under it, indeed, to trample upon,
not to poſſeſs; or if to poſſeſs, yet not to injoy. Their fault is not in defect of
neceſſary Truths, but in exceſs of ſuperfluous additions. <hi>Luther</hi> explicates
himſelf; For his <hi>Kernel</hi> is the ſeveral Articles of Chriſtian belief; his <hi>all
good,</hi> is Scriptures, Sacraments, Creeds, Councils, Fathers; all theſe they have,
but (God knows) miſerably corrupted. That they thus have them, is no whit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
worſe for us, and little better for themſelves: would to God they were theirs as
well in true uſe as in poſſeſsion.</p>
               <p>It was an ill deſcant that a nimble Papiſt made upon thoſe words of <hi>Luther,</hi>
which yield them the kernel of Chriſtianity, <hi>If we have the kernel</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>let them take the ſhell.</hi> Soft, friend, you are too witty: <hi>Luther</hi> did not give
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:44233:217"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> you the kernell, and reſerve us the ſhell: He yielded you both kernell and
ſhell, ſuch as it is, but the ſhell rotten, the kernell worm-eaten. Make much
of your kernell, but (as you have uſed it) it is but a bitter morſel; ſwallow that
if you pleaſe, and ſave the ſhell in your pocket.</p>
               <p>Neither think to goe away with an idle miſpriſion, We are a true viſible
Church, what need we more? why ſhould we wiſh to be other then we are?
Alas, poor ſouls! a true Viſibility may and doth ſtand with a falſe Belief. Ye
may be of a true viſible Church, and yet never the nearer to Heaven. It is
your intereſt in the true myſticall body of Chriſt that muſt ſave your Souls,
not in the outwardly viſible: your Errours may be, and are, no leſs damnable,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for that ye are by outward profeſsion Chriſtians, yea ſo much the more, Woe is
me, your danger is more viſible then your Church. If ye perſiſt wilfully in theſe
groſs Corruptions, which do by conſequent raze that foundation which ye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
to lay, ye ſhall be no leſs viſible ſpectacles of the wrath of that juſt God,
whoſe Truth and Spirit ye have ſo ſtubbornly reſiſted. The God of Heaven
open your eyes to ſee the glorious light of his Truth, and draw your hearts to
the love of it; and make your Church as truely ſound, as it is truly viſible.</p>
               <p>Thus, in a deſire to ſtand but ſo right as I am in all honeſt judgements, I have
made this ſpeedy and true Apologie; beſeeching all Readers in the fear of God
(before whoſe bar we ſhall once give an account of all our overlaſhings)
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to judge wiſely and uprightly of what I have written; in a word, to

            <p>I Confeſs my Charity led me into an Errour. Your Lordſhip well knows
how apt I am to be overtaken with theſe better deceits of an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
credulity. I had thought that any daſh of my Pen, in a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and eaſie advertiſement, might have ſerved to have quitted that
ignorant Scandal which was caſt upon my miſtaken Aſſertion of the true
Viſibility of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church. The iſſue proves all otherwiſe: I
finde, to my grief, that the miſunderſtanding tenacity of ſome zealous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
hath made it a quarrel. It cannot but trouble me to ſee that the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
which is ſo familiarly current with the beſt Reformed Divines, and
which hath been ſo oft and long ſince publiſhed by me without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
yea not without the approbation and applauſe of the whole repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative
body of the Clergy of this Kingdom, ſhould now be quarrelled,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
and drawn into the deteſtation of thoſe that know it not. As one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that ſhould think it corroſive enough, that any occaſion ſhould be taken
by ought of mine to ravell but one thred of that ſeamleſs Coat, I do earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſire by a more full explication to give clear ſatisfaction to all Readers;
and by this ſeaſonable Reconcilement to ſtop the flood-gates of contention.
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:44233:218"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> I know it will not be unpleaſing to your Lordſhip, that through your Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and Pious hands theſe welcome Papers ſhould be tranſmitted to many.
Wherein I ſhall firſt beſeech, yea adjure, all Chriſtians under whoſe eyes
they ſhall fall, by the dreadful Name of that God who ſhall judge both the
quick and the dead, to lay aſide all unjuſt Prejudices, and to allow the words
of Truth and Peace. I dare confidently ſay, Let us be underſtood, and we
are agreed.</p>
            <p>The Searcher of all hearts knows how far it was from my thoughts to
ſpeak ought in favour of the <hi>Romane</hi> Synagogue: If I have not ſufficiently
branded that Strumpet,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> I juſtly ſuffer. <hi>Luther</hi>'s broad word is by me already
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> both ſafely conſtrued, and ſufficiently vindicated. But do you not ſay, It is a
true viſible Church?<note place="margin">Reſp.</note> Do you not yield ſome kinde of Communion with
theſe clients of Antichriſt? What is, if this be not, Favour? Mark well,
Chriſtian Reader, and the Lord give thee underſtanding in all things. To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with the latter: No man can ſay but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds ſome
Truths; thoſe Truths are God's, and in his right ours; why ſhould not we
challenge our own whereſoever we find it? If a very Devil ſhall ſay of Chriſt,
<hi>Thou art the Son of the living God,</hi> we will ſnatch this Truth out of his
mouth as uſurped, and in ſpight of him, proclaim it for our own. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
there is no <hi>communion betwixt light and darkneſs;</hi> but there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
betwixt light and light: Now all Truth is Light, and therefore
ſymbolizeth with it ſelf. With that light therefore whoſe glimmering yet
remains in their darkneſs, our clearer light will and muſt hold communion.
If they profeſs Three Perſons in one Godhead, Two Natures in one Perſon
of Chriſt; ſhall we detrect to joyn with them in this Chriſtian Verity?
We abhor to have any Communion with them in their Errours, in their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
or Superſtitious practices; theſe are their own, not ours. If we durſt
have taken their part in theſe, this breach had not been. Now, who can
but ſay that we muſt hate their evil, and allow their good? It is no counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to their Errours that we imbrace our own Truths; it is no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to our Truths that they have blended them with their Errours. Here
can be no difference then, if this Communion be not miſtaken: No man will
ſay that we may ſever from their common Truths; no man will ſay that we
may joyn with them in their hateful Errours.</p>
            <p>For the former, He that ſaith a Thief is truly a man, doth he therein favour
that Thief? He that ſaith a diſeaſed, dropſied, dying body is a true (though
corrupt) body, doth he favour that Diſeaſe, or that living carkaſs? It is no
other, no more that I ſay of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Trueneſs of Being and
outward Viſibility are no praiſe to her; yea theſe are aggravations to her
falſhood. The advantage that is both ſought and found in this Aſſertion
is onely ours, as we ſhall ſee in the ſequel, without any danger of their
gain. I ſay then, that ſhe is a True Church; but I ſay withall, ſhe is a
falſe Church: True in Exiſtence, but falſe in Belief. Let not the homony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
of a word breed jarres, where the ſenſe is accorded. If we do not yield
her the true Being of a Church, why do we call her the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi>
What ſpeak we of? or where is the Subject of our queſtion? Who ſees not
that there is a Moral Trueneſs, and a Natural? He that is morally the
falſeſt man, is in Nature as truly a man as the honeſteſt; and therefore in
this regard as true a man. In the ſame ſenſe therefore that we ſay the Devil
is a true (though falſe) Spirit, that a Cheater is a true (though falſe) man, we
may and muſt ſay, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a true (though falſe) Church.
Certainly, there hath been a true Errour and miſtaking of the ſenſe that is
guilty of this quarrel. As for the Viſibility there can be no queſtion. Would
God that Church did not too much fill our eye, yea the world. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wherein it doth more pride it ſelf then in a glorious conſpicuity, ſcorning
in this regard the obſcure paucity of their oppoſers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="426" facs="tcp:44233:219"/>
But you ſay,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> What is this but to play with ambiguities? That the Church <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
of <hi>Rome</hi> is it ſelf, that is, a Church, that it is viſible, that it is truly exiſtent,
there can be no doubt: but is it ſtill a part of the truly exiſtent viſible Church
of Chriſt?<note place="margin">Reſp.</note> Surely, no otherwiſe then an Heretical and Apoſtatical Church
is and may be. Reader, whoſoever thou art, for God's ſake, for thy Souls
ſake, mark where thou treadeſt; elſe thou ſhalt be ſure to fall either into an open
gulf of Uncharitableneſs, or into a dangerous precipice of Errour. There
is no fear nor favour to ſay, that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> under a Chriſtian
Face, hath an Antichriſtian Heart; overturning that Foundation by neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
inferences, which by open profeſſion it avoweth. That Face, that Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
thoſe avowed Principles are enough to give it claim to a true outward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
Viſibilitie of a Chriſtian Church; whiles thoſe damnable inferences are enough
to feoffe it in the true ſtyle of Hereſie and Antichriſtianiſme. Now this Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
this Antichriſtianiſme makes <hi>Rome</hi> juſtly odious and execrable to God, to
Angels and Men; but cannot utterly diſ-church it, whiles thoſe main Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
maintain a weak life in that crazie and corrupted body.</p>
            <p>But is not this language different from that whereto our eares and eyes have
been inured, from the mouths and pens of ſome Reverend Divines and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſors
of our Church? Know, Reader, that the ſtream of the famous Doctors,
both at home and abroad, hath run ſtrongly my way: I ſhould have feared
and hated to go alone: what reaſon is there then to ſingle out one man in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
throng? Some few worthy Authors have ſpoken otherwiſe in the warmth of
their zealous contention; yet ſo, as that even to them durſt I appeal for my
Judges: for if their ſound differ from me, their ſenſe agrees with me: that,
which as I touched in my Advertiſement, ſo I am now ready to make clear
by the inſtance of Learned <hi>Zanchius,</hi> whoſe pregnant teſtimonies compared
together, ſhall plainly teach us how eaſie a reconcilement may be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
theſe two ſeemingly-contrary Opinions. That worthy Author, in his
Profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion, which he wrote and publiſhed in the Seventieth
year of his age, having defined the Church of Chriſt in general, and paſſed
through the Properties of it, at laſt, deſcending to the ſub-diviſion of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
Church Militant, comes to enquire, how particular Churches may be known
to be the true Churches of Chriſt; whereof he determins thus, <q>
                  <hi>Illas igitur,</hi>
&amp;c. Thoſe Churches therefore do we acknowledge for the true Churches
of Chriſt, in which, firſt of all, the pure Doctrine of the Goſpel is preached,
heard, admitted; and ſo onely admitted, that there is neither place nor ear
given to the contrary. For both theſe are the juſt Property of the flock or
ſheep of Chriſt; namely, both to hear the voice of their own Paſtor, and to
reject the voice of ſtrangers, <hi>John</hi> 10. 4. In which, ſecondly, the Sacraments
inſtituted by Chriſt are lawfully, and (as much as may be) according to
Chriſts inſtitution, adminiſtred and received; and therefore, in which the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
Sacraments deviſed by men are not admitted and allowed. In which, laſtly,
the Diſcipline of Chriſt hath the due place; that is, where both publickly
and privately charitable care is had, both by Admonitions, Corrections, and
at laſt (if need be) by Excommunications, that the Commandements of
God be duely kept, and that all perſons live ſoberly, juſtly, and piouſly, to
the glory of God, and edification of their Neighbour.</q> Thus he:
wherein who ſees not how directly he aims both at the juſtifying of our
Churches, and the caſhiering of the <hi>Roman,</hi> which is palpably guilty of the
violation of theſe wholeſome Rules? And indeed it muſt needs be ſaid, if we
bring the <hi>Romane</hi> Church to this touch, ſhe is caſt for a mere counterfeit; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
ſhe is as far from Truth, as Truth is from Falſhood. Now by this time you goe
away with an opinion that Learned <hi>Zanchy</hi> is my profeſſed Adverſary, and hath
directly condemned my Poſition, of the Trueneſs and Viſibility of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church. Have but patience, I beſeech you, to read what the ſame
excellent Author writes in his golden Preface to that noble Work, <hi>De
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:44233:219"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> natura Dei,</hi> where this queſtion is clearly and punctually decided. There
you ſhall finde, that having paſſed through the woful and gloomy offuſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Church of God in all former Ages, he deſcending to the darkneſs of
the preſent <hi>Babylon,</hi> concludes thus, 
to have no leſs ceaſed to be the Church of Chriſt, then thoſe Eaſtern
<q>
                  <hi>Deinde non potuit Satan,</hi> &amp;c. Moreover,
Satan could not in the very <hi>Roman</hi> Church doe what he liſted, as he had
done in the Eaſtern; to bring all things to ſuch paſs as that it ſhould no
more have the form of a Chriſtian Church: for, in ſpight of Satan, that
Church retained ſtill the chief Foundations of the Faith, although weakned
with the Doctrines of men; it retained the publick Preaching of the
Word of God, though in many places miſ-underſtood, and miſ-conſtrued;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the invocation of the Name of Chriſt, though joyned alſo with the invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of dead men; the adminiſtration of Baptiſme, inſtituted by Chriſt
himſelf, howſoever defiled with the addition of many Superſtitions. So
as, together with the Symbol of the Covenant, the Covenant it ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
ſtill in her, I mean in all the Churches of the Weſt; no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
then it did in the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even after that all things were in
part prophaned by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and other impious and idolatrous Kings,
upon the defection made by them from the Church and Tribe of <hi>Juda.</hi>
For neither do I aſſent to them which would have the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Churches which afterwards turned <hi>Mahumetan.</hi> What Church was ever
more corrupt then the Church of the Ten Tribes? yet we learn from the
Scriptures that it was ſtill the Church of God. And how doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> call
that Church wherein Antichriſt (he ſaith) ſhall ſit, the Temple of God?
Neither is it any Baptiſme at all, that is adminiſtred out of the Church of
Chriſt. The Wife that is an Adultereſs doth not ceaſe to be a Wife, unleſs
being deſpoiled of her marriage-ring, ſhe be manifeſtly divorced. The Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> therefore is yet the Church of Chriſt; but what manner of
Church? Surely ſo corrupted and depraved, and with ſo great tyrannie
oppreſſed, that you can neither with a good Conſcience partake with
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> them in their holy things, nor ſafely dwell amongſt them. </q>Thus he
again: wherein you ſee he ſpeaks as home for me as I could deviſe to
ſpeak for my ſelf, and as appoſitely profeſſeth to oppoſe the contrary.</p>
            <p>Look now how this Learned Author may be reconciled to his own pen; and
by the very ſame way ſhall my pen be reconciled with others. Either he
agrees not with himſelf, or elſe in his ſenſe I agree with my gainſayers. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more plain, then that he in that former ſpeech, and all other
Claſſick Authors that ſpeak in that Key, mean by a <hi>True Church,</hi> a ſound,
pure,<note place="margin">Ibid. Praefat. de nat. Dei.</note> right-believing Church; ſo as their <hi>vera</hi> is rather <hi>verax. Zanchie</hi>
explicates the terme, whiles he joines <hi>veram &amp; puram</hi> together; ſo as in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> this conſtruction it is no true Church that is an unſound one; as if truth
of Exiſtence were all one with truth of Doctrine. In this ſenſe whoſoever
ſhall ſay the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a true Church, I ſay he calls evil good,
and is no better then a teacher of lyes. But if we meaſure the true Being
of a Viſible Church by the direct maintenance of Fundamental Principles,
though by conſequences indirectly overturned, and by the poſſeſſion of the
Word of God and his Sacraments, though not without foul adulteration;
what judicious Chriſtian can but with me ſubſcribe to Learned <hi>Zanchius;</hi>
that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath yet the true Viſibility of a Church of Chriſt?
What ſhould I need to preſs the latitude and multiplicity of ſenſe of the word
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
               <hi>Church?</hi> there is no one term that I know in all uſe of Speech ſo various.
If in a large ſenſe it be taken to comprehend the Society of all that profeſs
Chriſtian Religion through the whole world, howſoever impured, who can
deny this title to the <hi>Roman?</hi> If in a ſtrict ſenſe it be taken (as it is by <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi>
here, and all thoſe Divines who refuſe to give this ſtyle to the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
of <hi>Rome</hi>) for the Company of Elect Faithful men gathered into
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:44233:220"/>
one myſtical Body under one Head Chriſt, waſhed by his Blood, juſtified by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
his Merits, ſanctified by his Spirit, conſcionably waiting upon the true
Ordinances of God in his pure Word and holy Sacraments, who can be
ſo ſhameleſs as to give this title to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? Both theſe ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
then are equally true, <hi>The Church of Rome is yet a true Church in the
firſt ſenſe; The Church of Rome long ſince ceaſed to be a true Church in the
ſecond.</hi> As thoſe friendly Souldiers therefore of old ſaid to their fellows, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>;
<hi>why fight we?</hi> Stay, ſtay, dear brethren, for Gods ſake, for his
Churches ſake, for your Souls ſake, ſtay theſe buſie and unprofitable liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations;
put up on both ſides your angry pens; turn your Swords into
Siths, to cut down the rank corruptions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
Spears into Mattocks, to beat down the walls of this myſtical <hi>Babylon.</hi>
There are enemies enough abroad, let us be friends at home. But if our
ſenſe be the ſame, you will ask why our terms varie, and why we have
choſen to fall upon that manner of expreſſion which gives advantage to the
Adverſary, offence to our own. Chriſtian Reader, let me beſeech thee in
the bowels of Chriſt to weigh well this matter, and then tell me why ſuch
offence, ſuch advantage ſhould be rather given by my words, then by the
ſame words in the mouth of <hi>Luther,</hi> of <hi>Calvin,</hi> of <hi>Zanchie, Junius, Pleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee,
Hooker, Andrews, Field, Crakenthorp, Bedell,</hi> and that whole cloud of
Learned and Pious Authors who have without exception uſed the ſame <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
language; and why more by my words now, then twentie years agoe, at
which time I publiſhed the ſame Truth in a more full and liberal expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Wiſe and charitable Chriſtians may not be apt to take offence where
none is given. As for any advantage that is hereby given to the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
they may put it in their eye, and ſee never the worſe. Loe, ſay
they, we are of the true viſible Church; this is enough for us; why are
we forſaken, why are we perſecuted, why are we ſollicited to a change?
Alas, poor ſouls! do they not know that Hypocrites, leud perſons, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates,
are no leſs members of the true viſible Church? what gain they
by this but a deeper damnation? To what purpoſe did the Jews cry, <hi>The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
Temple of the Lord,</hi> whiles they deſpited the Lord of that Temple? Is the
Sea-weed ever the leſs vile, becauſe it is drag'd up together with good
fiſh? They are of the viſible Church, ſuch as it is: what is this but to
ſay, they are neither Jews, nor Turks, nor Pagans; but misbelievers, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
Heretical in opinion, ſhamefully Idolatrous in practice? Let them
make their beſt of this juſt Eulogie, and triumph in this ſtyle; may we
never proſper if we envie them this glorie. Our care ſhall be, that beſides
the Church ſenſible,<note place="margin">Epiſt. l. 2. reſp. ad Catabaptiſt.</note> (as <hi>Zuinglius</hi> diſtinguiſheth) we may be of the Church
ſpiritual; and not reſting in a fruitleſs Viſibility, we may finde our ſelves
lively lims of the myſtical body of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> which onely condition ſhall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
give us a true right to Heaven; whiles faſhionable Profeſſion in vain
cries, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> and is barred out of thoſe bleſſed gates with an <hi>I know

            </p>
            <p>Neither may the Reader think that I affect to goe by-waies of ſpeech:
no, I had not taken this path, unleſs I had found it both more beaten and
fairer. I am not ſo unwiſe, to teach the Adverſary what diſadvantage I
conceive to be given to our moſt juſt Cauſe by the other manner of explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Let it ſuffice to ſay, that this form of defence more fully ſtops the
Adverſaries mouth in thoſe two main and envious Scandals which he caſts
upon our holy Religion, Defection from the Church and Innovation; then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
which no ſuggeſtion hath wont to be more prevalent with weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded
hearts. What we further win by this not more charitable then
ſafe Tenet, I had rather it ſhould be ſilently conceived by the judicious, then
blazoned by my free pen. Shortly, in this ſtate of the Queſtion, our
gain is as clear as the Adverſaries loſs; our ancient Truth triumphs over
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:44233:220"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> their upſtart Errours, our Charity over their mercileſs Preſumptions.
Fear not therefore, dear Brethren, where there is no room for danger;
ſuſpect not fraud where there is nothing but plain, honeſt ſimplicity of
intentions; cenſure not where there is the ſame Truth, clad in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
but more eaſie, habit of words. But if any mans fervent zeal ſhall
rather draw him to the liking of that other rougher and harder way, ſo as
in the mean time he keep within the bounds of Chriſtian Charity, I tax
him not: let every man abound in his own ſenſe; onely let our hearts
and tongues and hands conſpire together in peace with our ſelves, in warre
with our common enemies.</p>
            <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            <p>Thus far have I (Right Honourable) in a deſire of peace, poured out
my ſelf into a plain explication and eaſie accordance. Thoſe whom I ſtrive
to ſatisfie, are onely miſtakers; whoſe cenſures if ſome man would have
either laught out or deſpiſed, yet I have condeſcended to take off by a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
deprecation and juſt defence.</p>
            <p>It is an unreaſonable motion to requeſt minds prepoſſeſſed with Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to hear Reaſon. Whole Volumes are nothing to ſuch as have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
themſelves onely to take up Opinions upon truſt, and will hold
them becauſe they know where they had them. In vain ſhould I ſpend
my ſelf in beating upon ſuch anviles; but for thoſe ingenuous Chriſtians
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which will hold an eare open for Juſtice and Truth, I have ſaid enough,
if ought at all needed.</p>
            <p>Alas, my Lord, I ſee, and grieve to ſee it; it is my Rochet that hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
and not I; in another habit I long ſince publiſhed this and more
without diſlike; it is this colour of innocence that hath bleared ſome
over-tender eyes. Wherein I know not whether I ſhould more pity their
Errour, or applaud my own Sufferings. Although I may not ſay with
the Pſalmiſt, <hi>What hath the righteous done?</hi> let me (I beſeech your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip)
upon this occaſion have leave to give a little vent to my juſt grief in this

            <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            <p>The other day I fell upon a <hi>Latine</hi> Pamphlet, homely for ſtyle, tedious for
length, zealouſly uncharitable for ſtuff, wherein the Author (onely wiſe in
this, that he would be unknown) in a grave fierceneſs flies in the face of
our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelacie; not ſo much inveighing againſt their Perſons, (which
he could be content to reverence) as their very Places. I bleſt my ſelf to
ſee the caſe ſo altered. Heretofore the Perſon had wont to bear off ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
blows from the Function; now the very Function wounds the Perſon.
In what caſe are we, when that which ſhould command reſpect brands us?
What black Art hath raiſed up this ſpirit of <hi>Aerius</hi> from his pit? Wo is me,
that zeal ſhould breed ſuch monſters of conceit. It is the Honour, the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Pomp, the Wealth, the Pleaſure (he ſaith) of the Epiſcopal Chair that is
guilty of the depravation of our Calling; and if himſelf were ſo overlay'd
with Greatneſs, he ſhould ſuſpect his own Fidelity. Alas, poor man! at
what diſtance doth he ſee us? Foggie Air uſeth to repreſent every Object
far bigger then it is. Our Saviour in his Temptation upon the Mount had
only the Glory of thoſe Kingdomes ſhewed to him by that ſubtile Spirit,
not the Cares and vexations: Right ſo are our Dignities exhibited to theſe
envious beholders; little do theſe men ſee the Toiles and Anxieties that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
this ſuppoſedly-pleaſing eminence.</p>
            <p>All the revenge that I would wiſh to this uncharitable Cenſurer ſhould
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> be this, that he might be but for a while adjudged to this ſo glorious ſeat of
mine; that ſo his experience might taſte the bewitching Pleaſures of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
Greatneſs: he ſhould well finde more danger of being over-ſpent with
work, then of languiſhing with eaſe and delicacy.</p>
            <p>For me, I need not appeal to Heaven, eyes enough can witneſs how few
free hours I have enjoyed ſince I put on theſe Robes of Sacred Honour.
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:44233:221"/>
Inſomuch as I could finde in my heart, with holy <hi>Gregory,</hi> to complain of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
my change; were it not that I ſee theſe publick troubles are ſo many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable

            <p>MY Lord, I ſend you this little Pamphlet for your cenſure. It is
not credible how ſtrangely I have been traduced every where for
that which I conceive to be the common Opinion of Reformed
Divines, yea of reaſonable men; that is, for affirming the true
Being and Viſibility of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. You ſee how clearly I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to explicate this harmleſs Poſition; yet I perceive ſome tough
miſunderſtandings will not be ſatisfied. Your Lordſhip hath with great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
ſpent many years in the Divinity-Chair of the famous Univerſity of
<hi>Cambridge.</hi> Let me therefore beſeech you, whoſe Learning and Sincerity
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is ſo throughly approved in God's Church, that you would freely (how
ſhortly ſoever) expreſs your ſelf in this Point: and if you finde that I
have deviated but one hairs breadth from the Truth, correct me: if not,
free me by your juſt Sentence. What need I to intreat you to pity thoſe,
whoſe deſires of faithful offices to the Church of God are unthankfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paied
with Suſpicion and Slander? whoſe may not this caſe be? I had
thought I had ſufficiently in all my Writings, and in this very laſt Book of
mine (whence this quarrell is picked) ſhewed my fervent zeal for God's
Truth againſt that Antichriſtian Faction of <hi>Rome;</hi> and yet I doubt not
but your own ears can witneſs what I have ſuffered. Yea as if this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny

upon me the foul aſperſions of another Sect, whoſe name is as much hated as
little underſtood. My Lord, you know I had a place with you (though
unworthy) in that famous Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> where (howſoever ſickneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved

heard me with equall vehemency to the reſt crying down the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs
of that way. God ſo love me as I do the tranquillity and
happineſs of his Church; yet can I not ſo overaffect it, that I would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
one dram of Truth to it. To that good God do I appeal as the
witneſs of my ſincere heart to his whole Truth, and no-leſs-then-ever-zealous

            <opener>
               <salute>My LORD;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU deſire my Opinion concerning an Aſſertion of yours, whereat <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
ſome have taken offence. The Propoſition was this [That the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church remains yet a True Viſible Church.] The occaſion
which makes this an ill-ſounding Propoſition in the ears of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
(eſpecially ſuch as are not throughly acquainted with School Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions)
is the uſuall acception of the word <hi>True</hi> in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue.
For though men skilled in Metaphyſicks hold it for a Maxime, <hi>Ens, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
Bonum convertuntur:</hi> yet with us, he which ſhall affirm ſuch a one is
a true Chriſtian, a true Gentleman, a true Scholar, or the like, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
not onely to adſcribe Trueneſs of Being unto all theſe, but thoſe due
Qualities or requiſite Actions whereby they are made commendable or praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
in their ſeverall kinds. In this ſenſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is no more
a True Church in reſpect of Chriſt, or thoſe due Qualities and proper
Actions which Chriſt requires, then an arrant Whore is a true and loyall
Wife unto her Husband. I durſt upon mine oath be one of your Compur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators,
that you never intended to adorn that Strumpet with the title of a
true Church in this meaning. But your own Writings have ſo fully clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
you herein, that ſuſpicion it ſelf cannot reaſonably ſuſpect you in this
Point. I therefore can ſay no more concerning your miſtaken Propoſition
then this, If in that Treatiſe wherein it was delivered, the Antecedents
or Conſequents were ſuch as ſerved fitly to lead the Reader into that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
Senſe, which under the word True comprehendeth onely Truth of Being or
Exiſtencie, and not the due Qualities of the thing or Subject, you have
been cauſeleſly traduced. But on the other ſide, if that Propoſition comes
in <hi>ex abrupto,</hi> or ſtands ſolitarie in your Diſcourſe, you cannot marvell
though, by taking the word True according to the more ordinarie acception,
your true meaning was miſtaken. In brief, your Propoſition admits a true
ſenſe; and in that ſenſe is by the beſt Learned in our Reformed Church
not diſallowed. For the Being of a Church does principally ſtand upon the
gracious action of God, calling men out of Darkneſs and Death unto the
Participation of Light and Life in Chriſt <hi>Jeſus.</hi> So long as God conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
this Calling unto any people, though they (as much as in them lies)
darken this Light, and corrupt the means which ſhould bring them to Life
and Salvation in Chriſt; yet where God calls men unto the Participation
of Life in Chriſt by the Word and by the Sacraments, there is the true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Chriſtian Church, let men be never ſo falſe in their Expoſitions
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:44233:223"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of God's Word, or never ſo untruſtie in mingling their own Traditions with
God's Ordinances. Thus the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> loſt not her Being of a
Church when ſhe became an Idolatrous Church. And thus under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Scribes and Phariſees, who voided the Commandements of God
by their own Traditions, there was yet ſtanding a true Church, in which
<hi>Zacharias, Elizabeth,</hi> the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and our Saviour himſelf was born,
who were members of that Church, and yet participated not in the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thereof. Thus to grant that the <hi>Romane</hi> was and is a True Viſible
Chriſtian Church, (though in Doctrine a Falſe, and in Practice an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Church) is a true Aſſertion, and of greater uſe and neceſsity in our
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Controverſie with Papiſts about the Perpetuity of the Chriſtian Church, then
is underſtood by thoſe who gainſay it. This in your <hi>Reconciler</hi> is ſo well
explicated, as if any ſhall continue in traducing you in regard of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
ſo explained, I think it will be onely thoſe who are better acquainted
with wrangling then reaſoning, and deeper in love with Strife then Truth.
And therefore be no more troubled with other mens groundleſs ſuſpicions,
then you would be in like caſe with their idle Dreams. Thus I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
my ſelf beyond my firſt intent. But my love to your ſelf, and the
aſſurance of your conſtant love unto the Truth, inforced me thereunto. I

            <p>UPon the receit of your <hi>Reconciler,</hi> which it pleaſed you to ſend me,
I took occaſion (as my manifold diſtractions would permit) to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> peruſe what had been ſaid on both ſides concerning the now-being
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Wherein I muſt profeſs that I
could not but wonder at the needleſs Exceptions againſt your Tenet, you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
no new thing in that paſſage miſliked in your <hi>Old Religion.</hi> And
this your <hi>Advertiſement</hi> (afterward) ſo fully and punctually cleareth, and
your <hi>Reconciler</hi> ſo acquitteth it, with ſuch ſatisfying ingenuitie, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
imagine they have conſidered it well, or mean well, that ſhall perſiſt to
oppoſe it. For who perceives not, that your Lordſhip leaves no more to
<hi>Rome</hi> then our beſt Divines ever ſince the Reformation have granted?
If their ſpeeches have been ſometimes ſeemingly different, their meaning
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hath been alwayes the ſame, that in reſpect of the common Truths yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
among the Papiſts, they may and ought to be termed a True Viſible
Church, in oppoſition to Jews, Turks and Pagans, who directly denie the
Foundation; howſoever their Antichriſtian additions make them no better
then the Synagogue of Satan. This being agreed upon by thoſe whoſe Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
we have good reaſon to follow (cited in your <hi>Advertiſement,</hi> and by
others,) they doe an ill office to our Church (in my opinion) who ſet
them at oddes in this Point that are ſo excellently reconciled; and give more
advantage to the Adverſary by quarrelling with our Worthies, then the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
is like to get by our acknowledgement, that they are ſuch a miſerable
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Church as we diſcover them to be.</p>
            <p>What I have thought long ſince in this behalf, it appeareth in my Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
<hi>De Viſibilitate Eccleſiae;</hi> and as often as this hath come in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in our publick Diſputes, we determine here no otherwiſe then your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
hath ſtated it. And yet we truſt to give as little advantage to Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
as thoſe that doe deteſt it; and are as circumſpect to maintain our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

Doctrine and Diſcipline, without the leaſt Scandall to the weakeſt, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
thoſe that would ſeem moſt forward.</p>
            <p>That diſtinction of <hi>Rome</hi>'s caſe before and ſince the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
holds not to diſ-Church it, but ſhews it rather to be more incurable now then
heretofore.</p>
            <p>Neither finde I any particulars objected, which thoſe Worthy men have
not ſufficiently cleared that have juſtified your Aſſertion. Not to trouble
therefore your weightier affairs with my needleſs interpoſition: as that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
about the Altar (<hi>Joſuah</hi> 22.) had preſently a fair end upon the
full underſtanding of the good meaning on both ſides; ſo I truſt in God
this ſhall have: In which I am ſo perſwaded, that if it were to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
there after our Scholaſtical manner, it might well be defended either
<hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con,</hi> without prejudice to the Truth, according to the full ſtating
which your <hi>Advertiſement</hi> and <hi>Reconciler</hi> have afforded. And thus, with
tender of my due Obſervance and Prayers for your happineſs, I reſt</p>

               <hi>The Church is to be conſidered three manner of waies. Firſt, according to

the Word ſincerely preached. Thirdly, according to the election of Grace,
and the perſonal Calling, which hath perpetually the inward working of the Holy

Jews inwardly in the ſpirit,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 28, 29.</note> 
               <hi>as well</hi> as outwardly in the letter, whoſe praiſe is

            <p>
               <hi>In the ſecond Conſideration theſe onely are the true viſible Church of God,

               <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid to the people;</hi> Thou haſt avouched this day
the Lord to be thy God, and to walk in his waies, and to keep his Statures
and his Commandments and his Judgements, and to hearken unto his voice:
And the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he
hath promiſed thee, and that thou ſhouldeſt keep all his Commandements. <hi>This
condition of the Commandement God did often inculcate into their ears by his
Prophets:</hi>

               <hi>As when he ſaid to them by</hi> Jeremiah, This thing commanded I
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> them, ſaying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye ſhall be my
people; and walk ye in all the waies that I have commanded you, that it may
be well unto you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So in the Goſpel Chriſt ſaith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 10. 27, 5.</note> My ſheep hear my voice, and I know them,
and they follow me: But a ſtranger will they not follow, but will flie from
him; for they know not the voice of ſtrangers: <hi>where he giveth the firſt

of Chriſts voice.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>As likewiſe St.</hi> John <hi>ſaith,</hi> He that knoweth God, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us: Hereby know we the Spirit of Truth, and the ſpirit of Errour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 13. 35.</note> 
               <hi>the Lord ſaith,</hi> By this ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſciples,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> if ye love one another, <hi>pointing out the Concord and holy agreement which is
among the Brethren, as another mark of the Orthodox Church. As likewiſe when
he ſaith,</hi> Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works,
and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven,<note place="margin">Matt. 5. 16.</note> 
               <hi>he ſheweth that good Works are
the viſible mark of the true Orthodox Church. The true Preaching and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Hearing of the Goſpel is a viſible mark of our Faith and Hope; our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
in the Lord is a mark of our Charitie; our good Works are real and ſenſible
teſtimonies of our inward Faith, Hope and Charitie. Where we finde theſe three
Signes, we know certainly that there is Chriſts true Church; and judge chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably,
that is probably, that every one in whom we ſee theſe outward tokens of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Chriſts true and Orthodox Church, is a true member of the myſtical body of
the Lord</hi> Jeſus. <hi>I ſay</hi> charitably, <hi>becauſe outward marks may be outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
counterfeited by Hypocrites; as it is ſaid of Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 78. 36. 37.</note> They did flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

heart was not right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his Covenant:
<hi>and of many of thoſe that followed our Saviour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 2. 23, 24.</note> Many believed in his Name, when
they ſaw the Miracles which he did: But Jeſus did not commit himſelf unto
them, becauſe he knew all men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore when the people of</hi> Iſrael <hi>departed from the Covenant, and by their
Idolatry brake, as much as in them lay, the contract of Marriage between them
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and God, they ceaſed in that behalf to be Gods true Spouſe and people, though ſtill
they called him their Husband and their God. When they made a molten Calf in

<hi>or</hi> Ephraim, <hi>and therefore is not a true viſible Church in the ſecond ſenſe; I
ſay ſhe is one in ſome ſort in the firſt. In her God doth ſtill keep his true
word in the Old and New Teſtament, as the contract of his Marriage with her.
In her is the true Creed, the true Decalogue, the true Lords Prayer, which</hi>
Luther <hi>calleth</hi> the kernal of Chriſtianity. <hi>In her Chriſt is preached, though
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> corruptly. In her the Trinity and Incarnation of Chriſt are believed. In her
the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghoſt are prayed unto, though in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
tongue to the moſt part. In her the little Children are Baptized in
the Name of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Ghoſt. And no Divine
will deny that their Baptiſme is a true Sacrament, whereby their Children
are born to God, ſeeing we do not rebaptiſe them, where leaving her, they
adjoin themſelves to us. Who then can deny that ſhe is a true Church? For
out of the Church there is no Baptiſme, and the Church alone beareth children
to God. In her ſitteth the man of ſin, the ſon of perdition, who</hi> ſitteth in

               <hi>which is the Church. Its granted that ſhe is</hi> Babylon

               <hi>and God's people is commanded to</hi> come out of Babylon.
<hi>What is Gods people but Gods Church, which forſaketh her ſucceſsively; as of

we acknowledge her to be Gods people, that is, Gods Church, though Idolatrous,
Rebellious and Diſobedient. Neither ſhall ſhe ceaſe to be Gods people in this

Chriſt is ſcarcely known among the Saints, of whom ſome are in Heaven, as the

            <p>
               <hi>This teſtimony is the praiſe of the moſt wonderful patience of God, who
ſuffereth ſo long that common hackney to bear his name. It is her ſhame: As it
is the ſhame of a Quean married to a good husband, to be convicted of running
up and down after ſtrangers. Its a vantage to us in our imployment for her
Converſion. For as when</hi> Agar <hi>had confeſſed truly, that ſhe was</hi> Sarah<hi>'s maid,

neck, when ſhe confeſſeth that ſhe is Chriſts Church, as ſhe is indeed, exhorting
her to return unto Chriſt, to obey his word, to ſubmit her ſelf unto him, and to
follow the true Faith of the antient Catholick and Apoſtolick Church. Neither
is it any vantage to her againſt us, to inforce us to return to her, or to upbraid
us for forſaking her. For as</hi> Moſes, <hi>when the people had committed Idolatry,</hi>
took his Tabernacle,<note place="margin">Exod. 33. 7.</note> and pitched it without the Camp, afarre off from the
Camp, <hi>breaking off all Communication with thoſe which had broken the Covenant

Heaven in this Subject, I ſhould doubt whether to wiſh it publick. How true,
how juſt ſoever the plea be, I finde (ſuch is the ſelf-love and partiality of our
corrupt nature) the quarrell is inlarged by multiplying of words. When I ſee
a Fire quenched with Oyle, I will expect to ſee a Controverſie of this nature
ſtinted by publick altercation. New matter ſtill riſes in the agitation, &amp; gives
hint to a fore-reſolved Oppoſite of a freſh diſquiſition: So as we may ſooner
ſee an end of the common Peace, then of an unkindly jarre in the Church;
eſpecially ſuch a one as is fomented with a miſtaken Zeal on the one ſide, and
with a confidence of Knowledge on the other.</p>
            <p>Silence hath ſometimes quieted ſuch like miſ-raiſed brabbles, never inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
of words. This very Queſtion was on foot ſome forty years agoe in the
hote chace of great Authors; but whether through the ingenuity of the parties,
or ſome over-ruling act of Divine Providence, it ſoon died without noiſe: ſo
I wiſh it may now doe. Rather let the weaker Title goe away with the laſt
word, then the Church ſhall be diſtracted. For that Poſition of mine which
occaſioned your Vindication, you ſee it ſufficiently abetted and determined by
ſo Reverend Authority as admits no exception: I dare ſay, no Learned Divine
of our own Church or the forain can but ſubſcribe (in this our ſenſe) to the
Judgement of theſe Worthies. To draw forth therefore this cord of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to any further length, were no leſſe needleſſe then prejudiciall to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

            <p>As for thoſe Perſonall aſperſions that are caſt upon you by Malice, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to deſpiſe them. Theſe Weſtern parts, where your reputation is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly
pretious, know your zeal for Gods Truth no leſſe fervent (though
better governed) then the moſt fiery of your Cenſurers. No man more hateth
Popiſh Superſtition; onely your fault is, that you do not more hate Errour
then Injuſtice, and cannot abide wrong meaſure offered to the worſt enemy.
Neither be you troubled with that idle exprobration of a Prebendary retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
who would care for a contumely ſo void of truth? God knows that
worthleſſe gift was conferred upon you ere this task came into either of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
our thoughts; and whoſo knows the entire reſpects betwixt us from our very
Cradles till this day, may well think that a Prebend of three pounds by the year
need not goe for a Fee, where there is ſo much and ſo ancient cauſe of dearneſs.
I am ſorry to ſee ſuch rancour under the coat of Zeal. Surely nothing but mere
Malice can be guilty of this charge; no leſſe then of that other envious chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
of your decay of Graces, of falling from your firſt Love, from induſtry

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> What need I urge this? your Adverſaries do enough feel your worth. So
as (to ſpeak ſeriouſly) I cannot ſufficiently wonder at the liberty of thoſe men,
who profeſſing a ſtrict conſcience of their wayes, dare let their Pens or Tongues
looſe to ſo injurious and uncharitable a detraction, whereof they know the
juſt avenger is in Heaven. It ſhould not be thus betwixt Brethren, no not with
Enemies.</p>
            <p>For the main buſineſs, there wants not confidence on either ſide: I am
appealed to by both, an unmeet Judge, conſidering my ſo deep ingagements.
But if my umpierage may ſtand, I award an eternall ſilence to both parts.
Sit down in peace then, you and your worthy Second, whoſe young ripeneſs
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and modeſt and learned diſcourſe is worthy of better entertainment then
contempt: and let your zealous Opponents ſay, that you have overcome
your ſelves in a reſolved ceſſation of Pens, and them in a love of Peace. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Inding theſe Papers amongſt others lying aſide in my Fathers Study,
where of I conceived good uſe might be made, in regard of that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
advantage which they promiſed, I obtained of him good leave to
ſend them abroad; whereto he profeſſed himſelf the more eaſily indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
for that his continuall and weighty employments in this large and
buſie Dioceſe will not yet afford him leiſure to diſpatch thoſe his other fixed Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
on the Hiſtory of the New Teſtament. In the mean time, the expreſsions of
theſe voluntary and ſudden thoughts of his ſhall teſtifie how fruitfully he is wont to
improve thoſe ſhort ends of time which are ſtolne from his more important avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and (unleſſe my hopes fail me) the pattern of them may prove not a little <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
beneficial to others. Holy mindes have been ever wont to look through theſe bodily
Objects, at ſpiritual and heavenly. So</hi> Sulpitius <hi>reports of S.</hi> Martin, <hi>that ſeeing
a Sheep newly ſhorn, he could ſay, Loe here is one that hath performed that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in the Goſpel; having two Coats, ſhe hath given away one: and ſeeing an
Hogherd freezing in a thin ſuit of skins, Loe (ſaid he) there is</hi> Adam <hi>caſt out of
Paradiſe: and ſeeing a Medow part rooted up, part whole, but eaten down, and
part flouriſhing, he ſaid, The firſt was the ſtate of Fornication, the ſecond of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
the third of Virginity. But what do I ſeek any other Author then the Lord
of Life himſelf? who upon the drawing of water from the Well of</hi> Shilo <hi>on the day
of the great</hi> Hoſanna, <hi>took occaſion to ſpeak of thoſe Living waters which ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
flow from every true believer,</hi> John 7. 38. <hi>and upon occaſion of a bodily Feaſt,</hi>
Luke 14. <hi>entred into that Divine diſcourſe of God's gracious invitation of us to
thoſe ſpiritual viands of Grace and Glory. Thus, methinks, we ſhould ſtill be clim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
up in our thoughts from Earth to Heaven, and ſuffer no Object to croſſe us in
our way without ſome ſpiritual Uſe and Application. Thus it pleaſed my Reverend

               <p>I Have heedleſly loſt (I confeſſe) many good thoughts; theſe few my Paper
hath preſerved from vaniſhing; the example whereof may perhaps be
more uſefull then the matter. Our active Soul can no more forbear to
think, then the Eye can chuſe but ſee when it is open. Would we but keep our
wholeſome Notions together, mankinde would be too rich. To doe well, no
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Object ſhould paſſe us without uſe; every thing that we ſee, reads us new le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of Wiſdome and Piety. It is a ſhame for a man to be ignorant or God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
under ſo many Tutors. For me, I would not wiſh to live longer then I
ſhall be better for my eyes; and have thought it thank-worthy, thus to teach
weak mindes how to improve their thoughts upon all like occaſions. And if
ever theſe lines ſhall come to the publick view, I deſire and charge my Reader,
whoſoever he be, to make me and himſelf ſo happy, as to take out my Leſſon,

pray that <hi>thy will</hi> may <hi>be done in Earth as it is in Heaven,</hi> though we mean chiefly
the Inhabitants of that place, yet we do not exclude the very Place of thoſe
Bleſſed inhabitants from being an example of our Obedience. The motion of
this thy Heaven is perpetuall; ſo let me ever be acting ſomewhat of thy will:
the motion of thy Heaven is regular, never ſwerving from the due points; ſo let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
me ever walk ſteddily in the wayes of thy will, without all diverſions or varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from the line of thy Law. In the motion of thine Heaven, though ſome
Stars have their own peculiar and contrary courſes, yet all yield themſelves to
the ſway of the main circumvolution of that Firſt mover; ſo though I have a
will of mine own, yet let me give my ſelf over to be ruled and ordered by thy
Spirit in all my waies.</p>
               <p>Man is a little World; my Soul is Heaven, my Body is Earth: if this Earth

               <p>LIght is an ordinary and familiar Bleſſing; yet ſo dear to us, that one hours

               <p>O God, if we be ſo afflicted with the obſcuring of ſome piece of one of thy
created lights for an hour or two, what a confuſion ſhall it be that thou, who
art the God of theſe Lights, (in compariſon of whom they are mere darkneſſe)
ſhalt hide thy face from thy creature for ever? O thou that art the Sun of
Righteouſneſſe, if every of my ſins cloud thy face, yet let not my grievous ſins

               <p>HOw eaſily is our ſight deceived? how eaſily doth our ſight deceive us?
We ſaw no difference betwixt this Star and the reſt; the light ſeemed
alike, both whiles it ſtood, and whiles it fell: now we know it was no
other then a baſe ſlimy Meteor guilded with the Sun-beams; and now our
foot can tread upon that which ere while our eye admired. Had it been a Star,
it had ſtill and ever ſhined; now the very fall argues it a falſe and elementary
Apparition.</p>

               <p>AS there is a civil commerce amongſt men for the preſervation of humane
ſociety, ſo there is a naturall commerce which God hath ſet amongſt
the other Creatures for the maintenance of their common Being.
There is ſcarce any thing therefore in Nature which hath not a power of attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
ſome other. The Fire draws Vapors to it, the Sun drawes the Fire;
Plants draw moyſture; the Moon draws the Sea; all Purgative things draw
their proper Humors. A Naturall inſtinct draws all Senſitive creatures to affect
their own kinde; and even in thoſe things which are of imperfect mixtion we
ſee this experimented. So as the ſenſeleſſe Stones and Metals are not void
of this active virtue: the Loadſtone draws Iron; and the Jett, rather then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

upon their ſeverall ſubjects? Is there any thing more heavy and unapt for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

if they had the ſenſe of a deſire and delight; and do ſo cling to the point of it,
as if they had forgotten their weight for this adherence. Is there any thing
more apt for diſperſion then ſmall ſtraws and duſt? yet theſe gather to the
Jett, and ſo ſenſibly leap up to it, as if they had a kinde of ambition to be ſo
preferred.</p>
               <p>Methinks I ſee in theſe two a mere Embleme of the hearts of men and
their Spirituall attractives. The Grace of Gods Spirit, like the true Loadſtone <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

ſmile we know not wherefore; we have not wit enough to make ſigns
what hurts us, or where we complain; we can wry the mouth, but not ſeek
the breaſt; and if we want help, we can only lament, and ſprawl, and die. After,
when ſome months have taught us to diſtinguiſh a little betwixt things and
perſons, we crie for every toy, even that which may moſt hurt us; and when
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> there is no other cauſe, we crie only to hear our own noiſe, and are ſtraight
ſtilled with a greater; and if it be but upon the breeding of a tooth, we are ſo
wayward that nothing will pleaſe us; and if ſome formerly-liked knack be
given to quiet us, we caſt away that which we have, if we have not what we
would ſeem to like. We fear neither fire nor water; nothing ſcares us but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a rod or a feigned bug-bear: we miſ-know our Parents; not acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ſooner pleaſed then angry; and if any man have wronged them, let them but
have given a ſtroke unto the Nurſe to beat the offender, it is enough; at the

without any mixtures of ſin, I might have hoped for entire Health: But ſince
I have interſperſed my Obedience with many ſinfull failings and enormities,
why do I think much to interchange Health with Sickneſs? What I now feel
I know; I am not worthy to know what I muſt feel. As my times, ſo my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
are in the hands of a wiſe and good God. My comfort is, he that ſends
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> theſe evils, proportions them. If they be ſharp, I am ſure they are juſt; the
moſt that I am capable to endure, is the leaſt part of what I have deſerved to
ſuffer. Nature would fain be at eaſe: but, Lord, whatever become of this
carkaſſe, thou haſt reaſon to have reſpect to thine own Glory. I have ſinned,
and muſt ſmart: It is the glory of thy Mercy to beat my Body for the ſafety
of my Soul. The worſt of Sickneſs is Pain, and the worſt of pain is but Death.
As for Pain, if it be extreme, it cannot be long; and if it be long, (ſuch is the
difference of earthly and Helliſh torments) it cannot be extreme: As for Death,
it is both unavoidable and beneficial; there ends my Miſery, and begins my

               </p>
               <p>VII. There are and may be many Theologicall Points, which are wont to
be believed and maintained, and ſo many lawfully be, of this or that particular
Church, or the Doctors thereof, or their Followers, as godly Doctrines and
Probable Truths; beſides thoſe other Eſſential and main matters of Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any prejudice at all of the common Peace of the Church.</p>
               <p>VIII. Howſoever it may be lawfull for Learned men &amp; particular Churches
to believe and maintain thoſe Probable, or (as they may think) Certain Points <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
of Theologicall Verities; yet it is not lawfull for them to impoſe and obtrude
the ſaid Doctrines upon any Church or Perſon, to be believed and held as upon
the neceſſity of Salvation, or to anathematize or eject out of the Church any
Perſon or company of men that thinks otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>IX. Notwithſtanding any ſuch unjuſt <hi>Anathema</hi> denounced againſt any ſuch
Perſon or Church, whoſoever holds thoſe Principles and Eſſential Points of
Chriſtian Faith, however he be in place far remote from all the Viſible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Chriſt, and neither know not or receive not thoſe other Poſitions of
Theological determination, is throughly capable (in ſuch condition) of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
Communion; and if many ſuch be met together under a lawfull Paſtor,
there cannot be denied unto them both the truth and title of a true Viſible
Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>X. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is onely, and at the beſt, a Particular Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="501" facs="tcp:44233:255"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> XI. All Chriſtian Churches are no other then Siſters, and Daughters of
that great and Univerſall Mother, which furniſheth both Heaven and earth;
of equall priviledge in reſpect of God and his Faith, ſave onely that each one
is ſo much more honourable as it is more pure and holy. It is not therefore
lawfull for any one of them, in regard of the buſineſſes of Faith, to take upon
her ſelf the power and command over any other; or to preſcribe unto any of
them what they muſt neceſſarily believe upon pain of damnation.</p>
               <p>XII. Thoſe iſſues of Controverſie in regard whereof the Reformed Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
are wont to be condemned and anathematized by the <hi>Romane</hi> Church,<note place="margin">I perceive ſome Readers have unheedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; unjuſtly ſtumbled at this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if I had herein ſlighted the Differences betwixt us and the <hi>Romane</hi> Church; from which I am ſo far, as that I have ever profeſſed to hold them to be, on their parts, no leſſe then damnable Errors, and ſuch as by conſequence do raze the Foundation. If theſe words have ſeemed to ſound otherwiſe, it is nothing but the Readers inconſiderate miſtaking; who, if he pleaſe to bend his ſecond and more ſerious thoughts upon the place, will eaſily ſee that my intention is herein only to ſhew how unjuſtly the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth charge us with Hereſie in denying their Doctrine, foraſmuch as thoſe Poſitions of theirs which we are condemned for refuſing, are far from being Principles of Faith, but are things of their own deviſing &amp; impoſing. For example, they condemn us for rejecting the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, and refuſing to hold that the ſubſtance of the Bread is (by the force of the words) truly and really turned into the very Fleſh, Blood and Bone of Chriſt. Now, I ſay, this their doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation is far from being any Principle of Faith, but only a point of their own Divinity, deviſed and maintained by themſelves. They condemn us for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to pray to Saints, or to worſhip Images: I ſay, that this Doctrine, that Saints ought to be invoked or Images worſhipped, is far from being a Principle of Faith; but onely one of their own Theologicall Poſitions, deviſed and impoſed by themſelves. The like may be and muſt be ſaid of all their other Points obtruded on the Church; wherein I hope no wiſe Reformed Catholick will think he hath reaſon to diſſent from me, or to miſdoubt my Propoſition.</note> are
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> far from Principles of Chriſtian Faith; neither are any other than their own
Theologicall Poſitions, and the inſtitutions and deviſes of that particular
Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> XIII. The Reformed Catholicks have not offered to bring in any new
Opinion or Doctrine into the Church, but only labour and endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
ſome late &amp; ſuperfluous additions to the Faith to be caſhiered &amp; rejected.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> XIV. Vainly therefore and unjuſtly is it required of them, that they ſhould
ſhew the ſucceſſion of their Religion and Church (as raiſed upon a quite other
foundation) to be derived from the Apoſtolick times to the preſent; ſince
all that they profeſſe is a deſire to purge the very ſame Church of God from
certain new Errors and Superſtitious rites wherewith it is miſerably defiled.</p>
               <p>XV. Out of all which Premiſſes it neceſſarily followeth, that the <hi>Romane</hi>
Church, which upon theſe grounds ſticketh not to exclude true Chriſtians
(differing from them in matter of ſuch Doctrines) from the Church of God
and eternall Salvation, is juſtly guilty of great inſolency, and horrible breach
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> both of Charity and Peace; and that the Reformed, notwithſtanding this raſh
and unjuſt cenſure of theirs, (forasmuch as they do inviolably hold all the
Points of the truly ancient and Chriſtian Faith,) do juſtly claim unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
a moſt true and perfect intereſt in the communion of all Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and eternall Salvation.</p>
               <p>XVI. There is no leſſe danger in adding to the Articles of Chriſtian Faith,
then in diminiſhing them or detracting from them.</p>
               <p>XVII. Thoſe Points which the <hi>Romane</hi> Church is wont to adde, and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to put upon all Catholicks (as well the Reformed as thoſe whom they
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> term their own) are ſuch as are grounded on her own mere authority.</p>
               <p>XVIII. The Reformed Catholicks do juſtly complain, and prove that thoſe
Points which the <hi>Romane</hi> Church impoſeth and urgeth as the meet additions
both of Faith and Divine worſhip, are neither ſafe, nor agreeable to the holy
Word of God; and plead it to be utterly unjuſt, that thoſe acceſſory Points,
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:44233:256"/>
of their deviſing or determining, wherein every Church ſhould be left free and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
at her due liberty, ſhould be imperiouſly thruſt upon them, notwithſtanding
their vehement and juſt reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>XIX. It argues a palpable ſelf-love in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, and muſt needs
at the laſt draw down a grievous Judgement from God upon her, that this
Particular Church will needs make her ſelf uncapable of any better condition;
in that ſhe vainly brags that ſhe cannot erre, and fearfully accurſeth and ſends
down to hell all thoſe that profer her the leaſt endeavour of the means of her
remedy and redreſſe.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               </p>
               <p>XX. Upon all theſe grounds, it is plain that the Reformed Catholicks are
in a ſafe eſtate, and that contrarily the <hi>Romane</hi> are in a miſerable errour and
fearfull danger; and laſtly, that it is only through their default, that the
Church of God is not reduced to an happy Purity and Peace.</p>

                  <p>OUR moſt dear Son in Chriſt, we ſend you greeting and Apoſtolical
Benediction. The voice of rejoicing and Salvation is in the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles
of the righteous; let the wicked ſee this and fret, and let the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
Synagogue of Satan conſume away. The <hi>moſt Chriſtian King</hi> figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
for Religion, the Lord of hoſts fighteth for the King. We verily in this
Mother-City of the world triumph with holy joy, we congratulate this your
Majeſties Victory, the trophees whereof are erected in Heaven, the glory
whereof the generation that is to come ſhall never ceaſe to ſpeak of. Now at
the length this Age hath ſeen the Tower of ROCHEL, no leſſe impregnable
by the obſtinacie of treacherie then ſtrength of nature, ſurrendred to the King
and Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> Neither is any ſo fooliſh as to aſcribe this glorious Victory
rather to happineſs then to vertue. By your long ſiege of many moneths you
have taught us, that <hi>Europe</hi> oweth your <hi>French</hi> Legions no leſſe commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
for their conſtancy, then for their expedition; your Army going clear
away with the Victory over your enemies, by ſlighting all dangers and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all hardneſs, devoteth their life unto You, and promiſeth You an abſolute
trimph of conquered Hereſie. The waters of the Ocean made a noiſe and
were troubled, fighting for the beſieged Rebels; they made choice of death
rather then a ſurrender, undermining treacherie approaching even to Your
Majeſties tents; Hell all opened her mouth, vomiting out troops of miſchieſs
and dangers, to the end ſo rich a Fort might not be taken away from their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie.
The Lord ſtood on thy right hand; thou haſt not onely overcome
the forces of thine enemies, but thou wert able alſo to put a bridle upon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
Ocean aiding them. Let us all give thanks to Almighty God, who hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
thee from the contradictions of the unbelieving people. Howbeit ſith
You are not ignorant with what care the fruits of victories ought to be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
leſt they periſh, there is no doubt but that in a ſhort time all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Hereticks that have got ſtable-room in the <hi>French</hi> Vineyard ſhall
by You be utterly diſcomfited. The Church deſireth that this Diademe of
perfect renown be put upon that helmet of Salvation, wherewith the Lord
mighty in battell ſeemeth to cover the head of Your Majeſtie: for we believe
ſhortly that all tumults being appeaſed in <hi>France,</hi> the gliſtering Enſign of
<hi>Lewis</hi> the Conqueror ſhall ſhine to the captive Daughter of <hi>Sion,</hi> rehearſing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

Hear now therefore (Pope <hi>Urbane</hi>) that which ere long thou ſhalt hear with
horror and confuſion of face before that dreadfull Tribunall of Chriſt. Theſe
bloody blots of thine little beſeem the Shepherd of a Chriſtian Flock. What,
is it for thee like a grim Herald to give the Summons to War? Is it for thee
to excite Chriſtian Princes (already too much gorged with blood) to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligation
and fearfull ſlaughter of their own Subjects? Were the Keyes for
this cauſe committed to thy charge, that thou ſhouldeſt open the Iron gates of

thou take theſe <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants for <hi>Malchus,</hi> whoſe ears while thou wouldſt

it lately voiced to thee from heaven concerning theſe wretched Animals ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
in <hi>France, Ariſe, Pope Urbane, Kill and eate?</hi> Art thou the <hi>Pilot</hi> of the
Churches peace, and talkeſt of nothing but glittering helmets, ſwords and

She-Wolf of thy <hi>Romulus</hi> have made, if this direfull note of thine become the
Bell-weather of S.<hi>Peter</hi>'s fold? Well, ſince thou wilt beſpaul, bedribble the aſhes
of unhappy <hi>Rochel,</hi> and ſcatter with thy diſdainfull breath the deſpiſed duſt of
that forlorn City; yet withall call to minde a little, how not many Ages are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
paſt ſince the time was, that the hereditary Sceptre of this thy now <hi>Lewis</hi> broke

ſhall ere long be thine own, (O thou moſt accurſed City.) <hi>Bleſſed ſhall he be that
rewardeth thee as thou haſt rewarded us; yea happy he that ſhall take thy little

at our miſeries, laugh at our tears, make merry at our ſighs, ſing at our groans,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
and applaud our torments: But know for all this, there is a juſt avenger that
looks down from his Heaven upon us, whoſe rod we at once kiſſe, and exſpect
his vengeance. Plead thou our cauſe (O God) yea thine own, only thine: why
ſhould not our confident Innocence appeal to thy Judgment? If there be any
thing in the whole compoſure of our moſt Sacred Religion hitherto profeſſed
by us that hath iſſued out of the impure fountain of mans brain, let it even pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
with the authors, yea let it utterly periſh (O Lord) and be baniſhed into
that Hell whence it came: But if we never dared to obtrude any Doctrine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Chriſtian world but that alone wherewith thou didſt of old inſpire thy
Prophets and Apoſtles, and by thoſe thine infallible pen-men didſt faithfully <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
deliver over to thine own people; ſurely then, either it muſt be our happineſs
to erre with thee (the God of Truth) or thou doſt and wilt ſtill ever maintain

                  <p>But alas, poor ſouls! we are miſtaken all this while: it is nothing elſe but
pure Piety (forſooth) which we ignorantly condemn for Cruelty; 'tis the zeal

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of Gods houſe wherewith (Good Prelate) thou art ſo inflamed, that thou haſt
hereupon both wiſhed and importuned the utter extirpation of all thoſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
ſtabling in the <hi>French</hi> Territories. O forehead! O bowels! For us, we
call God, Angels, Saints to witneſs of this foul calumniation. I wis, thoſe
whom thou falſly brandeſt for Hereticks, thou ſhalt one day hear when the
Church ſhall imbrace them for her children, Chriſt for the ſpiritual Members
of his myſtical body. For what (I beſeech you) do we hold which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
Councils, Fathers, Churches and Chriſtian Profeſſors have not in all
Ages taught and publiſhed? To ſay the truth, All that which we profeſſe,
your own moſt approved Authors have ſtill maintained: whence then is this
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> quarrell? Shall I tell you? There are indeed certain new Patches of Opinion
which you would needs adde to the ancient Faith: theſe we moſt juſtly reject,
and do ſtill conſtantly refuſe. They are humane, they are your own; briefly,
they are either doubtfull, or impious. And muſt we now be caſt out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
of the Church, and be preſently delivered up to fire and ſword? Muſt we
for this be thunder-ſtrucken to Hell by your <hi>Anathemas,</hi> there to frie in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Torments? Is it for this, that a ſtall and ſhambles are thought good
enough for ſuch brutiſh animals? Good God! See the juſtice and charity of
theſe Popelings! This is nothing but a mere injury of the Times; it was not
wont to be Hereſie heretofore that is ſo now-a-daies. If it had been our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to have lived in the Primitive times of the Churches Simplicity, before
ever that <hi>Romiſh</hi> Tranſcendency, Image-worſhip, Tranſubſtantiation, Sacrifice of
the Maſſe, Purgatory, ſingle or half-Communion, Nundination of Pardons,
and the reſt of this rabble were known to the Chriſtian world; ſurely, Heaven
had been as open to us as to other Devout Souls of that purer Age, that took
their happy flight from hence in the Orthodox Faith of Chriſt <hi>Jeſus.</hi> But now
that we are reſerved to that dotage of the world, wherein a certain new brood
of Articles are ſprung up, it is death to us (forſooth) and to be expiated by no
leſſe puniſhment then the perpetuall torments of Hell-fire. Conſider this, O
ye Chriſtians whereſoever diſperſed upon the face of the whole earth; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> I ſay, how far it is from all Juſtice and Charity, that a new Faith ſhould
come dropping forth at mens pleaſure, which muſt adjudge Poſterity to eternal
death for Miſ-believers, whom the ancient Truth had willingly admitted into
Heaven. Theſe new Points of a politick Religion are they indeed that have
ſo much diſturbed the peace of Chriſtendome; theſe are they that ſet at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance
the mighty Potentates of the earth, who otherwiſe perhaps would ſit
down in an happy Peace; theſe are they that rend whole Kingdomes, diſtract
people, diſſolve Societies, nouriſh Faction and Sedition, lay waſt the moſt
flouriſhing Kingdomes, and turn the richeſt Cities to duſt and rubbiſh. But
ſhould theſe things be ſo? Do we think this will one day be allowed for a juſt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> warrant of ſo much war and bloodſhed, before the Tribunall of that ſupreme
Judge of Heaven and earth?</p>
                  <p>Awake therefore now, O ye Chriſtian Princes, and You eſpecially (King
<hi>Lewis</hi>) in whoſe eares theſe wicked counſels are ſo ſpightfully and bloodily

upon the fellow-ſervants of thy God, upon thine own beſt Subjects, whoſe very

ſome late upſtart ſuperfluous additions of humane invention, and mere will-worſhip,
who were alwaies moſt forward to redeem Thine &amp; thy Great Fathers
Safety and Honour, with the continuall hazzard of their owne moſt precious

Bride-groom Chriſt <hi>Jeſus.</hi> But they erre (you will ſay) from the
Faith. From what faith? (I beſeech you.) Not the Chriſtian ſurely, but the
<hi>Romiſh.</hi> What a ſtrange thing is this? Chriſt doth not condemn them, the
Pope doth. If that great Chancellour of <hi>Paris</hi> were now alive, he would freely
teach his <hi>Sorbon,</hi> (as he once did) that it is not in the Popes power (that I may
uſe his owne word) to hereticate any Propoſition. Yea, but an Oecumenicall
Council beſides hath done it. What Council? That of <hi>Trent.</hi> I am deceived <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
if that were hitherto received in the Churches of <hi>France,</hi> or deſerved to be ſo
hereafter. Conſult with your own late Authors of moſt undoubted credit;
they will tell you plainly how unjuſt that Council was, yea how no Council at
all: It was only the Popes act, whatſoever was decreed or eſtabliſhed by that
pack'd Conclave, envaſſalled to the Seven hills. Conſider laſtly, (I beſeech
you) how the Reformed Chriſtians ſtand in no other terms to the Papiſts,
then the Papiſts do to the Reformed; Hereſie is with equall vehemency up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided
on both ſides. But do we deale thus roughly with the followers of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Religion? Did we ever rage againſt the Popiſh Faith with fire and
ſword? Was ever the crime of a poor miſled conſcience capitall to any ſoul?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
You may finde perhaps (but very ſeldome) ſome audacious Maſſe-prieſt, ſome
firebrand of Sedition and contemner of our publick Laws to have ſuffered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign
puniſhment: But no Papiſt (I dare boldly ſay) ever ſuffered loſſe either of
life or lim merely for his Religion. Why doſt not thou then (the Son of that
gracious and mercifull <hi>Henry</hi>) carry thy ſelf alike toward thy faithfull Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
who moſt innocently profeſſe the Reformed Religion? Why ſhould it
prejudice any of them with thee to have ſerved their God according to the holy
Scriptures, and the practice of the Ancient Church? To conclude then, Let it
be but lawfull for thy people to be truly Religious. And thou, Pope <hi>Urban,</hi>
return at laſt to thy ſelf, and conſider how well this bloody advice of thine ſutes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
with thoſe thy Purple robes. A Sword rather then a Sheep-hook would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
that hand that ſhould write thus. Neither is this a Net for the holy
Fiſher-man of <hi>Rome,</hi> but rather for the bloody prizes of the Theatre. <hi>Beautiful
are the feet of them that preach peace,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet:) But we may ſay far
otherwiſe of thee, Curſed are the hands of them that denounce war. The leaſt
noiſe of an hammer muſt not be heard in Gods Temple: But you (Good man)
would fill the holy Church of God with loud alarms, claſhing of bloody wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
and fearfull groans of dying men. Give eare therefore now at laſt, thou
who proudly ſcorneſt the ſentence of any mortall Judge. That which once our
famous <hi>Robert,</hi> the holy and learned Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> is ſaid to have done to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
thy Predeceſſour, the ſame doe I now unto thee. Let me ſummon thee to that
dreadfull Tribunall of Almighty God, before which thy wretched Soul ſhall
one day appear, to give an account of this thy bloody advice. In the mean time,
if thou hadſt rather to flee from the Wrath to come, and to fare well hereafter,
Repent.</p>
