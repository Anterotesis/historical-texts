            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

O how often have we seen them, even immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after they were anointed and throughly greased, till their faces did glister like the Key-hole of a powdering tub, their teeth dance like the jacks of a paire of little Organs or Virginals, when they are played upon, and that they foamed from their very throats like a boare, which the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grel Mastiffe-hounds have driven in, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown amongst the foyles: what did they then? All their consolation was to have some page of the said Roll-book read unto them: and we have seen those who have given themselves to a hundred punchions of old devils, in case that they did not feele a manifest ease and asswage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of paine, at the hearing of the said book read, even when they were kept in a purgatory of torment; no more nor lesse then women in travel use to finde their sorrow abated, when the life of St. <hi>Margarite</hi> is read unto them: is this nothing? finde me a book in any language, in any faculty or science whatsoever, that hath such vertues, properties and prerogatives, and I will be content to pay you a quart of tripes. No, my Masters, no, it is peerlesse, incomparable, and not to be matched; and this am I resolved
<pb facs="tcp:29535:6"/>
for ever to maintaine even unto the fire <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusivè.</hi> And those that will pertinaciously hold the contrary opinion, let them be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Abusers, Predestinators, Impostors and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers of the People; it is very true, that there are found in some gallant and stately books, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of high estimation, certain occult and hid properties; in the number of which are reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>Whippot, Orlando furioso, Robert the devil, Fierabras, William without feare, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux, Monteville,</hi> and <hi>Mata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brune:</hi> but they are not comparable to that which we speak of; and the world hath well known by infallible experience, the great emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and utility which it hath received by this <hi>Gargantuine</hi> Chronicle; for the Printers have sold more of them in two moneths time, then there will be bought of Bibles in nine yeares.</p>
            <p>I therefore (your humble slave) being very willing to increase your solace and recreation yet a little more, do offer you for a Present another book of the same stamp, only that it is a little more reasonable and worthy of credit then the other was; for think not, (unlesse you wilfully will erre against your knowledge) that I speak of it as the <hi>Jewes</hi> do of the Law; I was not born under such a Planet, neither did it ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall me to lie, or affirme a thing for true that was not: I speak of it like a lustie frolick <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>I know that reading this passage, you will make a doubt within your selves, and that grounded upon very good reason: which is this, how it is possible that this relation can be true, seeing at the time of the flood all the world was destroyed, except <hi>Noah,</hi> and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29535:11"/>
seven persons more with him in the Ark, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whose number <hi>Hurtali</hi> is not admitted; doubtlesse the demand is well made, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apparent, but the answer shall satisfie you, or my wit is not rightly caulked: and because I was not at that time to tell you any thing of my own fancie, I will bring unto you the authority of the <hi>Massorets,</hi> good honest fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, true <hi>ballokeering</hi> blades, and exact <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braical</hi> bagpipers, who affirm that verily the said <hi>Hurtali</hi> was not within the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> (neither could he getin, for he was too big) but he sate astride upon it, with one leg on the one side, and another on the other, as little children use to do upon their wooden hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: or as the great Bull of <hi>Berne,</hi> which was killed at <hi>Marinian,</hi> did ride for his Hackney the great murthering piece called the <hi>Canon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eprrier,</hi> a pretty blast of a faire and pleasant amble without all question.</p>
            <p>In that posture, he after God, saved the said Ark from danger, for with his legs he gave it the brangle that was needful, and with his foot turned it whither he pleased, as a ship answereth her rudder. Those that were within sent him up victuals in abundance by a Chimney, as people very thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the good that he did them; And sometimes they did talk together as <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romenippus</hi> did to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> according to the report of <hi>Lucian.</hi> Have you understood all

But that we may fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the cause and reason of the name of <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> which at his Baptism was given him, you are to remark, that in that yeare there was so great drought over all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Affrick,</hi> that there past thirty and six moneths, three weeks, foure dayes, thirteen houres, and a little more without raine, but with a heat so vehement, that the whole earth was parched and withered by it: neither was it more scorched and dried up with heat in the dayes of <hi>Eliah,</hi> then it was at that time; for there was not a tree to be seen, that had either
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29535:12"/>
leafe or bloom upon it: the grasse was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out verdure or greennesse, the rivers were drained, the fountaines dried up, the poore fishes abandoned and forsaken by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per element, wandring and crying upon the ground most horribly: the birds did fall down from the aire for want of moisture and dew, wherewith to refresh them: the wolves, foxes, harts, wild-boares, fallow-deer, hares, coneys, weesils, brocks, badgers, and other such beasts were found dead in the fields with their mouthes open; in respect of men, there was the pity, you should have seen them lay out their tongues like hares that have been run six houres: many did throw themselves into the wells: others entred within a Cowes belly to be in the shade; those <hi>Homer</hi> calls <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libants:</hi> all the Countrey was idle, and could do no vertue: it was a most lamentable case to have seen the labour of mortals in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves from the vehemencie of this horrifick drought; for they had work enough to do to save the holy water in the Churches from being wasted; but there was such order taken by the counsel of my Lords the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, and of our holy Father, that none did dare to take above one lick: yet when any one came into the Church, you should have seen above twenty poor thirsty fellows hang upon him that was the distributer of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that with a wide open throat, gaping
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29535:13"/>
for some little drop, (like the rich glutton in <hi>Luke,</hi>) that might fall by, lest any thing should be lost. O how happy was he in that yeare, who had a coole Cellar under ground, well plenished with fresh wine!</p>
            <p>The Philosopher reports in moving the question, wherefore it is that the sea-water is salt? that at the time when <hi>Phoebus</hi> gave the government of his resplendent chariot to his sonne <hi>Phaeton,</hi> the said <hi>Phaeton,</hi> unskilful in the Art, and not knowing how to keep the ecliptick line betwixt the two tropicks of the latitude of the Sunnes course, strayed out of his way, and came so near the earth, that he dried up all the Countreys that were under it, burning a great part of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, which the <hi>Philosophers</hi> call <hi>via lactea,</hi> and the <hi>Huffsnuffs,</hi> St. <hi>Iames</hi> his way, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the most coped, lofty, and high-crest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Poets affirme that to be the place where <hi>Iuno's</hi> milk fell, when she gave suck to <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The earth at that time was so excessively heated, that it fell into an enormous sweat yea such a one as made it sweat out the sea which is therefore salt, because all sweat i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

certain <hi>Friday,</hi> when the whole people were bent upon their devotions, and had made goodly Processions, with store of Letanies, and faire preachings, and beseechings of God Almighty, to look down with his eye of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon their miserable and disconsolate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, there was even then visibly seen issue out of the ground great drops of water, such as fall from a puff-bagg'd man in a top sweat; and the poore Hoydons began to rejoyce, as if it had been a thing very profitable unto them; for some said that there was not one drop of moisture in the aire, whence they might have any rain, and that the earth did supply the default of that. Other learned men said, that it was a showre of the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> as <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> saith in his fourth book <hi>Quaestionum na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalium,</hi> speaking of the source and spring of <hi>Nilus:</hi> but they were deceived, for the Procession being ended, when every one went about to gather of this dew, and to drink of it with full bowles; they found that it was nothing but pickle, and the very brine of salt, more brackish in taste then the saltest water of the sea: and because in that very day <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was borne, his father gave him that name; for <hi>panta</hi> in <hi>Greek</hi> is as much to say as <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>Gruel</hi> in the <hi>Hagarene</hi> language doth signifie <hi>thirsty;</hi> inferring here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that at his birth the whole world was a dry and thirstie, as likewise foreseeing that

he, would be some day Suprem Lord, &amp; Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign of the <hi>thirstie Ethrappels,</hi> which was shewn to him at that very same hour by a more evident signe; for when his mother <hi>Badebec</hi> was in the bringing of him forth, and that the Midwives did wait to receive him: there came first out of her belly threescore and eight <hi>Tregeneers</hi> (that is, Salt-sellers,) every one of them leading in a Halter a Mule hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy loaden with salt: after whom issued forth nine Dromedaries, with great loads of gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of bacon, and dried neats tongues on their backs: then followed seven Camels loaded with links and chitterlins, Hogs pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and salciges: after them came out five great waines, full of leeks, garlick, onions and chibols, drawn with five and thirty strong Cart-horses, which was six for every one, besides the <hi>Thiller.</hi> At the sight hereoi the said Midwives were much amazed; yet some of them said, Lo, here is good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and indeed we need it; for we drink but lazily, as if our tongues walked on crutches, and not lustily like <hi>Lansman dutches:</hi> truly this is a good signe, there is nothing here but what is fit for us, these are the spurres of wine that set it a going. As they were tatling thus together after their own manner of chat, behold, out comes <hi>Pantagruel</hi> all hairie like a Beare, whereupon one of them inspired with a prophetical Spirit, said, This will be a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible

            <p>WHen <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was borne, there was none more astonished and perplexed then was his father <hi>Gargantua;</hi> for of the one side, seeing his wife <hi>Badebec</hi> dead, and on the other side his sonne <hi>Pantagruel</hi> born, so faire and so great, he knew not what to say nor what to do: and the doubt that troubled his braine, was to know whether he should cry for the death of his wife, or laugh for the joy of his sonne: he was <hi>hinc indè</hi> choaked with sophistical arguments, for he framed them very well <hi>in modo &amp; figura,</hi> but he could not resolve them, remaining pestered and entangled by this means, like a mouse catch't in a trap, or kite snared in a ginne: Shall I weep (said he?) Yes, for why? my so good wife is dead, who was the most <hi>this,</hi> the most <hi>that,</hi> that ever was in the world: never shall I see her, never shall I recover such another, it is unto me an inestimable losse! O my
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29535:15"/>
good God, what had I done that thou should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thus punish me? why didst thou not take me away before her? seeing for me to live without her is but to languish. Ah <hi>Badebec, Badebec,</hi> my minion, my dear heart, my su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, my sweeting, my honey, my little C. . . (yet it had in circumference full six acres, three rods, five poles, foure yards, two foot, one inche and a half of good woodland measure) my tender peggie, my Codpiece darling, my bob and hit, my slipshoe-lovie, never shall I see thee! Ah, poor <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> thou hast lost thy good mother, thy sweet nurse, thy well-beloved Lady! O false death, how injurious and despightful hast thou been to me? how malicious and outragious have I found thee? in taking her from me, my well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved wife, to whom immortality did of right belong. With these words he did cry like a Cow, but on a sudden fell a laughing like a Calfe, when <hi>Pantagruel</hi> came into his minde: Ha, my little sonne, (said he) my childilollie, fedlifondie, dandlichuckie, my ballockie, my pretty rogue; O how jollie thou art, and how much am I bound to my gracious God, that hath been pleased to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow on me a sonne, so faire, so spriteful, so lively, so smiling, so pleasant, and so gentle. <hi>Ho, ho, ho, ho,</hi> how glad I am? Let us drink, <hi>ho;</hi> and put away melancholy: bring of the best; rense the glasses, lay the cloth,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29535:15"/>
drive out these dogs, blow this fire, light candles, shut that door there, cut this bread in sippers for brewis, send away these poore folks in giving them what they ask, hold my gown, I will strip my self into my doublet, (<hi>én cuerpo</hi>) to make the Gossips merry, and keep them company.</p>
            <p>As he spake this, he heard the Letanies and the <hi>memento's</hi> of the Priests that carried his wife to be buried, upon which he left the good purpose he was in, and was suddenly ravished another way, saying, Lord God, must I again contrist my self? this grieves me; I am no longer young, I grow old, the weather is dangerous; I may perhaps take an ague, then shall I be foiled, if not quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; by the faith of a Gentleman, it were better to cry lesse, and drink more.</p>
            <p>My wife is dead, well, by G- (<hi>da jurandi</hi>) I shall not raise her again by my crying: she is well, she is in Paradise at least, if she be no higher: she prayeth to God for us, she is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, she is above the sense of our miseries, nor can our calamities reach her: what though she be dead, must not we also die? the same debt which she hath paid, hangs over our heads; nature will require it of us, and we must all of us some day taste of the same sauce: let her passe then, and the Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Survivors; for I must now cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout how to get another wife. But I will

tell you what you shall do, (said he) to the Midwives in <hi>France</hi> called <hi>wise women</hi> (Where be the good folks?

            </head>
            <p>I Finde by the ancient Historiographers and Poets, that divers have been borne in this world, after very strange manners, which would be too long to repeat; reade therefore the seventh chapter of <hi>Pliny,</hi> if you have so much leisure: yet have you never heard of any so wonderful as that of <hi>Pantagruel;</hi> for it is a very difficult matter to beleeve, how in the little time he was in his mothers belly, he grew both in body and strength. That which <hi>Hercules</hi> did, was nothing, when in his Cradle he slew two serpents; for those serpents were but little and weak: but <hi>Pantagruel</hi> being yet in the Cradle, did farre more admirable things, and more to be amazed at. I passe by here the relation of how at every one of his meales he supped up the milk of foure thousand and six hundred Cowes: and how to make him a skellet to boil his milk in, there were set a work all the Brasiers of <hi>Somure</hi> in <hi>Anjou,</hi> of <hi>Villedieu</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> in <hi>Lorraine:</hi> and they served in this whitepot-meat to him in a huge great Bell, which is yet to be seen in the City of <hi>Bourge</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:29535:17"/>
in <hi>Berrie,</hi> near the Palace; but his teeth were already so well grown, and so strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in vigour, that of the said Bell he bit off a great morsel, as very plainly doth appeare till this houre.</p>
            <p>One day in the morning, when they would have made him suck one of his Cows, (for he never had any other Nurse, as the History tells us) he got one of his armes loose from the swadling bands, wherewith he was kept fast in the Cradle, laid hold on the said Cow under the left fore hamme, and grasp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to him, ate up her udder and half of her paunch, with the liver and the kidneys, and had devoured all up, if she had not cried out most horribly, as if the wolves had held her by the legs, at which noise company came in, and took away the said Cow from <hi>Pantagruel;</hi> yet could they not so well do it, but that the quarter whereby he caught her was left in his hand, of which quarter he gulp't up the flesh in a trice, even with as much ease as you would eate a salcige; and that so greedily with desire of more, that when they would have taken away the bone from him, he swallowed it down whole, as a Cormorant would do a little fish; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards began fumblingly to say, <hi>Good, good, good,</hi> for he could not yet speak plaine; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to understand thereby, that he had found it very good, and that he did lack

but so much more; which when they saw that attended him, they bound him with great cable-ropes, like those that are made at <hi>Tain,</hi> for the carriage of salt to <hi>Lyons;</hi> or such as those are, whereby the great <hi>French</hi> ship rides at Anchor, in the Road of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven</hi> in <hi>Normandie.</hi> But on a certain time, a great Beare which his father had bred, got loose, came towards him, began to lick his face, for his Nurses had not throughly wiped his chaps, at which unexpected approach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a sudden offended, he as lightly rid himself of those great cables, as <hi>Samson</hi> did of the haulser ropes wherewith the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines</hi> had tied him, and by your leave, takes me up my Lord the Beare, and teares him to you in pieces like a pullet, which served him for a gorge-ful or good warme bit for that meale.</p>
            <p>Whereupon <hi>Gargantua</hi> fearing lest the childe should hurt himself, caused foure great chaines of iron to be made to binde him, and so many strong wooden arches unto his Cradle, most firmely stocked and mortaised in huge frames: of those chaines you have one at <hi>Rochel,</hi> which they draw up at night betwixt the two great towers of the Haven: Another is at <hi>Lyons:</hi> A third at <hi>Angiers:</hi> And the fourth was carried away by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils to binde <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who broke his chaines in those dayes, by reason of a cholick that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29535:18"/>
extraordinarily torment him, taken with eating a Serjeants soule fried for his break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast, and therfore you may beleeve that which <hi>Nicolas de Lyra</hi> saith upon that place of the <hi>Psalter,</hi> where it is written, <hi>Et Og regem Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san,</hi> that the said <hi>Og</hi> being yet little, was so strong and robustious, that they were faine to binde him with chaines of iron in his Cradle; thus continued <hi>Pantagruel</hi> for a while very calme and quiet, for he was not able so easily to break those chaines, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially having no room in the Cradle to give a swing with his armes. But see what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, once upon a great Holiday, that his father <hi>Gargantua</hi> made a sumptuous banquet to all the Princes of his Court: I am apt to beleeve, that the menial officers of the house were so imbusied in waiting each on his proper service at the feast, that no body took care of poor <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who was left <hi>a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culorum,</hi> behinde-hand all alone, and as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken. What did he? Heark what he did, good people: he strove and essayed to break the chaines of the Cradle with his armes but coold not, for they were too strong for him: then did he keep with his feet such a stamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stirre, and so long, that at last he beat out the lower end of his Cradle, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding was made of a great post five foot in square: and assoon as he had gotten out his feet, he slid down as well as he could,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29535:18"/>
till he had got his soales to the ground; and then with a mighty force he rose up, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Cradle upon his back, bound to him like a Tortoise that crawles up against a wall; and to have seen him, you would have thought it had been a great <hi>Carrick</hi> of five hundred tunne upon one end. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he entred into the great Hall, where they were banquetting, and that very boldly, which did much affright the companie; yet because his armes were tied in, he could not reach any thing to eate, but with great pain stooped now and then a little, to take with the whole flat of his tongue some lick, good bit or morsel.</p>
            <p>Which when his father saw, he knew well enough that they had left him without giving him any thing to eate, and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that he should be loosed from the said chains, by the counsel of the Princes and Lords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there present: besides that, also the Physicians of <hi>Gargantua</hi> said, that if they did thus keep him in the Cradle, he would be all his life-time subject to the stone. When he was unchained they made him to sit down, where after he had fed very well, he took his Cradle, and broke it into more then five hundred thousand pieces with one blow of his fist, that he struck in the midst of it, swearing that he would never come into it again.</p>

            <p>THus grew <hi>Pantagruel</hi> from day to day, and to every ones eye waxed more and more in all his dimensions, which made his father to rejoyce by a natural affection: therefore caused he to be made for him, whilest he was yet little, a pretty Crosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe, wherewith to shoot at small birds, which now they call the great Crossebowe at <hi>Chantelle.</hi> Then he sent him to the school to learn, and to spend his youth in vertue: in the prosecution of which designe he came first to <hi>Poictiers,</hi> where, as he studied and profited very much, he saw that the Scholars were oftentimes at leisure, and knew not how to bestow their time, which moved him to take such compassion on them, that one day he took from a long ledge of rocks (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led there <hi>Passelourdin,</hi>) a huge great stone, of about twelve fathom square, and fourteen handfuls thick, and with great ease set it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on foure pillars in the midst of a field, to no other end, but that the said Scholars when they had nothing else to do, might passe their

time in getting up on that stone, and feast it with store of gammons, pasties and flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, and carve their names upon it with a knife, in token of which deed, till this houre the stone is called the lifted stone: and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance hereof there is none entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Register and matricular Book of the said University, or accounted capable of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any degree therein, till he have first drunk in the <hi>Caballine</hi> fountain of <hi>Croustel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> passed at <hi>Passelourdin,</hi> and got up upon the <hi>lifted stone.</hi>

            <p>Afterwards reading the delectable Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of his Ancestors, he found that <hi>Iafrey</hi> of <hi>Lusinian</hi> called <hi>Iafrey</hi> with the great tooth, Grandfather to the Cousin in law of the eldest Sister of the Aunt of the Son in law of the Uncle of the good daughter of his Stepmother, was interred at <hi>Maillezais;</hi> therefore one day he took <hi>campos,</hi> (which is a little vacation from study to play a while,) that he might give him a visit as unto an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man: and going from <hi>Poi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29535:20"/>
looking upon the picture, whose lively draughts did set him forth in the represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a man in an extreme fury, drawing his great <hi>Malchus</hi> faulchion half way out of his scabbard: when the reason hereof was demanded, the Chanons of the said place told him, that there was no other cause of it, but that <hi>Pictoribus atque Poetis, &amp;c.</hi> that is to say, that Painters and Poets have liberty to paint and devise what they list after their own fancie: but he was not satisfied with their answer, and said, He is not thus painted without a cause; and I suspect that at his death there was some wrong done him, whereof he requireth his Kinred to take revenge: I will enquire further into it, and then do what shall be reasonable; then he returned not to <hi>Poictiers,</hi> but would take a view of the other Universities of <hi>France:</hi> therefore go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Rochel,</hi> he took shipping and arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> where he found no great exercise, only now and then he would see some Marriners and Lightermen a wrestling on the key or strand by the river-side: From thence he came to <hi>Tholouse,</hi> where he learned to dance very well, and to <hi>play</hi> with the <hi>two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed sword,</hi> as the fashion of the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the said University is to bestir them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in <hi>games,</hi> whereof they may have their <hi>hands full:</hi> but he stayed not long there, when he saw that they did cause bury their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents</hi>

alive, like red herring, saying, Now God forbid that I should die this death; for I am by nature sufficiently dry already, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heating my self any further.</p>
            <p>He went then to <hi>Monpellier,</hi> where he met with the good wives of <hi>Mirevaux,</hi> and good jovial company withal, and thought to have set himself to the study of Physick; but he considered that that calling was too troublesome and melancholick; and that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians did smell of glisters like old devils: Therefore he resolved he would studie the lawes; but seeing that there were but three scauld, and one bald-pated Legist in that place, he departed from thence, and in his way made the Bridge of <hi>Gard,</hi> and the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheater</hi> of <hi>Neems</hi> in lesse then three houres, which neverthelesse seems to be a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine then humane work. After that he came to <hi>Avignon,</hi> where he was not above three dayes before he fell in love; for the women there take great delight in playing at the close buttock-game, because it is Papal ground; which his Tutor and Pedagogue <hi>Epistemon</hi> perceiving, he drew him out of that place, and brought him to <hi>Valence</hi> in the <hi>Dauphinee,</hi> where he saw no great matter of recreation, only that the Lubbards of the Town did beat the Scholars, which so incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him with anger, that when upon a certain very faire Sunday, the people being at their
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29535:21"/>
publick dancing in the streets, and one of the Scholars offering to put himself into the ring to partake of that sport, the foresaid lubbardly fellowes would not permit him the admittance into their society; He taking the Scholars part, so belaboured them with blowes, and laid such load upon them, that he drove them all before him, even to the brink of the river <hi>Rhosne,</hi> and would have there drowned them, but that they did squat to the ground, and there lay close a full halfe league under the river. The hole is to be seen there yet.</p>
            <p>After that he departed from thence, and in three strides and one leap came to <hi>Angiers,</hi> where he found himself very well, and would have continued there some space, but that the plague drove them away. So from thence he came to <hi>Bourges,</hi> where he studied a good long time, and profited very much in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Lawes: and would sometimes say, that the books of the Civil Law, were like unto a wonderfully precious, royal and triumphant robe of cloth of gold, edged with dirt; for in the world are no goodlier books to be seen, more ornate, nor more elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent then the texts of the Pandects; but the bordering of them, that is to say, the glosse of <hi>Accursius</hi> is so scurvie, vile, base and unsavourie, that it is nothing but filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and villany.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:29535:21"/>Going from <hi>Bourges,</hi> he came to <hi>Orleans,</hi> where he found store of swaggering Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that made him great entertainment at his coming, and with whom he learned to play at tennis so well, that he was a Master at that game; for the Students of the said place make a prime exercise of it; and sometimes they carried him unto <hi>Cupids</hi> houses of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce (in that City termed <hi>Islands,</hi> because of their being most ordinarily environed with other houses, and not contiguous to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,) there to recreate his person at the sport of <hi>Poussevant,</hi> which the wenches of <hi>London</hi> call the <hi>Ferkers in and in.</hi> As for breaking his head with over-much study, he had an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care not to do it in any case, for feare of spoiling his eyes; which he the rather obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for that it was told him by one of his Teachers, (there called Regents,) that the paine of the eyes was the most hurtful thing of any to the sight: for this cause when he one day was made a <hi>Licentiate,</hi> or Graduate in law, one of the Scholras of his acquaintance, who of learning had not much more then his burthen, though in stead of that he could dance very well, and play at tennis, made the blason and device of the <hi>Licentiates</hi> in the said University, saying,</p>

other my good friends, as I was wont to do: which conversation of mine, although it was not without sin, (because we are all of us tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passers, and therefore ought continually to beseech his divine Majesty, to blot our trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions out of his memory) yet was it by the help and grace of God, without all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reproach before men.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore if those qualities of the minde but shine in thee, wherewith I am endowed, as in thee remaineth the perfect image of my body, thou wilt be esteemed by all men to be the perfect guardian and treasure of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of our name: but if otherwise, I shall truly take but small pleasure to see it, considering that the lesser part of me, which is the body, would abide in thee: and the best, to wit, that which is the soule, and by which our name continues blessed amongst men, would be degenerate and abastardised: This I do not speak out of any distrust that I have of thy vertue, which I have heretofore already tried, but to encourage thee yet more earnestly to proceed from good to better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that which I now write unto thee, is not so much that thou shouldest live in this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous course, as that thou shouldest rejoyce in so living and having lived, and cheer up thy self with the like resolution in time to come; to the prosecution and accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which enterprise and generous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:29535:30"/>
thou mayest easily remember how that I have spared nothing, but have so help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee, as if I had had no other treasure in this world, but to see thee once in my life, compleatly well bred and accomplished, as well in vertue, honesty and valour, as in all liberal knowledge and civility: and so to leave thee after my death, as a mirrour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting the person of me thy father, and if not so excellent, and such <hi>indeed</hi> as I do wish thee, yet such in my <hi>desire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But although my deceased father of happy memory <hi>Grangousier,</hi> had bent his best endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make me profit in all perfection and Political knowledge, and that my labour and study was fully correspondent to, yea, went beyond his desire: neverthelesse, as thou mayest well understand, the time then was not so proper and fit for learning as it is at present, neither had I plenty of such good Masters as thou hast had; for that time was darksome, obscured with clouds of ignorance, and savouring a little of the infelicity and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> who had, whereever they set footing, destroyed all good literature, which in my age hath by the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse been restored unto its former light and dignity, and that with such amendment and increase of the knowledge, that now hardly should I be admitted unto the first forme of the little Grammar-school-boyes:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29535:31"/>
I say, I, who in my youthful dayes was, (and that justly) reputed the most learned of that age; which I do not speak in vain boasting, although I might lawfully do it in writing unto thee, in verification whereof thou hast the authority of <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> in his book of old age, and the sentence of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in the book intituled how a man may praise himself without envie: but to give thee an emulous encouragement to strive yet further.</p>
                  <p>Now is it that the mindes of men are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified with all manner of discipline, and the old sciences revived, which for many ages were extinct: now it is, that the learned lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages are to their pristine purity restored, <hi>viz. Greek,</hi> (without which a man may be ashamed to account himself a scholar,) <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Arabick, Chaldaean</hi> and <hi>Latine.</hi> Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewise is now in use, so elegant, and so correct, that better cannot be imagined, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was found out but in my time by divine inspiration, as by a diabolical suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the other side was the invention of Ordnance. All the world is full of knowing men, of most learned Schoolmasters, and vast Libraries: and it appears to me as a truth, that neither in <hi>Plato</hi>'s time, nor <hi>Cicero</hi>'s, nor <hi>Papinian</hi>'s, there was ever such conveniency for studying, as we see at this day there is: nor must any adventure henceforward to come in publick, or present himself in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29535:31"/>
that hath not been pretty well polished in the shop of <hi>Minerva:</hi> I see robbers, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, free-booters, tapsters, ostlers, and such like, of the very rubbish of the people, more learned now, then the Doctors and Preachers were in my time,</p>
                  <p>What shall I say? the very women and children have aspired to this praise and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial Manna of good learning: yet so it is, that in the age I am now of, I have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to learn the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue, which I contemned not like <hi>Cato,</hi> but had not the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in my younger yeares to attend the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of it: and take much delight in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Morals, the pleasant Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of <hi>Plato,</hi> the Monuments of <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanias,</hi> and the Antiquities of <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> in waiting on the houre wherein God my Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator shall call me, and command me to depart from this earth and transitory pilgrimage. Wherefore (my sonne) I admonish thee, to imploy thy youth to profit as well as thou canst, both in thy studies and in vertue. Thou art at <hi>Paris,</hi> where the laudable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of many brave men may stirre up thy minde to gallant actions, and hast like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for thy Tutor and <hi>Paedagogue</hi> the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Epistemon,</hi> who by his lively and vocal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments may instruct thee in the Arts and Sciences.</p>
                  <p>I intend, and will have it so, that thou learn
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29535:32"/>
the Languages perfectly: first of all, the <hi>Greek,</hi> as <hi>Quintilian</hi> will have it: secondly, the <hi>Latine;</hi> and then the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> for the holy Scripture-sake: and then the <hi>Chaldee</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick</hi> likewise, and that thou frame thy stilein <hi>Greek</hi> in imitation of <hi>Plato;</hi> and for the <hi>Latine,</hi> after <hi>Cicero,</hi> let there be no history which thou shalt not have ready in thy memory; unto the prosecuting of which designe, books of <hi>Cosmographie</hi> will be very conducible, and help thee much. Of the liberal Arts of <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, Arithmetick</hi> and <hi>Musick,</hi> I gave thee some taste when thou wert yet little, and not above five or six yeares old; proceed further in them, &amp; learn the remainder if thou canst. As for <hi>Astronomy,</hi> study all the rules thereof, let passe neverthelesse the divining and judicial <hi>Astrology,</hi> and the Art of <hi>Lullius,</hi> as being nothing else but plain abuses and vanities. As for the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> of that I would have thee to know the texts by heart, and then to conferre them with <hi>Philosophie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in matter of the knowledge of the works of Nature, I would have thee to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that exactly, and that so there be no sea, river nor fountain, of which thou doest not know the fishes, all the fowles of the aire, all the several kindes of shrubs and trees, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in forrests or orchards: all the sorts of herbes and flowers that grow upon the ground: all the various mettals that are hid
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29535:32"/>
within the bowels of the earth: together with all the diversity of precious stones, that are to be seen in the Orient &amp; South-parts of the world, let nothing of all these be hidden from thee. Then faile not most carefully to peruse the books of the <hi>Greek, Arabian</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Physicians, not despising the <hi>Talmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dists</hi> and <hi>Cabalists;</hi> and by frequent Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomies get thee the perfect knowledge of the other world, called the Microcosme, which is man: and at some houres of the day apply thy minde to the study of the holy Scriptures: first in <hi>Greek,</hi> the New Testament with the Epistles of the Apostles; and then the Old Testament in <hi>Hebrew</hi> In brief, let me see thee an Abysse, and bottomlesse pit of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: for from hence forward, as thou grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est great and becomest a man, thou must part from this tranquillity and rest of study, thou must learn chivalrie, warfare, and the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of the field, the better thereby to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my house and our friends, and to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and protect them at all their needs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the invasion and assaults of evil doers.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, I will that very shortly thou try how much thou hast profited, which thou canst not better do, then by maintaining pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly <hi>Theses</hi> and Conclusions in all Arts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all persons whatsoever, and by haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the company of learned men, both at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> and otherwhere. But because as the wise
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:29535:33"/>
man <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Wisdome entereth not into a malicious minde;</hi> and that knowledge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conscience is but the ruine of the soule, it behooveth thee to serve, to love, to feare God, and on him to cast all thy thoughts and all thy hope, and by faith formed in charity to cleave unto him, so that thou mayest ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be separated from him by thy sins. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the abuses of the world: set not thy heart upon vanity; for this life is transitory, but the Word of the Lord endureth for ever. Be serviceable to all thy neighbours, and love them as thy self: reverence thy Praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptors: shun the conversation of those whom thou desirest not to resemble, and receive not in vaine the graces which God hath bestowed upon thee: and when thou shalt see that thou hast attained to all the knowledge that is to be acquired in that part, return unto me, that I may see thee, and give thee my blessing before I die. <hi>My sonne,</hi> the peace and grace of our Lord be with thee. Amen.</p>

            <p>ONe day as <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was taking a walk without the City, towards <hi>St. Antonies</hi> Abbey, discoursing and philosophating with his own servants and some other Scholars, met with a young man of a very comely sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and surpassing handsome in all the linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his body, but in several parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of most pitifully wounded; in such bad equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page in matter of his apparel, which was but totters and rags, and every way so far out of order, that he seemed to have been a fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with mastiffe-dogs, from whose fury he had made an escape, or to say better, he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the condition wherein he then was, like an Apple-gatherer of the countrey of <hi>Perche.</hi>

               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:29535:34"/>As farre off as <hi>Pantagruel</hi> saw him, he said to those that stood by: Do you see that man there, who is a coming hither upon the road from <hi>Charanton</hi>-bridge? by my faith, he is only poor in fortune; for I may assure you, that by his <hi>Physiognomie</hi> it appeareth, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath extracted him from some rich and noble race, and that too much curiosity hath thrown him upon adventures, which possibly have reduced him to this indigence, want and penurie. Now as he was just amongst them, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> said unto him, Let me intreat you, (<hi>friend</hi>) that you may be pleased to stop here a little, and answer me to that which I shall ask you, and I am confident you will not think your time ill bestowed; for I have an extream desire, (according to my ability) to give you some supply in this distresse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I see you are; because I do very much commiserate your case, which truly moves me to great pity; Therefore (my friend) tell me, who you are? whence you come? whither you go? what you desire? and what your name is? the <hi>companion</hi> answered him in the <hi>Dutch</hi> tongue, thus.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> How <hi>Pantagruel</hi> judged so equitably of a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, which was wonderfully obscure and difficult: that by reason of his just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree therein, he was reputed to have a most admirable judgement.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>PAntagruel,</hi> very well remembring his fathers letter and admonitions, would one day make trial of his knowledge. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in all the <hi>Carrefours,</hi> that is, throughout all the foure quarters, streets and corners of the City, he set up Conclusions to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of nine thousand seven hundred sixty and foure, in all manner of learning, touching in them the hardest doubts that are in any sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And first of all, in the <hi>fodder-street</hi> he held dispute against all the <hi>Regents</hi> or Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes of Colledges, <hi>Artists</hi> or Masters of Arts, and Oratours, and did so gallantly, that he overthrew them, and set them all upon their tailes, he went afterwards to the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,</hi> where he maintained argument against all the <hi>Theol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:29535:38"/>
take their repast: and at this were present the greatest part of the Lords of the Court, the Masters of Requests, Presidents, Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, those of the Accompts, Secretaries, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates and others: as also the Sheriffes of the said town, with the Physicians and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of the canon-law; amongst which it is to be remarked, that the greatest part were stubborn jades, and in their opinions obstinate; but he took such course with them, that for all their <hi>Ergo's</hi> and fallacies, he put their backs to the wall, gravelled them in the deepest questions, and made it visibly appear to the world, that compared to him, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> were but monkies, and a knot of mufled calves: Whereupon, every body began to keep a bustling noise, and talk of his so mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous knowledge, through all degrees of persons in both sexes, even to the very Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses, Brokers, Rostmeat-sellers, Penknife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> makers and others, who, when he past along in the street, would say, This is he; in which he took delight, as <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Greek</hi> Oratours did, when an old crouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wife, pointing at him with her fingers, said, That is the man.</p>
            <p>Now at this same very time there was a processe or suit in law, depending in Court between two great Lords, of which one was called my Lord <hi>Kissebreech,</hi> Plaintiffe of one side, and the other my Lord <hi>Suckfist,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:29535:38"/>
of the other; whose Controversie was so high and difficult in Law, that the Court of Parliament could make nothing of it. And therefore by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King, there were assembled foure of the greatest, and most learned of all the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments of <hi>France,</hi> together with the great Councel, and all the principal Regents of the Universities, not only of <hi>France,</hi> but of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> also and <hi>Italy,</hi> such as <hi>Iason, Philippus-Decius, Petrus de Petronibus,</hi> and a rabble of other old <hi>Rabbinists:</hi> who being thus met together, after they had thereupon consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the space of six and fourty weeks, finding that they could not fasten their teeth in it, nor with such clearnesse understand the case, as that they might in any manner of way be able to right it, or take up the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence berwixt the two aforesaid Parties, it did so grievously vex them, that they most vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanously conshit themselves for shame. In this great extremity, one amongst them na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Du Douhait,</hi> the learnedst of all, and more expert and prudent then any of the rest, whilest one day they were thus at their wits end, all-to-be-dunced and <hi>philogrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized</hi> in their braines, said unto them: We have been here (my Masters,) a good long space without doing any thingelse, then trifle away both our time and money, and can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse finde neither brim nor bottome in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:29535:39"/>
this matter; for the more we study about it, the lesse we understand therein, which is a great shame and disgrace to us, and a heavy burthen to our consciences; yea such, that in my opinion we shall not rid our selves of it without dishonour, unlesse we take some other course; for we do nothing but doat in our consultations.</p>
            <p>See therefore what I have thought upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you have heard much talking of that worthy personage named Master <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who hath been found to be learned above the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of this present age, by the proofs he gave in those great disputations, which he held publickly against all men: my opinion is, that we send for him, to conferre with him about this businesse; for never any man will encompasse the bringing of it to an end, if he do it not.</p>
            <p>Hereunto all the Counsellors and Doctors willingly agreed, and according to that their result having instantly sent for him, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to be pleased to canvass the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, and sift it throughly, that after a deep search and narrow examination of all the points thereof, he might forthwith make the report unto them, such as he shall think good in true and legal knowledge: to this effect they delivered into his hands the bags where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were the Writs and Pancarts concerning that suit, which for bulk and weight were
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:29535:39"/>
almost enough to lade foure great <hi>couillard</hi> or stoned Asses; but <hi>Pantagruel</hi> said unto them, Are the two Lords, between whom this debate and processe is, yet living? it was answered him, Yes: To what a devil then (said he,) serve so many paultry heapes, and bundles of papers and copies which you give me? is it not better to heare their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie from their own mouthes, whilest they are face to face before us, then to reade these vile fopperies, which are nothing but trumperies, deceits, diabolical cosenages of <hi>Cepola,</hi> pernicious slights and subversions of equity? for I am sure, that you, and all those thorough whose hands this processe hath past, have by your devices added what you could to it <hi>pro &amp; contra<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> in such sort, that although their difference perhaps was clear and easie enough to determine at first, you have obscured it, and made it more intricate, by the frivolous, sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish, unreasonable and foolish reasons, and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Accursius, Baldus, Bartolus, de castro, de imola, Hippolytus, Panormo, Bertachin, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, Curtius,</hi> and those other old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiffs, who never understood the least law of the Pandects, they being but meer block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads &amp; great tithe-calvs, ignorant of all that which was needful for the understanding of the lawes; for (as it is most certain) they had not the knowledge either of the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> tongue, but only of the <hi>Gothick</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian;</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:29535:40"/>
the lawes neverthelesse were first taken from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> according to the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Ulpian. l. poster. de origine juris,</hi> which we likewise may perceive by that all the lawes are full of <hi>Greek</hi> words and senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and then we finde that they are reduced into a <hi>Latine</hi> stile, the most elegant and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that whole language is able to afford, without excepting that of any that ever wrote therein; nay, not of <hi>Salust, Varo, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero, Seneca, Titus Livius,</hi> nor <hi>Quintilian:</hi> how then could these old dotards be able to understand aright the text of the lawes, who never in their time had looked upon a good <hi>Latine</hi> book, as doth evidently enough ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the rudenesse of their stile, which is fitter for a Chimney-sweeper, or for a Cook or a Scullion, then for a Jurisconsult and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in the Lawes.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, seeing the Lawes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpted out of the middle of moral and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philosophie, how should these fooles have understood it, that have by G—studied lesse in Philosophie then my Mule? in respect of humane learning, and the knowledge of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities and History, they were truly laden with those faculties as a toad is with fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and yet of all this the Lawes are so full, that without it they cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, as I intend more fully to shew unto you in a peculiar Treatise, which on that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:29535:40"/>
I am about to publish. Therefore if you will that I take any medling in this pro-: cesse; first, cause all these papers to be burnt: secondly, make the two Gentlemen come personally before me; and afterwards, when I shall have heard them, I will tell you my opinion freely without any feignednes or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation whatsoever.</p>
            <p>Some amongst them did contradict this motion, as you know that in all companies there are more fooles then wise men, and that the greater part alwayes surmounts the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as saith <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> in speaking of the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> but the foresaid <hi>Du Douet</hi> held the contrary opinion, maintaining that <hi>Pantagruel</hi> had said well, and what was right, in affirming that these records, bills of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, replies, rejoinders, exceptions, depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, and other such diableries of truth-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling Writs, were but Engines where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to overthrow justice, and unnecessarily to prolong such suits as did depend before them; and that therefore the devil would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them all away to hell, if they did not take another course, and proceeded not in times coming according to the Prescripts of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical and Philosophical equity. In fine, all the papers were burnt, and the two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men summoned and personally convented; at whose appearance before the Court, <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> said unto them, Are you they that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:29535:41"/>
have this great difference betwixt you? Yes, (my Lord) said they: Which of you (said <hi>Pantagruel,</hi>) is the Plaintiffe? It is I, said <hi>my Lord Kissebreech:</hi> Go to then, my friend, (said he) and relate your matter unto me from point to point, according to the real truth, or else (by cocks body) if I finde you to lie so much as in one word, I will make you shorter by the head, and take it from off your shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to shew others by your example, that in justice and judgement men ought to speak nothing but the truth; therefore take heed you do not adde nor impare any thing in the Narration of your case. <hi>Begin.</hi>

and a halfpeny, forasmuch as the <hi>Riphaean</hi> mountaines had been that yeare opprest with a great sterility of counterfeit gudgions, and shewes without substance, by meanes of the babling tattle, and fond fibs, seditiously rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed between the gibblegablers, and <hi>Accursian</hi> gibberish-mongers, for the rebellion of the <hi>Swissers,</hi> who had assembled themselves to the full number of the bum-bees, and myrmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, to go a handsel-getting on the first day of the new yeare, at that very time when they give brewis to the oxen, and deliver the key of the coales to the Countrey-girles, for serving in of the oates to the dogs. All the night long they did nothing else (keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hands still upon the pot) but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch both on foot and horseback, leaden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sealed Writs or letters, (to wit, Papal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions commonly called Bulls,) to stop the boats: for the Tailors and Seamsters would have made of the stollen shreds and clippings a goodly sagbut to cover the face of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, which then was great with childe of a potfull of cabbidge, according to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the hay-bundle-makers: but the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians said, that by the Urine they could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern no manifest signe of the Bustards pace, nor how to eat double-tongued mattocks with mustard, unlesse the Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Court should be pleased to give by <hi>B. mol</hi> expresse command to the pox, not

            <p>Ha (<hi>my Masters,</hi>) God moderates all things, and disposeth of them at his pleasure, so that against unluckie fortune a Carter broke his frisking whip, which was all the winde-instrument he had: this was done at his return from the little paultry town, even then when Master <hi>Amitus of Cresseplots</hi> was licentiated, and had past his degrees in all dullerie and blockishnesse, according to this sentence of the Canonists, <hi>Beati Dunces, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam ipsi stumblaverunt.</hi> But that which makes lent to be so high, by St. <hi>Fiacre</hi> of <hi>Bry,</hi> is for nothing else, but that the <hi>Pentecost</hi> never comes, but to my cost; yet <hi>on afore there hoe,</hi> a little rain stills a great winde, and we must think so, seeing that the Serjeant hath propounded the matter so farre above my reach, that the Clerks and Secondaries could not with the benefit thereof lick their fingers feathered with gaunders, so orbicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, as they were wont in other things to do. And we do manifestly see, that every one acknowledgeth himself to be in the errour, wherewith another hath been charged, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving

only those cases whereby we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to take an ocular inspection in a perspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive glasse of these things, towards the place in the Chimney, where hangeth the signe of the wine of fourty girths, which have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes accounted very necessary for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of twenty pannels and pack-saddles of the bankrupt Protectionaries of five yeares respit; howsoever at least he that would not let flie the fowle before the Cheesecakes, ought in law to have discovered his reason why not, for the memory is often lost with a wayward shooing: Well, God keep <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald Mit ain</hi> from all danger.

Now then (<hi>my Lord</hi>) said <hi>Kisse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breech,</hi> the foresaid good woman, saying her <hi>gaudez and audinos,</hi> could not cover her selfe with a treacherous backblow, ascending by the wounds and passions of the priviledges of the Universitie: unlesse by the vertue of a warming-pan she had Angelically fomented every part of her body, in covering them with a hedge of garden-beds: then giving in a swift unavoidable thirst very near to the place where they sell the old rags, whereof the Painters of <hi>Flanders</hi> make great use, when they are about neatly to clap on shoes on grashop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, locusts, <hi>cigals,</hi> and such like flie-fowles,

            <p>and good Lady, how many great Captaines have we seen in the day of battel, when in open field the Sacrament was distributed in lunchions of the sanctified bread of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraternity, the more honestly to nod their heads, play on the lute, and crack with their tailes, to make pretty little platforme leaps, in keeping level by the ground: but now the world is unshackled from the corners of the packs of <hi>Leycester.</hi> One flies out lewdly and becomes debauch't, another likewise five, four and two, and that at such randome, that if the Court take not some course therein, it will make as bad a season in matter of glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this yeare, as ever it made, or it will make goblets. If any poor creature go to the stoves to illuminate his muzzle with a

O companion, if I could mount up as well as I can get down, I had been long ere this above the sphere of the Moon with <hi>Empedocles.</hi> But I cannot tell what a devil this meanes. This wine is so
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:29535:51"/>
good and delicious, that the more I drink thereof, the more I am athirst; I beleeve that the shadow of my Master <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> engendereth the altered and thirsty men, as the Moon doth the catarres and defluxions; at which word the company began to laugh: which <hi>Pantagruel</hi> perceiving, said, <hi>Panurge</hi> What is that which moves you to laugh so? Sir, said he, I was telling them that these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villish Turks are very unhappy, in that they never drink one drop of wine, and that though there were no other harme in all <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homets Alcoran,</hi> yet for this one base point of abstinence from wine, which therein is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, I would not submit my self unto their law. But now tell me, (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) how you escaped out of their hands. By G—Sir (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) I will not lie to you in one word.</p>
            <p>The rascally <hi>Turks</hi> had broached me upon a spit all larded like a rabbet, (for I was so dry and meagre, that otherwise of my flesh they would have made but very bad meat) and in this manner began to rost me alive. As they were thus roasting me, I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended my self unto the divine grace, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in my minde the good St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> and alwayes hoped in God that he would deliver me out of this torment, which came to passe, and that very strangely; for as I did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my self with all my heart unto God,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:29535:52"/>
crying, Lord God help me, Lord God save me, Lord God take me out of this pain and hellish torture, wherein these traiterous dogs detain me for my sincerity in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of thy law: the roster or turn-spit fell asleep by the divine will, or else by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of some good <hi>Mercury,</hi> who cunningly brought <hi>Argus</hi> into a sleep for all his hundred eyes: when I saw that he did no longer turne me in roasting, I looked upon him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that he was fast asleep, then took I up in my teeth a firebrand by the end where it was not burnt, and cast it into the lap of my roaster, and another did I throw as well as I could under a field-couche, that was placed near to the chimney, wherein was the straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of my Master turnspit; presently the fire took hold in the straw, and from the straw to the bed, and from the bed to the loft, which was planked and seeled with firre, after the fashion of the foot of a lamp: but the best was, that the fire which I had cast into the lap of my paultry roaster, burnt all his groine, and was beginning to cease upon his cullions, when he became sensible of the danger, for his smelling was not so bad, but that he felt it sooner then he could have seen day-light: then suddenly getting up, and in a great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement running to the window, he cried out to the streets as high as he could, <hi>dalbaroth, dalbaroth, dalbaroth,</hi> which is as much to say
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:29535:52"/>
as, <hi>Fire, fire, fire:</hi> incontinently turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, he came streight towards me, to throw me quite into the fire, and to that effect had already cut the ropes, wherewith my hands were tied, and was undoing the cords from off my feet; when the Master of the house hearing him cry, Fire, and smelling the smoke from the very street where he was walking with some other <hi>Baashaws</hi> and <hi>Mustaphaes,</hi> ran with all the speed he had to save what he could, and to carry away his Jewels; yet such was his rage (before he could well resolve how to go about it,) that he caught the broach whereon I was spitted, and therewith killed my roaster stark dead, of which wound he died there for want of government or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise; for he ran him in with the spit a little above the navel, towards the right flank, till he pierced the third lappet of his liver, and the blow flanting upwards from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe or <hi>diaphragme,</hi> through which it had made penetration, the spit past athwart the <hi>pericardium,</hi> or capsule of his heart, and came out above at his shoulders, betwixt the <hi>spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyls</hi> or turning joints of the chine of the back, and the left <hi>homoplat,</hi> which we call the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-blade.</p>
            <p>True it is, (for I will not lie,) that in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the spit out of my body, I fell to the ground near unto the Andirons, and so by the fall took some hurt, which indeed had
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:29535:53"/>
been greater, but that the <hi>lardons,</hi> or little sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of bacon, wherewith I was stuck, kept off the blow. My <hi>Baashaw</hi> then seeing the case to be desperate, his house burnt without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and all his goods lost, gave himselfe over unto all the devils in hell, calling upon some of them by their names, <hi>Gringoth, Asta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roth, Rappalus,</hi> and <hi>Gribouillis,</hi> nine several times, which when <hi>I</hi> saw, <hi>I</hi> had above six pence worth of feare, dreading that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils would come even then to carry away this foole, and seeing me so near him would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps snatch me up too: <hi>I</hi> am already (thought <hi>I</hi>) halfe rosted, and my lardons, will be the cause of my mischief; for these devils are very lickorous of lardons, according to the authority which you have of the Philosopher <hi>Iamblicus</hi> and <hi>Murmault,</hi> in the Apology of <hi>Bossuris,</hi> adulterated <hi>pro magistros nostros:</hi> but for my better security <hi>I</hi> made the signe of the Crosse; crying, <hi>Hag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:29535:53"/>
thou dost here but trifle away thy time, or rashly lose it, for thou wilt never kill thy self thus as thou doest: well thou mayest hurt or bruise somewhat within thee, so as to make thee languish all thy life-time most pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully amongst the hands of the Chirurgions; but if thou wilt be counselled by me, I will kill thee clear out-right, so that thou shalt not so much as feel it, and trust me, for I have killed a great many others, who have found themselves very well after it: Ha, my friend, said he, I prethee do so, and for thy paines I will give thee my Codpiece, take, here it is, there are six hundred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Seraphs in it, and some fine Diamonds, and most excellent Rubies. And where are they (said <hi>Episte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon?</hi>) By St. <hi>Iohn</hi> (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) they are a good way hence, if they alwayes keep going<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but where is the last yeares snow? this was the greatest care that <hi>Villon</hi> the <hi>Parisien</hi> Poet took. Make an end (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) that we may know how thou didst dresse thy <hi>Baashaw:</hi> By the faith of an honest man (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) I do not lie in one word, <hi>I</hi> swadled him in a scurvie swathel-binding, which I found lying there half burnt, and with my cords tied him royster-like both hand and foot, in such sort that he was not able to winse; then past my spit thorough his throat, and hanged him thereon, fastening the end thereof at two great hooks of cramp-irons, upon which they
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:29535:54"/>
did hang their Halberds; and then kindling a faire fire under him, did flame you up my <hi>Milourt,</hi> as they use to do dry herrings in a chimney: with this, taking his budget, and a little javelin that was upon the foresaid hooks, <hi>I</hi> ran away a faire gallop-rake, and God he knows how <hi>I</hi> did smell my shoulder of mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</p>
            <p>When <hi>I</hi> was come down into the street, <hi>I</hi> found every body come to put out the fire with store of water, and seeing me so halfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roasted, they did naturally pity my case, and threw all their water upon me, which by a most joyful refreshing of me, did me very much good: then did they present me with some victuals, but <hi>I</hi> could not eat much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they gave me nothing to drink but wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter after their fashion. Other hurt they did me none, only one little villainous <hi>Turkie</hi> knobbreasted rogue, came thiefteously to snatch away some of my lardons, but <hi>I</hi> gave him such a sturdie thump and sound rap on the fingers, with all the weight of my jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, that he came no more the second time. Shortly after this, there came towards me a pretty young <hi>Corinthian</hi> wench, who brought me a box full of Conserves, of round <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolan</hi> plums, called <hi>Emblicks,</hi> and looked upon my poor <hi>Robin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> with an eye of great compassion, as it was flea-bitten and pinked with the sparkles of the fire from whence it
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:29535:54"/>
came, for it reached no further in length, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve me) then my knees; but note, that this roasting cured me entirely of a Sciatick, whereunto <hi>I</hi> had been subject above seven yeares before, upon that side, which my roast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by falling asleep, suffered to be burnt.</p>
            <p>Now whilest they were thus busie about me, the fire triumphed, never ask, How? for it took hold on above two thousand houses, which one of them espying, cried out, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, By <hi>Mahooms</hi> belly all the City is on fire, and we do neverthelesse stand gazing here, without offering to make any relief: upon this every one ran to save his own; for my part, <hi>I</hi> took my way towards the gate. When <hi>I</hi> was got upon the knap of a little hillock, not farre off, <hi>I</hi> turned me about as did <hi>Lots</hi> wife, and looking back, saw all the City burning in a faire fire, whereat <hi>I</hi> was so glad, that <hi>I</hi> had almost beshit my selfe for joy: but God punished me well for it: How? said <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel:</hi> Thus, said <hi>Panurge;</hi> for when with pleasure <hi>I</hi> beheld this jolly fire, jesting with my self, and saying, Ha poor flies, ha poor mice, you will have a bad winter of it this yeare, the fire is in your reeks, it is in your bed-straw, out came more then six, yea more then thirteen hundred and eleven dogs great and small, altogether out of the town, flying away from the fire; at the first approach they ran all upon me, being carried on by the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:29535:55"/>
sent of my leacherous half-roasted flesh, and had even then devoured me in a trice, if my good Angel had not well inspired me with the instruction of a remedy, very sovereign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the tooth-ache. And wherefore (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) wert thou afraid of the tooth-ache, or paine of the teeth? wert thou not cured of thy Rheumes? By Palme-sunday, (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) is there any greater pain of the teeth, then when the dogs have you by the legs? but on a sudden, (as my good Angel directed me) <hi>I</hi> thought upon my lardons, and threw them into the midst of the field a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them: then did the dogs run, and fight with one another at faire teeth, which should have the lardons: by this means they left me, and <hi>I</hi> left them also bustling with, and hairing one another. Thus did <hi>I</hi> escape frolick and lively, grammercie roastmeat and cookery.</p>

               <hi>PAntagruel</hi> one day to refresh himself of his study, went a walking towards St. <hi>Marcels</hi> suburbs, to see the extravagancie
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:29535:55"/>
of the <hi>Gobeline</hi> building, and to taste of their spiced bread. <hi>Panurge</hi> was with him, having alwayes a flaggon under his gown, and a good slice of a gammon of bacon; for without this he never went, saying, that it was as a Yeoman of the guard to him, to preserve his body from harme, other sword carried he none: and when <hi>Pantagruel</hi> would have given him one, he answered, that he needed none, for that it would but heat his milt. Yea but (said <hi>Epistemon</hi>) if thou shouldest be set upon, how wouldest thou defend thy self? With great <hi>buskinades</hi> or brodkin blowes, answered he, provided thursts were forbidden. At their return, <hi>Panurge</hi> considered the walls of the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> and in derision said to <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel,</hi> See what faire walls here are! O how strong they are, and well fitted to keep geese in a mue or coop to fatten them! by my beard they are competently scurvie for such a City as this is; for a Cow with one fart would go near to overthrow above six fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms of them. O my friend (said <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi>) doest thou know what <hi>Agesilaus</hi> said, when he was asked, Why the great City of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> was not inclosed with walls? Lo here (said he) the walls of the City, in shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the inhabitants and Citizens there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, so strong, so well armed, and so expert in military discipline; signifying thereby, that there is no wall but of bones; and that Towns
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:29535:56"/>
and Cities cannot have a surer wall, nor bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fortification then the prowesse and vertue of the Citizens and Inhabitants; so is this City so strong, by the great number of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like people that are in it, that they care not for making any other walls. Besides, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever would go about to wall it, as <hi>Strasbourg, Orleans</hi> or <hi>Ferrara,</hi> would finde it almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, the cost and charges would be so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive. Yea, but (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) it is good neverthelesse to have an out-side of stone, when we are invaded by our enemies, were it but to ask, Who is below there? As for the enormous expence, which you say would be needful for undertaking the great work of walling this City about, if the Gentlemen of the Town will be pleased to give me a good rough cup of wine, I will shew them a pretty, strange and new way how they may build them good cheap. How (said <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel?</hi>) Do not speak of it then (answered <hi>Panurge,</hi>) and I will tell it you. I see that the <hi>sine quo nons, killibistris,</hi> or <hi>contrapunctums</hi> of the women of this Countrey, are better cheap then stones: of them should the walls be built, ranging them in good symmetrie by the rules of Architecture, and placing the largest in the first ranks, then sloping down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ridgewayes, like the back of an Asse, the middle sized ones must be ranked next, and last of all the least and smallest. This
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:29535:56"/>
done, there must be a fine little interlacing of them, like points of Diamonds, as is to be seen in the grear Tower of <hi>Bourges,</hi> with a like number of the <hi>nudinnudo's, nilnisistando's,</hi> and stiffe <hi>bracmards,</hi> that dwell in amongst the claustral Codpieces. What devil were able to overthrow such walls? there is no metal like it to resist blowes, in so farre that if Culverin-shot should come to grease upon it, you would incontinently see distill from thence the blessed fruit of the great pox, as small as raine: beware in the name of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and hold off; furthermore, no thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt or lightning would fall upon it, for why? they are all either blest or consecrated: I see but one inconveniency in it: Ho, ho, ha, ha, ha, (said <hi>Pantagruel,</hi>) and what is that? It is that the flies would be so lickorish of them, that you would wonder, and would quickly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there together, and there leave their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and excretions, and so all the work would be spoiled. But see how that might be remedied, they must be wiped and made rid of the flies with faire fox-tailes, or good great <hi>viedazes</hi> (which are Asse-pizzles) of <hi>Provence.</hi> And to this purpose I will tell you (as we go to supper,) a brave example set down by <hi>Frater Lubinus libro de compotationi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus mendicantium;</hi> in the time that the beasts did speak, which is not yet three dayes since.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:29535:57"/>A poor Lion, walking through the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of <hi>Bieure,</hi> and saying his own little pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate devotions, past under a tree, where there was a roguish Collier gotten up to cut down wood, who seeing the Lion, cast his hatchet at him, and wounded him enormously in one of his legs, whereupon the Lion halting, he so long toiled and turmoiled himself in roam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down the forrest to finde helpe, that at last he met with a Carpenter, who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly look't upon his wound, cleansed it as well as he could, and filled it with mosse, telling him that he must wipe his wound well, that the flies might not do their excrements in it, whilest he should go search for some yarrow or millefoile, commonly called the Carpenters herbe. The Lion being thus heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, walked along in the forrest, at what time a sempiternous Crone and old Hag, was pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, and gathering some sticks in the said forrest, whoseeing the Lion coming towards her, for feare fell down backwards, in such sort, that the winde blew up her gown, coats and smock even as farre as above her shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; which the Lion perceiving, for pity ran to see whether she had taken any hurt by the fall, and thereupon considering her <hi>how do you call it,</hi> said, O poor woman, who hath thus wounded thee? which words when he had spoken, he espied a fox, whom he called to come to him, saying, <hi>Gossip Renard,</hi> hau, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:29535:57"/>
hither, and for cause: when the fox was come, he said unto him, My gossip and friend, they have hurt this good woman here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the legs most villainously, and there is a manifest solution of continuity, see how great a wound it is, even from the taile up to the navel, in measure foure, nay full five handfulls and a half; this is the blow of an hatchet, I doubt me it is an old wound, and therefore that the flies may not get into it, wipe it lustily well and hard; I prethy, both within and without; thou hast a good taile and long, wipe, my friend, wipe, I beseech thee, and in the mean while I will go get some mosse to put into it; for thus ought we to succour and help one another, wipe it hard, thus, my friend, wipe it well, for this wound must be often wiped, otherwise the Party cannot be at ease: go to, wipe well, my little gossip, wipe, God hath furnished thee with a taile, thou hast a long one, and of a bignesse proportionable, wipe hard and be not weary. A good <hi>wiper,</hi> who in <hi>wiping</hi> continually, <hi>wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth</hi> with his <hi>wipard,</hi> by wasps shall never be wounded: wipe, my pretty minion, wipe, my little bullie, <hi>I</hi> will not stay long. Then went he to get store of mosse; and when he was a little way off, he cried out in speaking to the fox thus, Wipe well still, gossip, wipe, and let it never grieve thee to wipe well, my little gossip, <hi>I</hi> will put thee into service to be wiper
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:29535:58"/>
to <hi>Don Pedro de Castille,</hi> wipe, only wipe, and no more: the poor fox wiped as hard as he could, here and there, within and withou: but the false old trot did so fizzle and fist, that she stunk like a hundred devils, which put the poor fox to a great de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l of ill ease, for he knew not to what side to turn himself, to escape the unsavoury perfume of this old womans po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern blasts, and whilest to that effect he was shifting hither and thither, without knowing how to shun the annoyance of those unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som gusts, he saw that behinde there was yet another hole, not so great as that which he did wipe, out of which came this filthy and infectious aire. The Lion at last return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, bringing with him of mosse more then eighteen packs would hold, and began to put into the wound, with a staffe that which he had provided for that purpose, and had already put in full sixteen packs and a half, at which he was amazed: What a devil? (said he) this wound is very deep, it would hold above two cart-loads of mosse. The fox perceiving this, said unto the Lion, O gossip Lion, my friend, I pray thee do not put in all thy mosse there, keep somewhat; for there is yet here ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther little hole, that stinks like five hundred devils; I am almost choaked with the smell thereof, it is so pestiferous and impoison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Thus must these walls be kept from the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:29535:58"/>
flies, and wages allowed to some for wiping of them. Then said <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> How dost thou know that the privy parts of women are at such a cheap rate? for in this City there are many vertuous, honest and chaste women besides the maids: <hi>Et ubi prenus,</hi> said <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge?</hi> I will give you my opinion of it, and that upon certain and assured knowledge. I do not brag that I have bumbasted four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and seventeen, since I came into this City, though it be but nine dayes ago: but this very morning I met with a good fellow, who in a wallet, such as <hi>Aesops</hi> was, carried two little girles of two or three yeares old at the most, one before, and the other behinde: he demanded almes of me, but <hi>I</hi> made him answer, that <hi>I</hi> had more cods then pence; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>I</hi> asked him, <hi>Good man,</hi> these two girles are they maids? Brother, said he, <hi>I</hi> have carried them thus these two yeares, and in regard of her that is before, whom <hi>I</hi> see continually, in my opinion she is a Virgin, neverthelesse <hi>I</hi> will not put my finger in the fire for it; as for her that is behinde, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse I can say nothing. Indeed (said <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi>) thou art a gentile companion, <hi>I</hi> will have thee to be apparelled in my livery, and therefore caused him to be clothed most gallantly according to the fashion that then was, only that <hi>Panurge</hi> would have the Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of his breeches three foot long, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:29535:59"/>
shape square, not round, which was done and was well worth the seeing. Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times was he wont to say that the world had not yet known the emolument and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility that is in wearing great Codpieces; but time would one day teach it them, as all things have been invented in time. God keep from hurt (said he) the good fellow whose long Codpiece or Braguet hath saved his life: God keep from hurt him, whose long Braguet hath been worth to him in one day, one hundred threescore thousand and nine Crowns: God keep from hurt him, who by his long Braguet hath saved a whole City from dying by famine. And by G—I will make a book of the commodity of long Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guets, when I shall have more leasure. And indeed he composed a faire great book with figures, but it is not printed as yet that I know of.</p>

old or thereabouts, fine to gild like a leaden dagger; for he was a notable cheater and cony-catcher, he was a very gallant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per man of his person, only that he was a little leacherous, and naturally subject to a kinde of disease, which at that time they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led lack of money: it is an incomparable grief, yet notwithstanding he had chreescore and three tricks to come by it at his need, of which the most honourable and most ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary was in manner of thieving, secret pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loining and filching; for he was a wicked lewd rogue, a cosener, drinker, royster, ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and a very dissolute and debautch'd fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, if there were any in <hi>Paris;</hi> otherwise, and in all matters else, the best and most ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous man in the world: and he was still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving some plot, and devising mischief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Serjeants and the watch.</p>
            <p>At one time he assembled three or foure especial good hacksters and roaring boyes, made them in the evening drink like <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plers,</hi> afterwards led them till they came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der St. <hi>Genevieve,</hi> or about the Colledge of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and at the houre that the watch was coming up that way, which he knew by putting his sword upon the pavement, and his eare by it, and when he heard his sword shake, it was an infallible signe that the watch was near at that instant: then he and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anions took a tumbrel or dung-cart, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:29535:60"/>
gave it the brangle, hurling it with all their force down the hill, and so overthrew all the poor watchmen like pigs, and then ran away upon the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>side; for in lesse then two dayes, he knew all the streets, lanes and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in <hi>Paris,</hi> as well as his <hi>Deus det.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At another time he made in some faire place, where the said watch was to passe, a traine of gun-powder, and at the very instant, that they went along, set fire to it, and then made himself sport to see what good grace they had in running away, thinking that St. <hi>Antonies</hi> fire had caught them by the legs. As for the poor Masters of Arts, he did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute them above all others: when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered with any of them upon the street, he would not never faile to put some trick or other upon them, sometimes putting the bit of a fried turd in their graduate hoods: At o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times pinning on little fox-tails, or hares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eares behinde them, or some such other ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish prank. One day that they were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all to meet in the <hi>fodder-street,</hi> he made a <hi>Borbonnesa</hi> tart, or filthy and slovenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, made of store of garlick, of <hi>Assa foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida,</hi> of <hi>Castoreum,</hi> of dogs turds very warm, which he steeped, temper'd and liquifi'd in the corrupt matter of pockie biles, and pestife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous botches, and very early in the morning, therewith anointed all the pavement, in such sort, that the devil could not have endured it,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:29535:60"/>
which made all these good people, there to lay up their gorges, and vomit what was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their stomacks before all the world, as if they had flayed the fox; and ten or twelve of them died of the plague, fourteen became lepers, eighteen grew lousie, and above seven and twenty had the pox but he did not care a button for it. He commonly carried a whip under his gowne wherewith he whipt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remission the pages, whom he found car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying wine to their Masters, to make them mend their pace. In his coat he had above six and twenty little fabs and pockets alwayes full, one with some lead-water, and a little knife as sharp as a glovers needle, wherewith he used to cut purses: Another with some kinde of bitter stuffe, which he threw into the eyes of those he met: another with clotburrs, penned with little geese or capons feathers, which he cast upon the gowns and caps of honest people: and often made them faire hornes, which they wore about all the City, sometimes all their life. Very often also up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the womens <hi>French</hi> hoods would he stick in the hind-part somewhat made in the shape of a mans member. In another he had a great many little hornes full of fleas and lice, which he borrowed from the beggars of St. <hi>Innocent,</hi> and cast them with small canes or quills to write with, into the necks of the daintiest Gentlewomen that he could finde,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:29535:61"/>
yea even in the Church, for he never seated himself above in the quire, but alwayes sate in the body of the Church amongst the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, both at Masse, at Vespres, and at Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. In another, he used to have good store of hooks and buckles, wherewlth he would couple men and women together, that sate in company close to one another, but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly those that wore gownes of crimson taf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faties, that when they were about to go away, they might rent all their gownes. In another, he had a squib furnished with tinder, matches, stones to strike fire, and all other tackling necessary for it: in another, two or three burning glasses, wherewith he made both men and women sometimes mad, and in the Church put them quite out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; for he said that there was but an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistrophe,</hi> or little more difference then of a literal inversion between a woman, <hi>folle a la messe,</hi> and <hi>molle a la fesse;</hi> that is, <hi>foolish at the Masse,</hi> and <hi>of a pliant buttock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In another he had a good deal of needles and thread, wherewith he did a thousand little devillish pranks. One time at the entry of the Palace unto the great Hall, where a certain gray Friar or <hi>Cordelier</hi> was to say Masse to the Counsellors: He did help to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel him, and put on his vestments, but in the accoutring of him, he sowed on his alb, surplice or stole to his gowne and shirt, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:29535:61"/>
then withdrew himself, when the said Lords of the Court, or Counsellors came to heare the said Masse; but when it came to the <hi>Ite, missa est,</hi> that the poor <hi>Frater</hi> would have laid by his <hi>stole</hi> or surplice (as the fashion then was) he plucked off withal both his frock and shirt which were well sowed together, and therby stripping himself up to the very shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, shewed his <hi>bel vedere</hi> to all the world, together with his <hi>Don Cypriano,</hi> which was no small one, as you may imagine: and the Friar still kept haling, but so much the more did he discover himself, and lay open his back-parts, till one of the Lords of the Court said, How now, what's the matter? will this faire Father make us here an offering of his taile to kisse it? nay, St. <hi>Antonies</hi> fire kisse it for us. From thenceforth it was ordained that the poor Fathers should never disrobe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves any more before the world, but in their vestry-room, or sextry, as they call it; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the presence of women, lest it should tempt them to the sin of longing, and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate desire. The people then asked, why it was the Friars had so long and large genito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? the said <hi>Panurge</hi> resolved the <hi>Probleme</hi> very neatly, saying, That which makes Asses to have such great eares, is that their dams did put no biggins on their heads, as <hi>Alliac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> mentioneth in his <hi>suppositions:</hi> by the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that which makes the genitories or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration-tooles
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:29535:62"/>
of those faire <hi>Fraters</hi> so long is, for that they ware no bottomed breech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and therefore their jolly member having no impediment, hangeth dangling at liberty, as farre as it can reach, with a wigle-wagle down to their knees, as women carry their <hi>patinotre</hi> beads: and the cause wherefore they have it so correspondently great, is, that in this constant wig-wagging the humours of the body descend into the said member: for according to the <hi>Legists,</hi> Agitation and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual motion is cause of attraction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> he had another pocket full of itching powder, called <hi>stone-allum,</hi> whereof he would cast some into the backs of those women, whom he judged to be most beautiful and stately, which did so ticklishly gall them, that some would strip themselves in the open view of the world, and others dance like a cock upon hot embers, or a drumstick on a taber: others again ran about the streets, and he would run after them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to such as were in the stripping veine, he would very civilly come to offer his attendance, and cover them with his cloak, like a courteous and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gracious man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> in another he had a little leather bottle full of old oile, wherewith, when he saw any man or woman in a rich new hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some suit, he would grease, smutch and spoil all the best parts of it under colour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:29535:62"/>
of touching them, saying, This is good cloth, this is good sattin, good taffaties; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> God give you all that your noble heart desireth; you have a new suit, <hi>pretty Sir;</hi> and you a new gown, <hi>sweet Mistris,</hi> God give you joy of it, and maintain you in all prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and with this would lay his hand upon their shoulder, at which touch such a villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous spot was left behinde, so enormously engraven to perpetuity in the very soule, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and reputation, that the devil himself could never have taken it away: Then upon his departing, he would say, <hi>Madam,</hi> take heed you do not fall, for there is a filthy great hole before you, whereinto if you put your foot, you will quite spoile your self. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had all full of <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> very fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pulverised, in that powder did he lay a faire handkerchief curiously wrought, which he had stollen from a pretty Seamstresse of the Palace, in taking away a lowse from off her bosome, which he had put there himself: and when he came into the company of some good Ladies, he would trifle them into a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of some fine workmanship of bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, then immediately put his hand into their bosome, asking them, And this work, is it of <hi>Flanders,</hi> or of <hi>Hainault?</hi> and then drew out his handkerchief, and said, Hold, hold, look what work here is, it is of <hi>Foutiman</hi> or of <hi>Fout arabia:</hi> and shaking it hard at their nose,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:29535:63"/>
made them sneeze for foure houres without ceasing: in the mean while he would fart like a horse, and the women would laugh and say, How now, do you fart, <hi>Panurge?</hi> No, no, <hi>Madam</hi> (said he,) I do but tune my taile to the plain song of the Musick, which you make with your nose. In another he had a picklock, a pellican, a crampiron, a crook, and some other iron tooles, wherewith there was no door nor coffer which he would nor pick open. He had another full of little cups, wherewith he played very artificially, for he had his fingers made to his hand, like those of <hi>Minerva</hi> or <hi>Arachne,</hi> and had here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore cried <hi>Triacle.</hi> And when he changed a teston, cardecu, or any other piece of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, the changer had been more subtil then a fox, if <hi>Panurge</hi> had not at every time made five or six sols, (that is some six or seven pence) vanish away invisibly, openly and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly, without making any hurt or lesion, whereof the changer should have felt nothing but the winde.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> How <hi>Panurge</hi> gained the pardons, and married the old women, and of the suit in law which he had at <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ONe day I found <hi>Panurge</hi> very much out of countenance, melancholick and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, which made me suspect that he had no money; whereupon I said unto him, <hi>Panurge,</hi> you are sick, as I do very well perceive by your physiognomie, and I know the disease, you have a flux in your purse; but take no care I have yet seven pence half penny, that never saw father nor mother, which shall not be wanting, no more then the pox in your necessity: whereunto he answered me, Well, well, for money, one day <hi>I</hi> shall have but too much; for I have a Philosophers stone, which attracts money out of mens purses, as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant doth iron; but will you go with me to gaine the pardons, said he? By my faith (said he) I am no great pardon-taker in this world; if <hi>I</hi> shall be any such in the other, <hi>I</hi> cannot tell: yet let us go in Gods Name, it is but one farthing more or lesse. But (said he) lend me then a farthing upon interest. No, no, (said I) <hi>I</hi> will give it you freely,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:29535:64"/>
and from my heart, <hi>Grates vobis dominos,</hi> said he.</p>
            <p>So we went along, beginning at St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vase,</hi> and I got the pardons at the first boxe only, for in those matters very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth me: then did I say my small suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the prayers of St. <hi>Brigid,</hi> but he gained them at all the boxes, and alwayes gave money to every one of the <hi>Pardoners;</hi> from thence we went to our <hi>Ladies</hi> Church, to St. <hi>Iohns,</hi> to St. <hi>Antonies,</hi> and so to the other Churches, where there was a banquet of pardons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for my part, I gained no more of them: but he at all the boxes kissed the relicks, and gave at every one: to be brief, when we were returned, he brought me to drink at the Castle-tavern, and there shewed me ten or twelve of his little bags full of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, at which I blest my self, and made the signe of the Crosse, saying, Where have you recovered so much money in so little time? unto which he answered me, that he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it out of the basins of the pardons; For in giving them the first farthing (said he) I put it in with such slight of hand, and so dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terously that it appeared to be a three-pence; thus with one hand I took three-pence, nine-pence or six-pence at the least, and with the other as much, and so thorough all the Churches where we have been. Yea, but (said I) you damn your self like a snake, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:29535:64"/>
are withal a thief and sacrilegious person. True (said he) in your opinion, but I am not of that minde; for the Pardoners do give me it, when they say unto me in presenting the relicks to kisse, <hi>Centuplum accipies,</hi> that is, that for one penny I should take a hundred; for <hi>accipies</hi> is spoken according to the manner of the Hebrewes, who use the future tense in stead of the imperative, as you have in the law, <hi>Diliges Dominum,</hi> that is, <hi>dilige:</hi> even so when the Pardon-bearer sayes to me, <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuplum accipies,</hi> his meaning is, <hi>centuplum ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe;</hi> and so doth <hi>Rabbi Kimy,</hi> and <hi>Rabbi Aben Ezra</hi> expound it, and all the <hi>Massorets, &amp; ibi Bartholus.</hi> Moreover, Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> gave me fifteen hundred francks of yearly pension (which in <hi>English</hi> money is a hundred and fifty pounds) upon his Ecclesiastical revenues and treasure, for having cured him of a canc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>krous botch, which did so torment him, that he thought to have been a Cripple by it all his life. Thus I do pay my self at my owne hand (for otherways I get nothing) upon the said Ecclesiastical treasure. Ho, my friend, (said he) if thou didst know what advantage <hi>I</hi> made, and how well <hi>I</hi> feathered my nest, by the Popes bull of the Croisade, thou wouldest wonder exceedingly. It was worth to me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove six thousand <hi>florins</hi> (in <hi>English</hi> coine six hundred pounds,) and what a devil is become of them? (said <hi>I</hi>) for of that money
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:29535:65"/>
thou hast not one half penny. They returned from whence they came (said he,) they did no mote but change their Master.</p>
            <p>But <hi>I</hi> employed at least three thousand of them (that is, three hundred pounds <hi>English,</hi>) in marrying (not young Virgins; for they finde but too many husbands) but great old sempiternous trots, which had not so much as one tooth in their heads; and that out of the consideration <hi>I</hi> had, that these good old women had very well spent the time of their youth in playing at the close-buttock-game to all commers, serving the foremost first, till no man would have any more dealing with them. And by G—<hi>I</hi> will have their skin-coat shaken once yet before they die; by this meanes, to one I gave a hundred florins, to another six score, to another three hundred, according to that they were infamous, detest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and abominable; for by how much the more horrible and execrable they were, so much the more must I needs have given them, otherwayes the devil would not have jum'd them. Presently I went to some great and fat wood-porters, or such like, and did my self make the match, but before I did shew him the old Hags, <hi>I</hi> made a faire muster to him of the Crownes, saying, Good fellow, see what <hi>I</hi> will give thee, if thou wilt but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to dufle, dinfredaille, or lecher it one good time: then began the poor rogues to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:29535:65"/>
gape like old mules, and I caused to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them a banquet, with drink of the best, and store of spiceries, to put the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in rut and heat of lust. To be short, they occupied all like good soules, only to those that were horribly ugly and ill-favoured, I caused their head to be put within a bag, to hide their face.</p>
            <p>Besides all this, I have lost a great deal in suits of law: And what law-suits couldest thou have? (said I) thou hast neither house norlands. My friend, (said he) the Gentlewomen of this City had found out, by the instigation of the devil of hell, a manner of high-mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bands, and neckerchiefs for women, which did so closely cover their bosomes, that men could no more put their hands under; for they had put the slit behinde, and those neck-cloths were wholly shut before, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the poor sad contemplative lovers were much discontented. Upon a faire <hi>Tuesday,</hi> I presented a Petition to the Court, making my self a Party against the said Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and shewing the great interest that I pretended therein, protesting that by the same reason, <hi>I</hi> would cause the Codpeece of my breeches to be sowed behinde, if the Cour would not take order for it. In summe, the Gentlewomen put in their defences, shewed the grounds they went upon, and constituted their Atturney for the prosecuting of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:29535:66"/>
cause, but <hi>I</hi> pursued them so vigorously, that by a sentence of the Court it was decreed, those high neckclothes should be no longer worne, if they were not a little cleft and open before, but it cost me a good summe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. <hi>I</hi> had another very filthy and beastly processe against the dung-farmer (called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Fifi</hi>) and his Deputies, that they should no more reade privily the pipe, punchon, nor quart of sentences, but in faire full day, and that in the fodder schools, in face of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Sophisters, where <hi>I</hi> was ordained to pay the charges, by reason of some clause mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in the relation of the Serjeant. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time <hi>I</hi> framed a complaint to the Court, against the mules of the Presidents, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors and others, tending to this purpose, that when in the lower Court of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, they left them to champ on their bridles: some bibs were made for them, that with their drivelling they might not spoile the pavement, to the end, that the Pages of the Palace might play upon it with their dice, or at the game of coxbody, at their own ease, without spoiling their breeches at the knees; and for this <hi>I</hi> had a faire decree, but it cost me deare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now reckon up what expence <hi>I</hi> was at in little banquets, which from day to day <hi>I</hi> made to the Pages of the Palace, and to what end, said <hi>I?</hi> My friend (said he) thou hast no
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:29535:66"/>
passe-time at all in this world, <hi>I</hi> have more then the King, and if thou wilt joyne thy selfe with me, we will do the devil toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. No, no, (said <hi>I</hi>) by St. <hi>Adauras</hi> that will <hi>I</hi> not, for thou wilt be hanged one time or another: And thou (said he) wilt be interred somtime or other; now which is most honourable, the aire or the earth? Ho, grosse pecore, whilest the Pages are at their banqueting, <hi>I</hi> keep their mules, and to some one <hi>I</hi> cut the stirrup-leather of the mounting side, till it hang but by a thin strap or thread, that when the great puffe-guts of the Counsellor or some other hath taken his swing to get up, he may fall flat on his side like a pork, and so furnish the Spectators with more then a hundred francks worth of laughter. But <hi>I</hi> laugh yet further, to think how at his home-coming the Master-page is to be whipt like green rie, which makes me not to repent what I have bestowed in feasting them. In brief, he had (as <hi>I</hi> said before) threescore and three wayes to acquire mony, but he had two hundred and fourteen to spend it, besides his drinking.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IN that same time, a certain learned man, named <hi>Thaumast,</hi> hearing the fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown of <hi>Pantagruels</hi> incomparable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, came out of his own countrey of <hi>England,</hi> with an intent only to see him, to try thereby, and prove, whether his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in effect was so great as it was reported to be. In this resolution, being arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> he went forthwith unto the house of the said <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who was lodged in the Palace of St. <hi>Denys,</hi> and was then walking in the garden thereof with <hi>Panurge,</hi> philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing after the fashion of the Peripateticks.

Very well, (answered <hi>Panurge</hi>) I pray you talk no more of it, but let me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; is any man so learned as the devils are? No, indeed (said <hi>Pantagruel,</hi>) without Gods especial grace: Yet for all that (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) I have argued against them, gravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and blanked them in disputation, and laid them so squat upon their tailes, that I have
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:29535:70"/>
made them look like Monkies; therefore be assured, that to morrow I will make this vain-glorious <hi>Englishman</hi> to skite vineger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the world. So <hi>Panurge</hi> spent the night with tipling amongst the Pages, and played away all the points of his breeches at <hi>primus secundus,</hi> and at peck point (in <hi>French</hi> called <hi>Lavergette.</hi>) Yet when the condescended on time was come, he failed not to conduct his Master <hi>Pantagruel</hi> to the appointed place, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which (beleeve me) there was neither great nor small in <hi>Paris</hi> but came, thinking with themselves that this devillish <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who had overthrown and vanquished in dispute all these doting fresh-water Sophisters, would now get full payment and be tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to some purpose; for this <hi>Englishman</hi> is a terrible bustler, and horrible coyle keeper, we will see who will be Conquerour, for he never met with his match before.</p>
            <p>Thus all being assembled, <hi>Thaumast</hi> stayed for them, and then when <hi>Pantagruel</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi> came into the Hall, all the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes, Professors of Arts, Senior-Sophisters and Batchelors began to clap their hands, as their scurvie custome is. But <hi>Pantagruel</hi> cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out with a loud voice, as if it had been the sound of a double canon, saying, Peace. with a devil to you, peace: by G—you rogues, if you trouble me here, I will cut off the heads of every one of you: at which words
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:29535:70"/>
they remained all daunted and astonished, like so many ducks, and durst not do so much as cough, although they had swallowed fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen pounds of feathers: withal they grew so dry with this only voice, that they laid out their tongues a full half foot beyond their mouthes, as if <hi>Pantagruel</hi> had salted all their throats. Then began <hi>Panurge</hi> to speak, saying to the <hi>Englishman,</hi> Sir, are you come hither to dispute contentiously in those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions you have set down, or otherwayes but to learn and know the truth? To which answered <hi>Thaumast,</hi> Sir, no other thing brought me hither, but the great desire I had to learn, and to know that of which <hi>I</hi> have doubted all my life long, and have neither found book nor man able to content me in the resolution of those doubts which I have proposed: and as for disputing contentiously, I will not do it, for it is too base a thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore leave it to those sottish <hi>Sophisters,</hi> who in their disputes do not search for the truth, but for contradiction only and debate. Then said <hi>Panurge,</hi> if I who am but a mean and inconsiderable disciple of my Master my Lord <hi>Pantagruel;</hi> content and satisfie you in all and every thing, it were a thing below my said Master, wherewith to trouble him: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it fitter that he be Chair-man, and sit as a Judge and Moderator of our discourse and purpose, and give you satisfaction in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

things, wherein perhaps <hi>I</hi> shall be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your expectation. Truly (said <hi>Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mast</hi>) it is very well said: begin then. Now you must note that <hi>Panurge</hi> had set at the end of his long Codpiece, a pretty tuft of red silk, as also of white, green and blew, and within it had put a faire orange.</p>

            <p>EVery body then taking heed, and heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening with great silence, the <hi>Englishman</hi> lift up on high into the aire his two hands se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally, clunching in all the tops of his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, together after the manner which (<hi>alachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonnese</hi>) they call the hens arse, and struck the one hand on the other by the nailes foure se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times: then he opening them, struck the one with the flat of the other, till it yielded a clashing noise, and that only once: again in joyning them as before he struck twice, and afterwards foure times in opening them; then did he lay them joyned, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the one towards the other, as if he had been devoutly to send up his prayers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. <hi>Panarge</hi> suddenly lifted up in the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:29535:71"/>
aire his right hand, and put the thumb there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of into the nostril of the same side, holding his foure fingers streight out, and closed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly in a parallel line to the point of his nose, shutting the left eye wholly, and making the other wink with a profound depression of the eye-brows and eye-lids. Then lifted he up his left hand, with hard wringing and stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his foure fingers, and elevating his thumb, which he held in a line directly correspondent to the situation of his right hand, with the distance of a cubit and a halfe between them. This done, in the same forme he abased towards the ground, both the one and the other hand; Lastly, he held them in the midst, as aiming right at the <hi>English</hi> mans nose: And if <hi>Mercurie,</hi> said the <hi>English</hi> man: there <hi>Panurge</hi> interrupted him, and said, You have spoken <hi>Mask.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then made the <hi>English</hi> man this signe, his left hand all open he lifted up into the aire, then instantly shut into his fist the foure fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers thereof, and his thumb extended at length he placed upon the gristle of his nose: Presently after, he lifted up his right hand all open, and all open abased and bent it down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, putting the thumb thereof in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place where the little finger of the left hand did close in the fist, and the foure right hand fingers he softly moved in the aire: then contrarily he did with the right hand what he
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:29535:72"/>
had done with the left, and with the left what he had done with the right.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Panurge</hi> being not a whit amazed at this, drew out into the aire his <hi>Trismegist</hi> Codpiece with the left hand, and with his right drew forth a trunchion of a white oxe-rib, and two pieces of wood of a like forme, one of black eben, and the other of incarnation brasil, and put them betwixt the fingers of that hand in good symmetrie: then knocking them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, made such a noise as the Lepers of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanie</hi> use to do with their clappering click<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, yet better resounding, and farre more harmonious; and with his tongue contracted in his mouth, did very merrily warble it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes looking fixedly upon the <hi>English</hi> man. The Divines, Physicians and Chirurgions that were there, thought that by this signe he would have inferred that the <hi>English</hi> man was a Leper: the Counsellors, Lawyers and Decretalists conceived, that by doing this he would have concluded some kinde of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal felicity to consist in Leprosie, as the Lord maintained heretofore,</p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> man for all this was nothing daunted, but holding up his two hands in the aire, kept them in such forme, that he closed the three master-fingers in his fist, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his thumbs thorough his indical, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most and middle fingers, his auricularie or little fingers remained extended and stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:29535:72"/>
out, and so presented he them to <hi>Panurge;</hi> then joyned he them so, that the right thumb touched the left, and the left little finger touched the right. Hereat <hi>Panurge,</hi> without speaking one word, lift up his hands and made this signe.</p>
            <p>He put the naile of the forefinger of his left hand, to the naile of the thumb of the same, making in the middle of the distance as it were a buckle, and of his right hand shut up all the fingers into his fist, except the forefinger which he often thrust in and out through the said two others of the left hand: then stretched he out the forefinger, and middle finger or medical of his right hand, holding them asunder as much as he could, and thrusting them towards <hi>Thaumast.</hi> Then did he put the thumb of his left hand upon the corner of his left eye, stretching out all his hand like the wing of a bird, or the finne of a fish, and moving it very daintily this way and that way, he did as much with his right hand upon the corner of his right eye. <hi>Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mast</hi> began then to waxe somewhat pale, and to tremble, and made him this signe.</p>
            <p>With the middle finger of his right hand, he struck against the muscle of the palme or pulp, which is under the thumb: then put he the forefinger of the right hand in the like buckle of the left, but he put it under and not over, as <hi>Panurge</hi> did. Then <hi>Panurge</hi> knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:29535:73"/>
one hand against another, and blowed in his palme, and put again the forefinger of his right hand into the overture or mouth of the left, pulling it often in and out; then held he out his chinne, most intentively looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Thaumast.</hi> The people there which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood nothing in the other signes, knew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well what therein he demanded (without speaking a word to <hi>Thaumast,</hi>) What do you mean by that? In effect, <hi>Thaumast</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to sweat great drops, and seemed to all the Spectators a man strangely ravished in high contemplation. Then he be thought himself, and put all the nailes of his left hand against those of his right, opening his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as if they had been semicircles, and with this signe lift up his hands as high as he could. Whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi> presently put the thumb of his right hand under his jawes, and the little finger thereof in the mouth of the left hand, and in this posture made his teeth to sound very melodiously, the upper against the lower. With this <hi>Thaumast</hi> with great toile and vexation of spirit rose up, but in rising let a great bakers fart, for the bran came after, and pissing withal very strong vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger, stunk like all the devils in hell: the company began to stop their noses; for he had conskited himself with meer anguish and perplexity. Then lifted he up his right hand, clunching it in such sort, that he brought the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:29535:73"/>
ends of all his fingers to meet together, and his left hand he laid flat upon his breast: whereat <hi>Panurge</hi> drew out his long Codpiece with his tuffe, and stretched it forth a cubit and a half, holding it in the aire with his right hand, and with his left took out his orange, and casting it up into the aire seven times, at the eight he hid it in the fist of his right hand, holding it steadily up on high, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to shake his faire Codpiece, shewing it to <hi>Thaumast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After that <hi>Thaumast</hi> began to puffe up his two cheeks like a player on a bagpipe, and blew as if he had been to puffe up a pigs blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi> put one finger of his left hand in his nockandrow, by some cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led St. <hi>Patricks</hi> hole, and with his mouth suck't in the aire, in such a manner as when one eats oysters in the shell, or when we sup up our broth; this done, he opened his mouth somewhat, and struck his right hand flat upon it, making therewith a great and a deep sound as if it came from the superficies of the midriffe through the <hi>trachiartere</hi> or pipe of the lungs, and this he did for sixteen times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but <hi>Thaumast</hi> did alwayes keep blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a goose. Then <hi>Panurge</hi> put the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger of his right hand into his mouth, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it very hard to the muscles thereof; then he drew it out, and withal made a great noise, as when little boyes shoot pellets out
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:29535:74"/>
of the pot-canons made of the hollow sticks of the branch of an aulder-tree, and he did it nine times.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Thaumast</hi> cried out, Ha, my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, a great secret; with this he put in his hand up to the elbow; then drew out a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that he had, holding it by the point down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; whereat <hi>Panurge</hi> took his long Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, and shook it as hard as he could against his thighes; then put his two hands intwined in manner of a combe upon his head, laying out his tongue as farre as he was able; and turning his eyes in his head, like a goat that is ready to die. Ha, I understand (said <hi>Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mast</hi>) but what? making such a signe, that he put the haft of his dagger against his breast, and upon the point thereof the flat of his hand, turning in a little the ends of his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; whereat <hi>Panurge</hi> held down his head on the left side, and put his middle fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into his right eare, holding up his thumb bolt upright; then he crost his two armes upon his breast, and coughed five times, and at the fifth time he struck his right foot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the ground: then he lift up his left arme, and closing all his fingers into his fist, held his thumbe against his forehead, striking with his right hand six times against his breast. But <hi>Thaumast,</hi> as not content therewith, put the thumb of his left hand upon the top of his nose, shutting the rest of his said hand:
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:29535:74"/>
whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi> set his two Master-fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers upon each side of his mouth, drawing it as much as he was able, and widening it so, that he shewed all his teeth: and with his two thumbs pluck't down his two eye-lids very low, making therewith a very ill-favour'd countenance, as it seemed to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>

            <p>THen <hi>Thaumast</hi> rose up, and putting off his cap, did very kindly thank the said <hi>Panurge,</hi> and with a loud voice said unto all the people that were there, My Lords, Gentlemen and others, at this time may I to some good purpose speak that Evangelical word, <hi>Et ecce plus quàm Salomon hîc:</hi> You have here in your presence an incomparable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, that is, my Lord <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> whose great renown hath brought me hither, out of the very heart of <hi>England,</hi> to conferre with him about the insoluble problemes, both in <hi>Magick, Alchymie,</hi> the <hi>Caballe, Geomancie, Astrologie</hi> and <hi>Philosophie,</hi> which I had in my minde: but at present I am angry, even with

But in fine, I will reduce into writing that which we have said and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the world may not take them to be fooleries, and will thereafter cause them to be printed, that every one may learne as I have done. Judge then what the Master had been able to say, seeing the disciple hath done so valiantly; for, <hi>Non est discipulus su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Magistrum.</hi> Howsoever God be praised, and <hi>I</hi> do very humbly thank you, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that you have done us at this Act: God reward you for it eternally: the like thanks gave <hi>Pantagruel</hi> to all the company, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thence, he carried <hi>Thaumast</hi> to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with him, and beleeve that they drank as much as their skins could hold, or, as the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:29535:75"/>
phrase is, with unbottoned bellies, (for in that age they made fast their bellies with buttons, as we do now the colars of our doublets or jerkins) even till they neither knew where they were, nor whence they came. Blessed Lady, how they did ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouse it, and pluck (as we say) at the Kids leather: and flaggons to trot, and they to toote, Draw, give (page) some wine here reach hither, fill with a devil, so? There was not one but did drink five and twenty or thirty pipes, can you tell how? even <hi>Sicut terra sine aqua;</hi> for the weather was hot, and besides, that they were very dry. In matter of the exposition of the Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons set down by <hi>Thaumast:</hi> and the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the signes which they used in their disputation, <hi>I</hi> would have set them down for you according to their own relation: but I have been told that <hi>Thaumast</hi> made a great book of it imprinted at <hi>London,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath set down all without omitting any thing, and therefore at this time I do passe by it.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>PAnurge</hi> began to be in great reputation in the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> by means of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, wherein he pre vailed against the <hi>English</hi> man, and from thenceforth made his Codpiece to be very useful to him, to which effect he had it pinked with pretty little Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broideries after the <hi>Romanesca</hi> fashion; And the world did praise him publickly, in so farre that there was a song made of him, which little children did use to sing, when they went to fetch mustard: he was withal made wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in all companies of Ladies and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, so that at last he became presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and went about to bring to his lure one of the greatest Ladies in the City: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed leaving a rabble of long prologues and protestations, which ordinarily these dolent contemplative Lent-lovers make, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meddle with the flesh; one day he said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, <hi>Madam,</hi> it would be a very great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to the Common-wealth, delightful to you, honourable to your progeny, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for me, that I cover you for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:29535:76"/>
of my race, and beleeve it, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will teach it you: the Lady at this word thrust him back above a hundred leagues, saying, You mischievous foole, is it for you to talk thus unto me? whom do you think you have in hand? be gone, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to come in my sight again; for if one thing were not, I would have your legs and armes cut off. Well, (said he) that were all one to me, to want both legs and armes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you and <hi>I</hi> had but one merry bout to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, at the brangle buttock-game; for here within is (in shewing her his long Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece) Master <hi>Iohn Thursday,</hi> who will play you such an <hi>Antick,</hi> that you shall feel the sweetnesse thereof even to the very mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of your bones: He is a gallant, and doth so well know how to finde out all the corners, creeks and ingrained inmates in your carnal trap, that after him there needs no broom, he'l sweep so well before, and leave nothing to his followers to work upon: whereunto the Lady answered, Go, villain, go, if you speak to me one such word more, <hi>I</hi> will cry out, and make you to be knocked down with blowes. Ha, (said he) you are not so bad as you say, no, or else <hi>I</hi> am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in your physiognomie, for sooner shall the earth mount up unto the Heavens, and the highest Heavens descend unto the Hells, and all the course of nature be quite

perverted, then that in so great beauty and neatnesse as in you is, there should be one drop of gall or malice: they say indeed, that hardly shall a man ever see a faire woman that is not also stubborn: yet that is spoke only of those vulgar beauties, but yours is so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, so singular, and so heavenly, that I beleeve nature hath given it you as a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and master-piece of her Art, to make us know what she can do, when she will imploy all her skill, and all her power. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in you but honey, but sugar, but a sweet and celestial Manna: to you it was, to whom <hi>Paris</hi> ought to have adjudged the golden Apple, not to <hi>Venus,</hi> no, nor to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> nor to <hi>Minerva;</hi> for never was there so much magnificence in <hi>Iuno,</hi> so much wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in <hi>Minerva,</hi> nor so much comelinesse in <hi>Venus,</hi> as there is in you. O heavenly <hi>gods</hi> and <hi>goddesses!</hi> how happy shall that man be to whom you will grant the favour to embrace her, to kisse her, and to rub his bacon with hers? by G—that shall be I, I know it well; for she loves me already her belly full, I am sure of it, and so was I predestinated to it by the <hi>Fairies:</hi> and therefore that we lose no time, put on, thrust out your gamons, and would have embraced her, but she made as if she would put out her head at the window, to call her neighbours for help. Then <hi>Panurge</hi> on a sudden ran out, and in his running away,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:29535:78"/>
said, <hi>Madam,</hi> stay here till I come again, I will go call them my self, do not you take so much paines: thus went he away not much caring for the repulse he had got, nor made he any whit the worse cheer for it. The next day he came to the Church, at the time that she went to Masse, at the door he gave her some of the holy water, bowing himself ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry low before her, afterwards he kneeled down by her very familiarly, and said unto her, <hi>Madam,</hi> know that I am so amorous of you, that I can neither pisse nor dung for love: I do not know (<hi>Lady,</hi>) what you mean, but if I should take any hurt by it, how much would you be too blame? Go, said she, go, I do not care, let me alone to say my prayers. I but (said he) equivocate upon this; <hi>a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon le viconte,</hi> or to faire mount the pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunts: I cannot, said she: It is, said he, <hi>a beau con le vit monte,</hi> or to a faire C. . . the pr. . . mounts: and upon this pray to God to give you that which your noble heart desireth, and I pray you give me these patenotres. Take them (said she) &amp; trouble me no longer: this done, she would have taken off her pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notres, which were made of a kinde of yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low stone called <hi>Cestrin,</hi> and adorned with great spots of gold, but <hi>Panurge</hi> nimbly drew out one of his knives, wherewith he cut them off very handsomly, and whilest he was going away to carry them to the Brokers, he
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:29535:79"/>
said to her, Will you have my knife? No, no, said she: But (said he) to the purpose, <hi>I</hi> am at your commandment, body and goods, tripes and bowels.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Lady was not very well content with the want of her patinotres; for they were one of her implements to keep her countenance by in the Church: then thought with her self, this bold flowting Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, is some giddy, fantastical, light-headed foole of a strange countrey; <hi>I</hi> shall never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my patenotres again, what will my husband say, he will no doubt be angry with me; but I will tell him that a thief hath cut them off from my hands in the Church, which he will easily beleeve, seeing the end of the riban left at my girdle. After dinner <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi> went to see her carrying in his sleeve a great purse full of Palace-crowns called counters, and began to say unto her, Which of us two loveth other best, you me, or I you? whereunto she answered, As for me, I do not hate you; for as God commands, I love all the world: But to the purpose, (said he) are not you in love with me? I have (said she) told you so many times already, that you should talk so no more to me, and if you speak of it again, I will teach you, that I am not one to be talked unto dishonestly: get you hence packing, and deliver me my pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notres, that my husband may not ask me for them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:29535:79"/>How now, (<hi>Madam</hi>) said he, your pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notres? nay, by mine oath I will not do so, but I will give you others; had you rather have them of gold well enameled in great round knobs, or after the manner of love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knots, or otherwise all massive, like great <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots,</hi> or if you had rather have them of <hi>Ebene,</hi> of <hi>Iacinth,</hi> or of <hi>grained</hi> gold, with the marks of fine <hi>Turkoises,</hi> or of faire <hi>Topazes,</hi> marked with fine <hi>Saphirs,</hi> or of <hi>baleu Rubies,</hi> with great marks of <hi>Diamonds</hi> of eight and twenty squares? No, no, all this is too little; I know a faire bracelet of fine <hi>Emeraulds,</hi> marked with spotted <hi>Ambergris,</hi> and at the buckle a <hi>Persian pearle</hi> as big as an Orange: it will not cost above five and twenty thousand ducates, I will make you a present of it, for <hi>I</hi> have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy coine enough, and withal he made a noise with his counters as if they had been <hi>French</hi> Crownes.</p>
            <p>Will you have a piece of velvet, either of the violet colour, or of crimson died in graine: or a piece of broached or crimson sattin? will you have chaines, gold, tablets, rings? You need no more but say, Yes, so farre as fifty thousand ducates may reach, it is but as nothing to me; by the vertue of which words he made the water come in her mouth: but she said unto him, No, I thank you, <hi>I</hi> will have nothing of you. By G—said he, but I will have somewhat of you; yet shall
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:29535:80"/>
it be that which shall cost you nothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall you have a jot the lesse, when you have given it, hold, (shewing his long Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece) this is Master <hi>Iohn Good fellow,</hi> that askes for lodging, and with that would have embraced her; but she began to cry out, yet not very loud. Then <hi>Panurge</hi> put off his counterfeit garb, changed his false visage, and said unto her, You will not then otherwayes let me do a little, a turd for you, you do not deserve so much good, nor so much honour: but by G—I will make the dogs ride you, and with this he ran away as fast as he could, for feare of blowes, whereof he was natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fearful.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> How <hi>Panurge</hi> served a Parisian Lady a trick that pleased her not very well.</head>
            <p>NOw you must note that the next day was the great festival of <hi>Corpus Christi,</hi> called the <hi>Sacre,</hi> wherein all women put on their best apparel, and on that day the said Lady was cloathed in a rich gown of crimson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sattin, under which she wore a very costly white velvet petticoat.</p>
            <p>The day of the Eve (called the vigile)
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:29535:80"/>
               <hi>Panurge</hi> searched so long of one side and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that he found a hot or salt bitch, which when he had tied her with his girdle, he led to his chamber, and fed her very well all that day and night; in the morning thereafter he killed her, and took that part of her which the <hi>Greek</hi> Geomanciers know, and cut it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to several pieces as small as he could; then carrying it away as close as might be, he went to the place where the Lady was to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, to follow the Procession, as the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome is upon the said holy day; and when she came in, <hi>Panurge</hi> sprinkled some holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on her, saluting her very courteously: then a little while after she had said her petty devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he sate down close by her upon the same bench, and gave her this roundlay in writing, in manner as followeth.</p>
            <lg>

            <p>And as she was opening this paper to see what it was, <hi>Panurge</hi> very promptly and lightly scattered the drug that he had, upon her in divers places, but especially in the plaits of her sleeves, and of her gowne: then said he unto her, Madam, the poor lovers are not alwayes at ease; as for me, <hi>I</hi> hope that those heavy nights, those paines and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles which <hi>I</hi> suffer for love of you, shall be a deduction to me of so much paine in Purgatory: yet at the least pray to God to give me patience in my misery. <hi>Panurge</hi> had no sooner spoke this, but all the dogs that were in the Church came running to this Lady with the smell of the drugs that he had strowed upon her, both small and great, big and little, all came, laying out their member; smelling to her, and pissing every where up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, it was the greatest villainy in the world. <hi>Panurge</hi> made the fashion of dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them away: then took his leave of her, and withdrew himself into some Chappel or
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:29535:81"/>
Oratory of the said Church, to see the sport; for these villainous dogs did compisse all her habiliaments, and left none of her attire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besprinkled with their staling, in so much that a tall grey-hound pist upon her head, others in her sleeves, others on her crupper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, and the little ones pissed upon her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines: so that all the women that were round about her had much ado to save her. Whereat <hi>Panurge</hi> very heartily laughing, he said to one of the Lords of the City, <hi>I</hi> beleeve that the same Lady is hot, or else that some grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound hath covered her lately. And when he saw that all the dogs were flocking about her, yarring at the retardment of their accesse to her, and every way keeping such a coyle with her, as they are wont to do about a proud or salt bitch, he forthwith departed from thence, and went to call <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> not forgetting in his way alongst all the streets, thorough which he went, where he found any dogs to give them a bang with his foot, saying, Will you not go with your fellowes to the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding? Away, hence, avant, avant, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil avant: And being come home, he said to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> Master, <hi>I</hi> pray you come and see all the dogs of the countrey, how they are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled about a Lady, the fairest in the City, and would dufle and line her; whereunto <hi>Pantagruel</hi> willingly condescended, and saw the mystery, which he found very pretty and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:29535:82"/>
strange: But the best was at the Procession, in which were seen above six hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand and fourteen dogs about her, which did very much trouble and molest her, and whithersoever she past, those dogs that came afresh, tracing her footsteps, followed her at the heeles, and pist in the way where her gown had touched. All the world stood ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing at this spectacle, considering the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of those dogs, who leaping up got about her neck, and spoiled all her gorgeous accoutrements, for the which she could finde no remedy, but to retire unto her house, which was a Palace: Thither she went, and the dogs after her; she ran to hide her self, but the Chamber-maids could not abstaine from laughing. When she was entered into the house, and had shut the door upon her self, all the dogs came running, of halfe a league round, and did so well bepisse the gate of her house, that there they made a stream with their urine, wherein a duck might have very well swimmed, and it is the same current that now runs at St. <hi>Victor,</hi> in which <hi>Gobelin</hi> dieth scarlet, for the specifical vertue of these pisse-dogs, as our Master <hi>Doribus</hi> did heretofore preach publickly. So may God help you; a Mill would have ground corne with it; yet not so much as those of <hi>Basacle</hi> at <hi>Toulouse.</hi>

               <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> How <hi>Pantagruel</hi> departed from <hi>Paris,</hi> hearing newes, that the <hi>Dipsodes</hi> had invaded the Land of the <hi>Amaurots:</hi> and the cause wherefore the leagues are so short in <hi>France.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>A Little while after <hi>Pantagruel</hi> heard newes that his father <hi>Gargantua</hi> had been translated into the land of the Fairies by <hi>Morgue,</hi> as heretofore were <hi>Oger</hi> and <hi>Arthur</hi> together, and that the report of his transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being spread abroad, the <hi>Dipsodes</hi> had is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued out beyond their borders, with inrodes had wasted a great part of <hi>Utopia,</hi> and at that very time had besieged the great City of the <hi>Amaurots;</hi> whereupon departing from <hi>Paris,</hi> without bidding any man farewel, for the businesse required diligence, he came to <hi>Rowen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Pantagruel</hi> in his journey, seeing that the leagues of that little territory about <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> called <hi>France,</hi> were very short in regard of those of other Countreys, demanded the cause and reason of it from <hi>Panurge,</hi> who told him a story which <hi>Marotus</hi> set down of the <hi>lac Monachus,</hi> in the acts of the Kings of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narre</hi>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:29535:83"/>
saying, that in old times Countreys were not distinguished into leagues, miles, furlongs, nor parasanges, until that King <hi>Pharamond</hi> divided them, which was done in manner as followeth. The said King chose at <hi>Paris</hi> a hundred faire, gallant, lustie, briske young men, all resolute and bold adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in <hi>Cupids</hi> duels, together with a hundred comely, pretty, handsome, lovely and well complexioned wenches of <hi>Picardie,</hi> all which he caused to be well entertained, and highly fed for the space of eight dayes; then having called for them, he delivered to every one of the young men his wench, with store of money to defray their charges, and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction besides, to go unto divers places here and there, and wheresoever they should biscot and thrum their wenches, that thy setting a stone there, it should be accounted for a league: thus went away those brave fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and sprightly blades most merrily, and because they were fresh, and had been at rest, they very often jum'd and fanfreluched almost at every fields end, and this is the cause why the leagues about <hi>Paris</hi> are so short; but when they had gone a great way, and were now as weary as poor devils, all the oile in their lamps being almost spent, they did not chink and dufle so often, but content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves, (<hi>I</hi> mean for the mens part,) with one scurvie paultry bout in a day, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:29535:83"/>
this is that which makes the leagues in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany, Delanes, Germany,</hi> and other more remote Countreys so long: other men give other reasons for it, but this seems to me of all other the best. To which <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi> willingly adhered. Parting from <hi>Rowen,</hi> they arrived at <hi>Honfteur,</hi> where they took shipping, <hi>Pantagruel, Panurge, Epistemon, Eust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes</hi> and <hi>Carpalim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which place, waiting for a favourable winde, and caulking their ship, he received from a Lady of <hi>Paris</hi> (which <hi>I</hi> had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept, and entertained a good long time,) a letter directed on the out-side thus, <hi>To the best beloved of the faire women, and least loyal of the valiant men,</hi> PNTGRL.</p>

Wondering at this, he called <hi>Panurge</hi> to him, and shewed him the case; whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi> told him, thar the leafe of paper was written upon, but with such cunning and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice that no man could see the writing at the first sight, therefore to finde it out he set it by the fire, to see if it was made with <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> soaked in water; then put he it into the water, to see if the letter was written with the juice of <hi>Tithymalle:</hi> after that he held it up against the candle, to see if it was written with the juice of white onions.</p>
            <p>Then he rubbed one part of it with oile of nuts, to see if it were not written with the lee of a fig-tree: and another part of it with the milk of a woman giving suck to her el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest daughter, to see if it was written with the blood of red toads, or green earth-frogs: Afterwards he rubbed one corner with the ashes of a Swallowes nest, to see if it were not written with the dew that is found within the herb <hi>Alcakengie,</hi> called the winter-cherry. He rubbed after that one end with eare-wax, to see if it were not written with the gall of a Raven: then did he dip it into vineger, to try if it was not written with the juice of the garden <hi>Spurge:</hi> After that he greased it with
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:29535:84"/>
the fat of a bat or flittermouse, to see if it was not written with the sperm of a whale, which some call ambergris: Then put it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fairly into a basin full of fresh water, and forthwith took it out, to see whether it were written with stone-allum: But after all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, when he perceived that he could finde out nothing, he called the messenger, and asked him, Good fellow, the Lady that sent thee hither, did she not give thee a staffe to bring with thee? thinking that it had been according to the conceit, whereof <hi>Aulus Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> maketh mention, and the Messenger an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him, <hi>No, Sir.</hi> Then <hi>Panurge</hi> would have caused his head to be shaven, to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Lady had written upon his bald pate, with the hard lie whereof sope is made, that which she meant; but perceiving that his hair was very long, he forbore, considering that it could not have grown to so great a length in so short a time.</p>
            <p>Then he said to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> Master, by the vertue of G—I cannot tell what to do nor say in it; for to know whether there be any thing written upon this or no; <hi>I</hi> have made use of a good part of that which Master <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco di Nianto,</hi> the <hi>Tuscan</hi> sets down, who hath written the manner of reading letters that do not appear; that which <hi>Zoroastes</hi> published, <hi>peri grammaton acriton;</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurnius Bassus de literis illegibilibus:</hi> but <hi>I</hi>

can see nothing, nor do I beleeve that there is any thing else in it then the Ring: let us therefore look upon it, which when they had done, they found this in <hi>Hebrew</hi> written with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>Lamach sabathani;</hi> whereupon they called <hi>Epistemon,</hi> and asked him what that meant? to which he answered, that they were <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> words, signifying, <hi>Wherefore hast thou forsaken me?</hi> upon that <hi>Panurge</hi> suddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied: <hi>I</hi> know the mystery, do you see this diamond? it is a false one; this then is the exposition of that which the Lady meanes, <hi>Diamant faux,</hi> that is, false lover, why hast thou forsaken me? which interpretation <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> presently understood, and withal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering, that at his departure he had not bid the Lady farewel, he was very sorry, and would faine have returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> to make his peace with her; but <hi>Epistemon</hi> put him in minde of <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s departure from <hi>Dido,</hi> and the saying of <hi>Heraclitus</hi> of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> That the ship being at anchor when need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, we must cut the cable rather then lose time about untying of it, and that he should lay aside all other thoughts to succour the City of his Nativity, which was then in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and indeed within an houre after that, the winde arose at the North-north-west, wherewith they hoised saile, and put out, even into the maine sea, so that within few dayes, passing by <hi>Porto Sancto,</hi> and by the <hi>Maderas,</hi>

            <p>When they were ashore, and pretty well refreshed, <hi>Panurge</hi> said, Gentlemen, the City is not farre from hence, therefore were it not amisse before we set forward, to advise well what is to be done, that we be not like the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> who never took counsel until after the fact: Are you resolved to live and die with me?

they all said, Let us go thither and see, and stay you here for us, for this very day, without further respite do we make account to bring you a certain report thereof.</p>
            <p>My self (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) will undertake to enter into their camp, within the very midst of their guards, unespied by their watch, and merrily feast and lecher it at their cost, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being known of any, to see the Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and the Tents of all the Captaines, and thrust my self in with a grave and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick carriage, amongst all their troops and companies, without being discovered; the devill would not be able to peck me out with all his circumventions: for I am of the race of <hi>Zopyrus.</hi>

            <p>AS he was speaking this, they perceived six hundred and threescore light horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, gallantly mounted, who made an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode thither, to see what ship it was that was newly arrived in the harbour, and came in a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:29535:87"/>
full gallop to take them if they had been able: Then said <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> my Lads, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire your selves unto the ship, here are some of our enemies coming apace, but I will kill them here before you like beasts, although they were ten times so many, in the meane time withdraw your selves, and take your sport at it. Then answered <hi>Panurge,</hi> No, Sir, there is no reason that you should do so, but on the contrary retire you unto the ship, both you and the rest; for I alone will here discomfit them, but we must not linger, come, set forward; whereunto the others said, It is well advised, Sir, withdraw your self, and we will help <hi>Panurge</hi> here, so shall you know what we are able to do: Then said <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> Well, I am content, but if that you be too weak, <hi>I</hi> will not faile to come to your assistance. With this <hi>Panurge</hi> took two great cables of the ship, and tied them to the kemstock or capstane which was on the deck towards the hatches, and fastened them in the ground, making a long circuit, the one further off, the other within that. Then said he to <hi>Epistemon,</hi> Go aboard the ship, and when <hi>I</hi> give you a call, turn about the capstane upon the orlop diligently, drawing unto you the two cable-ropes: and said to <hi>Eusthenes,</hi> and to <hi>Carpalin, My Bullies,</hi> stay you here, and offer your selves freely to your enemies, do as they bid you, and make as if you would
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:29535:87"/>
yield unto them: but take heed you come not within the compasse of the ropes, be sure to keep your selves free of them; and presently he went aboard the ship, and took a bundle of straw, and a barrel of gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, strowed it round about the compasse of the cordes, and stood by with a brand of fire or match lighted in his hand. Presently came the horsemen with great fury, and the foremost ran almost home to the ship, and by reason of the slipperinesse of the bank, they fell they and their horses, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of foure and fourty, which the rest see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, came on, thinking that resistance had been made them at their arrival: But <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi> said unto them, My Masters, <hi>I</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that you have hurt your selves, <hi>I</hi> pray you pardon us, for it is not our fault, but the slipperinesse of the sea-water, that is alwayes flowing; we submit our selves to your good pleasure; so said likewise his two other fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and <hi>Epistemon</hi> that was upon the deck; in the mean time <hi>Panurge</hi> withdrew himselfe, and seeing that they were all within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of the cables, and that his two compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were retired, making room for all those horses which came in a croud, thronging up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the neck of one another to see the ship, and such as were in it cried out on a sudden to <hi>Epistemon,</hi> Draw, draw: then began <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistemon</hi> to winde about the capstane, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:29535:88"/>
whereof the two cables so intangled and impestered the legs of the horses, that they were all of them thrown down to the ground easily, together with their Riders: but they seeing that, drew their swords, and would have cut them: whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi> set fire to the traine, and there burnt them up all like damned souls, both men and horses, not one escaping save one alone, who being mounted on a fleet <hi>Turkie</hi> courser, by meere speed in flight got himself out of the circle of the ropes; but when <hi>Carpalin</hi> perceived him, he ran after him with such nimblenesse and ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>erity, that he overtook him in lesse then a hundred paces; then leaping close behinde him upon the crupper of his horse, clasped him in his armes, and brought him back to the ship.</p>
            <p>This exploit being ended <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was very jovial, and wondrously commended the industry of these Gentlemen, whom he called his fellow-souldiers, and made them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh themselves, and feed well and merrily upon the sea-shore, and drink heartily with their bellies upon the ground, and their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner with them, whom they admitted to that familiarity: only that the poor devil was somewhat afraid that <hi>Pantagruel</hi> would have eaten him up whole, which, considering the widenesse of his mouth, and capacity of his throat, was no great matter for him to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:29535:88"/>
have done; for he could have done it, as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily as you would eate a small comfit, he shewing no more in his throat, then would a graine of millet-seed in the mouth of an Asse.</p>

            <p>THus as they talked &amp; chatted together, <hi>Carpalin</hi> said, And by the belly of St. <hi>Quenet,</hi> shal we never eat any venison? this salt meat makes me horribly dry, <hi>I</hi> will go fetch you a quarter of one of those horses which we have burnt, it is well roasted already: as he was rising up to go about it, he perceived under the side of a wood a fair great roe-buck, which was come out of his Fort (as I conceive) at the sight of <hi>Panurge</hi>'s fire: him did he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue and run after with as much vigour and swiftnesse, as if it had been a bolt out of a Crossebowe, and caught him in a moment; and whilest he was in his course, he with his hands took in the aire foure great bustards, seven bitterns, six and twenty gray partridges,

two and thirty red legged ones, sixteen phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants, nine woodcooks, nineteen herons, two and thirty coushots and ring-doves; and with his feet killed ten or twelve hares and rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets, which were then at relief, and pretty big withal, eighteen rayles in a knot toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with fifteen young wilde boares, two little Bevers, and three great foxes: so stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Kid with his fauchion athwart the head he killed him, and bearing him on his back, he in his return took up his hares, rayls, and young wilde boares, and as far off as he could be heard, cried out, &amp; said, <hi>Panurge</hi> my friend, vineger, vineger: then the good <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel,</hi> thinking he had fainted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> commanded them to provide him some vineger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi> knew well that there was some good prey in hands, and forthwith shewed unto noble <hi>Pantagruel</hi> how he was bearing upon his back a faire roe-buck, and all his girdle bordered with hares; then immediately did <hi>Epistemon</hi> make in the name of the nine Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, nine antick wooden spits: <hi>Eusthenes</hi> did help to flay, and <hi>Panurge</hi> placed two great cuirasier saddles, in such sort that they served for Andirons and making their prisoner to be their Cook, they roasted their venison by the fire, wherein the horsemen were burnt: and making great chear with a good deal of vineger, the devil a one of them did forbear from his victuals, it was a triumphant and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:29535:89"/>
incomparable spectacle to see how they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened and devoured. Then said <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> Would to God every one of you had two paires of little <hi>Anthem</hi> or <hi>Sacring</hi> bells hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at your chin, and that <hi>I</hi> had at mine the great clocks of <hi>Renes,</hi> of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> of <hi>Tours,</hi> and of <hi>Cambray,</hi> to see what a peale they would ring with the wagging of our chaps; But, said <hi>Panurge,</hi> it were better we thought a little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our businesse, and by what meanes we might get the upper hand of our enemies: That is well remembered, said <hi>Pantagruel;</hi> therefore spoke he thus to the prisoner, My friend, tell us here the truth, and do not lie to us at all, if thou wouldest not be flayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, for it is <hi>I</hi> that eat the little children: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late unto us at full the order, the number and the strength of the Army: to which the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner answered, Sir, know for a truth that in the army there are three hundred giants, all armed with armour of proof, and wonderful great: neverthelesse, not fully so great as you, except one that is their head, named <hi>Loup-garou,</hi> who is armed from head to foot with <hi>Cyclopical</hi> annuils; furthermore, one hundred threescore and three thousand foot, all armed with the skins of hobgoblins, strong and valiant men: eleven thousand foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men at armes or cuirasiers: three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand six hundred double canons, and harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busiers without number; fourescore and

            <p>Yea, but (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) is the King there? Yes Sir, (said the prisoner) he is there in person, and we call him <hi>Anarchus,</hi> King of the <hi>Dipsodes,</hi> which is as much to say as thirsty people, for you never saw men more thirsty, nor more willing to drink, and his tent is guarded by the Giants: It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) come brave boyes, are you resolved to go with me? To which <hi>Panurge</hi> answered, God confound him that leaves you: I have already bethought my self how I will kill them all like pigs, and so, that the devil one leg of them shall escape: but I am somewhat troubled about one thing: And what is that? said <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> It is (said <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi>) how I shall be able to set forward to the jusling and bragmardising of all the whores that be there this afternoon, in such sort, that there escape not one unbumped by me; breasted and jum'd after the ordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of man and woman, in the Venetian conflict.

sink-holes, if by G—I do not bumbast some one of them: Then said <hi>Eusthenes,</hi> What shall not I have any, whose paces since we came from <hi>Rowen,</hi> were never so well winded up, as that my needle could mount to ten or eleven a clock till now, that <hi>I</hi> have it hard, stiffe and strong, like a hundred de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils? Truly, (said <hi>Panurge,</hi>) thou shalt have of the fattest, and of those that are most plump, and in the best case.</p>
            <p>How now?

            </lg>
            <p>Then (said <hi>Pantagruel,</hi>) Come, my lads, let us be gone, we have stayed here too long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our victuals; for very seldom doth it fall out, that the greatest eaters do the most martial exploits, there is no <hi>shadow</hi> like that of flying colours, no <hi>smoke</hi> like that of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, no <hi>clattering</hi> like that of armour: at this <hi>Epistemon</hi> began to smile, and said, There is no <hi>shadow</hi> like that of the kitchin, no <hi>smoke</hi> like that of pasties, and no <hi>clattering</hi> like that of goblets: unto which answered <hi>Panurge,</hi> There is no <hi>shadow</hi> like that of courtaines, no <hi>smoke</hi> like that of womens breasts, and no <hi>clattering</hi> like that of ballocks: then forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with rising up he gave a fart, a leap, and a whistle, and most joyfully cried out aloud, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver live <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> when <hi>Pantagruel</hi> saw that, he would have done as much; but with the fart that he let, the earth trembled nine leagues about, wherewith and with the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted aire, he begot above three and fifty thousand little men, ill favoured dwarfes, and with one fisg that he let, he made as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:29535:93"/>
little women, crouching down, as you shall see in divers places, which never grow but like Cowes tailes downwards, or like the <hi>Limosin</hi> radishes, round. How now (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) are your farts so fertile and fruitful? by G—here be brave farted men, and fisgued women, let them be married together, they will beget fine hornets and dorflies; so did <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and called them Pygmies; those he sent to live in an island thereby, where since that time they are increased mightily: but the cranes make warre with them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, against which they do most couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously defend themselves; for these little ends of men and dandiprats, (whom in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> they call whiphandles, and knots of a tarre-barrel) are commonly very teastie and cholerick: the Physical reason whereof is, because their heart is near their spleen.</p>
            <p>At this same time, <hi>Panurge</hi> took two drinking glasses that were there, both of one bignesse, and filled them with water up to the brim, and set one of them upon one stool, and the other upon another, placing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five foot from one another: then he took the staffe of a javelin, about five foot and a half long, and put it upon the two glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, so that the two ends of the staffe did come just to the brims of the glasses: This done, he took a great stake or billet of wood, and said to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and to the rest: <hi>My</hi>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:29535:93"/>
               <hi>Masters,</hi> behold, how easily we shall have the victory over our enemies; for just as I shall break this staffe here upon these glasses, without either breaking or crazing of them. nay, which is more, without spilling one drop of the water that is within them, even so shall we break the heads of our <hi>Dipsodes,</hi> without receiving any of us any wound or losse in our person or goods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that you may not think there is any <hi>witchcraft</hi> in this; hold (said he to <hi>Eusthenes</hi>) strike upon the midst as hard as thou canst with this log: <hi>Eusthenes</hi> did so, and the staffe broke in two pieces, and not one drop of the water fell out of the glasses: Then said he, I know a great many such other tricks, let us now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore march boldly, and with assurance.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XXVIII.</hi> How <hi>Pantagruel</hi> got the victory very strangely over the <hi>Dipsodes,</hi> and the Giants.</head>
            <p>AFter all this talk, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> took the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner to him, and sent him away, saying, Go thou unto thy King in his Camp, and tell him tidings of what thou hast seen, and let him resolve to feast me to morrow about noon; for assoon as my galleys shall come,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:29535:94"/>
which will be to morrow at furthest; I will prove unto him by eighteen hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand fighting men, and seven thousand Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, all of them greater then I am; that he hath done foolishly and against reason, thus to invade my countrey, wherein <hi>Pantagruel</hi> feigned that he had an army at sea; but the Prisoner answered, that he would yield him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be his slave, and that he was content never to return to his own people, but rather with <hi>Pantagruel</hi> to fight against them, and for Gods sake besought him, that he might be permitted so to do: whereunto <hi>Pantagruel</hi> would not give consent, but commanded him to depart thence speedily, and be gone, as he had told him, and to that effect gave him a box full of <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> together with some grains of the black <hi>chameleon thistle,</hi> steeped into <hi>aqua vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ae,</hi> and made up into the condiment of a wet sucket, commanding him to carry it to his King, and to say unto him, that if he were able to eate one ounce of that without drinking after it, he might then be able to resist him, without any feare or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of danger.</p>
            <p>The Prisoner then besought him with joynt hands, that in the houre of the battel he would have compassion upon him: whereat <hi>Pantagruel</hi> said unto him, After that thou hast delivered all unto the King, put thy whole confidence in God,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:29535:94"/>
and he will not forsake thee; because, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for my part <hi>I</hi> be mighty, as thou mayest see, and have an infinite number of men in armes, I do neverthelesse trust neither in my force nor in mine industry, but all my confidence is in God my Protectour, who doth never forsake those that in him do put their trust and confidence. This done, the Prisoner requested him that he would afford him some reasonable composition for his ransome: to which <hi>Pantagruel</hi> answered, that his end was not to rob nor ransom men, but to enrich them, and reduce them to total liberty; Go thy way (said he) in the peace of the living God, and never follow evil company, lest some mischief befall thee. The Prisoner being gone, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> said to his men, Gentlemen, I have made this Prisoner believe that we have an army at sea, as also that we will not assault them till to morrow at noon, to the end, that they doubting of the great arrival of our men, may spend this night in providing and strengthening themselves, but in the mean time my intention is, that we charge them about the houre of the first sleep.</p>
            <p>Let us leave <hi>Pantagruel</hi> here with his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and speak of King <hi>Anarchus</hi> and his army. When the Prisoner was come, he went unto the King, and told him how there was a great Giant come, called <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who had overthrown, and made to be cruelly roasted
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:29535:95"/>
all the six hundred and nine and fifty horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and he alone escaped to bring the news: besides that, he was charged by the said Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, to tell him, that the next day about noon he must make a dinner ready for him, for at that houre he was resolved to set upon him: then did he give him that boxe wherein were those confitures; but assoon as he had swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down one spoonful of them, he was taken with such a heat in the throat, together with an ulceration in the flap of the top of the winde-pipe, that his tongue peel'd with it, in such sort that for all they could do unto him, he found no ease at all, but by drinking only without cessation, for assoon as ever he took the goblet from his head, his tongue was on a fire, and therefore they did nothing but still poure in wine into his throat with a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, which when his Captains, <hi>Bashawes,</hi> and guard of his body did see, they tasted of the same drugs, to try whether they were so thirst-procuring and alterative or no: but it so befell them as it had done their King, and they plied the flaggon so well, that the noise ran throughout all the Camp, how the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner was returned, that the next day they were to have an assault, that the King and his Captains did already prepare themselves for it, together with his guards, and that wiah carowsing lustily, and qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ffing as hard as they could, every man therefore in the army
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:29535:95"/>
began to tipple, ply the pot, swill and guzzle it as fast as they could. In summe, they drunk so much, and so long, that they fell asleep like pigs, all out of order throughout the whole Camp.</p>
            <p>Let us now return to the good <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and relate how he carried himself in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, departing from the place of the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies:</hi> he took the mast of their ship in his hand like a Pilgrims staffe, and put within the top of it two hundred and seven and thirty poisons of white wine of <hi>Anjou,</hi> the rest was of <hi>Rowen,</hi> and tied up to his girdle the bark all full of salt, as easily as the <hi>Lans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennets</hi> carry their little panniers, and to set onward on his way with his fellow-souldiers. When he was come near to the enemies Camp, <hi>Panurge</hi> said unto him, <hi>Sir,</hi> if you would do well, let down this white wine of <hi>Anjou,</hi> from the scuttle of the mast of the ship, that we may all drink thereof, like <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereunto <hi>Pantagruel</hi> very willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, and they drank so neat, that there was not so much as one poor drop left, of two hundred and seven and thirty punchons, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one <hi>Boracho</hi> or leathern bottle of <hi>Tours,</hi> which <hi>Panurge</hi> filled for himself, (for he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that his <hi>vade mecum,</hi>) and some scurvie lees of wine in the bottom, which served him in stead of vineger. After they had whitled
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:29535:96"/>
and curried the canne pretty handsomely; <hi>Panurge</hi> gave <hi>Pantagruel</hi> to eate some devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish drugs, compounded of <hi>Lithotripton,</hi> (which is a stone-dissolving ingredient,) <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrocatarticon,</hi> (that purgeth the reines) the marmalade of Quinces, (called <hi>Codiniac</hi>) a confection of <hi>Cantharides,</hi> (which are green flies breeding on the tops of olive-trees) and other kindes of <hi>diuretick</hi> or pisse-procuring simples. This done, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> said to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palin,</hi> Go into the City, scrambling like a cat up against the wall, as you can well do, and tell them that now presently they come out, and charge their enemies as rudely as they can, and having said so, come down ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a lighted torch with you, wherewith you shall set on fire all the tents and pavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions in the Camp, then cry as loud as you are able with your great voice, and then come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from thence. Yea but, said <hi>Carpalin,</hi> were it not good to cloy all their ordnance? No, no, (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) only blow up all their powder. <hi>Carpalin</hi> obeying him, departed suddenly, and did as he was appointed by <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and all the Combatants came forth that were in the City, and when he had set fire in the tents and pavillions, he past so lightly through them, and so highly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly did they snort and sleep, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver perceived him. He came to the place where their Artillery was, and set their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:29535:96"/>
on fire: but here was the danger, the fire was so sudden, that poor <hi>Carpalin</hi> had almost been burnt; and had it not been for his wonderful agility, he had been fried like a roasting pig: but he departed away so speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that a bolt or arrow out of a Crossebowe could not have had a swifter motion. When he was clear of their trenches, he shooted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, and cried out so dreadfully, and with such amazement to the hearers, that it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the devils of hell had been let loose: at which noise the enemies awaked, but can you tell how? even no lesse astonished then are <hi>Monks,</hi> at the ringing of the first peale to <hi>Matins,</hi> which in <hi>Lusonnois</hi> is called <hi>Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Pantagruel</hi> began to sowe the salt that he had in his bark, and because they slept with an open gaping mouth, he filled all their throats with it, so that those poor wretches were by it made to cough like foxes. Ha, <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> how thou addest great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er heat to the firebrand that is in us. Sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Pantagruel</hi> had will to pisse, by meanes of the drugs which <hi>Panurge</hi> had given him, and pist amidst the Camp so well and so copiously, that he drowned them all, and there was a particular deluge, ten leagues round about, of such considerable depth, that the history saith, if his fathers great mare had been there, and pist likewise, it would undoubtedly have
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:29535:97"/>
been a more enormous deluge then that of <hi>Deucalion;</hi> for she did never pisse, but she made a river, greater then is either the <hi>Rhosne,</hi> or the <hi>Danow,</hi> which those that were come out of the City seeing, said, They are all cruelly slain, see how the blood runs along: but they were deceived in thinking <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruels</hi> urine had been the blood of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; for they could not see but by the light of the fire of the pavillions, and some small light of the Moon.</p>
            <p>The enemies after that they were awaked, seeing on one side the fire in the Camp, and on the other the inundation of the urinal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, could not tell what to say, nor what to think; some said, that it was the end of the world, and the final judgement, which ought to be by fire: Others again thought that the sea-gods, <hi>Neptune, Protheus, Triton,</hi> and the rest of them did persecute them, for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they found it to be like sea-water and salt.</p>
            <p>O who were able now condignely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, how <hi>Pantagruel</hi> did demean himself against the three hundred Giants; O my Muse, my <hi>Calliope,</hi> my <hi>Thalia,</hi> inspire me at this time, restore unto me my spirits; for this is the <hi>Logical</hi> bridge of asses: here is the pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall, here is the difficultie, to have ability e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to expresse the horrible battel that was fought; Ah, would to God that I had now

            <p>THe Giants seeing all their Camp drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, carried away their King <hi>Anarchus</hi> upon their backs, as well as they could out of the Fort, as <hi>Aeneas</hi> did to his father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chises,</hi> in the time of the conflagration of <hi>Troy.</hi> When <hi>Panurge</hi> perceived them, he said to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> Sir, yonder are the Giants co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth against you, lay on them with your mast gallantly like an old Fencer; for now is the time that you must shew your self a brave man and an honest. And for our part we will not faile you: I my self willl kill to you a good many boldly enough; for why, <hi>David</hi> killed <hi>Goliah</hi> very easily; and then, this great Lecher <hi>Eusthenes,</hi> who is stronger then foure oxen, will not spare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.

               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:29535:98"/>
(said <hi>Pantagruel,</hi>) of courage <hi>I</hi> have more then for fifty francks, but let us be wise, for <hi>Hercules</hi> first never undertook against two; that is well cack'd, well scummered, (said <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi>) do you compare your self with <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les?</hi> You have by G—more strength in your teeth, and more sent in your bum, then ever <hi>Hercules</hi> had in all his body and soule: so much is a man worth as he esteems himself. Whilest they spake those words behold, <hi>Lougarou</hi> was come with all his Giants, who seeing <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi> in a manner alone, was carried away with temerity and presumption, for hopes that he had to kill the good man; whereupon he said to his companions the Giants, You Wenchers of the low countrey, by <hi>Mahoom,</hi> if any of you undertake to fight against these men here, I will put you cruelly to death: it is my will that you let me fight single, in the mean time you shall have good sport to look upon us: then all the other Giants retired with their King, to the place where the flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons stood, and <hi>Panurge</hi> and his <hi>Camerades</hi> with them, who counterfeited those that have had the pox, for he wreathed about his mouth, shrunk up his fingers, and with a harsh and hoarse voice said unto them, I forsake—od (fellow souldiers) if I would have it to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, that we make any warre at all; Give us somewhat to eat with you, whilest our Masters fight against one another; to this the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:29535:98"/>
King and Giants joyntly condescended, and accordingly made them to banquet with them. In the mean time <hi>Panurge</hi> told them the follies of <hi>Turpin,</hi> the examples of St. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas,</hi> and the tale of a tub. <hi>Loupgarou</hi> then set forward towards <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> with a mace all of steel, and that of the best sort, weighing nine thousand seven hundred kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and two quarterons, at the end whereof were thirteen pointed diamonds, the least whereof was as big as the greatest bell of our <hi>Ladies</hi> Church at <hi>Paris,</hi> (there might want perhaps the thicknesse of a naile, or (at most that <hi>I</hi> may not lie) of the back of those knives which they call cut-lugs or eare-cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but for a little off or on, more or lesse, it is no matter) and it was inchanted in such sort, that it could never break, but contrarily all that it did touch, did break immediately. Thus then as he approached with great fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and pride of heart: <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> casting up his eyes to heaven, recommended himself to God with all his soule, making such a Vow as followeth.</p>
            <p>O thou Lord God, who hast alwayes been my Protectour, and my Saviour, thou seest the distresse wherein I am at this time: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing brings me hither but a natural zeale, which thou hast permitted unto mortals, to keep and defend themselves, their wives and children, countrey and family, in case thy
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:29535:99"/>
own proper cause were not in question, which is the faith; for in such a businesse thou wilt have no Coadjutors, only a Catholick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and service of thy Word, and hast forbidden us all arming and defence; for thou art the Almighty, who in thine owne cause, and where thine own businesse is taken to heart, canst defend it far beyond all that we can conceive, thou who hast thousand thousands of hundreds of millions of legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Angels, the least of which is able to kill all mortal men, and turn about the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and earth at his pleasure, as heretofore it very plainly appeared in the army of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib,</hi> if it may please thee therefore at this time to assist me, as my whole trust and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is in thee alone: <hi>I</hi> vow unto thee, that in all Countreys whatsoever, wherein <hi>I</hi> shall have any power or authority, whether in this of <hi>Utopia,</hi> or elsewhere, <hi>I</hi> will cause thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gospel to be purely, simply and entirely preached, so that the abuses of a rabble of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and false prophets, who by humane constitutions, and depraved inventions, have impoisoned all the world, shall be quite exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated from about me.

with his mouth wide open was drawing near to him, went against him boldly, and cried out as loud as he was able, Thou diest, vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, thou diest, purposing by his horrible cry to make him afraid, according to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> Withal, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately cast at him out of his bark which he wore at his girdle, eighteen cags, and foure bushels of salt, wherewith he filled both his mouth, throat, nose and eyes: at this <hi>Loup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garou</hi> was so highly incensed, that most fiercely setting upon him, he thought even then with a blow of his mace to have beat out his braines: but <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was very nimble, and had alwayes a quick foot, and a quick eye, and therefore with his left foot did he step back one pace, yet not so nimbly, but that the blow falling upon the bark, broke it in foure thousand, fourescore and six pieces, and threw all the rest of the salt about the ground: <hi>Pantagruel</hi> seeing that, most gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly displayed the vigour of his armes, and according to the Art of the axe, gave him with the great end of his mast a homethrust a little above the breast: then bringing along the blow to the left side, with a slash struck him between the neck and shoulders: After that, advancing his right foot, he gave him a push upon the couillons, with the upper end of his said mast, wherewith breaking the scuttle, on the top thereof he spilt three or
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:29535:100"/>
foure punchons of wine that were left therein.</p>
            <p>Upon that <hi>Loupgarou</hi> thought that he had pierced his bladder, and that the wine that came forth had been his urine: <hi>Pantagruel</hi> being not content with this, would have doubled it by a side-blow; but <hi>Loupgarou</hi> lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his mace, advanced one step upon him, and with all his force would have dash't it upon <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> wherein (to speak the truth) he so sprightfully carried himself, that if God had not succoured the good <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel,</hi> he had been cloven from the top of his head to the bottom of his milt, but the blow glanced to the right side, by the brisk nimblenesse of <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and his mace sank into the ground above threescore and thirteen foot, through a huge rock, out of which the fire did issue greater then nine thousand and six tuns. <hi>Pantagruel</hi> seeing him busie about plucking out his mace, which stuck in the ground between the rocks, ran upon him, and would have clean cut off his head, if by mischance his mast had not touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little against the stock of <hi>Loupgarous</hi> mace, which was inchanted, as we have said before: by this meanes his mast broke off about three handfuls above his hand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at he stood amazed like a Bell-Founder, and cried out, Ah <hi>Panurge,</hi> where art thou? <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi> seeing that, said to the King and the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:29535:100"/>
Giants, By G—they will hurt one another, if they be not parted; but the Giants were as merry as if they had been at a wedding: then <hi>Carpalin</hi> would have risen from thence to help his Master; but one of the Giants said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, By <hi>Golfarin</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Mahoon,</hi> if thou stir hence I will put thee in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of my breeches, in stead of a Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, which cannot chuse but do me good; for in my belly I am very costive, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well <hi>cagar,</hi> without gnashing my teeth, and making many filthy faces. Then <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel,</hi> thus destitute of a staffe, took up the end of his mast, striking athwart and alongst upon the Giant, but he did him no more hurt then you would do with a filip upon a Smiths Anvil. In the time <hi>Loupgarou</hi> was drawing his mace out of the ground, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already plucked it out, was ready there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to have struck <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quick in turning, avoided all his blowes, in taking only the defensive part in hand, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til on a sudden he saw that <hi>Loupgarou</hi> did threaten him with these words, saying, Now, viliain, will not I faile to chop thee as small as minced meat, and keep thee henceforth from ever making any more poor men athirst; for then without any more ado, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> struck him such a blow with his foot against the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he made him fall backwards, his heels over his head, and dragged him thus along at
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:29535:101"/>
flay-buttock above a flight-shot. Then <hi>Loupgarou</hi> cried out, bleeding at the throat, <hi>Mahoon, Mahoon, Mahoon,</hi> at which noise all the Giants arose to succour him: but <hi>Panurge</hi> said unto them, Gentlemen, do not go, if you will beleeve me, for our Master is mad, and strikes athwart and alongst, he cares not where, he will do you a mischief; but the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants made no account of it, seeing that <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi> had never a staffe.</p>
            <p>And when <hi>Pantagruel</hi> saw those Giants ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach very near unto him, he took <hi>Loupga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou</hi> by the two feet, and lift up his body like a pike in the aire, wherewith (it being harnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Anvils) he laid such heavy load a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those Giants, armed with free stone, that striking them down as a Mason doth little knobs of stones, there was not one of them that stood before him, whom he threw not flat to the ground, and by the breaking of this stony armour there was made such a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible rumble, as put me in minde of the fall of the butter-tower of St. <hi>Stephens</hi> at <hi>Bourge,</hi> when it melted before the Sunne. <hi>Panurge,</hi> with <hi>Carpalin</hi> and <hi>Eusthenes,</hi> did cut in the mean time the throats of those that were struck down; in such sort that there escaped not one. <hi>Pantagruel</hi> to any mans sight was like a Mower, who with his sithe (which was <hi>Loupgarou,</hi>) cut down the meddow grasse (to wit the Giants,) but with this fencing of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruels,</hi>

               <hi>CHAP. XXX.</hi> How <hi>Epistemon,</hi> who had his head cut off, was finely healed by <hi>Panurge,</hi> and of the newes which he brought from the devils, and the damned people in hell.</head>
            <p>THis Gigantal victory being ended, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> withdrew himself to the place of the flaggons, and called for <hi>Panurge</hi> and the rest, who came unto him safe and sound, except <hi>Eusthenes,</hi> (whom one of the Giants had scratched a little in the face,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:29535:102"/>
whilest he about the cutting of his throat, and <hi>Epistemon,</hi> who appeared not at all: whereat <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was so aggrieved that he would have killed himself; but <hi>Panurge</hi> said unto him, Nay, Sir, stay a while, and we will search for him amongst the dead, and finde out the truth of all: thus as they went seeking after him, they found him stark dead, with his head between his armes all bloody. Then <hi>Eusthenes</hi> cried out, Ah cruel death! hast thou taken from me the perfectest amongst men? At which words <hi>Pantagruel</hi> rose up with the greatest grief that ever any man did see, and said to <hi>Panurge,</hi> Ha, my friend, the prophecy of your two glasses, and the jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin staffe was a great deal too deceitful, but <hi>Panurge</hi> answered, My dear bullies all, weep not one drop more, for he being yet all hot, <hi>I</hi> will make him as sound as ever he was; in saying this, he took the head, and held it warme fore-gainst his Codpiece, that the winde might not enter into it, <hi>Eusthenes</hi> and <hi>Carpalin</hi> carried the body to the place where they had banqueted, not out of any hope that ever he would recover, but that <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi> might see it.</p>
            <p>Neverthelesse <hi>Panurge</hi> gave him very good comfort, saying, If I do not heale him, I will be content to lose my head (which is a fooles wager,) leave off therefore crying and help me. Then cleansed he his neck very well
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:29535:102"/>
with pure white wine, and after that, took his head, and into it <hi>synapised</hi> some powder of <hi>diamerdis,</hi> which he alwayes carried about him in one of his bags. Afterwards, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed it with I know not what ointment, and set it on very just, veine against veine, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new against sinew, and spondyle against spondyle, that he might not be wry-necked, (for such people he mortally hated,) this done, he gave it round about some fifteen or sixteen stitches with a needle, that it might not fall off again, then on all sides, and every where he put a little ointment on it, which he called <hi>resuscitative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suddenly <hi>Epistemon</hi> began to breath, then opened his eyes, yawned, sneezed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards let a great houshold fart; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Panurge</hi> said, Now certainly he is healed, and therefore gave him to drink a large full glasse of strong white wine, with a sugred toast. In this fashion was <hi>Epistemon</hi> finely healed, only that he was somewhat hoarse for above three weeks together, and had a dry cough of which he could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>erid, but by the force of continual drinking: and now he began to speak, and said that he had seen the divel, had spoken with <hi>Lucifer</hi> familiarly, and had been very merry in hell, and in the <hi>Elysian</hi> fields, affirming very seriously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them all, that the devils were boone companions, and merry fellowes: but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:29535:103"/>
of the damned, he said he was very sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that <hi>Panurge</hi> had so soon called him back into this world again; for (said he) I took wonderful delight to see them: How so? said <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> because they do not use them there (said <hi>Epistemon</hi>) so badly as you think they do: their estate and condition of living is but only changed after a very strange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; for I saw <hi>Alexander</hi> the great there, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending and patching on clowts upon old breeches and stockins, whereby he got but a very poor living.</p>

            <p>When he saw me, he invited me to drink with him very courteously, and <hi>I</hi> being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be intreated, we tipled and chopined together most theologically.

No, no, said <hi>Epictetus,</hi> I do not use in my almes-giving to bestow farthings, hold thou Varlet, there's a crown for thee, be an honest man: <hi>Cyrus</hi> was exceeding glad to have met with such a bootie; but the other poor rogues, the Kings that are there below, as <hi>Alexander, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and others stole it away from him by night. I saw <hi>Pathelin</hi> the Treasurer of <hi>Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damantus,</hi> who in cheapening the pudding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyes that Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> cried, asked him, How much a dozen?

heretick, and would have caused him to be burnt alive, had it not been for <hi>Morgant,</hi> who for his <hi>Proficiat</hi> and other small fees gave him nine tuns of beer. Well (said <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel,</hi>) reserve all these faire stories for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, only tell us how the Usurers are there handled: I saw them (said <hi>Epistemon</hi>) all very busily employed in seeking of rustie pins, and old nailes in the kennels of the streets, as you see poor wretched rogues do in this world; but the <hi>quintal</hi> or hundred weight of this old iron ware, is there valued but at the price of a cantle of bread, and yet they have but a very bad dispatch and rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in the sale of it: thus the poor Misers are sometimes three whole weeks, without eating one morsel or crumb of bread, and yet work both day and night looking for the faire to come: neverthelesse, of all this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, toile and misery they reckon nothing, so cursedly active they are in the prosecution of that their base calling, in hopes at the end of the yeare, to earne some scurvie penny by it.</p>
            <p>Come, (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) let us now make our selves merry one bout, and drink (my Lads) <hi>I</hi> beseech you, for it is very good drinking all this moneth: then did they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease their flaggons by heaps and dozens, and with their leaguer-provision made excellent good chear: but the poor King <hi>Anarchus</hi>

could not all this while settle himselfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any fit of mirth; whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi> said, Of what trade shall we make my Lord the King here, that he may be skilful in the Art, when he goes thither to sojourn, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all the devils of hell?

            <p>AFter this wonderful victory, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> sent <hi>Carpalin</hi> unto the City of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maurots,</hi> to declare and signifie unto them how the King <hi>Anarchus</hi> was taken prisoner, and all the enemies of the City overthrown, which news when they heard, all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the City came forth to meet him in good order, and with a great triumphant pomp, conducting him with a heavenly joy
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:29535:107"/>
into the City, where innnumerable bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires were set on, thorough all the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and faire round tables which were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with store of good victuals, set out in the middle of the streets; this was a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the golden age in the time of <hi>Saturn,</hi> so good was the cheere which then they made.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Pantagruel</hi> having assembled the whole Senate, and Common Councel-men of the town, said (My Masters) we must now strike the iron whilest it is hot; it is therefore my will, that before we frolick it any longer, we advise how to assault and take the whole Kingdom of the <hi>Dipsodes:</hi> to which effect let those that will go with me provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against to morrow after drinking; for then will I begin to march, not that <hi>I</hi> need any more men then I have to help me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer it; for I could make it as sure that way as if <hi>I</hi> had it already, but <hi>I</hi> see this City is so full of inhabitants, that they scarce can turn in the streets; <hi>I</hi> will therefore carry them as a Colonie into <hi>Dipsodie,</hi> and will give them all that Countrey, which is fair, wealthie, fruitful and pleasant, above all other Countreys in the world as many of you can tell who have been there heretofore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every one of you therefore that will go along, let him provide himself as <hi>I</hi> have said. This counsel and resolution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing published in the City, the next morning
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:29535:108"/>
there assembled in the <hi>piazza,</hi> before the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, to the number of eighteen hundred fifty six thousand and eleven, besides women and little children: thus began they to marc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> straight into <hi>Dipsodie,</hi> in such good order as did the people of <hi>Israel</hi> when they departed out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to passe over the red-sea.</p>
            <p>But before we proceed any further in this purpose, I will tell you how <hi>Panurge</hi> handled his prisoner the King <hi>Anarchus:</hi> for having remembred that which <hi>Epistemon</hi> had rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, how the Kings and rich men, in this world were used in the <hi>Elysian</hi> fields, and how they got their living there by base and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble trades; he therefore one day apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his King in a pretty little canvass doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, all jagged and pinked like the tippet of a light horsemans cap, togethet with a paire of large Mariners breeches, and stockins without shoes; For (said he) they would but spoile his sight; and a little peach-coloured bonnet, with a great capons feather in it: I lie, for <hi>I</hi> think he had two: and a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some girdle of a sky-colour and green, (in <hi>French</hi> called <hi>pers &amp; vert</hi>) saying, that such a livery did become him well, for that he had alwayes been <hi>perverse:</hi> and in this plight bringing him before <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> said unto him, Do you know this royster? No indeed, said <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> It is (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) my Lord, the King of the three batches, or thread-bare
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:29535:108"/>
sovereign: <hi>I</hi> intend to make him an honest man. These devillish Kings which we have here are but as so many calves, they know nothing, and are good for nothing, but to do a thousand mischiefs to their poor sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and to trouble all the world with warre for their unjust and detestable pleasure: I will put him to a trade, and make him a Crier of green sauce: Go to, begin and cry, <hi>Do you lack any green sauce?</hi> and the poor devil cried: That is too low (said <hi>Panurge;</hi>) then took him by the eare, saying, Sing higher in <hi>Gesolreut:</hi> So, so, (poor devil) thou hast a good throat: thou wert never so happy as to be no longer King: and <hi>Pantagruel</hi> made himself merry with all this; for I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, that he was the best little gafer that was to be seen between this and the end of a staffe. Thus was <hi>Anarchus</hi> made a good Crier of green sauce, two dayes thereafter <hi>Panurge</hi> married him with an old Lanterne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrying Hag, and he himselfe made the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with fine sheeps-heads, brave haslets with mustard, gallant salligots with garlick, of which he sent five horse-loads unto <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel,</hi> which he ate up all, he found them so appetizing: and for their drink, they had a kinde of small well-watered wine, and some sorbapple-cider: and to make them dance he hired a blinde man, that made musick to them with a windbroach.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:29535:109"/>After dinner he led them to the Palace, and shewed them to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and said, pointing to the married woman, You need not feare that she will <hi>crack:</hi> Why? said <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel:</hi> Because, said <hi>Panurge,</hi> she is well slit and broke up already; What do you mean by that? said <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> Do not you see? said <hi>Panurge,</hi> that the chestnuts which are roasted in the fire, if they be whole, they <hi>crack</hi> as if they were mad; and to keep them from <hi>cracking,</hi> they make an incision in them, and slit them; so this new Bride is in her lower parts well slit before, and therefore will not crack behinde.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pantagruel</hi> gave them a little lodge near the lower street, and a mortar of stone wherein to bray and pound their sauce, and in this manner did they do their little businesse, he being as pretty a Crier of green sauce, as ever was seene in the Countrey of <hi>Utopia:</hi> but <hi>I</hi> have been told since that his wife doth beat him like plaister, and the poor sot dare not defend himself, he is so simple.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XXXII.</hi> How <hi>Pantagruel</hi> with his tongue covered a whole Army, and what the Author saw in his mouth.</head>
            <p>THus as <hi>Pantagruel</hi> with all his Army had entered into the Countrey of the <hi>Dipsodes,</hi> every one was glad of it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently rendred themselves unto him, bringing him out of their own good wills the Keyes of all the Cities where he went, the <hi>Almirods</hi> only excepted, who being resolved to hold out against him, made answer to his Heraulds that they would not yield but upon very honourable and good conditions.</p>
            <p>What? (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) do they ask any better termes, then the hand at the pot, and the glasse in their fist? Come let us go sack them, and put them all to the sword: then did they put themselves in good order, as being fully determined to give an assault, but by the way passing through a large field, they were overtaken with a great shower of raine, whereat they began to shiver and tremble, to croud, presse and thrust close to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. When <hi>Pantagruel</hi> saw that, he made their Captains tell them, that it was nothing,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:29535:110"/>
and that he saw well above the clouds, that it would be nothing but a little dew; but howsoever, that they should put themselves in order, and he would cover them: then did they put themselves in a close order, and stood as near to other as they could: and <hi>Pantagruel</hi> drew out his tongue only half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes and covered them all, as a hen doth her chickens. In the mean time I, who relate to you these so veritable stories, hid my self under a burdock-leafe, which was not much lesse in largenesse then the arch of the bridge of <hi>Montrible;</hi> but when I saw them thus covered, I went towards them to shelter my self likewise, which I could not do; for that they were so (as the saying is) <hi>At the yards end there is no cloth left.</hi> Then as well as <hi>I</hi> could, I got upon it, and went along full two leagues upon his tongue, and so long marched, that at last I came into his mouth: but oh gods and goddesses, what did I see there? <hi>Iupiter</hi> confound me with his trisulk lightning if I lie: I walked there as they do in <hi>Sophie</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and saw there great rocks like the mountains in <hi>Denmark,</hi> I beleeve that those were his teeth, <hi>I</hi> saw also faire meddows, large forrests, great and strong Cities, not a jot lesse then <hi>Lyons</hi> or <hi>Poictiers,</hi> the first man <hi>I</hi> met with there, was a good honest fellow planting coleworts, whereat being very much amazed, <hi>I</hi> asked him, My
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:29535:110"/>
friend, what dost thou make here? I plant coleworts, said he: But how, and wherewith said I? Ha Sir, said he, every one cannot have his ballocks as heavy as a mortar, neither can we be all rich: thus do <hi>I</hi> get my poor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and carry them to the market to sell in the City which is here behinde Jesus! (said <hi>I</hi>) is there here a new world? Sure (said he) it is never a jot new, but it is commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that without this there is an earth, whereof the inhabitants enjoy the light of a Sunne and a Moone, and that it is full of, and replenished with very good commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but yet this is more ancient then that: Yea, but (said I) my friend, what is the name of that City, whither thou car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riest thy Coleworts to sell? It is called <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharage,</hi> (said he) and all the indwellers are Christians, very honest men, and will make you good chear. To be brief, I resolved to go thither. Now in my way, I met with a fellow that was lying in wait to catch pigeons, of whom <hi>I</hi> asked, (My friend) from whence come these pigeons? Sir, (said he) they come from the other world: then I thought, that when <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi> yawned, the pigeons went into his mouth in whole flocks, thinking that it had been a pigeon-house.</p>
            <p>Then I went into the City, which <hi>I</hi> found faire, very strong, and seated in a good air<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

but at my entry the guard demanded of me my passe or ticket: whereat <hi>I</hi> was much astonished, and asked them, (My Masters) is there any danger of the plague here? O Lord, (said they) they die hard by here so fast, that the cart runs about the streets; Good God! (said <hi>I</hi>) and where? whereunto they answered that it was in <hi>Larinx</hi> and <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinx,</hi> which are two great Cities, such as <hi>Rowen</hi> and <hi>Nants,</hi> rich and of great trading: and the cause of the plague was by a stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and infectious exhalation, which lately vapoured out of the abismes, whereof there have died above two and twenty hundred and threescore thousand and sixteen persons within this sevennight; then <hi>I</hi> considered, calculated and found, that it was a rank and unsavoury breathing, which came out of <hi>Pantagruels</hi> stomack, when he did eat so much garlick, as we have aforesaid.</p>
            <p>Parting from thence, I past amongst the rocks, which were his teeth, and never left walking till <hi>I</hi> got up on one of them; and there <hi>I</hi> found the pleasantest places in the world, great large tennis-Courts, faire gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, sweet meddows, store of Vines, and an infinite number of banqueting summer out-houses in the fields, after the <hi>Italian</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, full of pleasure and delight, where I stayed full foure moneths, and never made better cheer in my life as then. After that I
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:29535:111"/>
went down by the hinder teeth to comt to the chaps; but in the way <hi>I</hi> was robbed by thieves in a great forrest, that is in the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory towards the eares: then (after, a little further travelling) <hi>I</hi> fell upon a pretty pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty village, (truly <hi>I</hi> have forgot the name of it) where <hi>I</hi> was yet merrier then ever, and got some certain money to live by, can you tell how? by sleeping; for there they hire men by the day to sleep, and they get by it six pence a day, but they that can snort hard get at least nine pence. How <hi>I</hi> had been robbed in the valley <hi>I</hi> inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Senators, who told me that in very truth the people of that side were bad li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and naturally theevish, whereby I perceived well, that as we have with us the Countreys <hi>cisalpin</hi> and <hi>transalpine,</hi> that is, behither and beyond the mountains, so have they there the Countreys <hi>cidentine</hi> and <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentine,</hi> that is, behither and beyond the teeth: but it is farre better living on this side, and the aire is purer. There <hi>I</hi> began to think, that it is very true which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said, that the one half of the world know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not how the other half liveth; seeing none before my self had ever written of that Countrey, wherein are above five and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Kingdomes inhabited, besides deserts, and a great arme of the sea: concerning which purpose, <hi>I</hi> have composed a great book inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled

            <p>At last I was willing to return, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by his beard, I cast my self upon his shoulders, and from thence slid down to the ground, and fell before him: assoon as I was perceived by him, he asked me, Whence comest thou, <hi>Alc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A While after this the good <hi>Pantagruel</hi> fell sick, and had such an obstruction in his stomack, that he could neither eate nor drink: and because mischief seldome comes alone, a hot pisse seised on him, which tormented him more then you would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve: His Physicians neverthelesse helped him very well, and with store of lenitives and diuretick drugs made him pisse away his paine: his urine was so hot, that since that time it is not yet cold, and you have of it in divers places of <hi>France,</hi> according to the course that it took, and they are called the hot Baths, as</p>

            </p>
            <p>At St. <hi>Bartolomee</hi> in the County of <hi>Boulogne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the <hi>Lorrette,</hi> and a thousand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places.</p>
            <p>And <hi>I</hi> wonder much at a rabble of foolish Philosophers and Physicians, who spend their time in disputing, whence the heat of the said waters cometh, whether it be by reason of <hi>Borax,</hi> or sulphur, or allum, or salt-peter that is within the mine; for they do nothing but dote, and better were it for them to rub their arse against a thistle, then to waste away their time thus in disputing of that, whereof they know not the original; for the resolution is easie, neither need we to enquire any further, then that the said baths came by a hot pisse of the good <hi>Pantagruel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to tell you after what manner he was cured of his principal disease; <hi>I</hi> let passe how for a <hi>minorative,</hi> or gentle potion, he took foure hundred pound weight of <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoniack Scammonee:</hi> six score and eighteen cart-loads of <hi>Cassia:</hi> an eleven thousand and nine hundred pound weight of <hi>Rubarb,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides other confused jumblings of sundry drugs: You must understand, that by the advice of the <hi>Physicians,</hi> it was ordained that what did offend his stomach should be taken away; and therefore they made seventeen great balls of copper, each whereof was big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:29535:113"/>
then that which is to be seen on the top of St. <hi>Peters</hi> needle at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in such sort, that they did open in the midst, and shut with a spring. Into one of them entered one of his men carrying a Lanterne and a torch lighted, and so <hi>Pantagruel</hi> swallowed him down like a little pill: into seven others went seven Countrey-fellows, having every one of them a shovel on his neck: into nine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers entred nine wood-carriers, having each of them a basket hung at his neck, and so were they swallowed down like pills: when they were in his stomack, every one undid his spring, and came out of their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins: the first whereof was he that carried the Lantern, and so they fell more then half a league into a most horrible gulph, more stinking and infectious then ever was <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitis,</hi> or the marishes of <hi>Camerina,</hi> or the abominably unsavoury lake of <hi>Sorbona,</hi> whereof <hi>Strabo</hi> maketh mention. And had it not been, that they had very well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidoted their stomach, heart and wine-pot, which is called the noddle, they had been altogether suffocated and choaked with these detestable vapours. O what a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume! O what an evaporation wherewith to beray the masks or muflers of young mangie queans: after that with groping and smelling they came near to the fecal matter and the corrupted humours; finally
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:29535:114"/>
they found a <hi>montjoy</hi> or heap of ordure and filth: then fell the Pioneers to work to dig it up, and the rest with their shovels filled the baskets; and when all was cleansed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one retired himself into his ball.</p>
            <p>This done, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> enforcing himself to a vomit, very easily brought them out, and they made no more shew in his mouth, then a fart in yours: but when they came merrily out of their pills, I thought upon the <hi>Grecians</hi> coming out of the <hi>Trojan</hi> horse: by this meanes was he healed, and brought unto his former state and convalescence; and of these brazen pills, or rather cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-balls, you have one at <hi>Orleans,</hi> upon the steeple of the Holy Crosse Church.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XXXIV.</hi> The Conclusion of this present Book, and the excuse of the Author.</head>
            <p>NOw (my Masters) you have heard a beginning of the horrifick history of my Lord and Master <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> Here will I make an end of the first book; My head akes a little, and I perceive that the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of my braine, are somewhat jumbled and disordered with this septembral juice. You shall have the rest of the history at <hi>Franckfort mart</hi> next coming, and there shall you see how <hi>Panurge</hi> was married and made a Cuckold within a moneth after his wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: how <hi>Pantagruel</hi> found out the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers stone, the manner how he found it, and the way how to use it: how he past o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Caspian</hi> mountaines, and how he sailed thorough the <hi>Atlantick</hi> sea, defeated the <hi>Cannibals,</hi> and conquered the isles of <hi>Perles,</hi> how he married the daughter of the King of <hi>India,</hi> called <hi>Presian,</hi> how he fought against the devil, and burnt up five cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of hell, ransacked the great black chamber, threw <hi>Proserpina</hi> into the fire,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:29535:115"/>
broke five teeth to <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and the horne that was in his arse. How he visited the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the Moon, to know whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Moon were not entire and whole, or if the women had three quarters of it in their heads, and a thousand other little mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments all veritable. These are brave things truly; Good night, Gentlemen, <hi>Perdonate mi,</hi> and think not so much upon my faults, that you forget your own. If you say to me, (Master) it would seem that you were not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wise in writing to us these flimflam stories, and pleasant fooleries:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> answer you, that you are not much wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser to spend your time in reading them: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse, if you read them to make your selves merry, as in manner of pastime <hi>I</hi> wrote them, you and <hi>I</hi> both are farre more worthy of pardon, then a great rabble of squint-minded fellowes, dissembling and counterfeit Saints, demure lookers, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, pretended zealots, tough Fryars, bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin-Monks, and other such sects of men, who disguise themselves like Maskers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the world, for whilest they give the common people to understand, that they are busied about nothing but contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and devotion in fastings, and maceration of their sensuality; and that only to sustain and aliment the small frailty of their humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: It is so far otherwise, that on the contrary
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:29535:115"/>
(God knows) what cheer they make, <hi>Et Curios simulant, sed bacchanalia vivunt.</hi> You may reade it in great letters, in the colouring of their red snowts, and gulching bellies as big as a tun, unlesse it be when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume themselves with sulphur; as for their study it is wholly taken up in reading of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruelin</hi> books, not so much to passe the time merrily, as to hurt some one or other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievously, to wit, in <hi>articling, sole-articling, wry-neckifying, buttock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> stirring, ballocking,</hi> and <hi>diabliculating,</hi> that is, calumniating; wherein they are like unto the poor rogues of a village, that are busie in stirring up and scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the ordure and filth of little children, in the season of cherries and guinds, and that only to finde the kernels, that they may sell them to the druggists, to make thereof po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander-oile Fly from these men, abhorre and hate them as much as <hi>I</hi> do, and upon my faith you will finde your selves the better for it. And if you desire to be good <hi>Pantagru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el sts</hi> (that is to say, to live in peace, joy, health, making your selves alwayes merry) never trust those men that alwayes peep out at one hole.</p>
