         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Q. But why bee Lovers for the moſt

            <p>Q. What meaneth it that Lovers bee

            <p>Q. Why be women more proue to Love,

            <p>A. Women of feeble ſight love them that
be blacke, becauſe blackneſſe doth joyne
and unite the ſight too much diſparkled,
and by this meanes doth comfort the ſame:
Or elſe we may well ſay, that every thing
doth love and deſire his like. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

their husbands be alwayes in their fantaſie,

            <p>Q. Wherefore be young women more

Q. What be the conditions that an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Lady ought to have?</p>
            <p>A. That ſhe be not covetous, that ſhe
be courteous and eaſie to be ſpoken unto,
neate and ſecret in her doings.</p>
            <p>Q. What properties be requiſite in a
Lady that right well may bee called faire?</p>
            <p>A. That ſhe have a faire and a comely
perſonage, a faire neck, a ſmall body, a little
mouth, and white teeth and cleane.</p>
            <p>Q. Is this a proverbe good? Love him
that will love thee?</p>
            <p>A. Yea very good: for he is a beaſt that
will not love, being beloved.</p>
            <p>Q. Whether is the man or the woman
more ſubject to love.</p>
            <p>A. That queſtion is very evident, a man
is ſooner taken and wrapt in love then a
woman. For we ſee that the man, which is
borne to a thouſand good and great enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes,
doth for loves ſake abandon all glory
and honour that he may receive.</p>
            <p>Q. Why have the ancient and they of
theſe dayes, painted love with wings?</p>
            <p>A. To declare that the deſires of Lovers
be high, and labour to attaine high and
great enterprizes.</p>

Q. Who deſerveth more to bee favoured
of love: the faire of ſimple and honeſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or the foule that is ſage, crafty, and

            <p>A. Prudence is the beauty of the mind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

            <p>Q. Can love be without Iealouſie?</p>
            <p>A. I thinke not. For teſtimony whereof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
Souldier, then of a learned man?</p>
            <p>A. Souldiers be more liberall, and not
ſo ſubtill as Schollers be, more eaſie to be
allured with enticements of women. There
is no Souldier ſo brave, if a woman ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him: that he hath a faire beard, that his

comely on horſebacke, ſtrong to encounter
and overthrow his enemy, but incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doth give over and ſubmit himſelfe unto
her will and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Q. What is the cauſe, that many deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
their wives, be ſo fond vpon curtezan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:173635:28"/>
A. The Curtezans ſuffer not themſelves
to be ſeene, except they be firſt painted, but
wives muſt often be ſeene of their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
which cauſeth them to ſeeme not
to be ſo faire. Or we may ſay that wives
continually be at their husbands backes,
miſuſing them with vile and unſeemely
words, which maketh them to taſt of other
meates, and cauſeth them to imagine a
thouſand other appetites and luſts.</p>
            <p>Q. Wherefore have Lovers ſo feeble
voyces?</p>
            <p>A. Of the feare that they haue to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
their Ladies. And therewithall the
unequall motions wherewith their Spirits
are moved, which forceth this feebleneſſe
of voyce.</p>
            <p>Q. VVhether doth Love ſhew her grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
force, either in making the foole to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

man, to become a beaſt?</p>
            <p>A. If there be more paine to breake down,
then to build: I beleeve there ſhall be more
adoe' to reſtore wiſedome to him that hath
loſt it, then newly to make him wiſe. For

may be comprehended and knowne; ſo
that without great paine and difficulty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it cannot be hidden.</p>
            <p>Q. From whence doe the amorous
ſend forth ſo many ſighes?</p>
            <p>A. Their continuall thoughts ſend
all the heate to the heart, whereof it
commeth, that neceſſarily it is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for them to reſpire and breathe,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:173635:35"/>
of which reſpiration, ſighings be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced:
whereby the coldneſſe of the ayre
is drawne to temper the inward heate.
That may alſo riſe of the conſideration
of the time loſt, of the deteſtation that
commeth of lecherie, of the diminution
of honour and reputation; and finally,
that the ſucceſſe of diſhoneſt loue, is tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall,
noyſome, furious, and miſerable.</p>
            <p>Q. Wherefore have the ancient pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Love holding Flowers in one hand,
and Fiſh in the other?</p>
            <p>A. To ſhew that Loue is a Lord both
of ſea and land.</p>
            <p>Q. Thinke you that Love doth yeeld
greater force, courage and ſtrength, to
him that doth combat and fight in the
preſence of his Ladie?</p>
            <p>A. There is nothing more certaine.
And for this cauſe was brought in and
ordained the brave and luſty company
of the errant and wandering Knights,
to give pleaſure to Ladies by Juſts and
Tournies.</p>
            <p>Q. Who receiueth moſt contentation,
the victorious and loving Knight, or the

            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:173635:36"/>
A. The Knight as I ſuppoſe ought
to be beſt contented, as having cauſe to
content himſelfe with his owne act and
deed of Chiualry. For he that doth beſt,
is worthy of greater praiſe: And he that
runneth beſt for his Ladies ſake, is beſt
worthy to enjoy her.</p>
            <p>Q. Wherefore doe amorous Ladies
impute that to fortune which chanceth

Allegories, which after my judgement

               <hi>Q.</hi> Wherefore was <hi>Paris</hi> deſirous to
ſee the three Goddeſſes naked, when he
was appointed arbitrator of their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</p>
            <p>A. To giue better judgement by
viewing the proportion of their bodies.
O how many faire and beautifull be
there in outward appearance, which
vnder their ſumptuous garments and

Q. What mooved the ancient to ſay;
that Love is Lord ouer gods and men?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe all that which is made
either in heaven or in earth, is made for
Love. Remember what the Philoſopher

doe love and deſire.</hi>

ſhould have faces of Angels, and heads
of Divels?</p>

            <p>Q. Is there any difference betweene
the grace of a woman and her beauty, or
whether be they all one?</p>
            <p>A. I beleeue that there is a difference;
for the one hath a greater force then the
other to cauſe a man to be content and
ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Q. Whether is it a greater adventure
to get the grace of a faire woman, or
elſe to recover it, if it were loſt?</p>
            <p>A. Jt is a greater act to recover it as
J beleeue, women being of their owne

A. They which be faire deſire to have
faire ſervants. Rich, thoſe that have

that be learned: But moſt-commonly
riches is beſt liked of women for their

continually the things that he loveth?</p>

            <p>A. Why not: ſith it is nouriſhed onely

            <p>Q. Is the ſervice of Love more
trouble ſome then others?</p>
            <p>A. In effect it is more weighty and
troubleſome: but in will much more
eaſie to be diſgeſted.</p>
            <p>Q. What is it that pacifieth Lovers

               <hi>A.</hi> A ſtedfaſt and a conſtant faith.</p>
            <p>Q. The Lover that is loved, is he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
Servant or a Maſter?</p>
            <p>A. He is rather a Servant then a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
for ſo much as he is clogged with
a double chaine. To love and to be
loved by two chaines, although that the
one be voluntary and the other by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
            <p>Q. Doe you thinke that a woman
without the prejudice and hurt of honor,
may ſatisfie one that hath ſerved her a
long time and ſeaſon?</p>
            <p>A. J dare not ſay without prejudice.
But yet I will affirme that ſhe is to be

            <p>Q. Which is the greateſt ingratitude
that may chance in love?</p>
            <p>A. Not to reward at all his Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>Q. Why is the ſervice of Love worthy
of greater rewards then other?</p>
            <p>A. Becauſe the longer one continueth
therein, the greater bitterneſſe he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
and ſuffereth.</p>
            <p>Q. Thinke ye that Love hath placed
his principall treaſure in women?</p>
            <p>A. J beleeve ſo, becauſe it hath
given them the Soveraignty above all
men.</p>
            <p>Q. Who is the moſt fortunate in
love: the Attendant, or the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor?</p>
            <p>A. The poſſeſſor hath one conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
but the attendant hath more then
a thouſand.</p>
            <p>Q. Is Love the cauſe of good or
evill?</p>
            <p>A. Of good, ſeeing he maketh fooles

            <p>Q. Why doe men ſay that Love is a

            <p>Q. Why doe men ſay, that a faire
woman is a monſter in beauty?</p>
            <p>A. Becauſe it is as rare thing as Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
be.</p>
            <p>Q. Doe Courtizans love, or doe they
faine to love?</p>
            <p>A. There be many reaſons to ſay
that they love not, but experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
the contrary, for J knew them
that be madde for love, and others that

out another, ſo they make and cauſe
them to forget their firſt.</p>
            <p>Q. Whereof commeth it that many
Lovers, the more they be ill intreated
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:173635:48"/>
of their Ladies, the more they be infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in their Love?</p>
            <p>A. That commeth of a certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
of Nature. Or we may well ſay,
that all Lovers be not maſters over
themſelves.</p>
            <p>Q. Whereof doth it come, that the
woman is more, Iealous then the
man?</p>
            <p>A. Becauſe ſhe is more fearefull, and
ſuſpicious: or elſe becauſe ſhe loveth
with leſſe diſcretion then the man.</p>
            <p>Q. Whether is it more difficult to
flye love, or to diſſemble it, when one i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A. He that loveth not at all, nor is

where love ruleth and maſtereth, it hath
ſuch force, that in deſpite of us he doth

with a window or a gate in his ſtomack,
wherein were written theſe two words:
<hi>Farre off, and at hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. To ſhew that he which is a Lover
muſt love as well in abſence as in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
            <p>Q. But why was he painted bare hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:173635:59"/>
A. To ſhew that betweene Lovers there

with the face of a man, and not of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant?</p>
            <p>A. To ſhew that a Lover ought to be

Painter <hi>Zeuxis</hi> did paint him with

hope: and greene doth ſignifie no other
thing then hope.</p>
            <p>Q. But why doth he ſet upon the
borders of his Robe theſe words: <hi>Death
and Life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe that true Love dureth
both in life, and alſo after death, and
breaketh never for any accident that
may happen.</p>
            <p>Q. And wherefore did <hi>Appelles</hi> paint
him with theſe words written in his
forehead: <hi>Spring time and Summer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> To ſhew that in love there is both

Q. VVherefore doe they give him
wings?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe the deſires of Lovers doe
tend alwayes to high things.</p>
            <p>Q. Wherefore doe they make him a
Child?</p>
            <p>A. Becauſe that whoſoever doth give
himſelfe to love, hath no underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for moſt commonly he loſeth for
a thing of nought, matters weighty and
of great importance.</p>
            <p>Q. What mooved the inhabitants of
<hi>Cypres,</hi> to paint Love, having a Turkie
bow behind his backe, and his arrowes
before?</p>
            <p>A. It was becauſe that Love hath a
cuſtome to wound all them that hee
meeteth. And becauſe that he ſecretly
doth the ſame, they place the Turkie
bow behind his backe.</p>
            <p>Q. Wherefore be his arrowes never
blunt, but ſharpe?</p>
            <p>A. Becauſe they ſhould wound the
better and enter more deepely, for they
make him ſore, to feele that he is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with them.</p>
            <p>Q. How commeth it that one looke is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:173635:60"/>
more hurtfull to Lovers, and woundeth
them more then any touching or talke?</p>
            <p>A. That is, becauſe Love taketh his
beginning of looking.</p>
            <p>Q. Why doe Lovers waxe ſo ſoone
pale and leane?</p>
            <p>A. The paſſions of the mind doe
bring the body to a poore eſtate.</p>
            <p>Q. Whereof commeth it, that Poſtes,
Ryders, Weavers, and generally they
which be accuſtomed to great agitation
of the body, be more veneriall then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</p>
            <p>A. Moving doth heate the reynes
and the veſſels of generation. Travell
alſo doth open the conduits where the
ſeed doth paſſe &amp; it is not to be doubted,
but cold doth cauſe the humours to be
in a manner unmoveable, letting the
ſeed from comming to the generative
parts:</p>
            <p>Q. Whereof commeth it, that men of
hote, ſtrong, and good complexion, abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
from copulation with women, doe
commonly fall into the fluxe, or have the
yealow Iaundoſe, or be troubled with
immoderate choller?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:173635:60"/>
A. Men with their ſeed doe avoid
certaine corrupt humours, the which
remaining in the body, be converted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into choller, or elſe into the yealow
Jaundiſe.</p>
            <p>Q. VVhat is the cauſe that Harlots
and whores doe ſmell ſo rammiſh?</p>
            <p>A. Becauſe they ſildome retaine their
ſeed, which being out of the Matrix doth
corrupt and ſtincke.</p>
            <p>Q. Is it lawfull for a Lover to take
his pleaſure with any other beſides his
owne Lady?</p>
            <p>A. I anſwer no. Nevertheleſſe his
Lady being abſent and he cannot enjoy
her, he may have liberty to uſe another
if ſhe reſemble his owne in ſuch perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
as ſhe may be tearmed a ſecond La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
but not in any wiſe to fixe his
heart upon her. Hee then, I
ſay, I that uſeth ſuch a one in his
Ladies ahſence is the rather to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
but neither of them is to be admitted
in my judgement, if he meane to deſerve
the title of a true Lover.</p>
            <p>Q. Tell me then, what thing is Love?</p>
            <p>A. It is a paſſion that doth blind
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:173635:61"/>
the ſpirits, removeth the underſtanding,
taketh all the memory away, cauſeth
ruine and loſſe of goods, maketh a man
weake, and is the enemy of youth, and
the death of old age, the mother of all
vices, the receptacle of penſive minds:
a thing without reaſon, without order
and ſtability, and the whirlepoole of
mans liberty.</p>
            <p>Q. What are divers women of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>
            <p>A. Beaſts unperfect, given to tenne
thouſand paſſions and pleaſures, abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
to be thought well of. So that if
men would doe as they ought to doe,
they would not follow them nor purſue

               </gap>ite, but
as things inevitable, which neceſſity
doth conſtraine them to uſe.</p>
            <p>Q. VVherefore be there ſo few women
that can content themſelves to love
one?</p>
            <p>A. Becauſe moſt of them are given
to luſt, inſatiable. And for this cauſe they
care neither for number, nor for any

            <p>Q. Why doe women count them beaſts
that be over curious and diligent to

unworthy of ſuch ſervice.</p>
            <p>Q. Is it true that men ſay, when one

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Without doubt the ſecret wiſe,

is of little continuance.</p>
            <p>Q. How ſhould men keepe themſelves
ſecret in love?</p>
            <p>A. They muſt take heed that they
paſſe not oftentimes by their Lovers
houſes, or often follow their haunt, but

waite untill Fortune preſent apt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Q. How ſhould our pleaſures be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured?</p>
            <p>A. They ought to agree with our

place where we be.</p>
            <p>Q. What ſhould be the faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

            <p>A. It ought to be neceſſary and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
with the heart and the life.</p>

others which have more amiable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</p>
            <p>A. They doe eſteeme perhaps that
they ſhall be better beloved and ſerved
of thoſe meaner ſpirits, becauſe they
have not ſuch knowledge as the other
which are of more underſtanding then

And men may alſo enjoy the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

            <p>A. They would ſignifie by that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſe
no other thing, but the
wanton and laſcivious allurements of
<hi>Circe,</hi> wherewith deteining all thoſe
that fell into her hands, ſhe ſo farre forth

            <p>Q. How ſhould a man behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

            <p>A. As in the Court amongſt Princes

            <p>Q. Is it very true, that he muſt needs
be bold and full of audacity?</p>
            <p>A. After my opinion no: but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as a man may uſe himſelfe, I ſay
yea. Notwithſtanding I ſuppoſe that in
the Court and traine of Princes, and in
the ſervice of Ladies, men ought rather

affection to all thoſe things, which

            <p>A. That is too true, for they be in

engraven things, and ſuch like: if they
ſhew any remembrance of the thing
they love.</p>
            <p>Q. What is the true pledge of Love?</p>

            <p>A. Naturall heate cannot travell
both in digeſtion and ſpeculation at one

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The ſtomacke hath certaine ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
with the heart, the braine, and the

            <p>Q. Whereof commeth it, that ſome

            <p>A. That proceedeth of the heare that

which have the hicket, by retaining their

            <p>A. The blowing and breath retained,
doth heate the interior parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,

            <p>Q. Why doth wine mingled with

            <p>A. Mingled wine is noyſome to the

            <p>Q. Why be they ſo ſubject to ſickneſſe
that love to drinke ſtrong and mighty
wines?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Strong wine exceſſively drunke,
doth extinguiſh naturall heate, and
the liver being therewith weakened,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:173635:73"/>
cannot engender good blood, but doth
rather ingender a certaine aquoſitie and

into a Dropſie.</p>
            <p>Q. Why be not young children ſo
thirſty and dry, as men of greater age?</p>
            <p>A. The moiſtneſſe of young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
doth keepe them from being thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie.
For thirſt is nothing elſe but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of moiſtneſſe, whereupon they that
be of greater age be naturally more dry
and therefore more thirſty.</p>
            <p>Q. Whereof commeth it, that the
bottome of a Caldron or kettle is cold,
although ſcalding water remaine in it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is becauſe of the hot vapours
which mount on high, whereby the

water that is in it.</p>

which the Ants doe lay vpon the

            <p>A. Nature hath taught them to doe
ſo, to take away the growing thereof

            <p>Q. Wherefore doe the Phyſitians
ſay, that it is dangerous to let one blood

            <p>A. The veynes of groſſe men be

            <p>Q. Why be rich men more ſubject to
the gout then poore?</p>
            <p>A. Becauſe they ſtuffe themſelves
with many and divers meates, or that
they be too much idle, or elſe becauſe
they uſe not convenient exerciſe. The

            <p>Q. Wherefore is it not good to ſpeake
when one eateth?</p>
            <p>A. Becauſe ſpeech doth much let
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:173635:74"/>
and hinder the chawing of meate, or
elſe it is for feare of entring or falling
into ſome cough and ſtrangling.</p>
            <p>Q. VVhereof doth it come, that the
birds and fowles which be fat (in this
Countrey) if they take their flight into
the South parts, or into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> they
returne leaner then when they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</p>
            <p>A. The South parts bee hot and dry,
and doth dry that which dwelleth in
them. Or we may ſay, that in all places
that be hot and colde, both in Summer
and in Autumne there be found fruits
and ſeedes, and the dayes are more
longer.</p>
            <p>Q. VVhat is the cauſe that birdes doe

and in Autumne when they are fat and
in good liking they doe not breed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The ſpring time is a moderate
ſeaſon, and all living things at that time
be moſt temperate, and by that
meanes are more apt to generation.
Contrariwiſe, Autumne is colde and
dry, and by that meanes leſſe fit to that

upon the Seas, then when we travell on
foote or horſebacke?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe to ſayle vpon the Seas,

moving vnaccuſtomable, and all extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary

left?</p>
            <p>A. It is becauſe the male breedeth in
the right ſide: and ſo the menſtruall
blood comming to that ſide, to nouriſh
the child, maketh it more hard and
ſtiffe.</p>

blacke women?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Browne women are of hotter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
and therefore have their milke

            <p>A. Such is the appetite as the humours

            <p>A. The excrement the longer it tarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:173635:108"/>
A. Becauſe the opinion of the ſpirit

            <p>Q. Why did the <hi>Romanes</hi> deeme him
hurtfull to the Common-wealth, that
would not content himſelfe with ſeven
yokes of Land?</p>
            <p>A. After the Kings were chaſed from
<hi>Rome,</hi> the Romanes deſirous to content
themſelves with a little, to avoid all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of Tyranny, aſſigned every Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

            <p>Q. Why was it ſo long before the
<hi>Romanes</hi> did plant any <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ines?</p>
            <p>A. Becauſe they foreſaw, that wine
made them dull, debilitated their ſinues,
weakned their forces, troubled their
braines, and made them have a ſtinking
breath.</p>
            <p>Q. Whereof commeth it, that the

            <p>Q Why did the Romans eſteeme the

            <p>A. Becauſe the Peaſant and Country
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:173635:109"/>
man is more accuſtomed to ſleepe upon

hunger and thirſt.</p>

keepe, then he that rendereth not the
thing he borroweth?</p>
            <p>A. Becauſe there is nothing more
villanous, then a man to doe wrong to
his friend, for no man delivereth any
thing in keeping to any man, but to
him in whom he hath repoſed his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
truſt.</p>
            <p>Q. What meant the Romanes to have
no Bakers in their City, before the wars
of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> which was five hundred
and foureſcore yeares after the building
of <hi>Rome?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. The <hi>Romanes</hi> eſteemed the Science
of Baking to be but the worke of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>Q. But tell me I pray you, why had
they no Cookes as we have?</p>
            <p>A. Becauſe they are ſtrong and luſty

               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:173635:109"/>
Q. How chanceth it, that the drowned
bodies of men doe ſwimme vpwards, and
thoſe of women downewards?</p>
            <p>A. Nature her ſelfe hath a ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

            <p>A. The Scituation of <hi>Carthage</hi> did
cauſe the ſame. For by reaſon of the

had with all the Nations of the world,
they were very much uſed and frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

            <p>Q. But why were the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>

            <p>A. Becauſe they thought that the

Nations continually rather to love

our eyes what wee ought to

            <p>Q. Why doth the vice of anger daily
diſpleaſe the wiſe?</p>
            <p>A. Becauſe it is a ſpice of Folly and
Rage.</p>
            <p>Q. Wherefore ought the vertue of
Iuſtice to be in Princes commendable
above all other things?</p>
            <p>A. Becauſe it is the mother of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
But what ſhall be deemed of that

            <p>A. Becauſe they eate too much.</p>

make a Law, that whoſoever would goe
about by any law or ordinance to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
ſome new device or innovation in
their City, ought without remedy (the
Rope about his necke) to recite openly
before the people the law which he would
eſtabliſh, and the reaſon wherefore?</p>
            <p>A. That was to chaſtiſe and correct
thoſe that love novelties and new devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
for if the law propoſed pleaſed not
the people, or was found to be wrongfull
and unjuſt, the propoſer of the law had

Which ordinance and decree kept

            <p>Q. What meant the wiſe continually

that which he perceiveth indeed to be

that <hi>Ixion</hi> doth turne continually, as the

tables abroad for every man to view?</p>

they tell lyes in ſtead of truth, they doe
evill in ſtead of good, vice in ſtead of
vertue, and are ordained to deſtroy the
good, and thoſe that doe righteouſly.</p>
               <p>Q. Why would not <hi>Socrates</hi> ſuffer

that his flatteries were the cauſe that it
was ordained at <hi>Rome,</hi> that no King
ſhould come thither, without licence of
the Senate obtained before.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a vice proper and particular
to vile minds, to women and cowards:
for it proceedeth of nothing elſe but of

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a kind of feare to fall into
any infamy, or to be blamed for any
deed doing, or to be worthily reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for ſome fault. Therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> did
tearme it to bee the Tamer of evill
thoughts; for ſhe withdraweth man, and
preſerveth him from committing any
offence.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom ought a man to bee
ſhamefaſt?</p>
               <p>A. To children onely; for a man of
age it is vnmeet to bluſh, and to ſay, I
had not thought to doe it,</p>

not death.</p>
               <p>Q. What is death?</p>
               <p>A. Jt is an end: from which a man
ought not to retire, but to goe to it joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and as ſome ſay, it is a gift given
of God to men, by a ſingular grace.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did <hi>Mallius</hi> ſay in the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

and <hi>Aemilius,</hi> that envy was bleare-eyed,
and had a very evill ſight?</p>
               <p>A. Becauſe that the envious man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth
thoſe things which are next
him, and not them a farre off, which
ſhould bee more to be envied, if envie
were a vertue.</p>
               <p>Q. Why is Envy compared vnto fire?</p>
               <p>A. Becauſe it alwaies mounteth: for
there is no man ſo mighty, that Envie
will ſticke to aſſaile, and ſurmount him
alſo, if it be poſſible.</p>
               <p>Q. VVhat was the cauſe of the death
of <hi>Socrates,</hi> being ſo innocent a man?</p>
               <p>A. The envie of the Athenians: a
vſuall thing in that City which cauſed
alſo the death of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:173635:158"/>
                  <hi>Ariſtides</hi> the juſt?</p>

had his eyes put out by the Muſes?</p>
               <p>A. To declare that how mighty ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
a man be, he hath ſome body that
goeth about to make himſelfe equall
with him: which is a paſſion almoſt like
vnto Envie, but not ſo much different

                  </hi> Philoſopher put to him in paſtime.
And exceſſive thought ought not to fall

an Eagle alwaies to gnaw the heart

that he which procured to eſtabliſh new

The contrary of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy is inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
