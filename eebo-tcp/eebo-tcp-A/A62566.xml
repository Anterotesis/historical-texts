            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Eneral Persuasives to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and a good Life, and
Invectives against Sin and
Wickedness at large, are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
of good use to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
Religion and Virtue,
and to expose the deformity
and danger of a Vicious
course. But it must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleged
on the other hand, that these general
Discourses do not so immediately tend to reform
the Lives of men: Because they fall among the
Croud, but do not touch the Consciences of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Persons in so sensible and awakening a
manner as when we treat of particular Duties and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37934:3"/>
Sins, and endeavour to put men upon the practice
of the one, and to reclaim them from the other,
by proper Arguments taken from the Word of
God, and from the nature of particular Vertues
and Vices.</p>
            <p>The <hi>general</hi> way is, as if a Physician, instead
of applying particular Remedies to the Distemper
of his Patient, should entertain him with a long
discourse of Diseases in general, and of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and advantages of Health; and earnestly
persuade him to be well; without taking his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Disease into consideration, and prescribing
Remedies for it.</p>
            <p>But if we would effectually reform men, we
must take to task the great and common disorders
of their Lives, and represent their faults to them
in such a manner as may convince them of the
evil and danger of them, and put them upon
the endeavour of a cure.</p>
            <p>And to this end I have pitched upon one of
the common and reigning Vices of the Age, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny</hi>
and <hi>Evil-speaking;</hi> by which men contract
so much guilt to themselves, and create so much
trouble to others: And from which, it is to be
feared, few or none are wholly free. For <hi>who is
he,</hi> saith the Son of <hi>Sirach, that hath not offended
with his tongue?</hi> Ecclus. 19. 16. <hi>In many things,</hi>
saith St. <hi>James,</hi> James 3. 2. <hi>we offend all: And if
any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how few have attain'd to this perfection?
And yet unless we do endeavour after it, and in
some good measure attain it, all our pretence to
Religion is vain: So the same <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us,
James 1. 26. <hi>If any man among you seemeth to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his
own heart, that man's Religion is vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:37934:3"/>
For the more distinct handling of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I shall reduce my Discourse to these <hi>Five</hi>
Heads.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I shall consider the Nature of this Vice,
and wherein it consists.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I shall consider the due extent of this
Prohibition, <hi>To speak evil of no man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I shall shew the Evil of this practice,
both in the <hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I shall add some further Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to dissuade men from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I shall give some Rules and Directions
for the prevention and cure of it.</p>
            <p>I. I shall consider <hi>what this Sin or Vice of evil
speaking, here forbidden by the Apostle, is:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
not to defame and slander any man,
not to <hi>hurt his reputation,</hi> as the <hi>Etymology</hi> of the
word doth import. So that this Vice consists in
saying things of others which tend to their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement
and reproach, to the taking away or
lessening of their Reputation and good Name.
And this, whether the things said be true or not.
If they be false, and we know it, then it is down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<hi>Calumny;</hi> and if we do not know it, but
take it upon the report of others, it is however a
<hi>Slander;</hi> and so much the more injurious, because
really groundless and undeserved.</p>
            <p>If the thing be true, and we know it to be so,
yet it is a defamation, and tends to the prejudice
of our neighbour's reputation: And it is a fault
to say the evil of others which is true, unless
there be some good reason for it besides: Because
it is contrary to that charity and goodness which
<hi>Christianity</hi> requires, to divulge the faults of others,
though they be really guilty of them, without
necessity or some other very good reason for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:37934:4"/>
Again, It is <hi>Evil-speaking</hi> and the Vice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
in the <hi>Text,</hi> whether we be the first Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of an ill Report, or relate it from others;
because the man that is evil spoken of is equally
defam'd either way.</p>
            <p>Again, Whether we speak evil of a man to his
face, or behind his back: The former way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
seems to be the more generous, but yet is a
great Fault, and that which we call <hi>reviling:</hi> The
latter is more mean and base, and that which we
properly call <hi>Slander</hi> or <hi>Backbiting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Lastly, Whether it be done directly and
in express terms, or more obscurely and by way
of oblique insinuation; whether by way of down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
reproach, or with some crafty preface of
commendation: For so it have the effect to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame,
the manner of address does not much alter
the case: The one may be more dextrous, but is
not one jot less faulty: For many times the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Wounds are given by these smoother and
more artificial ways of Slander; as by asking
questions, <hi>Have you not heard so and so of such a
man? I say no more, I only ask the question:</hi> Or by
general intimations, that <hi>they are loth to say what
they have heard of such a one, are very sorry for it,
and do not at all believe it,</hi> if you will believe <hi>them;</hi>
And this many times without telling the thing,
but leaving you in the dark to suspect the worst.</p>
            <p>These and such like Arts, though they may
seem to be tenderer and gentler ways of using
mens reputation, yet in truth they are the most
malicious and effectual methods of Slander; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they insinuate something that is much worse
than is said, and yet are very apt to create in
unwary men a strong belief of something that
is very bad, though they know not what it is.
So that it matters not in what fashion a Slander
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37934:4"/>
is dress'd up, if it tend to defame a man and to
diminish his Reputation, it is the Sin forbidden
in the <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. We will consider <hi>the extent of this Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to speak evil of no man;</hi> and the due <hi>bounds and
limitations of it.</hi> For it is not to be understood ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,
to forbid us to say any thing concerning
others that is bad. This in some cases may be
necessary and our duty, and in several cases very
fit and reasonable. The Question is, In what
Cases by the general Rules of Scripture and right
Reason we are warranted to say the evil of others
that is true?</p>
            <p>In general, we are not to do this without great
reason and necessity; as, for the prevention of
some great evil, or the procuring of some consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
good to our selves, or others. And this
I take to be the meaning of that advice of the
Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi> Eccl. 19. 8. <hi>Whether it be to a friend
or a foe, talk not of other mens lives; and if thou
canst without offence reveal them not;</hi> that is, if
without hurt to any body thou canst conceal
them, divulge them not.</p>
            <p>But because this may not be direction sufficient,
I shall instance in some of the principal Cases
wherein men are warranted to speak evil of
others, and yet in so doing do not offend against
this Prohibition in the <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It is not only lawful, but very commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and many times our duty to do this in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the probable amendment of the person of
whom evil is spoken. In such a case we may tell
a man of his faults privately; or where it may
not be so fit for us to use that boldness and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
we may reveal his faults to one who is
more fit and proper to reprove him, and will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37934:5"/>
make no other use of this discovery but in
order to his amendment. And this is so far from
being a breach of Charity, that it is one of the best
testimonies of it. For perhaps the party may not
be guilty of what hath been reported of him,
and then it is a kindness to give him the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of vindicating himself: Or if he be guilty,
perhaps being privately and prudently told of it
he may reform. In this Case the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi>
adviseth to reveal men's faults; <hi>Ecclus. 19. 13, 14,
15. Admonish a friend,</hi> says he, <hi>it may be he hath not
done it; and if he have done it, that he do it no more:
Admonish a friend, it may be he hath not said it; and
if he have, that he speak it not again: Admonish a
friend, for many times it is a slander; and believe not
every tale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then we must take care that this be done
out of kindness, and that nothing of our own
passion be mingled with it; and that under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of reproving and reforming men, we do
not reproach and revile them, and tell them of
their faults in such a manner as if we did it to
shew our <hi>authority</hi> rather than our <hi>charity.</hi> It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a great deal of address and gentle applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
so to manage the business of Reproof, as
not to irritate and exasperate the person whom
we reprove, instead of curing him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This likewise is not only lawful, but
our duty, when we are legally called to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
concerning the fault and crime of another.
A good man would not be an accuser, unless
the publick good, or the prevention of some
great evil should require it. And then the plain
reason of the thing will sufficiently justifie a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
accusation: otherwise it hath always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
well-manner'd People been esteemed very
odious for a man to be officious in this kind, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37934:5"/>
a forward Informer concerning the misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors
of others. <hi>Magistrates</hi> may sometimes
think it fit to give encouragement to such persons,
and to set one bad man to catch another, because
such men are fittest for such dirty work: But
they can never inwardly approve them, nor will
they ever make them their friends and confidents.</p>
            <p>But when a man is call'd to give testimony in
this kind in obedience to the Laws, and out of
reverence to the Oath taken in such Cases, he is
so far from deserving blame for so doing, that it
would be an unpardonable fault in him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
the truth, or any part of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is lawful to publish the faults of
others in our own necessary defence and vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
When a man cannot conceal another's faults
without betraying his own innocency, no chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
requires a man to suffer himself to be defamed
to save the reputation of another man. <hi>Charity
begins at home;</hi> and though a man had never so
much goodness, he would first secure his own
good name, and then be concern'd for other
men's. We are <hi>to love our neighbour as our selves;</hi>
so that the love of our selves is the Rule and
Measure of our love to our neighbour: And
therefore <hi>first,</hi> otherwise it could not be the <hi>Rule.</hi>
And it would be very well for the World, if our
Charity would rise thus high; and no man
would hurt another man's reputation, but where
his own is in real danger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This also is lawful for caution and
warning to a third person, that is in danger to
be infected by the company, or ill example of
another; or may be greatly prejudiced by repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
too much confidence in him, having no
knowledge or suspicion of his bad qualities: But
even in this case we ought to take great care that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37934:6"/>
the ill character we give of any man be spread
no further than is necessary to the good end we
designed in it.</p>
            <p>Besides these more obvious and remarkable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
this Prohibition doth not I think hinder but
that in ordinary conversation men may men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that ill of others which is already made as
publick as it well can be: Or that one friend
may not in freedom speak to another of the
miscarriage of a third person, where he is secure
no ill use will be made of it, and that it will go
no further to his prejudice: Provided always, that
we take no delight in hearing or speaking ill of
others: And the less we do it, though without
any malice or design of harm, still the better;
because this shews that we do not feed upon ill
reports and take pleasure in them.</p>
            <p>These are the usual Cases in which it may be
necessary for us to speak evil of other men. And
these are so evidently reasonable that the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
in the <hi>Text</hi> cannot with reason be extended
to them. And if no man would allow himself
to say any thing to the prejudice of another
man's good name, but in these and the like Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
the tongues of men would be very innocent,
and the World would be very quiet. I proceed
in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IIId.</hi> place to consider <hi>the evil of this practice,</hi>
both in the <hi>Causes</hi> and the <hi>Consequences</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> We will consider the <hi>Causes</hi> of it. And
it commonly springs from one or more of these
evil Roots.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> One of the deepest and most common
<hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>evil-speaking</hi> is <hi>ill-nature</hi> and cruelty of
disposition: And by a general mistake <hi>Ill-nature</hi>
passeth for <hi>Wit,</hi> as <hi>Cunning</hi> doth for <hi>Wisdom;</hi> tho
in truth they are nothing a-kin to one another,
but as far distant as <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:37934:6"/>
And there is no greater evidence of the bad
temper of Mankind, than the general proneness
of men to this Vice. For (as our <hi>Saviour</hi> says)
<hi>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</hi>
And therefore men do commonly incline to the
censorious and uncharitable side: which shews
humane Nature to be strangely distorted from
its original rectitude and innocency. The Wit
of Man doth more naturally vent it self in <hi>Satyr</hi>
and Censure, than in Praise and <hi>Panegyrick.</hi>
When men set themselves to commend, it comes
hardly from them, and not without great force
and straining; and if any thing be fitly said in
that kind, it doth hardly relish with most men:
But in the way of <hi>Invective,</hi> the Invention of
men is a plentiful and never-failing Spring: And
this kind of Wit is not more easie than it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable:
It is greedily entertained and greatly
applauded, and every man is glad to hear others
abused, not considering how soon it may come
to his own turn to lie down and make sport for
others.</p>
            <p>To speak evil of others, is almost become the
general entertainment of all Companies: And the
great and serious business of most Meetings and
Visits, after the necessary Ceremonies and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
are over, is to sit down and back-bite all
the World. 'Tis the <hi>Sawce</hi> of Conversation, and
all Discourse is counted but flat and dull which
hath not something of <hi>piquancy</hi> and sharpness in
it against some body. For men generally love
rather to hear evil of others than good, and are
secretly pleas'd with ill reports, and drink them
in with greediness and delight: Though at the
same time they have so much Justice, as to hate
those that propagate them; and so much Wit, as
to conclude that these very persons will do the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37934:7"/>
same for them in another Place and Company.</p>
            <p>But especially, if it concerns one of another
<hi>Party,</hi> and that differs from us in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
in this Case, all Parties seem to be agreed
that they do God great service in blasting the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of their Adversaries: And tho they all
pretend to be <hi>Christiams,</hi> and the <hi>Disciples</hi> of <hi>Him</hi>
who taught nothing but <hi>kindness</hi> and <hi>meekness</hi> and
<hi>charity;</hi> yet it is strange to see with what a salvage
and murderous disposition they will flie at one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother's
Reputation and tear it in pieces: And
what-ever other <hi>Scruples</hi> they may have, they make
none to bespatter one another in the most bitter
and slanderous manner.</p>
            <p>But if they hear any good of their Adversaries,
with what nicety and caution do they receive it?
how many objections do they raise against it?
and with what coldness do they at last admit it?
<hi>It is very well,</hi> say they, <hi>if it be true: I shall be glad
to hear it confirm'd. I never heard so much good of him
before. You are a good man your self, but have a care
you be not deceived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay it is well, if to balance the matter, and set
things even, they do not clap some infirmity and
fault into the other Scale, that so the Enemy may
not go off with flying Colours.</p>
            <p>But on the other side, every man is a good and
substantial Author of an ill Report. I do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
this to any one sort of men, though all are
to blame in this way; <hi>Iliacos intra muros peccatur,
&amp; extra.</hi> To speak impartially, the <hi>Zealots</hi> of all
<hi>Parties</hi> have got a <hi>scurvy Trick</hi> of lying for the
Truth.</p>
            <p>But of all sorts of People, I have observed the
<hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Bigots</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the
ablest in this way, and to have the strongest Faith
for a lusty Falshood and Calumny. Others will
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37934:7"/>
bandy a false Report, and toss it from one hand
to another; but I never knew any that would so
hug a Lye and be so very fond of it. They seem
to be described by St. <hi>John</hi> in that expression in
the Revelation, <hi>Whosoever loveth and maketh a lye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another shrewd sign that <hi>ill-nature</hi> lies at the
root of this <hi>Vice</hi> is, that we easily forget the good
that is said of others, and seldom make mention
of it; but the contrary sticks with us, and lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost
in our memories, and is ready to come
out upon all occasions: And which is yet more
ill-natur'd and unjust, many times when we do
not believe it our selves we tell it to others, with
this charitable Caution, <hi>That we hope it is not true.</hi>
But in the mean time we give it our <hi>Pass,</hi> and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it to take its fortune to be believed or not,
according to the charity of those into whose hands
it comes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Cause of the commonness of
this Vice is, that many are so bad themselves, in
one kind or other. For to think and speak ill of
others is not only a bad thing, but a sign of a bad
man. Our <hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi> speaking of the evil
of the <hi>last days,</hi> gives this as the reason of the
great decay of Charity among men; <hi>Because ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
shall abound, the Love of many shall wax cold,
Matth.</hi> 24. 12. When men are bad themselves,
they are glad of any opportunity to censure others,
and are always apt to suspect that evil of other
men which they know by themselves. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have a good opinion of themselves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are very unwilling to have so of any body
else; and for this reason they endeavour to bring
men to a level, hoping it will be some justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them if they can but render others as bad
as themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another source of this Vice is <hi>Malice</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:37934:8"/>
and <hi>Revenge.</hi> When men are in Heat and Passion
they do not consider what is true, but what is
spiteful and mischievous; and speak evil of others
in revenge of some injury which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from them: And when they are blinded
by their Passions, they lay about them madly and
at a venture, not much caring whether the evil
they speak be true or not. Nay many are so <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilish,</hi>
as to invent and raise false Reports on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to blast mens Reputation. This is a <hi>Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical</hi>
temper, and therefore St. <hi>James</hi> tells us that the
slanderous <hi>Tongue is set on fire of Hell:</hi> And the
<hi>Devil</hi> hath his very <hi>Name</hi> from <hi>Calumny</hi> and false
Accusation; and it is his <hi>Nature</hi> too, for he is
always ready to stir up and foment this evil spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
among men: Nay, the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us that he
hath the malice and impudence to accuse good
men before God; as he did <hi>Job,</hi> charging him
with <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> to God himself; <hi>Who,</hi> he knows,
<hi>does know the hearts of all the children of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Another <hi>Cause</hi> of evil-speaking is <hi>Envy.</hi>
Men look with an evil eye upon the good that is
in others, and think that their Reputation ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scures
<hi>them,</hi> and that their commendable qualities
do stand in <hi>their</hi> light; and therefore they do
what they can to cast a cloud over them, that the
bright shining of their Vertues may not scorch
<hi>them.</hi> This makes them greedily to entertain, and
industriously to publish any thing that may serve
to that purpose, thereby to raise themselves upon
the Ruins of other men's Reputation: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as soon as they have got an ill Report of any
good man by the end, to work they presently go
to send it abroad by the first <hi>Post:</hi> For the string
is always ready upon their Bow to let fly this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
with an incredible swiftness, through <hi>City</hi>
and <hi>Country;</hi> for fear the innocent man's justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
should over-take it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:37934:8"/>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Another <hi>Cause</hi> of evil-speaking is <hi>Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi>
and <hi>Curiosity;</hi> an itch of talking and medling
in the affairs of other Men, which do nowise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
them. Some persons love to mingle themselves
in all business, and are loth to seem ignorannt of so
important a piece of <hi>News</hi> as the <hi>faults</hi> and <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ies</hi> of
men, or any bad thing that is talk'd of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> good
Company. And therefore they do with great care
pick up ill Stories, as good matter of discourse in
the next Company that is worthy of them: And this
perhaps not out of any great malice, but for want
of something better to talk of, and because their
Parts lie chiefly that way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Men do this many times out of <hi>wantonness</hi>
and for <hi>diversion.</hi> So little do light and vain men
consider, that a man's Reputation is too great and
tender a Concernment to be jested withal; and that
a slanderous Tongue <hi>bites like a Serpent,</hi> and <hi>wounds
like a Sword.</hi> For what can be more barbarous, next
to sporting with a man's Life, than to play with
his Honour and Reputation, which to some men
is dearer to them than their Lives?</p>
            <p>It is a cruel pleasure which some men take in
worrying the Reputation of others much better
than themselves; and this only to divert themselves
and the Company. <hi>Solomon</hi> compares this sort of
men to distracted persons; <hi>As a mad man,</hi> saith he,
<hi>who casteth fire-brands, arrows, and death, so is the man
that deceiveth his neighbour;</hi> the LXX. render it, <hi>So
is the man that defameth his neighbour, and saith, Am
I not in sport?</hi> Such, and so bad are the Causes of
this Vice. I proceed to consider, in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> place, the ordinary, but very pernicious
<hi>Consequences</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of it; both to <hi>Others,</hi> and
to <hi>our Selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> To <hi>Others;</hi> the Parties I mean that are
slandered. To them it is certainly a great <hi>injury;</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:37934:9"/>
and commonly a high <hi>Provocation,</hi> but always mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of no small <hi>grief</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>It is certainly a great <hi>injury,</hi> and if the evil which
we say of them be not true, it is an injury beyond
imagination, and beyond all possible reparation. And
though we should do our utmost endeavour after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
towards their Vindication, yet that makes but
very little amends; because the Vindication seldom
reacheth so far as the Reproach, and because com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
men are neither so forward to spread the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,
nor is it so easily received after ill impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
are once made. The solicitous Vindication of a
man's self is, at the best, but an <hi>after-game;</hi> and for
the most part a man had better sit still, than to run the
hazard of making the matter worse by <hi>playing</hi> it.</p>
            <p>I will add one thing more, That it is an Injury
that descends to a man's Children and Posterity;
because the good or ill Name of the Father is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
down to them; and many times the best thing
he hath to leave them is the Reputation of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemish'd
Virtue and Worth: And do we make no
Conscience to rob his innocent Children of the best
part of this small Patrimony, and of all the kindness
that would have been done them for their Father's
sake, if his Reputation had not been so undeserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stain'd? Is it no Crime by the breath of our
mouth at once to blast a man's Reputation, and to
ruin his Children, perhaps to all Posterity? Can we
make a jest of so serious a matter? Of an Injury so
very hard to be repented of as it ought, because in
such a Case no Repentance will be acceptable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Restitution, if it be in our power. And perhaps
it will undo us in this World to make it; and if
we do it not, will be our Ruin in the other.</p>
            <p>I will put the Case at the best, that the matter of
the Slander is true; yet no man's Reputation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably
stained, tho never so deservedly, without
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37934:9"/>
great harm and damage to him. And it is great odds
but the matter by passing through several hands is
aggravated beyond truth, every one out of his
bounty being apt to add something to it.</p>
            <p>But, besides the <hi>Injury,</hi> it is commonly a very
high <hi>Provocation.</hi> And the consequence of that may
be as bad as we can imagine, and may end in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and desperate Quarrels. This reason the wise
Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> gives why we should defame no man:
<hi>Whether it be,</hi> says he, <hi>to a friend or to a foe, talk not of
other mens lives. For he hath heard and observed thee,
Ecclus.</hi> 19. 8, 9. that is, one way or other it will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
come to his knowledge, <hi>and when the time cometh
he will shew his hatred;</hi> that is, he will take the first
opportunity to revenge it.</p>
            <p>At the best, it is always matter of <hi>Grief</hi> to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that is defam'd: And <hi>Christianity,</hi> which is the
<hi>best-natur'd Institution</hi> in the World, forbids us the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of those things whereby we may <hi>grieve one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
A man's good name is a tender thing, and a
wound there sinks deep into the spirit even of a wise
and good man: And the more innocent any man
is in this kind, the more sensible is he of this hard
usage; because he never treats others so, nor is he
conscious to himself that he hath deserved it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Consequences</hi> of this Vice are as
bad or worse to <hi>our selves.</hi> Whoever is wont to speak
evil of others, gives a bad character of himself, even
to those whom he desires to please; who, if they be
wise enough, will conclude that he speaks of them
to others, as he does of others to them: And were it
not for that fond partiality which men have for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
no man could be so blind as not to see this.</p>
            <p>And it is very well worthy of our consideration,
which our <hi>Saviour</hi> says in this very Case, That <hi>with
what measure we meet to others, it shall be measured to us
again;</hi> Matth. 7. and that many times <hi>heaped up;</hi> and
<hi>running over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> For there is hardly any thing wherein
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37934:10"/>
Mankind do use more strict justice and equality, than
<hi>in rendering evil for evil, and railing for railing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, Revenge often goes further than Words. A
reproachful and slanderous Speech hath cost many a
man a <hi>Duel,</hi> and in that the loss of his own Life, or
the Murther of another, perhaps with the loss of his
own Soul: And I have often wonder'd that among
<hi>Christians</hi> this matter is no more laid to heart.</p>
            <p>And tho neither of these great mischiefs should
happen to us, yet this may be inconvenient enough
many other ways. For no man knows in the chance
of things, and the mutability of humane affairs, whose
kindness and good-will he may come to stand in
need of before he dies. So that did a man only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
his own safety and quiet, he ought to refrain
from <hi>evil-speaking. What man is he,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist,
that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see
good: Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
falshood,</hi> Psal. 34. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But there is an infinitely greater Danger hanging
over us from God. If we allow our selves in this
evil practice, all our Religion is good for nothing.
So St.</hi> James <hi>expresly tells us,</hi> If any man among you
seemeth to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
his own heart, that man's Religion is vain, <hi>Jam. 1.
26. And St.</hi> Paul <hi>puts</hi> Slanderers <hi>and</hi> Revilers <hi>amongst
those that</hi> shall not inherit the kingdom of God. <hi>And our</hi>
Blessed Saviour <hi>hath told us, That</hi> by our words we shall
be justified, and by our words we shall be condemned,
1 Cor. 6. 10. <hi>To which I will add the counsel given us
by the</hi> Wise-man, Refrain your tongue from backbiting, for
there is no word so secret that shall go for nought, and the
mouth that slandereth slayeth the Soul, <hi>Wisdom of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
c. 1. v. 11. <hi>I proceed in the</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>IVth place, to add</hi> some further Arguments and Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
to take men off from this Vice: <hi>As,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That the use of <hi>Speech</hi> is a peculiar Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of Man above other Creatures, and bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37934:10"/>
him for some excellent end and purpose: That
by this <hi>Faculty</hi> we might communicate our thoughts
more easily to one another, and consult together for
our mutual comfort and benefit: Not to enable us
to be hurtful and injurious, but helpful and beneficial
to one another. The <hi>Psalmist,</hi> as by <hi>Interpreters</hi> is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
thought, calls our <hi>Tongue</hi> our <hi>Glory;</hi> therewith we
<hi>praise God</hi> and <hi>bless Men.</hi> Now to <hi>bless</hi> is to speak well
of any, and to wish them well. So that we pervert
the use of <hi>Speech</hi> and turn our <hi>glory</hi> into shame, when
we abuse this <hi>Faculty</hi> to the injury and reproach of any.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Consider how cheap a kindness it is to
speak well, at least not to speak ill of any. A good
word is an easie obligation, but not to speak ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
only our Silence, which costs us nothing. Some
instances of Charity are chargeable, as to relieve the
wants and necessities of others: The expence deterrs
many from this kind of Charity. But were a man
never so covetous, he might afford another man his
good word; at least he might refrain from speaking
ill of him: especially if it be consider'd how dear
many have paid for a slanderous and reproachful word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Consider that no quality doth ordinarily
recommend one more to the favour and good-will
of men, than to be free from this Vice. Every one
desires such a man's friendship, and is apt to repose
a great trust and confidence in him: And when he
is dead, men will praise him; and next to Piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, and Righteousness to Men, nothing is
thought a more significant commendation, than that
he was never, or very rarely heard to speak ill of
any. It was a singular Character of a <hi>Roman Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
Nescivit quid esset maledicere, he knew not what
it was to give any man an ill word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let every man lay his hand upon his
heart, and consider how himself is apt to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with this usage. Speak thy Conscience <hi>Man,</hi>
and say whether, as bad as thou art, thou wouldst
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37934:11"/>
not be glad to have every man's, especially every
good man's good word? And to have thy faults con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenal'd,
and not to be hardly spoken of, though it
may be not altogether without truth, by those whom
thou didst never offend by word or deed? But with
what face or reason dost thou expect this from
others, to whom thy carriage hath been so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
Nothing surely is more equal and reasonable
than that known <hi>Rule, What thou wouldst have no
man do to thee, that do thou to no man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> When you are going to speak reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
of others, consider whether you do not lie
open to just reproach in the same, or some other
kind. Therefore give no Occasion, no Example of
this barbarous usage of one another.</p>
            <p>There are very few so innocent and free either
from infirmities or greater faults, as not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to reproach upon one account or other;
even the wisest, and most virtuous, and most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
among men have some little vanity, or affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which lays them open to the railery of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
and malicious Wit: Therefore we should of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
turn our thoughts upon our selves, and look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that part of the <hi>Wallet</hi> which men commonly fling
over their shoulders and keep behind them, that they
may not see their own Faults: And when we have
searched that well, let us remember our <hi>Saviour's
Rule, He that is without sin, let him cast the first stone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly</hi> consider, That it is in many Cases as great
a Charity to conceal the evil you hear and know of
others, as if you relieved them in a great necessity.
And we think him a hard-hearted man that will not
bestow a small Alms upon one in great want. It is
an excellent Advice which the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> gives
to this purpose; <hi>Talk not of other men's lives: If thou
hast heard a word, let it die with thee; and be bold it
will not burst thee,</hi> Ecclus. 19. 10. I shall in the
<hi>Vth.</hi> and <hi>last</hi> place, <hi>give some Rules and Directions
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37934:11"/>
for the prevention and cure of this great evil among men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, Never say any evil of any man, but what you
certainly know.</hi> When ever you positively accuse and
<hi>endite</hi> any man of any <hi>Crime,</hi> though it be in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and among Friends, speak as if you were upon
your <hi>Oath,</hi> because God sees and hears you. This not
only Charity, but Justice and regard to truth do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of us. He that easily credits an ill Report is
almost as faulty as the first inventer of it. For tho
you do not make, yet you commonly propagate a
<hi>Lye.</hi> Therefore never speak evil of any upon <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Fame,</hi> which for the most part is false, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
always uncertain whether it be true or not.</p>
            <p>Not but that it is a fault, in most Cases, to report
the evil of men which is true, and which we certainly
know to be so: But if I cannot prevail to make men
wholly to abstain from this fault, I would be glad to
compound with some Persons, and to gain this point
of them however; because it would retrench <hi>nine</hi>
parts in <hi>ten</hi> of the <hi>evil-speaking</hi> that is in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Before you speak evil of any man, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whether he hath not obliged you by some real
kindness, and then it is a bad return to speak ill of
him who hath done us good. Consider also, whether
you may not come hereafter to be acquainted with
him, related to him, or obliged by him whom you
have thus injured? And how will you then be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
when you reflect upon it, and perhaps have
reason also to believe that he to whom you have
done this injury is not ignorant of it?</p>
            <p>Consider likewise, whether in the change of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
affairs, you may not some time or other come
to stand in need of his favour; and how incapable
this carriage of yours towards him will render you of
it? And whether it may not be in his power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
a spiteful and needless word by a shrewd
turn? So that if a man made no conscience of hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others, yet he should in prudence have some
consideration of himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:37934:12"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let us accustom our selves to pity the
Faults of men and to be truly sorry for them, and
then we shall take no pleasure in publishing them.
And this common Humanity requires of us, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the great infirmities of humane Nature, and
that we our selves also are liable to be tempted: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
likewise, how severe a Punishment every
Fault and miscarriage is to it self; and how terribly
it exposeth a man to the wrath of God, both in this
World and the other. He is not a good <hi>Christian,</hi> that
is not heartily sorry for the faults even of his greatest
Enemies; and if he be so, he will discover them no
further than is necessary to some good end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When-ever we hear any man evil-spoken
of, if we know any good of him let us say <hi>that.</hi> It is
always the more humane and the more honourable
part to stand up in the defence and vindication of
others, than to accuse and bespatter them. Possibly
the good you heard of them may not be true, but it
is much more probable that the evil which you have
heard of them is not true neither: However, it is
better to preserve the credit of a bad man, than to
stain the Reputation of the innocent. And if there
were any need that a man should be evil-spoken of,
it is but fair and equal that his good and bad Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
should be mention'd together; otherwise he
may be strangely misrepresented, and an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Man may be made a Monster.</p>
            <p>They that will observe nothing in a Wise man,
but his over-sights and follies; nothing in a Good
man, but his failings and infirmities; may make a
shift to render a very wise and good man very des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable.
If one should heap together all the passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Speeches all the froward and imprudent Actions
of the best Man; all that he had said or done amiss
in his whole Life, and present it all at one view, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
his Wisdom and Vertues; the Man in this
Disguise would look like a <hi>Mad-man</hi> or a <hi>Fury:</hi> And
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37934:12"/>
yet if his Life were fairly represented, and just in
the same manner it was led; and his many and
great Virtues set over-against his failings and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
he would appear to all the World to be an
admirable and excellent Person. But how many and
great soever any man's ill Qualities are, it is but just
that with all this heavy load of Faults he should have
the due praise of the few real Virtues that are in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That you may not speak ill of any, do not
delight to hear ill of them. Give no countenance to
<hi>Busy-bodies,</hi> and those that love to talk of other mens
Faults: Or if you cannot decently reprove them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their Quality, then divert the discourse
some other way; or if you cannot do that, by
seeming not to mind it, you may sufficiently signify
that you do not like it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Let every man mind himself, and his own
Duty and Concernment. Do but endeavour in good
earnest to mend thy self, and it will be work enough
for one Man, and leave thee but little time to talk
of others. When <hi>Plato</hi> withdrew from the Court of
<hi>Dionysius,</hi> who would fain have had a famous <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi>
for his Flatterer, they parted in some unkindness,
and <hi>Dionysius</hi> bad him not to speak ill of him when
he was return'd into <hi>Greece; Plato</hi> told him, <hi>he had
no leisure for it;</hi> meaning that he had better things
to mind, than to take up his thoughts and talk with
the faults of so bad a man, so notoriously known to
all the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Let us set a watch before the door of our
lips, and not speak but upon consideration: I do not
mean to speak <hi>finely,</hi> but <hi>fitly.</hi> Especially when thou
speakest of others, consider of <hi>whom,</hi> and <hi>what</hi> thou
art going to speak: Use great Caution and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
in this matter: Look well about thee; on
every side of the thing, and on every Person in the
Company, before thy words slip from thee; which
when they are once out of thy lips, are for ever out
of thy power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:37934:13"/>
Not that men should be sullen in company, and
say nothing; or so stiff in conversation, as to drop
nothing but <hi>Aphorisms</hi> and <hi>Oracles:</hi> Especially, among
Equals and Friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we should not be so reserved as
if we would have it taken for a mighty favour that
we vouchsafe to say any thing. If a Man had the
understanding of an <hi>Angel,</hi> he must be contented to
abate something of this excess of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> for fear of
being thought <hi>Cunning.</hi> The true Art of Conversation,
if any body can hit upon it, seems to be this; an
appearing freedom and openness, with a resolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedness
as little appearing as is possible.</p>
            <p>All that I mean by this <hi>Caution</hi> is, that we should
consider well what we say, especially of others. And to
this end we should endeavour to get our minds fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with matter of Discourse concerning things
useful in themselves, and not hurtful to others: And,
if we have but a Mind wise enough, and good enough,
we may easily find a Field large enough for innocent
Conversation; such as will harm no body, and yet
be acceptable enough to the better and wiser part of
Mankind: And why should any one be at the cost
of playing the fool to gratify any body whatsoever?</p>
            <p>I have done with the <hi>Five</hi> things I propounded to
speak to upon this Argument. But because hardly any
thing can be so clear, but something may be said
against it; nor any thing so bad, but something may
be pleaded in excuse for it: I shall therefore take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of two or three <hi>Pleas</hi> that may be made for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Some pretend mighty injury and provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If in the same kind, it seems thou art sensible
of it; and therefore thou of all men oughtest to
abstain from it: But in what kind soever it be, the
Christian Religion forbids Revenge. Therefore do
not plead one Sin in excuse of another, and make
<hi>Revenge</hi> an Apology for <hi>Reviling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is alledged by others, with a little better
grace, that if this Doctrine were practised, Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37934:13"/>
would be spoil'd, and there would not be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
enough for pleasant discourse and entertainment.</p>
            <p>I answer, The design of this Discourse is to redress
a great evil in Conversation, and that I hope which
mends it will not spoil it. And however, if men's
Tongues lay a little more still, and most of us spake
a good deal less than we do, both of our selves and
others, I see no great harm in it: I hope we might
for all that live comfortably and in good health, and
see many good days. <hi>David,</hi> I am sure, prescribes <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
as an excellent <hi>Receipt,</hi> in his Opinion, for a quiet,
and cheerful, and long Life, to refrain from evil-speaking;
Psal. 34. 12, 13. <hi>What man is he that desireth
life, and loveth many days that he may see good? Keep thy
tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking falshood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But granting that there is some pleasure in <hi>Invective,</hi>
I hope there is a great deal more in <hi>Innocence:</hi> And
the more any man considers this, the truer he will
find it; and whenever we are serious, we our selves
cannot but acknowledge it. When a man examines
himself impartially before the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> or is put in
mind upon a <hi>Death-bed</hi> to make reparation for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
done in this kind, he will then certainly be of
this mind and wish he had not done them. For
this certainly is one necessary qualification for the
<hi>Blessed Sacrament,</hi> that we <hi>be in love and charity with
our neighbours;</hi> with which temper of mind this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is utterly inconsistent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is yet a more specious <hi>Plea</hi> than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the former, that men will be encouraged to
do ill if they can escape the tongues of men; as they
would do, if this Doctrine did effectually take place:
Because by this means one great restraint from doing
evil would be taken away, which these good men
who are so bent upon reforming the World, think
would be great pity. For many who will venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the displeasure of God, will yet abstain from doing
bad things for fear of reproach from Men: Besides,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37934:14"/>
that this seems the most proper punishment of many
Faults which the Laws of Men can take no notice of.</p>
            <p>Admitting all this to be true, yet it does not seem
so good and laudable a way to punish one Fault by
another. But let no man encourage himself in an evil
way with this hope, that he shall escape the censure of
men: When I have said all I can, there will, I fear,
be evil-speaking enough in the World to chastise
them that do ill: And tho we should hold our peace,
there will be bad tongues enow to reproach men
with their evil-doings. I wish we could but be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
to make the Experiment for a little while,
whether men would not be sufficiently lash'd for
their Faults, tho we sate by and said nothing.</p>
            <p>So that there is no need at all that good Men
should be concern'd in this odious Work. There will
always be Offenders and <hi>Malefactors</hi> enow to be the
<hi>Executioners</hi> to inflict this punishment upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Therefore let no man presume upon Impunity
on the one hand; and on the other, let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
but that this business will be sufficiently done
one way or other. I am very much mistaken, if we
may not safely trust an ill-natur'd World that there
will be no failure of Justice in this kind.</p>
            <p>And here, if I durst, I would fain have said a word
or two concerning that more publick sort of <hi>Obloquy</hi>
by <hi>Lampoons</hi> and <hi>Libels,</hi> so much in fashion in this
witty Age. But I have no mind to provoke a very
terrible sort of men. Yet thus much I hope may be
said without offence, that how much soever men are
pleas'd to see others abused in this kind, yet it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
grievous when it comes to their own turn:
However I cannot but hope that every man that
impartially considers must own it to be a fault of a
very high nature to revile those whom God hath
placed in Authority over us, and <hi>to slander the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
of the Lord's Anointed:</hi> Especially since it is so
expresly written, <hi>Thou shalt not speak evil of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of thy People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:37934:14"/>
Having represented the great evil of this Vice,
it might not now be improper to say something to
those who suffer by it. Are we guilty of the evil said
of us? Let us reform, and cut off all occasions for
the future; and so turn the malice of our Enemies
to our own advantage, and defeat their ill intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by making so good an use of it: And then it
will be well for us to have been evil spoken of.</p>
            <p>Are we innocent? We may so much the better bear
it patiently; imitating herein the Pattern of our <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Saviour, Who when he was reviled, reviled not again,
but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may consider likewise, that tho it be a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
to be evil-spoken of, it is their fault that do
it, and not ours; and therefore should not put us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Passion, because another man's being injurious
to me is no good reason why I should be uneasy to
my self. We should not revenge the injuries done to
us, no not upon them that do them, much less upon
our selves. Let no man's Provocation make thee to
lose thy Patience. Be not such a fool, as to part
with any one Virtue because some men are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
as to endeavour to rob thee of the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the rest. When men speak ill of thee,
do as <hi>Plato</hi> said he would do in that case; <hi>Live so,
as that no body may believe them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that now remains is to reflect upon what hath
been said, and to urge you and my self to do accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.
For all is nothing, if we do not practise what
we so plainly see to be our Duty. Many are so taken
up with the deep <hi>Points</hi> and <hi>Mysteries</hi> of Religion,
that they never think of the common <hi>Duties</hi> and <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of human Life. But <hi>Faith</hi> and a <hi>good Life</hi> are so far
from clashing with one another, that the <hi>Christian
Religion</hi> hath made them inseparable. True <hi>Faith</hi> is
necessary in order to a <hi>good Life,</hi> and a <hi>good Life</hi> is the
genuine product of a <hi>right Belief;</hi> and therefore the
<hi>one</hi> never ought to be press'd to the prejudice of the
<hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:37934:15"/>
I foresee what will be said, because I have heard it
so often said in the like case; that there is <hi>not one word
of Jesus Christ in all this.</hi> No more is there in the <hi>Text.</hi>
And yet I hope that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is truly preach'd,
whenever his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> and the <hi>Duties</hi> enjoin'd
by the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> are inculcated upon us.</p>
            <p>But some men are pleased to say, that <hi>this is mere
Morality:</hi> I answer, that this is <hi>Scripture-Morality</hi> and
<hi>Christian-Morality,</hi> and who hath any thing to say
against <hi>that?</hi> Nay, I will go yet further, that no
man ought to pretend to believe the <hi>Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
who lives in the neglect of so plain a <hi>Duty;</hi>
and in the practice of a <hi>Sin</hi> so clearly condemn'd
by it, as this of <hi>evil-speaking</hi> is.</p>
            <p>But because <hi>the Word of God is quick and powerful,
and sharper than a two-edged Sword,</hi> yea sharper than
<hi>Calumny</hi> it self; and pierceth the very Hearts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of men, laying us open to our selves, and
convincing us of our more secret as well as our
more visible Faults; I shall therefore at one view
represent to you what is dispersedly said concerning
this <hi>Sin</hi> in the <hi>Holy Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I have purposely reserved this to the last, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is more persuasive and penetrating than any
Humane Discourse. And to this end be pleas'd to
consider in what company the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> doth usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
mention this <hi>Sin.</hi> There is scarce any <hi>black Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi>
of <hi>Sins</hi> in the <hi>Bible</hi> but we find this among them;
in the company of the very worst <hi>Actions</hi> and most
irregular <hi>Passions</hi> of men. <hi>Out of the heart,</hi> says our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>
Matt. 15. 19. <hi>proceed evil thoughts, murders, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
fornications, false witness, evil speakings.</hi> And the
<hi>Apostle,</hi> Rom. 1. 29. ranks <hi>backbiters</hi> with <hi>fornicators,</hi> and
<hi>murderers,</hi> and <hi>haters of God;</hi> and with those of whom
it is expresly said, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10. that <hi>they shall not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when he enumerates the Sins of <hi>the last times,</hi>
2 Tim. 3. 2, 3. <hi>Men,</hi> says he, <hi>shall be lovers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37934:15"/>
covetous, boasters, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>evil-speakers, without natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
affection, perfidious, false accusers,</hi> &amp;c. And which is
the strangest of all, they who are said to be guilty of
these great Vices and Enormities are noted by the
<hi>Apostle</hi> to be great pretenders to Religion; for so it
follows in the next words, <hi>Having a form of godliness,
but denying the power thereof.</hi> So that it is no new thing
for men to make a more than ordinary profession
of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and yet at the same time to live in a
most palpable contradiction to the Precepts of that
<hi>Holy Religion:</hi> As if any pretence to <hi>Mystery</hi> and I
know not what extraordinary <hi>attainments</hi> in the
knowledge of <hi>Christ,</hi> could exempt men from obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to his Laws, and set them above the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of a good Life.</p>
            <p>And now after all this, do we hardly think <hi>that</hi> to
be a Sin, which is in <hi>Scripture</hi> so frequently rank'd
with <hi>Murther</hi> and <hi>Adultery</hi> and the <hi>blackest Crimes;</hi>
such as are inconsistent with the life and power of
Religion, and will certainly shut men out of the
Kingdom of God? Do we believe the <hi>Bible</hi> to be
the <hi>Word of God?</hi> and can we allow our selves in
the common practice of a <hi>Sin,</hi> than which there is
hardly any Fault of mens Lives more frequently
mention'd, more severely reprov'd, and more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
branded in that <hi>Holy Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Consider seriously these</hi> Texts, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. 1. Who shall
abide in thy Tabernacle, who shall dwell in thy holy Hill? He
that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor taketh up a reproach
against his neighbour. <hi>Have ye never heard what our</hi>
Saviour <hi>says, that</hi> of every idle word we must give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in the day of Judgment; <hi>that</hi> by thy words thou
shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemn'd?
<hi>What can be more severe than that of St.</hi> James?
If any man among you seemeth to be religious, and bridleth
not his tongue, that man's Religion is vain.</p>
            <p>To conclude: The <hi>Sin</hi> which I have now warned
men against, is plainly condemn'd by the <hi>Word of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37934:16"/>
God;</hi> and the <hi>Duty</hi> which I have now been persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
you to, is easy for every man to understand,
not hard for any man, that can but resolve to keep
a good guard upon himself for some time, by the
grace of God to practice; and most reasonable for
all <hi>Men,</hi> but especially for all <hi>Christians,</hi> to observe.
It is as easy as a <hi>resolute silence</hi> upon just occasion, as
reasonable as <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>justice</hi> and <hi>charity,</hi> and the
preservation of <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>good-will</hi> among men, can
make it; and of as necessary and indispensible an
obligation, as the Authority of God can render any
thing.</p>
            <p>Upon all which Considerations let us every one
of us be persuaded to take up <hi>David</hi>'s deliberate Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
<hi>Psal. 31. 1. I said, I will take heed to my ways,
that I offend not with my tongue.</hi> And I do verily believe,
that would we but heartily endeavour to amend this
one Fault, we should soon be better Men in our
whole lives: I mean, that the correcting of this <hi>Vice,</hi>
together with those that are nearly allied to it, and
may at the same time, and almost with the same reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
and care be corrected, would make us Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of a great many considerable Vertues, and carry
us on a good way towards perfection; it being hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be imagin'd that a man that makes conscience
of his <hi>Words</hi> should not take an equal or a greater
care of his <hi>Actions.</hi> And this I take to be both the
true meaning, and the true reason of that saying of
St. <hi>James,</hi> and with which I shall conclude: <hi>If any
man offend not in Word, the same is a perfect man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead
our Lord Jesus Christ, the great Shepherd of the
Sheep, through the blood of the everlasting Covenant,
make you perfect in every good word and work, to do
his will; working in you always that which is well-pleasing
in his sight, through Jesus Christ; <hi>To
whom be glory for ever,</hi> Amen.</p>

A HEAVENLY CONVERSATION.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PHIL. iii. 20.</bibl>
               <q>For our Conversation is in Heaven.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>FOR the understanding of which words we
need to look back no further than the <hi>18th
verse</hi> of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> where the Apostle with
great vehemency and passion speaks of some
among the <hi>Philippians,</hi> who indeed profess'd Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
but yet would do any thing to decline suffering
for that profession; <hi>there are many that walk, of
whom I have told you often, and now tell you even
weeping, that they are enemies to the Cross of Christ;</hi>
they cannot endure to suffer with him and for him,
they are so sensual and wedded to this world that
they will do any thing to avoid persecution; so he
describes them in the next <hi>verse, whose end is destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
whose God is their belly, whose glory is in their
shame, who mind earthly things.</hi> Now in opposition
to these sensual and earthly-minded men the Apostle
gives us the character of the true Christians, they
are such as mind Heaven and another world, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37934:17"/>
the hopes of that to all the interests of this life,
<hi>our conversation is in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the right understanding of which <hi>phrase</hi> be
pleased to observe, that it is an allusion to a City or
Corporation, and to the privileges and manners of
those who are free of it. And Heaven is several
times in Scripture represented to us under this notion
of a <hi>City,</hi> It is said of <hi>Abraham</hi> that <hi>he looked for
a City which hath foundations, whose builder and maker
is God, Heb.</hi> 11. 10. It is called likewise <hi>the City
of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, Heb.</hi> 12. 22.
And the same Apostle speaking of the uncertain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Christians in this world says of them, that
<hi>here they have no continuing City, but look for one
that is to come, Heb.</hi> 14. 14.</p>
            <p>Now to this <hi>City</hi> the Apostle alludes here in the
Text, when he says <hi>our conversation is in Heaven.</hi>
For the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is rendred <hi>conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
may either signifie the <hi>privilege</hi> of Citizens, or
their <hi>conversation</hi> and manners, or may take in both
these.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>first</hi> sense of the <hi>priviledge</hi> of Citizens, we find
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a word of near affinity with this sometimes
us'd; <hi>with a great sum</hi> (says the Captain to <hi>Paul)
obtained I</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>this freedom, Acts</hi>
22. 28. According to this sense, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
may very well be rendred, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> often does
this Text, <hi>municipatus noster, our Citizenship is in
Heaven;</hi> an allusion perhaps (as the learned Dr.
<hi>Hammond</hi> observes) to those who though they were
not born at <hi>Rome,</hi> and it may be lived at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from it, had yet <hi>jus civitatis Romanae,</hi> the
privilege of <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens. In like manner the
Apostle here describes the condition of Christians.
'Tis true we are born here in this world and live in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37934:17"/>
it, but we belong to another Corporation; we are
denizens of another Country and free of that City
which is above.</p>
            <p>In the other sense of the <hi>conversation</hi> of Citizens
we find the verb <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> used towards the beginning
of this <hi>Epistle, Let your conversation be as it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Gospel of Christ.</hi> And why may not the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the Text, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27. without any
inconvenience include both these? as if the Apostle
had said, there are some that mind earthly things,
and are so addicted to them that rather than part
with them they will forsake their Religion; but as
for us, we consider that we are Citizens of Heaven,
and accordingly we converse and demean our selves
in this world as those that are free of another City
and do belong to it.</p>
            <p>So that to have <hi>our conversation in heaven</hi> does im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
these two things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The serious thoughts and considerations of
Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The effect which those thoughts ought
to have upon our lives.</p>
            <p>These two things take up the meaning of my Text,
and shall be the subject of the following discourse.</p>
            <p>I. The serious thoughts and considerations of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
that is, of the happy and glorious state of good
men in another life. And concerning this, there are
two things principally which offer themselves to our
consideration <hi>First,</hi> The happiness of this state.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> The way and means whereby we may
come to partake of this happiness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:37934:18"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> We will consider the happiness of this state.
But what, and how great this happiness is, I am not
able to represent to you. These things are yet in a
great measure within the veil, and it does not now
fully <hi>appear what we shall be.</hi> The Scriptures have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
so much in general concerning the reality and
unspeakable felicities of this state as may satisfie us
for the present, and serve to inflame our desires after
it, and to quicken our endeavours for the obtaining
of it; as <hi>namely,</hi> that it is incomparably beyond any
happiness of this world; that it is very great; and
that it is eternal; in a word, that it is far above any
thing that we can now conceive or imagine.</p>
            <p>1. It is incomparably beyond any happiness in this
world. It is free from all those sharp and bitter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
which do abate and allay the felicities of this
life. All the enjoyments of this world are mix'd,
and uncertain, and unsatisfying; nay so far are they
from giving us satisfaction, that the very sweetest of
them are satiating and cloying.</p>
            <p>None of the comforts of this life are pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt.
There is something of <hi>vanity</hi> mingled with
all our earthly enjoyments and <hi>that</hi> causeth <hi>vexation
of spirit.</hi> There is no sensual pleasure but is either
purchas'd by some pain, or attended with it, or ends
in it. A great estate is neither to be got without care,
nor kept without fear, nor lost without trouble.
Dignity and greatness is troublesome almost to all
mankind, it is commonly uneasie to them that have
it and it is usually hated and envy'd by those that
have it not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Knowledge, that is one of the best and
sweetest pleasures of humane life; and yet if we may
believe the experience of one, who had as great a
share of it as any of the Sons of men ever had, he
will tell us, that <hi>this also is vexation of spirit; for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37934:18"/>
in much wisdom there is much grief, and he that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth
knowledge, encreaseth sorrow, Eccl.</hi> 1. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Thus it is with all the things of this world; the
best of them have a mixture of good and evil, of
joy and sorrow in them: but the happiness of the
next life is free from allay and mixture. In the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the <hi>new Jerusalem</hi> it is said, that <hi>there
shall be no more curse, and there shall be no night there,
Rev.</hi> 22, 3, 5. nothing to imbitter our blessings, or
obscure our glory. Heaven is the proper region of
happiness, there onely are pure joys and an unmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
felicity.</p>
            <p>But the enjoyments of this world as they are mix'd,
so they are uncertain. So wavering and inconstant
are they that we can have no security of them, when
we think our selves to have the fastest hold of them
they slip out of our hands we know not how. For
this reason <hi>Solomon</hi> very elegantly calls them things
<hi>that are not, Why wilt thou set thine eyes upon that
which is not? for riches certainly make to themselves
wings and flie like an Eagle towards heaven.</hi> So fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
are they, that after all our endeavours to secure
them they may break loose from us and in an instant
vanish out of our sight, <hi>riches make to themselves wings,
and flie like an Eagle,</hi> intimating to us that riches are
often accessary to their own ruin. Many times the
greatness of a mans estate, and nothing else, hath
been the cause of the loss of it, and of taking away
the life of the owner thereof. The <hi>fairness</hi> of some
mens fortune hath been a temptation to those who
have been more powerful to <hi>ravish</hi> it from them, thus
<hi>riches make to themselves wings.</hi> So that he that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys
the greatest happiness of this world does still
want one happiness more, to secure to him for the
future what he possesses for the present. But the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:37934:19"/>
happiness of Heaven is a steady and constant light, fixt
and unchangeable as the fountain from whence it
springs, <hi>the father of lights, with whom is no vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
nor shadow of turning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if the enjoyments of this life were certain, yet
they are unsatisfying. This is the <hi>vanity of vanities,</hi>
that every thing in this world can trouble us but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can give us satisfaction. I know not how it is,
but either we, or the things of this world, or both,
are so phantastical, that we can neither be well with
these things, nor well without them. If we be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
we are in pain; and if we eat to the full, we are
uneasie. If we be poor we think our selves misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and when we come to be rich we commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
are so. If we are in a low condition we fret and
murmur, and if we chance to get up and to be rais'd
to greatness we are many times farther from content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than we were before So that we pursue the
happiness of this world just as little children chase
birds, when we think we are come very near it and
have it almost in our hands it flies farther from us
than it was at first.</p>
            <p>Nay, so far are the enjoyments of this world from
affording us satisfaction, that the sweetest of them
are most apt to satiate and cloy us. All the pleasures
of this world are so contriv'd as to yield us very little
happiness. If they go off quickly they signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and if they stay long we are sick of them: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a full draught of any sensual pleasure we presently
loath it, and hate it as much after the enjoyment as
we courted it and long'd for it in the expectation.
But the delights of the other world, as they will give
us full satisfaction so we shall never be weary of
them. Every repetition of them will be accompanied
with a new pleasure and contentment. In the felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:37934:19"/>
of Heaven these two things shall be reconcil'd,
which never met together in any sensual delight, long
and full enjoyment and yet a fresh and perpetual
pleasure. As in Gods <hi>presence there is fulness of joy,</hi>
so <hi>at his right hand there shall be pleasures for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The happiness of the other life is not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
beyond any happiness of this world (that,
it may be, is no great commendation of it) but it is
very great in it self. The happiness of Heaven is
usually in Scripture describ'd to us by such pleasures
as are manly and excellent, chast and intellectual, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
more pure and refin'd than those of sense; and
if the Scripture at any time descend to the metaphors
of a <hi>feast,</hi> and a <hi>banquet,</hi> and a <hi>marriage,</hi> it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by way of accommodation to our weakness and
condescention to our capacities.</p>
            <p>But the chief ingredients of this happiness, so far
as the Scripture hath thought fit to reveal it to us,
are the perfection of our knowledge, and the height
of our love, and the perpetual society and friendship
of all the blessed inhabitants of those glorious mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and the joyful concurrence of all these in chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
expressions of gratitude, in the incessant praises
and admiration of the fountain and author of all this
happiness. And what can be more delightful than to
have our understandings entertain'd with a clear sight
of the best and most perfect Being, with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of all his works and of the wise designs of his
providence here in the world? than to live in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
presence of God, and to be continually atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon him whose favour is life, and whose glory
is much more above that of any of the Princes of
this world than the greatest of them is above the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
worm? The Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> thought <hi>Solomons</hi>
Servants happy in having the opportunity by standing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37934:20"/>
continually before him to hear his wisdom; but in
the other world it shall be a happiness to <hi>Solomon</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and to the wisest and greatest persons that ever
were in this world, to stand before this great King to
admire his wisdom and to behold his glory. Not that
I imagine the happiness of Heaven to consist in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
gazing upon God, and in an idle contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the glories of that place. For as by that
blessed sight we shall be infinitely transported, so the
Scripture tells us we shall be also transform'd into
the image of the divine perfections; we <hi>shall see God
and we shall be like him,</hi> and what greater happiness
can there be than to be like the happiest and most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Being in the world? Besides, who can tell what
employment God may have for us in the next life?
We need not doubt but that he who is happiness it
self, and hath promis'd to make us happy, can easily
find out such employments and delights for us in the
other world as will be proper and suitable to that state.</p>
            <p>But then besides the improvement of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
there shall be the most delightful exercise of
love. When we come to heaven we shall enter into
the society of the blessed Angels and of <hi>the spirits of
just men made perfect,</hi> that is, freed from all those
passions and infirmities which do now render the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
even of the best men, sometimes trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to one another. We shall then meet with all
those excellent Persons, those brave Minds, those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
and charitable Souls whom we have seen, and
heard, and read of in this world. There we shall
meet with many of our dear relations and intimate
friends, and perhaps with many of our enemies, to
whom we shall then be perfectly reconcil'd notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the warm contests and peevish differences
which we had with them in this world, even about
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37934:20"/>
matters of Religion. For Heaven is a state of perfect
love and friendship, there will be nothing but kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and good nature there, and all the prudent Arts
of endearment and wise ways of rendring conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
mutually pleasant to one another. And what
greater happiness can be imagin'd than to converse
freely with so many excellent persons, without any
thing of folly or disguise, of jealousie or design upon
one another? For then there will be none of those
vices and passions, of covetousness and ambition, of
envy and hatred, of wrath and peevishness, which
do now so much spoil the pleasure and disturb the
quiet of mankind. All quarrels and contentions,
schisms and divisions will then be effectually hinder'd
not by force but by love, not by compulsion but by
that <hi>charity which never fails;</hi> and all those contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
in Religion which are now so hotly agitated
will then be finally determin'd, not as we endeavour
to end them now by Canons and Decrees, but by a
perfect knowledge and convincing light.</p>
            <p>And when this blessed society is met together and
thus united by love, they shall all joyn in gratitude
to their great Patrons and Benefactors, <hi>to him that sits
upon the Throne and to the lamb that was slain, to God
even our Father, and to our Lord Jesus Christ, who
hath lov'd us and wash'd us from our sins in his own blood.</hi>
And they shall sing everlasting songs of praise to God
for all his works of wonder, for the effects of that
infinite goodness, and admirable wisdom, and almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
power, which are clearly seen in the creation and
government of the world and of all the Creatures in
it; particularly for his favours to mankind, for the
benefit of their beings, for the comfort of their lives,
and for all his mercifull providences towards them in
this world: But above all for the redemption of their
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37934:21"/>
souls by the death of his Son for the free forgiveness
of their sins, for the gracious assistance of his holy
Spirit, and for conducting them safely through all the
snares and dangers, the troubles and temptations of
this world to the secure possession of that glory and
happiness which then they shall be partakers of, and
are bound to praise God for to all eternity. This, this
shall be the employment of the blessed spirits above,
and these are the chief ingredients of our happiness
which the Spripture mentions. And if there were no
other as there may be ten thousand more for any thing
I can tell, yet generous and vertuous minds will easily
understand how great a pleasure there is in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of our knowledge, and the exercise of love,
and in a gratefull and perpetual acknowledgement of
the greatest benefits that creatures are capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving.</p>
            <p>3. This happiness shall be eternal. And though
this be but a circumstance and do not enter into the
nature of our happiness, yet it is so material a one
that all the felicities which heaven affords would be
imperfect without it. It would strangely damp and
allay all our joys to think that they should sometime
have an end. And the greater our happiness were,
the greater trouble it would be to us to consider that
it must have a period. It would make a man sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
indeed to think of leaving such vast possessions.
Indeed if the happiness of heaven were such as the joys
of this world are, it were fit they should be as short;
for after a little enjoyment it would cloy us, and we
should soon grow weary of it: But being so excellent,
it would scarce be a happiness if it were not eternal.
It would imbitter the pleasures of heaven, as great as
they are, to see to an end of them, though it were at
never so great a distance; to consider that all this vast
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:37934:21"/>
treasure of happiness would one day be exhausted,
and that after so many years were past we should be
as poor and miserable again as we were once in this
world. God hath so order'd things, that the vain and
empty delights of this world should be temporary and
transient, but that the great and substantial pleasures
of the other world should be as lasting as they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.
For Heaven as it is an <hi>exceeding,</hi> so it is <hi>an
eternal weight of glory.</hi> And this is that which crowns
the joys of heaven and banishes all fear and trouble
from the minds of the blessed. And thus to be secur'd
in the possession of our happiness is an unspeakable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to it. For that which is eternal as it shall never
determine, so it can never be diminish'd; for to be
diminish'd and to decay is to draw nearer to an end,
but that which shall never have an end can never come
nearer to it.</p>
            <p>O vast <hi>eternity!</hi> how dost thou swallow up our
thoughts and entertain us at once with delight and
amazement? This is the very top and highest pitch of
our happiness, upon which we may stand secure and
look down with scorn upon all things here below; and
how small and inconsiderable do they appear to us,
compar'd with the vast and endless enjoyments of our
future state? But oh vain and foolish souls! that are
so little concern'd for eternity; that for the trifles of
time, and <hi>the pleasures of sin which are but for a season,</hi>
can find in our hearts to forfeit an everlasting felicity.
Blessed God! why hast thou prepar'd such a happiness
for those who neither consider it, nor seek after it?
<hi>Why is</hi> such <hi>a price put into the hands of fools, who
have no heart to make use of it;</hi> who fondly chuse to
gratifie their lusts rather than to save their souls, and
sortishly prefer the temporary enjoyments of sin before
a blessed immortality?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:37934:22"/>
4. And lastly, This happiness is far above any
thing that we can now conceive or imagine. It is so
great that is cannot now <hi>enter into the heart of man.</hi>
We cannot from the experience of any of those plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and delights which we have been acquainted
withall in this world frame an equal <hi>Idea</hi> and concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it. So that when we come to Heaven we shall
be ready to say of it as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> did of
<hi>Solomon</hi>'s wisedom and prosperity, that <hi>half of it hath
not been told us;</hi> that the felicities and glories of that
state do far exceed all the fame which we heard of
them in this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For who can say how great a
good God is? and how happy he who is the fountain
of happiness can make those souls that love him, and
those whom he loves?</p>
            <p>In this imperfect state we are not capable of a full
representation of those glories. <hi>We cannot</hi> now <hi>see
God and live.</hi> A full description of Heaven and of the
pleasures of that state would let in joys upon us too
big for our narrow capacities, and too strong for weak
mortality to bear. <hi>We are now but Children, and we
speak as Children, and understand</hi> and think <hi>as Children</hi>
concerning these things; but in the other state we shall
grow up <hi>to be men,</hi> and then we shall <hi>put away</hi> these
<hi>childish</hi> thoughts; <hi>now we know but in part, but when
that which is perfect is come, that which is imperfect
shall be done away; now we see through a glass darkly</hi>
(<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in a riddle) but then we shall see face to
face; now we know in part, but then we shall know even
as also we are known,</hi> as the Apostle discourseth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
concerning this very matter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9,
10, 11.</p>
            <p>No sooner shall we enter upon the joys of the other
world, but our minds shall be rais'd to a strength and
activity as much above that of the most knowing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:37934:22"/>
in the world as the thoughts of the greatest Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
and wisest man upon earth are above the
thoughts of a child or a fool. No man's mind is now
so well fram'd to understand any thing in this world, as
our understandings shall then be fitted for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God and of the things that belong to that state.
In the mean time let us bless God that he hath reveal'd
so much of this happiness to us as is necessary to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
and encourage us to seek after it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing to be consider'd concerning our
future happiness, is the way and means whereby we
may come to be made partakers of it. And that in
short is by the constant and sincere endeavours of a
holy life, in and through the mercies of God in our
Lord Jesus Christ. Christ indeed is the author of our
salvation, but obedience is the condition of it; so the
Apostle tells us, that Christ <hi>is the author of eternal
salvation to them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5. 1. It is <hi>the
grace of God</hi> in the Gospel <hi>which brings</hi> or offers this
<hi>salvation to us,</hi> but then it is by the <hi>denying of ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and worldly lusts,</hi> and by <hi>living soberly, and
righteously, and godly in this present world</hi> that we are
<hi>to wait for the blessed hope,</hi> Tit. 2. 11, 12. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
promises this happiness to the pure in heart, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
are the pure in heart, for they shall see God;</hi> and
elsewhere the Scripture doth exclude all others from
any share or portion in this blessedness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so the Apostle
assures us <hi>that without holiness no man shall see the Lord,</hi>
Heb. 18. 14.</p>
            <p>And holiness is not onely a condition but a necessary
qualification for the happiness of the next life. This
is the force of St. <hi>John</hi>'s reasoning, <hi>we shall be like him,
for we shall see him.</hi> To <hi>see God</hi> is to be happy, but
unless we be like him we cannot see him. The sight
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:37934:23"/>
and presence of God himself would be no happiness
to that man who is not like to God in the temper and
disposition of his mind. And from hence the Apostle
infers in the next <hi>verse, every man that hath this hope in
him purifieth himself even as he is pure.</hi> So that if we
live wicked lives, if we allow our selves in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of any known sin, we interrupt our hopes of
Heaven and render our selves unfit for eternal life.
By this means we defeat all the designs of God's grace
and mercy towards us, and salvation it self cannot
save us if we make our selves incapable of that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
which God offers. Heaven is in Scripture call'd
<hi>an inheritance among them that are sanctified,</hi> and <hi>the
inheritance of the Saints in light;</hi> so that it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
that this <hi>inheritance</hi> is promis'd to us, but we
must be qualifi'd and prepar'd for it, and <hi>be made meet
to be made partakers of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this life is the time of our preparation for our
future state. Ours souls will continue for ever what
we make them in this world. Such a temper and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of mind as a man carries with him out of this
life he shall retain in the next. 'Tis true indeed, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
perfects those holy and vertuous dispositions which
are begun here; but the other world alters no man as
to his main state, <hi>he that is filthy will be filthy still,</hi> and
<hi>he that is unrighteous will be unrighteous</hi> still. If we do
not in a good degree mortifie our lusts and passions here
death will not kill them for us, but we shall carry
them with us into the other world. And if God
should admit us so qualifi'd into the place of happiness,
yet we shall bring that along with us which would
infallibly hinder us from being happy. Our sensual
inclinations and desires would meet with nothing there
that would be suitable to them, and we should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
tormented with those appetites which we
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:37934:23"/>
brought with us out of this world, because we should
find nothing there to gratifie them withall. For as the
Apostle says in another sense, <hi>The kingdom of God is
not meats and drinks, but righteousness, and peace, and
joy in the Holy Ghost.</hi> The happiness of heaven con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in such things as a wicked man hath no gust and
relish for. So that if a covetous, or ambitious, or
voluptuous man were in Heaven, he would be just
like the rich man in Hell, tormented with a continual
thirst, and burnt up in the flames of his own ardent
desires, and would not be able, amidst all the plenty
and treasures of that place, to find so much as one
drop of suitable pleasure and delight to quench and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
that heat. So likewise our fierce and unruly pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
if we should carry them with us into the other
world, how inconsistent would they be with happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
They would not onely make us miserable our
selves, but be a trouble to all those with whom we
should converse. If a man of an envious and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
of a peevish and passionate temper, were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the mansions of the blessed, he would not
onely be unhappy himself, but would disturb the quiet
of others, and raise storms even in those calm regions.
Vain man! that dreamest of being happy without
any disposition or preparation for it. To be happy,
is to enjoy what we desire and to live with those whom
we love. But there is nothing in heaven suitable to
the desires and appetites of a wicked man. All the
joys of that place, and the delights of that state are
purely spiritual, and are onely to be relish'd by those
who have <hi>purified themselves as God is pure.</hi> But if
thou be carnal and sensual, what are these things to
thee? What happiness would it be to thee to see God,
and to have him always in thy view who was never
in all thy thoughts; to be tied to live for ever in his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:37934:24"/>
company who is of a quite contrary temper and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to thy self, whose presence thou dreadest,
and whom whilst thou wast in this world thou couldst
never endure to think upon? So that the pleasures of
Heaven it self could signifie no good or happiness to
that man who is not so dispos'd as to take pleasure
in them. Heaven is too pure an air for corrupt souls
to live and breath in, and the whole employment
and conversation of that place, as it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitable,
so would it also be unacceptable to a sensual
and vicious person.</p>
            <p>From all this it appears how necessary it is for us
to prepare our selves for this blessed state, by the
constant and sincere endeavours of a holy life, and by
mortifying every lust and inordinate passion in our
souls. For till this be done we are not meet to be
made partakers of the felicities of the other world.
And thus I have done with the <hi>first</hi> thing imply'd
in this phrase <hi>of having our conversation in heaven,
viz.</hi> the serious thoughts and considerations of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
or the happiness of that state, and of the way
and means whereby that happiness is to be attained.</p>
            <p>II. The <hi>having our conversation in heaven</hi> does
imply likewise the effect which those considerations
ought to have upon our hearts and lives: As,</p>
            <p>1. To convince us of the vanity of this world.
God hath on purpose made this world troublesome
and uneasie to us, that there might be no sufficient
temptation to reasonable and considerate men to take
them off from the care and thought of their future
happiness; that God and heaven might have no rival
here below; that there might be nothing in this
world that might pretend to our affection or court us
with any advantage in comparison of everlasting life
and glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:37934:24"/>
When we come to die and eternity shall present
it self to our serious and waking thoughts, then
things will put on another face, and those things
which we valued so much in this life will then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be nothing worth; but those things which
we neglected, to be of infinite concernment to us,
and worthy to have been the care and endeavour of
our whole lives. And if we would consider these
things in time, while the opportunities of life and
health are before us, we might be convinc'd at a
cheaper rate, and come to be satisfi'd of the vanity
of this world before we despair'd of the happiness
of the other.</p>
            <p>2. To make us very active and industrious to be
as good, and to do as much good as we can in this
life, that so we may be qualifi'd and dispos'd for the
happiness of the next. Men are usually very indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
for the things of this life, to be rich and great
in the world; did we but value heaven half as much
as it deserves we should take infinitely more pains for
that. So often as we consider the glories that are
above, how does it accuse our sloth and condemn our
folly that we are less concerned for our souls than
most men are for their bodies, that we will not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
half so much for an eternal inheritance as men
ordinarily do for these corruptible things?</p>
            <p>Let us remember that we are hasting apace to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world, and that our eternal happiness now lies
at the stake. And how should it quicken our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to have such a reward set before us, to have
Crowns and Scepters in our eyes? would we but
often represent to our minds the glorious things of
another world, what fervours should we feel in our
hearts? we should be all life, and spirit, and wing;
and should do Gods will, almost with the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
and delight, as the <hi>Angels</hi> do <hi>who continually
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:37934:25"/>
behold the face of their Father.</hi> The consideration
of heaven and the firm perswasion of our future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
should actuate all the powers of our souls, and
be continually inspiring us with new vigour in the
ways of holiness and vertue. How should this
thought swell our resolutions and confirm our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
of obedience, that if we have our <hi>fruit unto
holiness</hi> our <hi>end will be everlasting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. To mitigate and lighten the evils and afflictions
of this life. It is no great matter how rough the
way be provided we be sure that it leads to happiness.
The incomparably greater good of the next life will
to a wise and considerate man weigh down all the
evils of this. And the Scripture tells us that there is
no comparison between them. <hi>The sufferings of this
present time are not worthy to be compared with the
glory which shall be revealed in us, Rom.</hi> 8. 18. The
evils of this life afflict men more or less according as
the soul is fortified with considerations proper to
support us under them. When we consider that we
have but a little while to be here, that we are upon
our journey travelling towards our heavenly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
where we shall meet with all the delights we
can desire, it ought not to trouble us much to endure
storms and foul ways, and to want many of those
accommodations we might expect at home. This is
the common fate of Travellers, and we must take
things as we find them and not look to have every
thing just to our mind. These difficulties and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
will shortly be over, and after a few
days will be quite forgotten, and be to us as if they
had never been. And when we are safely landed in
our own Country, with what pleasure shall we look
back upon those rough and boisterous Seas which we
have escap'd? The more troubles we have past
through the kinder usage we shall find when we come
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37934:25"/>
to our Fathers house. So the Apostle tells us, that
<hi>our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh
for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi>
When we come to heaven our happiness shall then be
as real as our miseries were here upon earth, and far
greater and more lasting. And what great matter is
it though we suffer a while in this world, provided
we escape the endless unsufferable torments of the
next; though we have not our good things in this
life, if infinitely greater be reserv'd for us and we
shall receive them with interest in the other?</p>
            <p>Several of the evils and calamities of this life
would be unsufferable indeed, if there were nothing
better to be hoped for hereafter. If this were true,
Christians would not onely be of all <hi>men</hi> but of all
<hi>creatures the most miserable.</hi> But our Religion hath
abundantly assur'd us to the contrary. And the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of this was that which made the primitive
Christians to embrace sufferings with so much cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
<hi>to glory in tribulation,</hi> and <hi>to take joyfully the
spoiling of their goods, knowing that in heaven they
had a better and more enduring substance.</hi> The seven
brethren in the History of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> upon this
perswasion would <hi>not accept deliverance that they
might obtain a better resurrection.</hi> That storm of
stones which was pour'd upon St. <hi>Stephen</hi> was no
more to him than a common shower when <hi>he saw the
heavens open'd,</hi> and <hi>Jesus</hi> (in whose cause he suffered)
<hi>standing on the right hand of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. To make us sincere in all our professions, words
and actions, did men firmly believe the rewards of
another world their Religion would not be onely in
shew and pretence, but in life and reality, no man
would put on a <hi>form of godliness</hi> that were destitute
of <hi>the power of it;</hi> we should do nothing for the
opinion of others, but all with regard to God and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:37934:26"/>
our own Consciences; and be as curious of our
thoughts, and most retir'd actions, as if we were in
an open theatre and in the presence of the greatest
assembly. For in the next life men shall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
for what they seem'd to be, but for what
they really were in this world. Therefore whatever
we think, or speak, or do, we should always remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that the day of revelation is coming, when the
secrets of all hearts shall be disclos'd, when all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guises
shall be laid aside, and every ones mask shall
be taken off, and all our actions and designs shall be
brought upon the publick stage and expos'd to the
view of men and Angels. <hi>There is nothing</hi> now <hi>hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
which shall not</hi> then <hi>be reveal'd, nor secret which
shall not be made known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. To arm us against the fears of death. Death
is terrible to nature, and the terrour of it is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
encreas'd by the fearful apprehensions of what may
follow it. But the comfortable hopes of a blessed
immortality do strangely relieve the fainting spirits of
dying men, and are able to reconcile us to death, and
in a great measure to take away the terror of it. I
know that the thoughts of death are dismal even to
good men, and we have never more need of comfort
and encouragement than when we are conflicting with
this last Enemy, and there is no such comfortable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
to a dying man as the hopes of a happy
eternity. He that looks upon death onely as a passage
to glory, may welcome the messengers of it as bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him the best and most joyful news that ever came
to him in his whole life, and no man can stay behind
in this world with half the comfort that this man
leaves it.</p>
            <p>And now I have done with the <hi>two</hi> things implyed
in this phrase, of <hi>having our conversation in heaven,
viz.</hi> the serious thoughts and considerations of heaven,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:37934:26"/>
and the effect of these thoughts and considerations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our hearts and lives.</p>
            <p>I crave your patience but a little longer, till I make
some reflection upon what hath been deliver'd concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the happiness of good men after this life. I have
told you that it is incomparably beyond any happiness
of this world, that it is great in it self, and eternal in
its duration, and far above any thing that we can now
conceive or imagine. And now after all this, I am
very sensible how much all that I have said comes short
of the greatness and dignity of the thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that I
could almost begin again and make a new attempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this subject. And indeed who would not be loth to
be taken off from so delightfull an argument? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
'tis good for us to be here, and to let our minds
dwell upon these considerations. We are unworthy
of heaven and unfit to partake of so great a glory, if
we cannot take pleasure in the contemplation of those
things now the possession whereof shall be our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for ever.</p>
            <p>With what joy then should we think of those <hi>great
and glorious things which God hath prepar'd for them
that love him, of that inheritance incorruptible, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil'd,
which fadeth not away, reserv'd for us in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens?</hi>
How should we welcome the thoughts of that
happy hour when we shall make our escape out of
these prisons, when we shall pass out <hi>of this howling
wilderness</hi> into <hi>the promis'd Land,</hi> when we shall be
remov'd from all the troubles and temptations of a
wicked and ill-natured world; when we shall be past
all storms, and secur'd from all further danger of
shipwreck, and shall be safely landed in the regions of
bliss and immortality?</p>
            <p>O blessed time! <hi>When all tears shall be wiped from our
eyes,</hi> and <hi>death and sorrow shall be no more;</hi> When
<hi>mortality</hi> shall <hi>be swallowed up of life,</hi> and we shall
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37934:27"/>
enter upon the possession of all that happiness and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which God hath promis'd, and our faith hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
and our hopes have rais'd us to the expectation
of; when we shall be eas'd of all our pains, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
of all our doubts, and be purg'd from all our
sins, and be free'd from all our fears, and be happy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all our hopes, and have all the happiness secur'd
to us beyond the power of time and change: When
we shall know God and other things without study,
and love him and one another without measure, and
serve and praise him without weariness, and obey his
will without the least reluctancy; and shall still be
more and more delighted in the knowing, and loving,
and praising, and obeying of God to all eternity.</p>
            <p>How should these thoughts affect our hearts, and
what a mighty influence ought they to have upon our
lives? The great disadvantage of the arguments
fetch'd from another world is this, that those things
are at a great distance from us, and not sensible to us;
and therefore are not apt to affect us to strongly, and
to work so powerfully upon us. Now to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
for this disadvantage we should often revive
these considerations upon our mind, and inculcate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our selves the reality and certainty of these things
together with the infinite weight and importance of
them. We should reason thus with our selves; If
good men shall be so unspeakably happy, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
wicked men so extreamly miserable in another
world: If these things be true and will one day be
found to be so, why should they not be to me as if
they were already present? why should not I be as
much afraid to commit any sin as if Hell were naked
before me, and I saw the astonishing miseries of the
damned? and why should I not be as careful to serve
God and keep his commandments, as if Heaven were
open to my view, and I saw <hi>Jesus</hi> standing at the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:37934:27"/>
right hand of God with crowns of glory in his hand
ready to be set upon the heads of all those who
continue faithfull to him?</p>
            <p>The lively apprehensions of the nearness of death
and eternity are apt to make mens thoughts more
quick and piercing, and according as we think our
selves prepar'd for our future state to transport us with
joy, or to amaze us with horrour. For the soul that
is fully satisfi'd of his future bliss is already entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
heaven, has begun to take possession of glory, and
has (as it were) his blessed Saviour in his arms, and
may say with old <hi>Simeon, Lord now lettest thou thy
servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
But the thoughts of death must needs be very
terrible to that man who is doubtfull or despairing of
his future condition. It would daunt the stoutest man
that ever breathed, to look upon death when he can
see nothing but hell beyond it. When the Apparition
at <hi>Endor</hi> told <hi>Saul, to morrow thou and thy Sons shall
be with me,</hi> these words struck him to the heart, so
that <hi>he fell down to the ground, and there was no more
strength left in him.</hi> It is as certain that we shall die
as if an express messenger should come to every one
of us from the other world and tell us so. Why
should we not then always live as those that must die,
and as those that hope to be happy after death? To
have these apprehensions vigorous and lively upon our
minds this is <hi>to have our conversation in heaven, from
whence also we look for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ,
who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned
like unto his glorious body, according to the working of
that mighty power whereby he is able even to subdue all
things to himself.</hi>
