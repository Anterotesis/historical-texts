            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Prethee forbear, our fortunes are so sad, that rather than lament we should study how to mend them, though <hi>Oviedo</hi> and <hi>Pyrracco</hi> have their Defects, yet they are liberal Masters, and by their Mony, we have furnish'd for your Use, that fine Appartment you are now to lodge in, by which we have been able to lay a Design, so likely to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, that the Joy it gives me, has suppressed my Grief.</p>

                  <speaker>Guzm.</speaker>
                  <p>And she should have consider'd mine; for I'm sure 'tis fitter for a Woman to bear ill Language than for a Man to do it. I am so tender in point of Honour, that if mine were offended, though by a Child of four Years old, yet I would resent it to the last degree; besides, the Feminine Sex is so paultry a Sex, as I have no reverence for any one of it, that I am not first in Love with: But prithee help me, 'tis my Custom when I draw my Sword to fling away the Scabbard, and now I cannot find it.</p>

<stage>Two ready.</stage>
before Dinner, and at Two in the Afternoon you must at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him alone; for he will admit of no Witnesses, lest the

prodigious Effects of his Art, might by the Ignorant, pass for Magick, and he by two Testimonies be condemn'd by the Inquisition.</p>

                  <p>No, no, these are sad and real Truths: I told you the Affront you cast upon the Lady in the Blew would be resented by some of her Friends or Gallants; and these that would have come in to you now with a Challenge, were a couple of Gentlemen, who say they come from <hi>Oviedo</hi> and <hi>Piracco</hi>; unknown the one unto the other, and meeting here by Accident, found each of them brought a Challenge from his Friend to you.</p>

                  <p>Can you ask that question, and know that the fam'd <hi>Alcanzar</hi> lives in the next Street? I wish whilst you are cheapning the Bargain, that they do not clap it up. If a couple of certain Duels, and perhaps a hundred more to follow (for only Fate knows where so brisk a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning will meet an End) be not worth Five hundred Crowns to get off with Honour and Victory, let your Parsimony and your Wisdom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider; but I have decreed to abjure your Company, for nothing less than Charms can secure you or any one that keeps it.</p>

                  <p>'Tis a sign you are not of the fighting Crew of the Town, that ask who they are. Why, they are Men that can hardly Sleep without a Murther: They have spent half their Estates only in the many Pardons their Valour has forc'd them to take out. In one Word, you had better have a Quarrel with all <hi>Salamanca</hi> than with them, and you must fight with them both by Six a Clock, or they'll have kill'd you before Seven.</p>

                  <p>Laws! They no more value Laws than they do their own Souls; one of them sent a Cartel to a Judge upon a Bench, for not salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him as he past by, by accident. Others fear the Laws, but they make the Laws fear them. But having warn'd you of your Danger, fare you well.</p>

                  <p>Fear not, you shall try the Charms in his Closet, before you prove them in the Field. But while we are thus talking, I know not if there will be time enough left for him to prepare for you such efficacious Spells; and if by Six you are not ready, take what will follow the next Hour. Here's your Ticket to him: Now go fetch your Crowns, that I may with them, smooth your Way to him.</p>

                     <hi>Piracco,</hi> Good Morrow, I hope you have not slept to Night.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pir.</speaker>
                  <p>Why not slept to Night?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ovie.</speaker>
                  <p>I think your Heart is low, if after leaving me ingag'd as you did, you could take any rest till your Honour were restor'd; You made a very quick retreat Sir.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pir.</speaker>
                  <p>Me thought Yours was not very slow; I watch'd you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ovie.</speaker>
                  <p>'Slight, 'twas time to make a Retreat when you fled from me, and a dozen Bravoes fell on me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pir.</speaker>
                  <p>A dozen Bravoes?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ovie.</speaker>
                  <p>Bravoes did I say? I meant Furies, they laid about them so; especially one that made <hi>Alongès</hi> above thirty Foot; I Parried fifty times, and if ever I dealt like a Cavalier of Honour, 'twas in that Occasion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pir.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Ovie.</speaker>
                  <p>Some Scratches I had, Marks rather of Honour than of Danger; which with my Sympathetick Powder I have cur'd this Night: But I have sent a File of them into the <hi>Elizian</hi> Shades, and had I not been affraid of drawing more Blood upon my Soul, I would have dispatched the rest: Fear of doing, not receiving hurt, made me retire.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pir.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, though one of your Antagonists made an <hi>Alongè</hi> of Thirty Foot with his Sword; yet you have made a longer with your Tongue; for there were but two in all, and I have disarm'd them by a Stratagem; look, here are both their Swords: Shew me such Trophies of your Valour, as I have shew'd you my Policy.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Ovie.</speaker>
                  <p>Two Swords? by my left <hi>Mustachio,</hi> these two Swords belong unto some of those Six that I sent Post to <hi>Charon.</hi> These are but the Glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of my Valour's Harvest.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pir.</speaker>
                  <p>And by my right <hi>Mustachio,</hi> these are all the Swords were in your dozen Furies hands, which by my Contrivance I forc'd from them; talk what you please, this is the naked Truth.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>Nature is yet the strongest, but if thou provokest me farther, the Tie of Blood shall soon be Sacrific'd to the Resentments of my Honour.</p>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ovie.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, that the two Beauties we saw last Night, are <hi>Pastrana</hi> and <hi>Antonia,</hi> whom before we slighted.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pir.</speaker>
                  <p>For certain.</p>

                  <speaker>Ovie.</speaker>
                  <p>It has rais'd in me a greater Conflict than that I had last Night with the two half dozen of Bravoes; for should we make Addresses there, the Grave <hi>Solomons,</hi> our Uncles, would so domineer over us, that we had better be Slaves at <hi>Tituan,</hi> than endure their Tyranny; and if I make not my Addresses there, I must decline both what my Honour and my Inclination leads me to, for there I meet with Charming Beauties, and with certainty of fighting Rivals: Two things my very Soul is tickl'd with.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pir.</speaker>
                  <p>I must confess, she in the Pink Charms me, as much as she in the Blew does you; but leave it to my Policy to manage our Addresses there, without their knowledge, for I also fear their insulting more than you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ovie.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, on things of Valour thou shalt rely on me, as I on things of Policy on thee; but lose no Opportunity.</p>

                  <p>Why Sir, this Evening, or else my Stars deceive me; (which they seldom do) you will receive two Cartels: Now in regard <hi>I</hi> would make your Valour famous, <hi>I</hi> would not have you fight the ordinary way with Swords, but Pistols (for they sending the Challenge, you may chuse the Weapon) This they will dread, and therefore <hi>I</hi> would have you Shot-free. When you will be made Invulnerable against the Sword, you know the Price, to which you must add two Hours Warning.</p>

Ladies, why do you thus come in Masquerade? Can you
believe that I can tell Future Events, and yet think a little Crape can hide things present from my knowledge?

                  <p>I take it for granted, this Sealed Letter is of the same Tenure, and to both the Premises. <hi>I</hi> Answer, that <hi>I</hi> have Vow'd to fight but one Duel a day, especially when the first is to be begun after Seven in the Evening: In brief, for <hi>I</hi> long to be at it, <hi>I</hi>'ll give one his Supper, and the other his Break-fast; and that's fare: But <hi>I</hi> thought by the fold of their Epistles, they had understood the Punctillio's of Duels; and yet they are so Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as to send the Challenge and appoint the Weapons; that belongs to me: Not but that <hi>I</hi> would have Nam'd Swords, had they had the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or good Manners to have left it to my Choice: But now <hi>I</hi> will not so much as have a Sword in the Field, only to thwart them; <hi>I</hi> am resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to fight with any Fire-Arms, from the Pocket Pistol to the Cannon

                  <p>And therefore, Sir, I choose it: A famous <hi>Monsieur</hi> of <hi>Gallia Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi> brought up the Mode of fighting Duels with single Rapier, which ever since has borne his Name, and has been call'd by the <hi>Cartelists à la Bouteville</hi>: And I who have fought ten times more Duels than he, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce fighting with great Guns, which shall hereafter be called Duels <hi>à la Guzman</hi>; on their batter'd Carcasses I'll raise my self a Name.</p>

                  <p>Well, rather than protract my Sport, (for such Duels are to me) I am content, for this time, to fight but with a Case of Pistols, and neither Sword nor Dagger shall be in the Field; when this Evening I have kill'd <hi>Oviedo,</hi> (for it is natural the Eldest Brother to dye first) if to morrow Morning <hi>Piracco</hi> has a mind to the like Fate; I shall look to hear from him again: And then let him expect Leaden-Pill to purge away his Mortality—You have your Answers.</p>

                  <p>Rave! do you call it? Why, I tell you what I would have had him done: I would have had him fought on his stump rather than have disappointed such a Cavaliero as I am, Men fire Pistols with their Hands, and not with their Legs, and since the Fighting limb was Sound, he should not have shunned the Duel, because the Running limb was hurt: The <hi>Poltroon</hi> shews by this, that he trusted more to his Feet than to his Hands.

You Mr. Examinator, come hither quickly and learn Manners. This Beautiful Lady calls my Godson right, that is to say <hi>Don Ove</hi>; for till he recovers his long Name in Combat, he shall wear my short one. By the Great Cham of <hi>Tartary</hi> he shall. And let me see who dares say me nay. — Now Madam, to Answer you;
<stage>He puts his Arms a Kembo.</stage>
I declare, this <hi>Don Ove</hi> is one of the Roaring Boys of <hi>Salamanca</hi>; his younger Brother is call'd <hi>Piracco,</hi> who was to Fight with me to Morrow Morning; but I have certain Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he means to break both his Arms to avoid it: And therefore by way of Prophecy, I have Christned him by the name of <hi>Piracco the Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Maim'd.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Anto.</speaker>
                  <p>But suppose <hi>Piracco</hi> should Fight with you to Morrow Morning, what will you call him then?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Guzm.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi>'ll call him then what he shall be then, <hi>Piracco the Defunct</hi>; so bad a Name, that if he has Discretion, he will rather chuse that of the <hi>Self-Maim'd.</hi> But Madam, who are those two Fellows that dare stay in this Room, while I come to Court you in it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Anto.</speaker>
                  <p>One is call'd <hi>Don Ove,</hi> and thee other <hi>Don Piracoo, the Self-Maim'd,</hi> or the <hi>Defunct</hi> that shall be; I wonder you do not know your own God sons.</p>

                  <p>The Rage of being disappointed of my Duel, so heated my Blood, that I could not hold from visiting <hi>Antonia</hi> and <hi>Pastrana</hi>; for thou knowest when our Veins are warm'd, we love to fool a little with our Mistresses, with whom I found <hi>Oviedo</hi> and <hi>Piracco,</hi> whose Faces I no more knew than I do <hi>Iudas Iscariot</hi>'s.</p>

                  <p>By <hi>Procris,</hi> that's pretty; why, though she were thy Wise, I hope I might visit her: But to the Point, the Ladies found Anger written in my Looks in Text-hand, and having prest me often to know the Cause, I at last told them it, when suddenly behind my back, <hi>Oviedo</hi> and <hi>Piracco</hi> both drew on me, and had not <hi>Antonia</hi>'s Kindness and Shrieks given me notice of their Treachery, I had been spitted; but instantly fetching a Pyrowet on my Heel, and whipping out my Rapier and my Ponyard, I did, with them, break both their Thrusts at once.</p>

                  <p>Then I prest the nearest with my Dagger, and the farthest with my Tuck, so furiously, that I made the Ladies run Squeaking out of the Chamber, and my two Antagonists retire toward the Door, through which I forced both of them with a double Stockada. (An Art I learn'd of a fam'd <hi>Morisco</hi> Fencer, and which, in Crowds, has often stood me in good stead) But then, By <hi>Hannibal</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> I fell into the <hi>Golian</hi> Ambush I told thee of.</p>

                  <p>That denial pleas'd me most, for 'twas a Proof they meant to grant us, what they would blush at when they did it, that they so covered their Faces. Besides, I have enquired of their Deportments and Quality of some of their Neighbors, and find their Carriage is most strict and virtuous, and that they are Daughters to a Gentleman of a good Family, who dy'd a Beggar: So that to marry Men of our Estates and Degree, is a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness they could scarcely hope; but we are Rich enough, and they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiously Handsom, and their Gay-humor pleases me as much as their Beauties.</p>

                  <p>No; But since <hi>Francisco</hi> has betray'd himself, and bely'd me; I'll use him as he deserves, and prove my self an honest Man: Yes, the Lady you speak of is now here, but so Fair and Rich, that did my Profession allow of Wedlock, I my self would marry her; 'tis true, he got her to come hither, and would have brib'd me to have feign'd an Oracle to his Advantage: But what my Justice made me Scorn to do for him, my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge provokes me to do for you.</p>

            <p>UPON my Perusal of <hi>Guzman</hi> in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript, I thought it a piece of Justice to the World, as well as to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of your Lordships Honorable Grand-Father, the most Ingenious and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd Earl of <hi>Orrery,</hi> to see it Published with the Volume of his other Plays. I was surprized to find, that the Author of the <hi>Black Prince, Harry the Fifth,</hi> and <hi>Mustapha,</hi> should have a Genius for Comedy, when he condescended to that Task. The Tale of <hi>Guzman</hi> appears to have been a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Design, and therefore naturally grave; but the Spirit of my Lord <hi>Orrery</hi>'s Wit was sufficient
<pb facs="tcp:63098:32"/>
to quicken the Mass, to enliven and beautifie it to that degree as renders it an Entertainment for an English Reader. The Intriegue is carried on with Variety of Accidents and Pleasant Circumstances, and (which is the Life and Perfection of Comedy,) wound up into a natural and surprizing Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. I have very seldom seen so many Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Persons and separate Interests managed with so much Conduct, as not to perplex the Tale, but every Thing serviceable to the Progress of the main Design. The Reputation of <hi>Mustapha</hi> has been established by the Approbation of all sorts of Spectators, and will continue a just Model of Tragedy, as long as the Stage shall last. The Story is magnificent, the Characters and Persons of the Noblest Rank, which are all maintained to their Dignity, and preserved in their proper Colours; The Business of greatest Importance; The Expression and Sentiments Just and Noble; The Passion and Distress wrought up to such a Height, as commands our Attention and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>The Noble Author of the ensuing Comedy was furnish'd within himself for any Performance of Wit, forasmuch as no Man of his Time better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood Men and Things. He was not only an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Ingenuity Himself, but a great Encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of it in Others. Indeed there was no sort of Merit that escaped his Patronage. Poetry was but one of his Accomplishments. As for his other Qualifications, derived to him from his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, those he supported in his own Person and Character, and transmitted them with Advantage to your Lordships Honorable Father, who has again resign'd them as Hereditary to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. That Sweetness of Temper, that Principle of Justice and Generosity, which are already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous in your Lordship, give sure Promises,
<pb facs="tcp:63098:32"/>
that you will maintain the Honor and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Predecessors. The World and Time are yet before you, and you have already obtain'd so great an Interest in Mankind, as to have every Body's good Wishes. For my own part I am ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, not only upon the promising Hopes I have conceived of your Lordship, but likewise upon the Alliance you have to our most Honorable <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Maecenas,</hi> to whom the Acknowledgments of the Muses are eternally devoted, neither will it ever be determined, whether he is more a Favorer of <hi>them,</hi> or <hi>their</hi> Favorite. I have already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted your Lordship with the Occasion of this Address, and cannot despair of your Lordship's Acceptance of the following Piece in Print, which (I question not) will be favorably received by the World. I would only farther beg leave to say, that I am, with all Respect and Sincerity,</p>
