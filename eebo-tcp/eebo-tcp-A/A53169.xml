            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe late Tryal of Sir <hi>G. W.</hi> and the other Priſoners Arraigned with him, being upon a Charge of the higkeſt and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Nature, had occaſioned abundance of antecedent noiſe and diſcourſe about it in the Town; not a little augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its being once put off to a longer day, and ſome other conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant Circumſtances which had poſſeſt peoples heads with mountain-Conceits, that they ſhould ſee moſt hideous Monſters unkennell'd, and ſcrew'd up their expectations to the higheſt Pin; but finding thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious gapings ſomewhat Bilkt, 'tis no wonder if they expreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in different Paraphraſes, and ſome extravagant enough; for 'tis the nature of the <hi>many headed-Beaſt</hi> to be ſuſpitious, calumnious, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous, mad to have folks hang'd, and as mad to pitty them when they hear them lying at the Gallows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:57391:2"/>
For my part, I know not any judicious Proteſtant in the world, that wiſhes not but that all the Papiſts that are yet to be tried, might on fair, juſt, impartial proceedings, approve themſelves innocent: for 'tis not their perſons but damnable practices that we hate. But certainly they are no Friends that endeavour from this Occurrence to fly-blow folks heads with Calumnies and ſiniſter Opinions of the Evidence that have deſerv'd ſo much of the Nation. 'Tis true, if to <hi>Accuſe</hi> were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, ſcarce <hi>Any</hi> would be <hi>Innocent.</hi> But 'tis as true, that if to <hi>Deny</hi> were enough, <hi>None</hi> would be <hi>Guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis certainly the Honour of the Witneſſes, and a great Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all ſober men of their good Conſcience and Integrity, that they would not venture upon any dubious Poſitives, nor ſtrain a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; which, had they been of a profligated temper, 'tis not to be ſuppoſed they would have boggled at. Nor does the Law vote it any Blemiſh on the Priſoners Repute, to have been tried when acquitted: For that ſevere honeſt man <hi>Cato</hi> was above Thirty times Arraigned. Much leſs ought there to be any Ill-murmurings ſpread on the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Court, or the Gentlemen of the Jury, who are to proceed <hi>Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Allegata &amp; Probata;</hi> and where Life is in the Ballance, every ſyllable muſt be exactly weighed by the Legal Standard. Yet there are a gaggling Flock of Town-talkers that, though they know nothing of the matter, will be cenſuring this way or that, juſt as the Toy takes them; as pertly and dogmatically, as if they were of the <hi>Quorum</hi> in a Commiſſion of Review.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid thus much to diſcountenance the Inſolence of ſuch dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veling Animadverters, concerning thoſe perſons Acquittal, we now proceed to ſpeak of ſome other people under ſeverer Stars; who for Common Rogueries were this day convey'd to Execution.</p>
            <p>ON <hi>Friday</hi> laſt the 18th of this inſtant <hi>July,</hi> there were in all Nine that received ſentence of Death, Seven men and Two wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Some of them, where there were any probable grounds for hope of future amendment, obtained a gracious Reprieve; the reſt came now to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>During their being under Condemnation in <hi>Newgate,</hi> not onely Mr. Ordinary, who is never wanting to improve that diſmal time as far as poſſible he can for the Spiritual good and Soul-advantage of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Priſoner that comes under his important Charge, but likewiſe ſome other godly Miniſters took indefatigable pains to make them ſenſible of their ſad Condition, and to awaken them to look out
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57391:2"/>
and prepare for their future State, being in the Jaws of Deſtruction, and on the very brink of Eternal as well as Temporal Ruine; if by ſpeedy ſincere Repentance, and a firm well-grounded, not empty, cuſtomary, notional Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, they did not provide for their Immortal Souls.</p>
            <p>One of the Coiners ſeemed to have a more than ordinary Impreſſion made on his Spirit by theſe Spiritual Exhortations, and did oft expreſs his great ſorrow for his Crimes, eſpecially mentioning and bewailing his large-ſpreading ſin in defrauding and wronging ſuch multitudes of people, and many of them peradventure poor and not able to bear it, by putting abroad ſuch quantities of baſe Counterfeit Money.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Katherine Jumana,</hi> Condemned for Murthering her Baſtard-Child, was very ill and weak all the while after Sentence; She ſpent the greateſt part of her time in Tears, deſired all young Women by her ſad Example to take ſpecial warning to avoid Lightneſs, Immodeſty, and Laſciviouſneſs; and eſpecially to dread that horrid and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Folly and Impiety, of thinking to cover one Crime with a greater, and adde the Scarlet Sin of Murther to that filthy one of Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. That ſhe found by ſad Experience, that how cloſe ſoever ſuch Villany was carried, God would one day bring it to light, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſh the Authors, both in this world, and (if they repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not) in the World to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward Gowin</hi> was Condemned for a Robbery on the Highway. Five of them ſet upon a Coach coming from <hi>Chiſwick,</hi> in which there was a Captain and his Brother, who though they had ſecured the Coachman, made ſo brave a defence, that the Thieves were glad to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, ſome of them being much wounded, without any other Booty but a Beaver-hat valued at Three pounds.</p>
            <p>There were two others Arraigned with him, but onely he found guilty, becauſe to the other two the Evidence was not poſitive, and ſo they were ſet a ſide. He ſeemed very reſolute and ſtubborn in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment for a day or two, expecting, as it was thought, a Reprieve; but when at laſt he muſt ſuffer, he began to relent, and expreſs much ſorrow and contrition for his ill ſpent life. He acknowledged that he was ſeduced and drawn away by ill Companie to lewd Courſes; and deſired all men to avoid vile Women, naughty Houſes, and Nurſes of Debaucherie, as the Highway to Ruine and Deſtruction. He was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Prayer for the two laſt days before he died; and 'tis ſaid, made ſome very ingenuous Confeſſions of former Pranks he had plaid, and Robberies by him committed, not meet here to be divulg'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:57391:3"/>
               <hi>Elias Hutchings</hi> was a notable Diver, one of the moſt dexterous Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dycrafts-men that ever belonged to the Colledge, he was wont to go in a garb as rich as moſt men about the Town, and generally paſſed for a Dutch Merchant, for which indeed there was ſome reaſon; for having long followed the Trade of Pocket-picking, and chiefly aiming to make Prizes of Watches, and Silver Tobacco boxes; when he had at any time gotten a conſiderable Cargo of them together, then would he ſlip over with them into <hi>Holland,</hi> and barter them away for other Commodities, the putting off of which here, gave him reputation in various Company, and thereby the better opportunities to ſalute their Fobs when he ſaw occaſion, without being ſuſpected. But of late he took upon him the Quality of a Disbanded Officer, and when he was apprehended, had no leſs than Eighteen Watches taken in his cuſtody.</p>
            <p>The day before they ſuffered, the Miniſter exhorting, inſtructing, and examining each of them apart, and then praying with and for them a conſiderable time, they generally appeared in a very ſober compoſed frame of ſpirit, very ſenſible of their approaching end, ſome with Tears, and all with deep ſighs and groans, imploring mercy and favour from God, and pardon and forgiveneſs for the ſake and only merits of Jeſus, of all their crying ſins which they freely acknowledged, as they had been innumerable for number, ſo likewiſe were they moſt black and horrid in their particular nature and circumſtances.</p>
            <p>One of them eſpecially lamented and bewailed his ſin in breaking ſo oft his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Vows to God, and violating holy Reſolutions that he had formerly made to amend his life, forſake ill Company, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet preſently upon the leaſt temptation, like the Swine returned again to the Mire, and inſtead of redeeming the time, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending, became every day worſe and worſe, till at laſt Cuſtome of ſinning having taken away Sence of ſin, he became ſo hardened, as to commit wickedneſs without any Checks or Remorſe, till God was pleaſed to awaken his Conſcience by this juſt Sentence of Death.</p>
            <p>They were carried to <hi>Tyburne</hi> in this order; <hi>Wilmot</hi> and <hi>Davenpors</hi> Drawn on a Sledge: The three for Robbery, <hi>viz. Gowin, Williams,</hi> and <hi>Jones</hi> (the two laſt for robbing a Gentleman in the <hi>Strand</hi> of a Beaver-Hat) in one Cart, and the Woman and <hi>Hutchins</hi> in another; but the ſaid <hi>Hutchins</hi> being met with a Reprieve as he was going to Execution, was immediately brought back. They all appeared very penitent in their Behaviour, and the three eſpecially wept and mourned lamentably; and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot</hi> carried himſelf Modeſtly and Devoutly.</p>
            <p>They had the day before, and that morning, declared their minds to Mr. Ordinary and others in the Priſon; and therefore at the place of Execution did not make any formal Confeſſion: onely in general Terms acknowledging what vile ſinners they had bee; and earneſtly deſiring all preſent to take warning by their ſhameful and untimely Ends; to avoid thoſe Evil Courſes, as Idleneſs, Riot, Drunkenneſs, lewd Company, Uncleanneſs, and what was a great Inlet to all theſe, Breach of the Sabbath, and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of Gods publick Ordinances and Prayer in private: which being omitted, the Soul is let looſe to all Impiety, and Satan finding her without a Guard, leads her Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive at his pleaſure. Theſe were the ſins which theſe poor wretches ſaid had haſtened their Death and cut them off in the prime of their years, and would undoubtedly ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or later be the ruine of all that continue to walk therein. Then they went to prayer, and ſo were Executed.</p>
