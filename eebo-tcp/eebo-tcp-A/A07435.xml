            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Notwythstandyng I graunte, that there is a certayne difference in the preceptes and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of god. For some there be, that we are alwayes bounde and subiecte vnto, as are the morall

               <p>I haue to say thys. As for the aunswere that I haue broughte out of Ireneus, I dooe not greatly leane vpon it. For in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of the Actes of the Apostles to baptize in the name of Chryste is to baptize by hys commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">What is to baptise in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of Chryst.</note> and according to his wil and institution.</p>
               <p>Wherby we mai rather co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude and gather, that the Apostles dyd

               <p>For why? It was done to thys

we receaue so much there, as God hath appointed to geue vnto vs, of whose will we can not be certified but only by hys worde.</p>
               <p>But Chryste hath ordayned ii partes of thys sacrament, saying of the one: This is my body, and of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other: thys is my blood, meaninge therby, that in the bread being wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thely receaued, and accordynge to Christes institucion, we are made partakers of his bodye, and in the wine, partakers of his bloode: and hath left vnto vs expresse wordes, for or touchyng these thyngs: ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore we must rather trust to hym, than to mans sophistications or subtyll argumentes.</p>
               <p>I confesse and graunte that the body of Christ,<note place="margin">Christes bodi in hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen is not wythout blood.</note> whiche is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, is not wythout blood.

               <p>Why will ye not vnderstande that thys saying of Christe ought ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to be vnderstanded and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Gentiles or heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not particularly? It is most true, that in the firste settinge foorth of Christendome, that is to say, of the Christen religion and gospell, we must beginne at the doctryne. For when a citie, contreye or realme, must be wonne to Chryst, afore we come to baptisme, preaching must be vsed.</p>
               <p>Whyche when it is once recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and beeleued, not onelye they, that be of age, are baptised, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so they offer their litell ones to bee baptysed.</p>
               <p>That therefore, that was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of Christ, ye wil bryng it to a particular baptisynge
<pb facs="tcp:10521:26"/>
of children. The Greke worde is Matheteusantes, which signifieth to make disciples, and to aggregat or gather vnto Chryste, whyche thyng, in them that are of age, is do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both by doctryne and baptisme, in the yonge children by baptisme on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, because they are not yet able to receaue the doctrine.

Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian rehearseth the causes, why y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lordes supper or communion is ministred in the mornyng: the first is, because the people maye better come together at that houre, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at any other tyme of the day besides: for in the daye time much busines chaunceth, whereby men are pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked away from the diuine seruice. The seconde is, because men ar at that tyme sobre, and haue theyr myndes more apte to receaue and beare awaye Godlye lessons and wholsome doctryne.</p>
               <p>The thirde is, because the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:10521:28"/>
is a good monument or reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beraunce of the Lordes resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on or rising agayne, which thing is much auaileable to the institucion of thys sacrament.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is to bee noted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the aunciente fathers, when they obserued and kept any general fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinge, beecause they tooke then no meate till nyght, wer wont to haue the Communion in the eueninge: for when they fasted, thei gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues al the day long to prayers, to hearyng of sermons, to singinge of Godly Hymmes, and to other lyke Godly exercises.</p>
               <p>Aboute the euenyng the communi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on or lords supper was ministred they receued the sacrament, and so eueri ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> went home to take hys re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>paste.</p>
               <p>Howbeit in Saint Augustins tyme they were wonte in manye

churches, vpon maundye thirsday to receaue the communion at night that so they myghte the better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Christes institution and do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ynge: but I fynde that this custo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e was abolyshe and put downe by the sixte counsell,<note place="margin">The sixte Counsel. of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stant<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nople kept in Trullo.</note> that was kepte at Constantinople in Trullo, the Canons of whych counsell are set forth in greke, wherin mentyon is made, of the custome that was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vsed in the churches of Affrica.

               <p>I say, that we ought to consyder in it two significations.<note place="margin">Ans. to the 13. ob.</note> The one is touching remission of synnes, and the clensing or purging away of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fylthynesse of the mynde, whyche is geuen vs by Chryst.

               </p>
               <p>Besydes that, thys washynge was a token or sygne of Chrysten loue and of the submission of the

If I then beyng your Lord and master haue washed your fete, ye ought also to washe one an others fete. By the whyche commaundement he wold signifie vnto vs, that we oughte for no maner of worldly dignitie, to wythdrawe our selues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that seruice and dutye, that we owe to our neighboure or Chrysten bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea in thynges that seme most vile, whyche thynge Chryste dyd for our example performe and full<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fill.<note place="margin">Where wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shyng of fete was v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed &amp; why it was v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note>

               <p>The washing of the fete, was a thing much vsed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Iewes. For in suche hotte contryes, as Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is, when menne did trauayll on foote, their bodies were much wea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryed
<pb facs="tcp:10521:30"/>
with heate: therefore the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of their fete, when they were weari and ful of dust, was no smal refreshing vnto them, specially se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in those contreyes menne were not so well shod as they are wyth vs.</p>
               <p>Els how could Chryste haue had his fete washed by the synne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full woman and wiped wyth her heares,<note place="margin">Luke. 10.</note> excepte he had had hys fete bare, or so shod that his shoes might easely be pulled of?

               <p>Truly master person, I haue mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked them wel, and I trust, ye shal say no lesse, by that tyme ye haue heard myne answer.</p>
               <p>As for the first argument, that ye haue brought,<note place="margin">Ans. to the 16. obiec.</note> saying that Chryste hath some tymes ministred vnder
<pb facs="tcp:10521:34"/>
one kynd, because we read in Luk that his disciples knewe him by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breakyng of bread, that verelye is to weake, yea and verye foolyshe also.</p>
               <p>For ye shal neuer be able to shewe that the breakynge of bread doeth in that place signifie the holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, syth that the same maner of speakyng is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy scriptures applyed verye often tymes to the commaundementes. And it is no meruail, that those disciples knew him by breakyng of bread, or by ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kyng of commen meate. For syth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ (as we maye Godly beleue of hym) hadde certayne peculyare thankes geuinge and prayers, he myght easely be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that Chryst did then at that tyme geue one parte of the Sacramente onely: shall it be lawfull for vs to dooe it therefore? He dyd not by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10521:35"/>
same one onelye doinge abrogate or abolyshe the generall commaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dement, that he gaue at his supper, and afterwardes was confyrmed by the writinges of the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lystes and of Paul.</p>

               <p>For these blasphemous priuat masses were not yet then vsed.<note place="margin">Priuate masses are here called when no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>But ye laboure not to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye from it dogges and swyne, by whom much greater iniurye is done to the bloud of Chryste, than if some droppes of it shoulde bee spilled on the grounde: therefore I would counsayll the ministers, if at lest I were worthy to geue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
