            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO Edward Tayler <abbr>ESQ</abbr>
            </head>
            <p>THAT I interrupt your Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with such a trifling Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent (for even your Retirement is Busie) wou'd need an Appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy with a Friend of more Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony and less good Humour. Your Judgment will set a value on <hi>Poetry</hi> from any Hand, and your Kindness dispense with the imperfect <hi>Essays</hi> of a Friend. The general hard Censure of <hi>Poetry,</hi> and its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, has sometimes been the Subject of our <hi>Discourse,</hi> where amongst other Reflections, we have with some surprize, observ'd that none hold this <hi>Art</hi> in less esteem than your gravest Pretenders to Learning; but tax it on such an Account, as they, of all Men, should least insist upon. <hi>Its Insignificancy to the World,</hi> What can be easier than to recriminate in this Case? Will not impartial Censure prefer the Author of <hi>Chevee-Chase</hi> to the nicest Distinguisher in <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks?</hi> What difference (as to publick benefit, between idle Speculations and the slightest Madri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galls, excepting that the former is a more Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Impertinence, and the Folly made Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend with a Gown and Title,</p>
            <p>In the mean time 'tis forgotten what <hi>Aristotle</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:92991:3"/>
himself (even against his own Profession) has declared in behalf of the Muses? <hi>That Poetry (Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy in particular) is more effectual to instruct Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind than Philosophy.</hi> And ev'n <hi>Tully</hi> is Poetical in pleading for this Faculty: <hi>Haec Studia Adole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scentiam alant, Senectutem oblectant, Secundas Res ornant, Adversis per sugium ac solatium praebent; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectant domi, non impediunt Foris: pernoctunt nobis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, perigrinantur, rusticantur.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Caeterarum rerum Studia, &amp; Doctrinâ &amp; Praeceptis, &amp; Arte constare, Poetam Naturâ ipsà valere, mentis Viribus excitari, &amp; quasi Divinoquodam Spiritu asflari.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis an Error as groundless as Vulgar, to think that there goes no more to the furnishing a Poet, than a Wind-mill in the Head, a Stream of Tattle, and convenient Confidence; whereas no Exercise of the Soul requires a more compos'd Thought, more sparingness of Words, more Modesty and Caution in the Undertaker. To make an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complisht Poet, Nature, in the first place must do her best; she must give him the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Soul in Perfection, a Copious Invention, a Comprehensive Memory, a Nimble Wit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to this Store-house for Materials on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, a Strict Discerning Judgment to censure this Choice, to give it just Expression, and in short, to square and finish what was wrought off in the Heat of Fancy. Nor is even this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to constitute a Poet. Nature will not do his Business, he must have the Addition of Arts and Learning, be familiar with the Sciences, acquainted with the Intrigues of Courts, the
<pb facs="tcp:92991:3"/>
Customs and Constitutions of Nations, vers'd in their Languages, and read in the Histories of all Ages. His Knowledge must reach to the Policies of State, and descend even to Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanism; have insight into the meanest Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Trades, because 'tis uncertain whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Subject will lead him; and he is to speak properly on all Occasions: nor are these Accomplishments above Humane Capacity, for they are every where conspicuous in the <hi>Iliad</hi> and the <hi>AEneid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am apt to think, that Expression of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved <hi>Horace,</hi> the <hi>Potestas quidlibet Audendi,</hi> which he allows to Poets and Painters, was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Proverb of his time than a Notion of his own; for he immediately lays this restraint upon't,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Sed non ut placidis coeant immitia, non ut</l>
               <l>Serpentes Avibus geminentur, Tigribus Agni.</l>
            </q>
            <p>There are some Beauties common to Poems of all sorts, and there are besides select Graces peculiar to every Species of Poesie; and these so distinct among themselves, that 'tis a question whether there ever was an Universal Poet. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny believe there can be no such, the various Temperament and Passion of the Poems (which must be as different in the mind of the Writer) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>inconsistent. Virgil</hi> may be urg'd on this Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there being nothing softer than his <hi>Ecclogues,</hi> his <hi>Tytirus,</hi> his <hi>Alexis,</hi> his <hi>Gallus;</hi> nothing loftier than his <hi>AEneid:</hi> yet even in these Pastorals you
<pb facs="tcp:92991:4"/>
will find the Heroick turn of his Verse, and the Air of a Muse, too Majestick to be diguis'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Nymphs of the Plain.</p>
            <q>
               <l>— Illa Pharetram</l>
               <l>Fert humero, gradiensque Deas Supereminet Omnes.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The greatest Labour of the Muses is by some thought a Task of Ease, whereas there is no Poem of the lowest Degree, that is perfect in kind, but must have such a Symetry in the whole, and so many Proprieties beside, which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor must have regard to; the <hi>Lucidus, Ordo, Series &amp; Junctura,</hi> and the <hi>Felix Operis Summa,</hi> exacted by <hi>Horace,</hi> that the Undertaker will find even a good <hi>Eligy</hi> or <hi>Epigram,</hi> a Work of weight. What more difficult than to steer amongst such Shelves, where the avoiding an Error is a ready way to commit one.</p>
            <l>In vitium ducit Culpae fuga.</l>
            <p>This great Poet and Critique will have even the <hi>Debentia dici,</hi> sometimes omitted, to secure the justness of the Poem; and yet he will tell ye that</p>
            <l>Non satis est Pulchra esse Poemata, dulcia sunto.</l>
            <p>Where by <hi>Pulchra</hi> I suppose he means Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, and by <hi>Dulcia,</hi> Diverting and Aery. As in good Painting, where the Colours must be neither Dead nor Gawdy.</p>
            <p>For distinction of Characters he has given us Rule and Examples in the same Verses, and drawn in little, what can never be more fully exprest in large.</p>
            <q>
               <pb facs="tcp:92991:4"/>
               <l>Intererit Multum, Davusne loquatur, an Eros</l>
               <l>Maturusne senex, an adhuc florente juventa</l>
               <l>Fervidus, an Matrona potens, an sedula Nutrix.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Where every single Epithite distinguishes the Person and makes it a Character.</p>
            <p>You have sometimes ask'd my Opinion to what sort of Poetry I would give the Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence? And will possibly expect some account at this time. I suppose the Question can be only betwixt the <hi>Epic</hi> and <hi>Tragedy.</hi> The end that is pursu'd by both, I conceive to be the same (for the later Designs the Instruction even of Princes, as well as the former; (and no Monarch was ever too great to be represented on the Stage) but I will not take upon me to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine which is most effectual for that end. If you will have my imperfect thoughts, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive 'em too nearly related to make different <hi>Species;</hi> and find our learned <hi>Laureat</hi> content to have one of his <note n="*" place="margin">Praef. <hi>to the</hi> Conqu. <hi>of</hi> Granada.</note> Sprightliest <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies,</hi> call'd an <hi>Epic Poem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot forget the strong desire I have heard you express to see the Common Places of our <hi>Shakespear,</hi> compar'd with the most famous of the Ancients. This indeed were a Task worthy the greatest Critique. Our Learned <hi>Hales</hi> was wont to assert, That since the time of <hi>Orpheus</hi> and the Oldest Poets, no Common Place has been touch'd upon, where our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has not perform'd as well. Our <hi>Laureat</hi> has
<pb facs="tcp:92991:5"/>
thrown in his Testimony, and declar'd, <note n="*" place="margin">Essay <hi>on</hi> Dram. Poe.</note> That <hi>Shakespear</hi> was a Man that of all Men had the largest and most comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Soul.</p>
            <p>What I have already asserted concerning the necessity of Learning to make a compleat Poet, may seem inconsistent with my Reverence for our <hi>Shakespear.</hi>
            </p>
            <l>— Cujus amor semper mihi crescit in Horas.</l>
            <p>I confess I cou'd never yet get a true account of his Learning, and am apt to think it more than Common Report allows him. I am sure he never touches on a Roman Story, but the Persons, the Passages, the Manners, the Circumstances, the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, all are Roman. And what Relishes yet of a more exact Knowledge, you do not only see a Roman in his Heroe, but the particular Genius of the Man, without the least mistake of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, given him by their best Historians. You find his <hi>Anthony</hi> in all the Defects and Excellencies of his Mind, a Souldier, a Reveller, Amorous, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Rash, sometimes Considerate, with all theva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Emotions of his Mind. His <hi>Brutus</hi> agen has all the Constancy, Gravity, Morality, Generosity, Imaginable, without the least Mixture of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Interest or Irregular Passion. He is true to him, even in the imitation of his Oratory, the famous Speech which he makes him deliver, being exactly agreeable to his manner of expressing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; of which we have this account, <hi>Facultas ejus
<pb facs="tcp:92991:5"/>
erat Militaris &amp; Bellicis accommodata Tumultubus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however it far'd with our Author for Book-Learning, 'tis evident that no man was better studied in Men and Things, the most useful Knowledge for a <hi>Dramatic</hi> Writer. He was a most diligent Spie upon Nature, trac'd her through her darkest Recesses, pictur'd her in her just Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Colours; in which Variety 'tis impossible that all shou'd be equally pleasant, 'tis sufficient that all be proper.</p>
            <p>Of his absolute Command of the Passions, and Mastery in distinguishing of Characters, you have a perfect Account in that most excellent Criticism before, <hi>Troylus</hi> and <hi>Cressida:</hi> If any Man be a lover of <hi>Shakespear</hi> and covet his Picture, there you have him drawn to the Life; but for the Eternal Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Wit on the same Theam, I will only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you with a few instances of his Reflections on the Person, and Cruel Practices of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third. First of all <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth bespeaks him in these words:</p>
            <q>
               <l>The Owl shriekt at thy Birth, an evil sign,</l>
               <l>Dogs howl'd and hideous Tempests shook down Trees,</l>
               <l>The Raven rookt her on the Chymneys Topp,</l>
               <l>And chatt'ring Pies in dismal Discords sung;</l>
               <l>Thy Mother felt more than a Mothers Pain,</l>
               <l>And yet brought forth less than a Mothers hope;</l>
               <l>An indigested Lump, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard</hi> afterwards makes as bold with himself, where this is part of his Soliloque.</p>

               <l>And that so lamely and unfashionable,</l>

               <l>I that in this weak piping time of Peace,</l>

            <head>PROLOGUE WRITTEN BY Mr. DRYDEN.</head>
            <l>IF yet there be a few that take delight</l>
            <l>In that which reasonable Men should write;</l>
            <l>To them Alone we Dedicate this Night.</l>
            <l>The Rest may satisfie their curious. Itch</l>
            <l>With City Gazets or some Factious Speech,</l>
            <l>Or what-ere Libel for the Publick Good,</l>
            <l>Stirs up the Shrove-tide Crew to Fire and Blood!</l>
            <l>Remove your Benches you apostate Pit,</l>
            <l>And take Above, twelve penny-worth of Wit;</l>
            <l>Go back to your dear Dancing on the Rope,</l>
            <l>Or see what's worse the Devil and the Pope!</l>
            <l>The Plays that take on our Corrupted Stage,</l>
            <l>Methinks resemble the distracted Age;</l>
            <l>Noise, Madness, all unreasonable Things,</l>
            <l>That strike at Sense as Rebels do at Kings!</l>
            <l>The stile of Forty One our Poets write,</l>
            <l>And you are grown to judge like Forty Eight.</l>
            <l>Such Censures our mistaking Audience make,</l>
            <l>That 'tis almost grown Scandalous to Take!</l>
            <l>They talk of Feavours that infect the Brains,</l>
            <l>But Non-sence is the new Disease that reigns.</l>
            <l>Weak Stomacks with a long Disease opprest,</l>
            <l>Cannot the Cordials of strong Wit digest:</l>
            <l>Therfore thin Nourishment of Farce ye choose,</l>
            <l>Decoctions of a Barly-water Muse:</l>
            <l>A Meal of Tragedy wou'd make ye Sick,</l>
            <l>Unless it were a very tender Chick.</l>
            <l>Some Scenes in Sippets wou'd be worth our time,</l>
            <l>Those wou'd go down; some Love that's poach'd in Rime;</l>
            <l>If these shou'd fail —</l>
            <l>We must lie down, and after all our cost,</l>
            <l>Keep Holy-day, like Water-men in Frost,</l>
            <l>Whil'st you turn Players on the Worlds great Stage,</l>
            <l>And Act your selves the Farce of your own Age.</l>
