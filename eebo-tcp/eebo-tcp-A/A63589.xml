            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

at the Seſſions begun <date>the 13th of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
1676,</date> at the Oly Bayly.</head>
            <p>THe firſt perſon tried, was for making a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
her Baſtard-childe; but upon
hearing the Evidence, and examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
both of the Midwife and Coroner,
it appeared to be onely a Miſcarriage;
and by ſeveral circumſtances there was reaſon to
judge that ſhe had not gone above ſixteen weeks,
and had never been quick, the abortive Infant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not above eight inches long, and no ſymptoms
of Wounds or Bruiſes being to be ſeen on the body
to argue any violence uſed to it, the Jury thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thought fit to bring her in not guilty.</p>
            <p>A young man was arraigned for Murther, killing
an old man in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park: Two fellows being
running together in the evening the poor ancient
man unlukily happen'd to be in their way, and one
of them tumbled him down and bruiſed him, of
which bruiſe the next day he died; but the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
teſtifying that it was done meerly by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
without any grudge or quarrel precedent, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38178:3"/>
that the Priſoner as food as he perceived he had
done an injury, went immediately and call'd a Chair
to carry him home, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There was no reaſon for
finding the Indictment, ſo that he was diſcharged.</p>
            <p>A Servant maid was found guilty of ſtealing a
ſilver Tankard of the value of Five pounds: She
living at a publick houſe in the <hi>Old Jury,</hi> took an
opportunity to take it away; and having knock'd
off the Lid, brought it to a Goldſmith to ſell, who
perceiving the Cover lately broke off, would not
buy it, unleſs ſhe would ſhew it him; which after
much importunity ſhe did, and upon that was engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the name of the Owner, whoſe wife ſhe then
pretended to be, and had the Goldſmith to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
houſe, who ſeemed to ſay as much: but
at laſt being trapp'd in their words by him, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
the Felony to him, and afterwards on her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
before the Juſtice, and acknowledg'd in
effect as much now at the bar, onely ſaid that the
Tankard was delivered her to ſell by a fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;
but there being neither proof nor probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of any ſuch things, ſhe was convicted.</p>
            <p>A woman was indicted for burning her Maſter's
Barns at <hi>Harrow on the Hill,</hi> in which a conſiderable
parcel of Wheat and other Corn was conſumed on
<hi>Michaelmas</hi> day laſt. Her Maſter and his wife gave
evidence, but nothing of their own knowledge,
onely that ſhe had confeſs'd the Fact, that in their
abſence in the evening ſhe took a Fire-brand, and
carrying it out of the houſe put it in at a hole in the
Barn amongſt a Mow of unthraſh'd Oats, whereby
that Barn, and another adjoyning were burn'd down,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38178:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the Dwelling houſe with much difficulty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.
And this likewiſe appeared on reading her
Examination; for which miſchievous act ſhe could
alleadge no other provocation but that her Maſter
would not lend her money to go to a Wedding.
However the Juſtice that committed her, aſſuring
the Court from his perſonal knowledge, that the
Priſoners Father was a very m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd
man, and that ſhe her ſelf had a defect in her
underſtanding, and many times at leaſt not the uſe
of common Reaſon or Senſe, and the Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
her in effect acknowledging as much, which
was confirmed by her preſent ſtupid carriage at the
B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r. The Jury looking upon her as <hi>Non Compos
Mentis</hi> at the time of the Fact committed, could
not finde her guilty in the eye of the Law, of the
Crime for which ſhe ſtood indicted.</p>
            <p>Two Legerdemain Ladies of profound experience
in the myſteries of Shop lifting; one of them having
been whipt at the Carts tail but the very laſt Seſſions,
were convicted for ſtealing two pieces of Callicoe,
under pretence of buying <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kerum. The Goods
were taken before they got out of ſight in one of their
aprons, who alleadged a very civil excuſe, aſſuring
the Court that ſhe was drunk with Brandy, and
knew not what ſhe did; but that Plea was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rul'd,
and both of them found guilty.</p>
            <p>A French Gentleman, came in voluntarily
to take a tryal for killing a Marſhal's man's fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower,
in <hi>April</hi> laſt was two years, at the end of St.
<hi>Martins-lane.</hi> The Marſhals man himſelf was gone
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38178:4"/>
another way, and the party kill'd, and three or four
more ſeiz'd the Priſoner (as they ſubpoſe it was) but
without having any Warrant at that inſtant with
them; and beſides, the Warrant their Maſter had
was wrong in the Chriſtian name. Upon their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the party, divers of his Companions drew their
Swords, and one of the Bayliffs loſt his life in the
fray; but the Evidence could not ſay who kill'd
him, nor poſitively that the Priſoner at Bar was the
perſon they had arreſted: ſo that he was acquitted
both of Murther and Manſlaughter.</p>
            <p>The next was a tedious tryal of a young fellow
for breaking open the houſe of a worthy Gentleman
his late Maſter, and ſtealing thence a Spaniſh Gun,
and other Goods, to the value of Fourty pound.
There appeared ſeveral violent preſumptions of
Guilt, and a perſon where the Gun was found had
ſworn directly before the Juſtice, that the Priſoner
was the man that ſold it; and another, that he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
believ'd him to be the man; but now neither of
them would ſay further, than that he was ſomewhat
like him. The Priſoner had a great number to ſpeak
in his behalf, but few couln ſay any thing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
and the Court declared themſelves ſenſible
of much practice us'd on the Priſoner's behalf, to
conceal the truth, yet on a full hearing, for want of
direct Evidence, the Jury brought him in not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>A Flemming born in the City of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
on the Statute for exerciſing the Trade of a
Gold-beater here, not having ſerved ſeven years an
Apprentice; but it being prov'd by ſeveral witneſſes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38178:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that he ſerv'd the ſaid term to his Father of the ſame
Trade in the ſaid City of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and that he was
an excellent Artiſt. The Court conſidering the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the ſaid Statute, which is onely to prevent
unskilful and inſufficient Workmen; and that the
Art it ſelf prohibi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s onely <hi>Thoſe that have been Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices,
or not ſerv'd as Apprentices:</hi> And though
he were not Apprentice in <hi>England,</hi> yet he had ſerv'd
<hi>as an Apprentice</hi> abroad; which they concluded to
be within the intent of the Statute: For otherwiſe
it would be too great a diſcouragement to Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to inſtruct us in the uſual Inventions; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Jury found him not guilty.</p>
            <p>An old Offender was convicted for ſtealing a bay
Gelding of Six pound price, a quarter of grownd
Mault and two Sacks: the Horſe was taken out of
the ſtable on the 28th of <hi>Nov.</hi> and the two ſacks of
Mault with it. The very next day the Owner co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to <hi>London</hi> met the Priſoner driving his Horſe
along <hi>St. Gileſes</hi>'s, with one of the Sacks empty on
his arm, and there ſeiz'd him, who now pretended
that the Sack was given him by two ſtrangers, he
knew not who, for his pains to drive the Horſe along
Tyburn road, but he knew not whether; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſeeming onely a forged excuſe, without any
proof to confirm it, he was found guilty, it being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert'd
in Court that he had three times already been
burnt in the hand and convicted.</p>
            <p>Two perſons, one by his own Confeſſion, and the other by
Verdidict, were Convicted for ſtealing a ſilver Tankard in the
<hi>Woolſtaple Weſtminſter,</hi> from a publique houſe, whence at once
they ſtole away themſelves, the Plate and the Reckoning, but
were diſcovered by a Female Crony, upon a diſguſt, that
ſhe was not allowed Snips in the prize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:38178:5"/>
A Woman as principal, and a Man as acceſſary, were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viicted
for ſtealing Plate, and other rich goods, to the value of
200 pound from a Frenchman at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> whoſe ſervant
the woman being, to<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y of his abſence, and
ranſackt ſeveral of his Rooms, and ſtole the ſaid goods, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which the ſaid other priſoner took her a Lodging, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of a Watch, and ſome of the Plate; for which both
were found Guilty.</p>
            <p>A Lighterman and his wife were Arraigned, for ſtealing of
about 40 pieces of Serge, out of a Lighter on the Thomes;
The Proſecuter produced ſeveral witneſſes, and one very
roundly ſwore, that ſhe ſaw two of the pieces of Serge in
the Priſoners houſe in the Cradle, and that his wife ſeemed
much afraid of a ſearch; and threatned to fling them into
the houſe or office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But upon a full examination, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
that there had been ſeveral ſuits and brangles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the parties, that the Priſoner was ſick at the time of
the Robbery, that it was two years ago, and no proſecution
all this while, that the husband priſoner was a perſon of good
Fame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They were both acquitted by the Jury.</p>
            <p>There was great exbectation of the Tryal of one <hi>Lodowick
Muggleton,</hi> for ſpreading deteſtable opinions, and publiſhing
ſeveral impious Books; But the ſame was put off, till witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
might be ready for a full diſcovery of his Villanies, and
therefore the reader is to take notice, that any Pamphlets
publiſhed concerning his Tryal, are faigned ſtories.</p>
            <p>There were t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
