         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Will not entertain
you with a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
the ſum of
all I have to ſay to
you, being but to
give you Thanks,
very hearty Thanks;
and I aſſure you I
finde it a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
work to ſatisfie My Self in My Own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions
of thoſe Thanks; Perfunctory thanks,
Ordinary thanks for Ordinary civilities are eaſily
given; but when the Heart is as full as Mine
is, it is a labor to thank you: Bou have taken
great pains to obliege Me, and therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be eaſie for me to expreſs the ſence I have of it.</p>
            <p>I will enlarge no further to you upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
then to tell you, That when God brought
Me hither, I brought with me an Extraordinary
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119853:3"/>
Affection and Eſteem for Parliaments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I need
not tell you how much it is improved by your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
towards me. You have out-done all the
good and oblieging Acts of your Predeceſſors to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Crown; and therefore you cannot but
believe My Heart is exceedingly enlarged with
the acknowledgment.</p>
            <p>Many former Parliaments have had particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
denominations from what they have done;
They have been ſtiled, <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Unlearned,</hi>
and ſometimes have had worſe Epithites; I pray
let us all Reſolve that this be for ever called,
<hi>The Healing and the Bleſſed Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I thank you, though not enough, for what
you have done, ſo I have not the least doubt,
by the bleſsing of God, but when I ſhall call the
next Parliament, which I ſhall do as ſoon as
reaſonably you can expect or deſire, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
your Thanks for what I have done ſince I
parted with you: For I deal truly with you, I
ſhall not more propoſe any one Rule to My Self
in My Actions, and My Councels, then this,
<hi>What is a Parliament like to think of this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or this Councel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

in Me, if it will not bear that
Teſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with this, which I cannot

               </gap> to the miraculous bleſsing of God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119853:3"/>
Almighty; and indeed, as an immediate effect of
that Bleſsing, I do impute the good Diſpoſition
and Security we are all in, to the happy Act of
Indempnity and Oblivion; that is the principal
Corner-ſtone which ſupports this excellent Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that creates Kindneſs in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s to each other;
and Confidence is Our Joynt and Common Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
You may be ſure, I will not onely obſerve
it Religiouſly, and inviolably My Self, but alſo
exact the obſervation of it from others: And if
any perſon ſhould ever have the boldneſs to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to perſwade Me to the contrary, he will
finde ſuch an Acceptation from Me, as he would
have, who ſhould perſwade Me to burn <hi>Magna

a new Government after My Own invention
and appetite.</p>
            <p>There are many other particulars which I

            <p>THere cannot be a greater manifeſtation
of an excellent Temper and Harmony
of Affections throughout the Nation, then
that the King and his two Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
meet with the ſame Affections and
Cheerfulneſs, the ſame Alacrity in their
Countenance at the Diſſolution, as when they
met at the Convention of Parliament: It is
an unqueſtionable evidence, that they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
ſatisfied in what they have done to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
each other, that they have very well
done all the buſineſs they came about: This
is now your caſe, you have ſo well ſatisfied
your own Conſciences, that you are ſure you
have ſatisfied the King's expectation and His
Hope, and the deſires and wiſhes of the
Country. It was very juſtly obſerved by you
Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> that you have never asked any
one thing of the King, which he hath not
with all imaginable cheerfulneſs granted; and
in truth His Majeſty doth with great comfort
acknowledge, that you have been ſo far from
denying Him any thing He hath asked, that
He hath ſcarce wiſhed any thing that you
have not granted; And it is no wonder, that
having ſo fully complyed with your obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and having ſo well compoſed the minds
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119853:4"/>
of the Nation, you are now willing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
from this extraordinary Fatigue you
have ſubmitted ſo long to, and to return to
the conſideration of your own particular Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
which you have ſo long ſacrificed to the
Publique<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this reaſonable wiſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
hath brought the King to comply with
you, and, which nothing elſe could do, to part
with you with an equal cheerfulneſs; and he
makes no doubt, but all ſucceeding Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
will pay you their Thanks for all you
have done, and look upon your Actions and
your example with all poſsible Approbation
and Reverence.</p>
            <p>The King and you have given ſuch earneſt
to each other of your mutual Affection, you
have been ſo exact and punctual in your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
towards each other, that you have
made no promiſe, no profeſsion to each other,
of the making good and performing of which
the world is not witneſs: You declared at the
Adjournment in <hi>September</hi> laſt, your Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſettle a noble Revenew on the Crown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
you have done it with all the Circumſtances of
Affection and Prudence. The King promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
you to eſtabliſh a Council for Trade, a
Council for the Forreign Plantations, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
for compoſing all difference upon
Sales; all this he did before your coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and with very good effect; and you
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119853:5"/>
ſhall hear that the Proceedings in every one of
them are more vigorous and effectual after
your Diſſolution; His Majeſty then promiſed
you, that he would give up all his endeavors
to compoſe the unhappy differences in matters
of Religion, and to reſtore the languiſhing
Church to peace, Unity and Order: <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
himſelf hardly ſpent ſo much of his own
time in private and publique Conferences to
that purpoſe; His Majeſty in private confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the Learned Men, and heard all that
could be ſaid upon ſeveral Opinions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
apart, and then in the preſence of both
Parties, himſelf moderating in the debates,
(and leſs care and diligence and authority
would not have done the work) and God hath
ſo bleſſed His Labor, and made His Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
in that Affair ſo generally agreeable,
that he hath received thanks from His Houſes
of Parliament, that is, from the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
If after all this, His Majeſty doth not
reap the full Harveſt he expected from thoſe
Condeſcentions; If ſome men, by their
writing, and by their preachings endeavor to
continue thoſe Breaches, and very raſhly and I
think unconſcientiouſly keep up the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and publickly juſtifie and maintain
what hath heretofore been done amiſs, and
for which the Act of Indempnity was the beſt
defence; I ſhall ſay no more, then that I hope
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119853:5"/>
their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> want of Modeſty and Obedience will
cauſe them to be diſclaimed by all pious and
peaceable men, who cannot but be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to ſee them reduced by Law, to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
they owe to Law: And His Majeſty
is confident, that this His beloved City, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
which His heart is ſo gracious, and ſo
full of Princely Deſigns to improve their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
their Wealth, and their Beauty, will
diſcountenance all thoſe ſeditious deſigns, and
by returning and fixing themſelves upon their
good old Foundations, make themſelves
the great example of Piety, of Loyalty,
and of hearty Affection to the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe puts me in mind to ſay to
you, that though the King wonders much
more at the many great things you have done,
then that you have left any thing undone, yet
he could have wiſhed, and would have been
glad that your other weighty Affairs had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you time to have publiſhed your opinion
and advice in the buſineſs of the Militia, that
the People after ſo many diſputes upon that
Argument, might have diſcerned that the
King, and His two Houſes of Parliament are
as much of the ſame mind in that, as in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, as no doubt they are: But ſince
that could not be done, you may all aſſure
your ſelves, That the King will proceed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119853:6"/>
in with all imaginable care and circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for the eaſe, and quiet, and ſecurity of His
People: And as He did before the laſt Receſs
by the unanimous advice of His Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
iſſue out His Commiſsions of Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
for the ſetling the Militia in the ſeveral
Counties, to prevent any diſorders which
many apprehended might ariſe upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding
the Army; ſo He will now again
recommend it to them to keep themſelves in
ſuch a Poſture, as may diſappoint any ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
deſigns which are now on foot; and
there cannot be too much circumſpection and
vigilance to fruſtrate thoſe deſigns. You
have heard of many ſuſpected and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
perſons which have been lately clapped
up; and it was high time to look about: His
Majeſty hath ſpent many hours Himſelf in
the examination of this buſineſs; and ſome of
the Principal Officers, who before they came
to His Majeſtie's Preſence, could not be
brought to acknowledge any thing, after the
King Himſelf had ſpoken to them, confeſſed,
That their ſpirits were inſenſibly prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſubdued, and that it was not in their
power to conceal their guilt from Him.
They have confeſſed, That there is a party
of the late Disbanded-Officers and Soldiers,
and others, full of diſcontent and ſeditious
purpoſes, and a reſolution to attempt the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119853:6"/>
change of the preſent Government, and to
erect the Republick; they acknowledge that
they did purpoſe to have made their attempt
for the reſcue of thoſe Wretches, who were
ſo juſtly condemned at <hi>Newgate,</hi> and ſo
worthily executed; and that <hi>Ludlow</hi> ſhould
then have appeared in the head of them;
that they made themſelves ſure at the ſame
time, by Parties and Confederacy to have
ſurprized the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and the
Caſtle of <hi>Windſor,</hi> but that they found, or
at leaſt apprehended, that their deſign was
diſcovered; which ſo broke their ſpirits, that
they concluded they muſt acquieſce for the
preſent, and ſtay till the Army ſhould be
disbanded, which they ſaid was generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched,
that is, Returned to an honeſt and
faſt obedience to the King; and that it was
evident they were betrayed by thoſe who
were moſt entirely truſted by them; and
they were in the right: The King had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of all their deſign, what progreſs it made,
and the night they intended to ſurprize the
Tower and <hi>Windſor,</hi> and gave notice to the
ſeveral Governors; and ſo without any noiſe,
that miſchief was by God's goodneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented:
They acknowledge that they have
ſince recovered their Courage and Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and were about this time to make their
full attempt; they have been promiſed ſome
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119853:7"/>
conſiderable Riſing in the Weſt under <hi>Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi>
and in the North under others; but
this place was the Scene of greateſt hope;
they made ſure of a Body here, I think they
ſay of Two thouſand five hundred men, with
which they reſolved in the firſt place, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
(you know what that ſecurity is) the
Perſon of the General, the Duke of <hi>Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marle,</hi>
with whom they have ſo much reaſon
to be angry, and at the ſame time to poſſeſs
themſelves of <hi>Whitehal;</hi> You know the
method uſed in ſuch poſſeſsing, <hi>Kill, and take
Poſſeſsion;</hi> and this inſupportable Calamity
God hath again deverted from Us; though
I muſt tell you, the poor men who ſeem to
ſpeak honeſtly, and upon the impulſion of
Conſcience, are very far from being confident,
that there will not be ſome deſperate Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
and Attempts in ſeveral parts of the
Kingdom within a ſhort time, which all
poſsible care will be taken to prevent; and
in truth this very good City ſo well requites
the Kings abundant Grace and Kindneſs to it,
That not onely by the unwearied Pains and
Diligence of the worthy Lord Major, but
by the general temper and conſtitution of the
whole City, the diſcontented and ſeditious
Party (which can never be totally extirpated
out of ſuch a <hi>Metropolis</hi>) is like to receive lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
encouragement to purſue their deſperate
Counſels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:119853:7"/>
The King doth not believe that all thoſe
perſons who at preſent are apprehended,
and in cuſtody, will be found guilty of this
Treaſon; It is a vulgar and known Artifice,
to corrupt inferior perſons, by perſwading
them, That better men are ingaged in the
ſame enterpriſe; and the King will make
as much haſte as He can to ſet thoſe at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
againſt whom the evidence or ſuſpicion
is not too reaſonable; in the mean time,
they who are in truth innocent, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
that the proceeding towards them, hath
been very natural and full of Clemency; and
no man will wonder, if His Majeſty be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
deſirous that in this conjuncture, and in
order to prevent, or ſuppreſs theſe too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
diſtempers and Machinations, His Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia
in all places be in good order and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration:
And you may aſſure your ſelves,
That in the forming and conduct of it, He
will have ſo great a care of the eaſe and
quiet of His People, that if any perſon
truſted by him, ſhall through want of skill,
or want of temper, ſatisfie his own paſsion
or appetite, in grieving or vexing his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
His Majeſty will be ſo ſenſible of it,
that if it can be cured no other way, His
Truſt ſhall be quickly determined, and He
is not at all reſerved in giving thoſe Anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adverſions
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119853:8"/>
and Reprehenſions when there is
occaſion; and His ears will be always open
to receive thoſe complaints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> You are now
returning to your Countreys to receive the
thanks and acknowledgements of your
Friends and Neighbours, for the great
things you have done, and to make the
burthens you have laid upon them, eaſie, by
convincing them of the inevitable neceſsity
of their ſubmitting to them; You will make
them ſee that you have proceeded very far
towards the ſeparation, and even divorce of
that Neceſsity from them, to which they
have been ſo long married, that they are
now reſtored to that bleſſed temper of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
under which their Anceſtors en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
ſo many hundred years, that full
meaſure of felicity, and the miſery of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deprived of which they have ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
felt, that they are now free from thoſe
midnight Alarms, with which they have
been terrified, and riſe out of their beds at
their own healthy hours, without being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
with the death of a Husband, a Son,
and Friend, miſerably killed the night or the
day before, and with ſuch circumſtances
kill'd, as improved the miſery beyond the
loſs it ſelf; this enfranchiſement is worth all
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119853:8"/>
they pay for it: Your Lordſhips will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recover that eſtimation and reverence
that is due to your high Condition, by the
exerciſe and practice of that vertue, from
whence your Honors firſt ſprang; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of your Juſtice and Piety will enflame
the hearts of the People towards you; and
from your practice, they will make a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the King himſelf: They know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well, that you are not only admitted to
his Preſence, but to his Converſation, and
even in a degree to his Friendſhip, for you
are his great Councill; by your Example
they will form their own Manners, and by
yours they will make ſome gueſs at the
King's: Therefore under that obligation,
you will cauſe your Piety, your Juſtice,
your Affability, and your Charity to
ſhine as bright as is poſsible before them.
They are too much in love with <hi>England,</hi>
too partial to it, who believe it the beſt
Countrey in the world; there is better
earth, and a better aire, and a better, that
is, a warmer Sun in other Countries; but
we are no more then juſt, when we ſay that
<hi>England</hi> is an endoſure of the beſt People in
the world, when they are well Informed
and Inſtructed; a People in ſobriety of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
the moſt devoted to God Almighty;

to the Nobility; no Nobility in <hi>Europe</hi>
ſo entirely loved by the People; there may
be more awe, and fear, and terror of them,
but no ſuch love towards them as in <hi>England.</hi>
I beſeech your Lordſhips, do not undervalue
this love; they have looked upon your
Lordſhips, and they will look upon your
Lordſhips again, as the greateſt examples
and patterns of Duty to the King, as their
greateſt Security and Protection from inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and injuſtice, and for their enjoying what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
is due to them by the Law, and as
the moſt proper Mediators and Interpoſers
to the King, if by any failer of Juſtice they
ſhould be expoſed to any oppreſsion and
violence: And this exerciſe of your Juſtice
and Kindneſs towards them, will make
them the more abhor and abominate that
parity upon which a Commonwealth muſt
be founded, becauſe it would extirpate, or
ſuppreſs, or deprive them of their beloved
Nobility, which are ſuch a ſupport and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
to their full happineſs.</p>
            <p>And you Gentlemen of the Houſe of
Commons, you are now returning to your
Countrey, laden with a Truſt not inferior,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119853:10"/>
weighty, than that you brought from thence,
you came up their Deputies to the King, and
he returns you now his Deputies to them, his
Plenipotentiaries, to inform &amp; aſſure them, that
he thinks himſelf the happieſt, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Prince of the World, not from the Scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of His Dominions and the Power of his
great Navy, with which he can viſit his
Neighbors, and keep them from viſiting him,
or from the noble Revenue you have ſetled
upon him, which he will improve with all
good Husbandry, but from being poſſeſſed of
the Affections and Hearts of ſuch Subjects;
that he doth ſo intirely love them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon them, that all his Actions and all
his Councels, ſhall tend to no other end, but
to make them happy and proſperous: that
he thinks his Honour and his Intereſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
to conſiſt in providing for, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
the Honor and Intereſt of the Nation:
That you may have the more credit in what
you ſay, He will not take it unkindly, if you
publiſh his defects and Infirmities: You may
tell them, that He is ſo confident in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of His very good and faithful Subjects,
that he is very hard to be perſwaded that His
few ill and unfaithful Subjects can do Him
much harm; that He ſo much depends upon
the affection of honeſt men, and their Zeal
for His ſecurity, that He is not ſo ſollicitous
and vigilant for His own ſafety as he ought to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119853:11"/>
be, amidſt ſo many Combinations, of which
he is ſo well informed, that His Servants,
who with grief and anguiſh importune Him
not to take ſo little care of his own ſafety, can
obtain no other anſwer from Him, then what
<hi>Caeſar</hi> heretofore gave to his jealous Friends,
<hi>Mori ſe malle quam timeri,</hi> or <hi>timere;</hi> He will
die any death, rather then live in fear of His
own Subjects, or that they ſhould live in fear
of him; You may tell them as a great Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
that a troubled and diſcontented Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
ſo afflicts him, that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
it from them at his own charge, as if
he himſelf were in the fault; and when he
hath been informed of any leſs kinde, or jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
thing ſaid amongſt you, as your windores
are never ſo cloſe ſhut, but that the ſound of
your words goes to the ſeveral corners of the
Town, His Majeſty hath been heard to ſay
no more, but, <hi>What have I done? I wiſh that
Gentleman and I were acquainted, that he knew
me better.</hi> Oh, Gentlemen, you cannot be
your ſelves, nor you cannot make your
Friends too zealous, or too jealous for ſuch a
Prince's ſafety, or too ſollicitous for ſuch a
Prince's ſatisfaction and content, to whom we
may very juſtly ſay, as the King of <hi>Tyre</hi> writ
to <hi>Solomon, Becauſe God hath loved his people,
he hath made thee King over them:</hi> Even His
defects and infirmities are very neceſſary to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119853:11"/>
the full meaſure of our proſperity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> God hath ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
us to invert one Argument, which, I
hope, may to a good degree repair the much
miſchief it hath heretofore done: It hath
been urged very unreaſonably, yet ſucceſsful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
urged in the worſt times, That it was not
Faith, but Preſumption, to expect that God
would reſtore a Family, with which he ſeemed
to have a controverſie, &amp; had humbled ſo far;
That he would ever countenance a Party, that
he had ſo much diſcountenanced, and almoſt
deſtroyed. We may now much more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
and therefore I hope as effectually, preſs
the Miracles that God Almighty hath lately
wrought for King and People, as an evidence
that he will not again eaſily forſake them:
We may tell thoſe, who are uſing all their
endeavours to imbroil the Nation in new
troubles, That it is not probable, that a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
againſt which God ſeemed theſe late
years to have pronounced his Iudgment, in
the very language of the Prophet;</p>
            <p>Go ye ſwift meſſengers to a Nation ſcattered
and peeled, to a people terrible from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
hitherto, a Nation rooted out
and trodden down, whoſe Land the Rivers
have ſpoiled:—The Lord hath mingeld
a perverſe ſpirit in the middeſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:119853:12"/>
That he ſhould reduce that perverſneſs to the
greateſt meekneſs and reſignation, that he
ſhould withdraw his Judgement from this
Nation, and in a moment reſtore it to all the
happineſs it can wiſh, and to no other end, but
to expoſe it to the mercy and fury of a few
diſcontented perſons, the worſt of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is not eaſie to be believed.</p>
            <p>We may tell thoſe who ſtill contrive the
ruine of the Church, the beſt, and the beſt
Reformed Church in the Chriſtian World;
Reformed by that Authority, and with
thoſe Circumſtances as a Reformation ought
to be made, that God would not ſo mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly
have ſnatched this Church as a
brand out of the fire; would not have
raiſed it from the grave, after he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
it to be buried ſo many years, by the
boyſtrous hands of Prophane and Sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
perſons, under its own rubbidge, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it again to the ſame Rapine, Reproach
and Impiety: That Church which delights
it ſelf in being called Catholick, was never
ſo near expiration, never had ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
that ſo ſmall a pittance of Meal
and Oyl, ſhould be ſufficient to preſerve
and nouriſh the poor Widow and her Family
ſo long, is very little more miraculous then
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119853:12"/>
that ſuch a number of pious, learned, and very
aged Biſhops, ſhould ſo many years be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
in ſuch wonderful ſtraights and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
untill they ſhould plentifully provide for
their own Succeſſion: That after ſuch a deep
Deluge of Sacriledge, Profaneſs and Impiety
had covered, and to common underſtanding
ſwallowed it up; that that Church ſhould again
appear above the waters, God be again ſerved
in that Church, and ſerved as he ought to be,
and that there ſhould be ſtill ſome Revenue left
to ſupport and encourage thoſe who ſerve him;
nay, that many of thoſe who ſeemed to thirſt
after that Revenue till they had poſſeſſed it,
ſhould conſcientiouſly reſtore what they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, and become good ſons, and willing
Tenants to that Church they had ſo lately
ſpoyled, may make us all piouſly believe, that
God Almighty would not have been at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
and charge of ſuch a miracle, ſo manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf to us in ſuch a deliverance, but in
the behalf of a Church very acceptable to him,
and which ſhall continue to the end of the
World, and againſt which the Gates of Hell
ſhall not be able to prevail.</p>
            <p>We may tell thoſe deſperate wretches, who
yet harbour in their thoughts wicked deſigns
againſt the Sacred Perſon of the King, in order
to the compaſſing their own imaginations; that
God Almighty would not have led Him
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119853:13"/>
through ſo many Wilderneſſes of Afflictions
of all kinds, conducted Him through ſo many
perils by Sea, and perils by Land; ſnatch'd
Him out of the midſt of this Kingdom, when
it was not worthy of Him; and when the
hands of His Enemies were even upon Him,
when they thought themſelves ſo ſure of Him,
that they would bid ſo cheap, and ſo vile a price
for Him; He would not in that Article have
ſo covered Him with a Cloud, that He tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
even with ſome pleaſure, and great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
through the midſt of His Enemies;
He would not ſo wonderfully have new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delled
that Army, ſo inſpired their hearts, and
the hearts of the whole Nation, with an honeſt
and impatient longing for the return of their
dear Soveraign, and in the mean time have ſo
exerciſed Him (which had little leſs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
in it than the other) with thoſe unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
or at leaſt unuſual diſreſpects and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
abroad, that He might have a harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and an innocent appetite to His Own
Countrey, and return to His Own People, with
a full value, and the whole unwaſted Bulk of
His Affections, without being corrupted, or
byaſſed by Extraordinary Forraign Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
God Almighty would not have done all
this, but for a Servant whom He will alwayes
preſerve as the apple of His own Eye, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
defend from the moſt ſecret machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of His Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:119853:13"/>
If theſe Argumentations, Gentlemen, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with that vivacity as is moſt natural to
your own gratitude and Affections, recover as
many (and it would be ſtrange if it ſhould not)
as have been corrupted by the other Logick,
the hearts of the whole Nation, even to a man,
will inſenſibly be ſo devoted to the King, as the
only Conſervator and Protector of all that is
dear and precious to them, and will be ſo Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to pleaſe him, whoſe greateſt pleaſure is to
ſee them pleaſed, that when they make choice
of Perſons again to ſerve in Parliament, they
will not chooſe ſuch, who they wiſh ſhould op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the King, but therefore chooſe them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they have, and becauſe they are like to
ſerve the King with their whole hearts; and
ſince he deſires what is beſt for his People, to
gratifie him in all he deſires: This bleſſed har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
would raiſe us to the higheſt Pinacle of
honour and happineſſe in this world, a pinacle
without a point, upon which King and People
may ſecurely reſt and repoſe themſelves againſt

and I am ſure you will all contend to be at the

and therefore, as I am commanded, I muſt humbly
aſſure Your Majeſty, that the many healing expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
propounded by Your Self in your ſeveral moſt
gracious Declarations, have been the ſubject matter
upon which Your Commons have wrought all this
Parliament: And in the firſt place, they took in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Conſideration, the great and growing charges,
which then lay upon your people, for the pay of
Your Army and Navy; and they conceived it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary;
to begin with that part thereof, next at hand,
wherein Your People would receive the moſt eaſe,
and the greateſt ſecurity and ſatisfaction, which was
the disbanding Your Majeſties Forces by Land, and
the paying off five and Twenty of Your Ships then
in the Harbour and of no uſe: And this led them to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119853:15"/>
the Conſideration of ſuch wayes and means, as were
to be uſed to raiſe Moneys for that purpoſe: And
that for Poll-money being propounded and paſſed,
ſome were of opinion, that, that alone would have
over-done the Work: Others having had experience
of a former Bill of the ſame nature, and upon the
like occaſion, fearing it might not anſwer expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and being unwilling to be deceived the ſecond
time, eſpecially in ſuch a buſineſs as this, wherein a
miſtake was like to prove ſo penal, moved for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Supply, which after ſome Debate was agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Of a Two months Aſſeſſment at Seventy thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pounds a month, and both have not yet fully
done the work for which they were deſigned, but
with the help of two other Bills here in my hand;
the one intituled, <hi>An Act for the leavying of the Arrears
of the Twelve months Aſſeſſment, commencing the four and
twentieth of June 1659, ând the Six months Aſſeſſment com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing
the Five and twentieth of December</hi> 1659. And
the other intituled, <hi>An Act for the further Supplying and
Explaining certain Defects in an Act for the ſpeedy Proviſion
of Money for Disbanding and Paying off the Forces of this
Kingdome both by Land and Sea:</hi> They hope, this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
will be fully cleared off at laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> Your Commons have likewiſe taken into their
Conſiderations, the Charge of Your Summer-Fleet,
which beſides that part thereof Your Majeſty is pleaſed
to take upon Your Self, for Your ordinary Guard of
the Seas, will amount unto a very great ſum. And as
'tis a great Debt, ſo it is a growing Debt, in a few
Moneths it doubles. There is a ſaying, <hi>Qui cito dat,
bis dat;</hi> I am ſure 'tis moſt true in this caſe, <hi>Qui cito ſolvit,
bis ſolvit;</hi> To pay this Debt readily, is the way to pay
it but once; and to take time to pay it, is the ſure way
to pay it twice: And therefore Your Commons lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119853:16"/>
aſide the ſad thoughts of their long ſufferings,
and thoſe miſerable Devaſtations and Preſſures they
have lain under for many years laſt paſt; and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the neceſſity of Affairs, which call impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately,
and muſt be anſwered effectually, hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
another Bill here in my hand, intituled, <hi>An Act
for Six Moneths Aſſeſſment, at Seventy Thouſand pounds</hi> per
Menſem, to begin the Firſt of <hi>January,</hi> and to be paid
in, the one Moyety thereof before the Firſt of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi>
and the other Moyety, being the remaining part,
by the Firſt of <hi>April</hi> next enſuing; which is to be
applyed wholly to the paying off the Arrears of Your
Majeſties Navy and Army.</p>
            <p>I have three other Bills in my hand, which have
relation to Your Majeſties Revenue, and are branches
thereof; the One intituled, <hi>An Act for the better Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the ſelling of Wines by Retail, and for preventing abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in the Mingling, Corrupting, and Vitiating of Wines, and
for ſetling and limiting the Prizes of the ſame:</hi> And this
Bill is tendered unto Your Majeſty, for preventing
all future diſputes touching the Legality thereof: For
we know it is Your Majeſties deſire, that nothing
might be done, by any of Your Officers or Miniſters
that Act under You, <hi>Sine figura Juſtitiae, &amp; warranto
Legis.</hi> An other is intituled, <hi>An Act for erecting and
eſtabliſhing a Poſt-Office:</hi> And this being likewiſe Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
ſetled, will be of very great uſe to all Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
People, and eſpecially Your Merchants, for
holding Intelligence with their Correſpondents, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
and Agents in Foreign parts, <hi>Litterae ſunt indices
animi,</hi> and without the ſafe and ſpeedy diſpatch and
conveyance of their Letters, they will never be able
to time their buſineſs, nor carry on their Trades to
an equal advantage with the Merchants of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
The other Bill provides for the increaſing
Your Majeſties ordinary and conſtant Revenue by the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119853:16"/>
grant of an Impoſt to be taken upon <hi>Ale, Beer,</hi> and
other Beveredges therein particularly mentioned and
expreſſed; To hold to your Majeſty for life, which
<hi>God</hi> long continue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as it is the deſire of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
that your Majeſty might never be neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to reſort to any extraordinary or unparlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
wayes and means, for the rayſing of money
upon your People; So they likewiſe acknowledg it
to be their duties, to ſupport and uphold, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
of their Powers, the Honour and Grandure of
your Majeſties Royal State and Dignity.</p>
            <p>And for a further evidence of your Commons duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
affections to your Majeſties moſt dear and Royal
Perſon, they have paſſed another Bill, for the rayſing
of ſeventy thouſand Pounds for your Majeſties fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſupply; All which Bills I am commanded
humbly to preſent your Majeſty withall, and to
pray your gracious acceptance thereof, and your Royal
aſſent thereunto</p>
            <p>There are other Bills likewiſe of Publick concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which have paſſed both Houſes, and do now
attend upon your Majeſty, waiting for your Royal
aſſent. The one is Intituled, <hi>An Act for the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder
of ſeveral Perſons, guilty of the horrid Murther of
his late ſacred Majeſty,</hi> your Royal Father of ever bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Memory. There is another Bill Intituled, <hi>An Act
for Confirmation of Leaſes and Grants from Colledges and
Hoſpitals.</hi> This will tend much to the quieting of
many mens Eſtates, that in the late unhappy times
were enforced to renew, and change their Eſtates
much for the worſe, were it not for the favour your
Majeſty intends them in this Bill.</p>
            <p>There is another Bill to prohibit the Exportation
of Wool, Wooll-fells, Fullers Earth, or any other ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Earths, Woollen Manufactures, beſides the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
they pay your Majeſty for your Cuſtoms
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119853:17"/>
here at home, have great impoſitions laid upon them
in forraign parts where they are vented: In the Low-Countries
ſixteen or ſeventeen <hi>per cent.</hi> and in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi>
Twenty <hi>per cent</hi> at the leaſt. But thoſe, who for
their own private baſe filthy lucre ſake, having no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
or reſpect unto the publick good, that ſteal over
the Materials of which thoſe Manufactures are made,
pay not one penny either here or there, and by that
means ſtrangers do make thoſe Manufactures of our
wool upon ſuch eaſie termes, that they can afford and
do under-ſel your Merchants, which is the occaſion of
a double loſs. Firſt, to your Majeſty in your Cuſtoms,
and in the next Place to your people, who are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
diſheartened and diſcouraged, and in a ſhort time,
if not prevented, will be utterly beaten out of that
Ancient native Staple trade, upon which many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of Families do wholly depend for all their live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
and ſubſiſtence.</p>
            <p>There is another Bill intituled, an Act for prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
the planting, ſetting or ſowing of Tobacco in
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> This Climate is ſo cold that it
never comes to any maturity or perfection: for we
find by experience, though it be never ſo well healed,
made up with the greateſt art and skil that poſſible
can be, yet it is impoſſible, after it is made up into
the Roll, to keep it and preſerve it from putrifying
above three or four moneths at the moſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Phyſitians, even thoſe that love it beſt, and uſe
it moſt, conclude generally, that it is unwholſome
for mens bodies: Beſides many other great damages
and inconveniencies will follow upon it, if it ſhould
be permitted. The abatement of your Majeſties
Cuſtome, The deſtruction of your Plantations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
The diſcouraging of Navigation, And ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the decay of Shipping, which are the Walls
and Bulwarks of your Majeſties Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:119853:17"/>
There is another Bill Intituled, an Act for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away the Court of Wards and Liveries, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with tenures <hi>in Capite,</hi> Knight-<hi>Service,</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures
and Purveyances. This Bill <hi>Ex re nata</hi> may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be called a Bill of Exchange: for, as care is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
taken for the caſe of Your people; So the ſupply of
that part of your Majeſties Revenue, which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
came into your Treaſury by your tenures, and for
your Purveyances, is thereby likewiſe fully provided
for by the grant of another impoſition to be taken
upon Ale, Beer, and other Liquors, To hold to your
Majeſtie, your Heires and Succeſſors for ever: And
yet they ſhould not look upon the conſiderations
mentioned in this bill, as a full compenſation and
recompence for your Majeſties parting with two
ſuch <hi>Royal Prerogatives</hi> and ancient flowers of your
Crown, if more were not implyed then is expreſſed.
For, <hi>Royal Sir,</hi> Your Tenures <hi>in Capite</hi> are not only
turned into a Tenure in Soccage (though that alone
will for ever give your Majeſtie a juſt Right and
title to the labour of our Ploughs, and the ſweat of
our browes) But they are likewiſe turned into a
Tenure <hi>in Corde:</hi> what your Majeſtie had before in
your Court of Wards, you will be ſure to find it
hereafter in the Exchequer of your peoples hearts
The King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Mines will ſooner deceive him,
then this Revenue will fail you: for his Mines have
bottomes, but the deeper your Majeſtie ſinkes your
ſelf into the hearts and affections of your people, the
greater you will find your Wealth to be, and the
more invincible your Strength.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Royal Sir,</hi> We have nothing more to offer or to
Ask, but muſt conclude all our work this Parliament
with an humble and thankful acknowledgement of
Gods infinite Goodneſs and mercie in Reſtoring
your Majeſtie to your Royal and Imperial Crown,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119853:18"/>
Throne and Dignitie; And for making you the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer
of that, which is dearer unto us then our lives,
Our Religion; in which through Gods bleſſing and
Gracious aſſiſtance we are reſolved to live and dye.
As likewiſe for reſtoring us to our <hi>Magna Charta</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
having taken the charge and care of them into
your own heart, which is our greateſt ſecurity, and
more then a thouſand confirmations</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Royal Sir,</hi> You have denied us nothing we have
asked this Parliament; indeed you have out-done
your Parliament by doing much more for us, then we
could agree amongſt our ſelves to ask, and therefore
muſt needs be a happy Parliament: This is a
healing Parliament, A Reconciling Peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Parliament, A bleſſed Parliament, A Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<hi>Propter excellentiam,</hi> that may truly be called
<hi>Parliamentiſſimum Parliamentum:</hi> no man can ſay, that
hath made the moſt curious ſearch into Books or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
that there ever was ſuch a Parliament as this;
And its our unſpeakable joy and comfort that no
man can ſay, ſo long as your Majeſtie lives, but we
may have ſuch another; for you have ſet your Royal
Heart upon it, to do your people good.</p>
            <p>And as we have nothing more to ſay, ſo we have
nothing more to do, but that which will be a doing
as long as we have a being; The pouring out our
ſoules unto Almighty God for your Majeſties Long,
Long, Long, and moſt happy, bleſſed, Glorious and
Proſperous Reign over us.</p>
