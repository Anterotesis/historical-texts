            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE Proteſtant Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the motion was firſt made for the Publiſhing of theſe Papers, it ſeemed to me to be as the <hi>Caſting of water into the Sea;</hi> ſo great is the Number of the Learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Proteſtant Divines againſt the Papiſts (which will never be well anſwered) that the moſt elaborate addition may ſeem ſuperfluous; much more theſe haſty Diſputations prepared but for an exerciſe which is the Recreation of a few Countrey-Miniſters at a monthly meeting, when they eaſe themſelves of their ordinary work. But upon further conſideration, I ſaw it was, <hi>The Caſting of water upon a threatning fire,</hi> which the Sea it ſelf doth but reſtrain. It's more
<pb facs="tcp:61063:3"/>
Engines than a few that are openly or ſecretly at work at this time, to captivate theſe Nations again to the <hi>Romane</hi> Pope. When ſo many hundreds, if not thouſands are night and day contriving our ſeduction, under the name of Reconciling us to the Church; if no body coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwork them, what may they not do. It's not enough that we have had Defenders, and that their Books are yet in the World. Old Writings are laid by, though much ſtronger than any new ones: But new ones are ſooner ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up and read. The Papiſts have of late been very plentifull, and yet very ſparing in their Writings. Plentiful of ſuch as run among the ſimple injudicious people in ſecret, ſo that the Countries ſwarm with them; But ſparing of ſuch as may provoke any Learned man to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation: That ſo, they may in time diſuſe us from thoſe Studies, and ſo diſable the Miniſtry therein, and catch us when we are ſecure through a ſeeming peace, and fall upon us when we have loſt our ſtrength. And I am much afraid that the generality of our people (perhaps of the beſt) are already ſo much diſuſed from theſe ſtudies, as to be much unacquainted with the Nature of Popery, and much more to ſeek for a preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive againſt it, and a through confutation of them. So that if Papiſts were once but as fully ſet out among us in their own likeneſs, as they
<pb facs="tcp:61063:3"/>
are under the names of Quakers and other Sects, what work would you ſee in many places? I doubt many would follow their pernicius wayes, and fall like Sheep of a common rot, or people in a raging peſtilence, eſpecially if they had but the countenance of the times: Not through <hi>their</hi> ſtrength, but becauſe our people are naked, and unmeet for a defence.</p>
            <p>The work that now they are upon, is, <hi>1.</hi> By Diviſions, and Reviling the Miniſters, to looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the people from their Guides; that they may be as a Maſterleſs Dog that will follow any body that will whiſtle him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To take down the Miniſters maintenance and encouragements, that they may be diſabled ſo vigorouſly to reſiſt them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To hinder their union, that they may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate their ſtrength, and find them work againſt each other.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To procure a Liberty of ſeducing all they can under the name of Liberty of Conſcience, that ſo they may have as fair a game for it as we: And ignorance and the common corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (eſpecially ſo heightened by a cuſtome in ſin) doth befriend the Devils cauſe much more than Gods; or elſe how comes it to paſs that the Godly are ſo few, and Error, Idolatry and impiety doth ſo abound in all the earth!</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb facs="tcp:61063:4"/>5. To break the common people into as many Sects and parties as they can, that they may not onely employ them againſt one another, but alſo may hence fetch matter of reproach, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our profeſsion in the eyes of the World.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To plead under the name of Seekers againſt the certainty of all Religion; that men may be brought to think that they muſt be either of the Popiſh profeſsion or of none.</p>
            <p>And indeed when all Sects have done their worſt it is but two, that we are in any great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of (And of thoſe I think we are in more danger, then the most are aware of) And that is, <hi>1. Papiſts</hi>: who plead not as other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, onely by the tongue, but by exciting Princes and States againſt us, and diſputing with the Fagot or Hatchet in their hands: And if we have not Arguments that will confute a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, an Army, or a Powder-plot, we can do no good againſt them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Prophaneneſs;</hi> animated by Apoſtate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels: This is the Religion that men are born in. And men that Naturally are ſo endeared to their luſts, that they <hi>would not</hi> have the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be true, will eaſily hearken to him that tells them it is falſe.</p>
            <p>Yea ſo much doth Popery befriend men in a vicious courſe, that ſome are apt to joyn
<pb facs="tcp:61063:4"/>
theſe together, thinking at the heart that Chriſtianity is but a Fable: but yet for fear it ſhould prove true, they will be Papiſts, that they may have that eaſie remedy for a reſerve.</p>
            <p>If God will preſerve us but from theſe two dangers, Popery, and Prophaneneſs animated by infidelitie, it will goe well with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The moſt of my former Writings having been bent againſt the later; I thought it not amiſs to let go this one againſt the former. That ſo I may entice the common profeſſors to a little more ſerious Study of theſe points, and furniſh them with ſome familiar Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are ſuited to their capacities, that every deceiver may not find them unarmed. And here I thought it beſt to defend our own profeſsion and overthrow theirs in the main, and not to ſtand long upon particular contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, except that one of the Reſolution and Foundation of our Faith, which is the great difference. Yet that private unſtudyed men may underſtand wherein the particular differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences lie, I have given them a Catalogue of them in other mens words in the end, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving not to do it in my own.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, I have here made it plain that Popery is againſt Scripture, Reaſon, Senſe,
<pb facs="tcp:61063:5"/>
and againſt the Unity and Judgement of the Church.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Either Scripture is True or not true: If not, Popery is not true, which pleadeth its warrant from it (And ſome of them argue, as if they purpoſed to diſprove the Scripture, and to imitate <hi>Samſon,</hi> in pulling down the houſe on their own heads and ours, in revenge for the diſhonor they have ſuffered by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.) If it be true (as nothing more true) then Popery is not true, which palpably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth it, as in the points of Latin ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and denying the Cup in the Lords Supper, and many other is moſt evident.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Either the Catholike Church is one, or not: If not, then Popery is deceitful, which maketh this its principal pretence, for the uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urping the Univerſal Headſhip. If it be One then Popery is deceitful, which is renounced by the far greater part of the Catholike Church, and again renounceth them, and ſeparateth from them, becauſe they will not be ſubject to the Pope, who never yet in his greateſt height had the actual Government of half the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Either the Judgement of the Antient Doctors is ſound or not: If not, then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is unſound, that is ſworn to expound the Scripture onely according to their
<pb facs="tcp:61063:5"/>
concent: If it be ſound, then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is unſound, that arrogate a Uiniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Government and Infallibility, and build upon a foundation, that was never allowed by the Antient Doctors (as in the third Diſput. I have fully proved) and which moſt Chriſtians in the world do ſtill reject.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> Either Reaſon it ſelf is to be renounced or not: If it be, then none can be Papiſts but mad men. If not, then Popery muſt be renounced, which foundeth our very faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on impoſsibilities, and teacheth men of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to believe in the Pope as the Vicar of Chriſt, before they believe in Chriſt, with many the like which are afterwards laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5.</hi> Either our five Senſes, and the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made upon them, is certain and Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible or not. If not, then the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> both Pope and Council are Fallible, and not at all to be t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ed. For when all their Tradition is by hearing or reading, they are uncertain whether ever they heard or read any ſuch thing; and we muſt all be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain whether they ſpeak or write it: And then we muſt not onely ſubſcribe to <hi>Franſc. Sanchez, Quod nihil ſcitur,</hi> but alſo ſay that <hi>Nihil certo creditur.</hi> But if ſenſe be certain and Infallible, then the Church of
<pb facs="tcp:61063:6"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> even Pope and Council are not onely Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, but certainly falſe deceivers and deceived. For the Pope and his Council tell the Church that it is not Bread and Wine which they take, eat and drink in the Euchariſt. But the ſenſes of all ſound men, do tell them that it is. I ſee that its Bread and Wine, I <hi>ſmell</hi> it, I <hi>feel</hi> it, I <hi>taſte</hi> it; and ſomewhat I <hi>hear</hi> to further my aſſurance: And yet if Popery be not falſe, its no ſuch matter. One would think the dulleſt Reader, might be quickely here reſolved, whether Popery be true or falſe. Look on the conſecrated Bread and Wine, touch it, ſmell it, taſte it, and if thou canſt but be ſure that it is indeed Bread and Wine, thou maiſt be as ſure that Popery is a deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And if thou canſt but be ſure; that it is not Bread and Wine, yet thou maiſt be ſure that the Pope or his Council, nor any of his Doctors are not to be believed. For if other mens ſenſes be deceitful, theirs and thine are ſo too.</p>
            <p>But theſe things are urged in the following Diſputations.</p>
            <p>Its worth the obſerving how much they are at odds among themſelves, about the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of their Faith, and how neer ſome of them come to us of late, as in <hi>Tho. White</hi>'s <hi>Sonus Buccinae,</hi> and Doctor <hi>H.

Holden de Reſol. fidei,</hi> and in <hi>Creſſy</hi> and <hi>Vane</hi> and others may be ſeen: And their ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followers in <hi>England</hi> think verily, that theirs is the common Doctrine of that Church. And how ſolicitous <hi>Creſſy</hi> and others are to take that Infallibility out of our way as a ſtumbling ſtone, which the <hi>Italians</hi> and moſt of them, make the Foundation and chief cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-ſtone. What a task were it to Reconcile but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Holden? Knot</hi> and <hi>Creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy</hi> (both in <hi>Engliſh.</hi>) <hi>White</hi> had ſo much wit in his Defence of <hi>Ruſhworths</hi> Dialogues, when he wrote in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to carry on the matter as ſmoothly, as if they had been all of a mind. But when he writes in Latin, How many wayes of Reſolution of Faith, that are unſound can he find among the Papiſts as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from his own? <hi>Vid. de fide &amp; Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log.

I have many times conſidered, that you could never ſure endure to torment men in your Inquiſition, and conſume them to aſhes, and ſo induſtriouſly to embroyle the Nations of the earth in blood and miſeries, to work them to your minds, and ſet up your own way, if you did not think it right, and think them exceeding bad whom you thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy.
<pb facs="tcp:61063:8"/>
I find that my own heart would ſerve me to uſe Toads and Serpents, and deſtroying Vermine, half as bad as you do Proteſtants, that is, to put them to death, though not to torment them ſo long: but for gentler and more harmeleſs creatures, I could not do it without a great reluctancy of my nature. I muſt needs therefore by your works bear you record that you have a zeal for God; but ſo had ſome before you that guided it not by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2. And I ſuppoſe your way is undoubtedly right in your own eyes, or elſe you durſt never proſecute it with ſuch violence: And yet one that was once as zealous in his way, and ſhut up the Saints in priſon, and received au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the high Prieſts to put them to death, and compelled them to blaſpheam, did afterward call all this but <hi>madneſs, Acts</hi> 26.9, 10, 11. But methinks I find my ſelf obliged, when I ſee men differ from me with ſuch height of confidence, to give them ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of my differing thoughts: And yet it is no great matter of ſucceſs that I can expect from this account. To make any addition or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in your belief, I have no great reaſon to expect; while you read my words with this prejudice, that they are damnable hereſie; and depend upon him whom you ſuppoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, for the faſhioning of your Faith. And
<pb facs="tcp:61063:8"/>
if I ſhould ſay that I expect ſatisfaction from <hi>you,</hi> with any great hope, I ſhould but diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For I have not been negligent in reading ſuch writings of your own as might acquaint me both with your Faith, and your Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Opinions; and can ſcarce reaſonably expect that any of you ſhould ſay more to ſatisfie me, then theſe contain. For any of you to recite the Canons or Decretals of your Church or Popes, in a writing to me is in vain: For I have them at hand already, or can have them at a trice. And if you ſay any thing to me by way of Anſwer, which is not in thoſe Canons or Decretals, or ſolemnly pronounced alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by your Church to be <hi>de fide,</hi> you can give me little aſſurance of its verity; but your own writing muſt incur all thoſe reproaches, which <hi>Knot</hi> beſtows on the Doctrine of <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> and we hear from you ſo frequently, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But ſtill I confeſs I read them with prejudice and partiality; till at laſt I attained (as far as I can underſtand by my own heart) ſuch a love to the truth, and an impartiality in my Studies and judgement of theſe things, that I read your Writers, with as free a mind (I mean, as willing to find what truth was there to be found) as I do the Writings of Proteſtants themſelves.

               </gap> hath been brought on ſince I began to ſearch in to it impartially; I ſhall here further declare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61063:9"/>Firſt, I have been moſt offended with thoſe doctrines and practices, that did moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly run againſt the ſtream of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; for here the caſe was ſo plain that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſingular acuteneſs it might be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: as in your Latin Service of God with thoſe that underſtand it not, your adminiſtring the Bread in the Lords Supper without the cup; that Image-worſhip which your Writers do maintain, forbidding Prieſts marriages, with many ſuch like. And yet ſuſpecting my own underſtanding, I read what your Writers ſay alſo for theſe: But when I ſaw how palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they forced the text, it increaſed my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: And then knowing that you contradicted the Scriptures in <hi>theſe,</hi> and finding withal that you build your faith upon your Churches Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, I was exceedingly turned againſt your profeſſion, when I ſaw your foundation ſo clearly overthrown. But yet this was not all: There was ſcarce any thing that more offended me, then the tendency of your Doctrines, to deſtroy the Knowledge of the people, and lead them on in ignorance, and pleaſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them by a company of ceremonies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Reaſonable ſervice of God: and the manner of your worſhip I could never digeſt. Other things did grate very hard upon thoſe truths which I was confirmed in, but <hi>theſe</hi> went againſt the very bent of my heart, and
<pb facs="tcp:61063:10"/>
croſſed the very ends of my Religion and my Life. Your keeping the Scriptures from the Laity, as far as you do; and maintaining it ſo commonly to be the Original of Hereſies to tranſlate them into a known tongue; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it ſo deadly a crime to have a Bible which they can read; with your Latin Service afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and the formalities and ſcenical worſhip in which you train up the ignorant vulgar with many other things in your doctrine and practice, are ſuch as leave me but little room for delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whither I ſhould own them or not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo plainely againſt the very end of the Chriſtian Religion. Had theſe things come under my conſideration in a carnal ſtate, when the fleſh was my end, and not God I know not how I ſhould have entertained them. But your own Doctors conſent that God muſt be my end, and chiefly Loved, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and ſought: And will you teach a man this, and whoodwinke him when you have done? Will you bid him love God, and keep him from the Knowledge of him? Will you bid him deſire and ſeek him, and when you have done lock him up in the dark? Or will you bid him ſerve and obey him, and yet forbid him to ſearch after the knowledge of his laws and will? If you would bring me to be of theſe opinions, your reaſonings would be to as much purpoſe as if you ſhould perſwade me to put out my
<pb facs="tcp:61063:10"/>
eyes and put them in your pockets, for fear of miſſing my way in my race, when my life is at the ſtake: Or as if you ſhould perſwade me to be ignorant of Plowing and Sowing, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, and yet to ſeek after proviſion and riches in the world. I am as eaſily reconciled as another to thoſe that ſtep out of the path that I am in, if they go towards the ſame end: But if you would teach me to turn my back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Heaven, as the onely way to attain it, this will not eaſily down with me: I know that <hi>God is light, and with him is no darkneſs</hi>; and that <hi>Chriſt is the light of the world,</hi> and his ſpirit is the illuminater of the Saints, and the <hi>word is a light to our feet,</hi> and <hi>giveth wiſdome to the ſimple:</hi> And yet would you have us refuſe this Light, and chooſe the Darkneſs? I know that Satan is <hi>the prince of darkneſs,</hi> &amp; a ſtate of death is a ſtate of <hi>darkneſs,</hi> tending to <hi>outer darkneſs</hi>: and that it is the ſaving way of God to <hi>tranſlate men out of darkeneſs into his marvellous light:</hi> And yet would you perſwade me that this is the way of Life? What a difference is there between this doctrine of yours, and the very ſcope of Scriptures, and antient Writers, and the ſenſe of a gracious ſoul? <hi>Solomon</hi> would have men to <hi>Hide the commandment with them, and incline their ear to wiſdom, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their hearts to underſtanding, and cry after knowledge, and lift up their voiec for underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="tcp:61063:11"/>
and ſeek for it as ſilver, and ſearch after it as for hid treaſure,</hi> Prov. 2.2, 3, 4. And is your Doctrine like this? <hi>Iſay</hi> bids, <hi>To the Law and the Teſtimony.</hi> Iſ. 8.20. And the Bereans are commended for ſearching the Scriptures daily to ſee whether the things were ſo that were taught them even by Apoſtles: And will you forbid this, and burn men for to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their ſalvation? Did not <hi>Paul</hi> write his Epiſtles to the Laity as well as to the Clergy? You muſt ſtrip me of the grace of God, and reduce my mind to a ſtate of darkneſs, before I can ever entertain theſe principles of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: For <hi>light and darkneſs</hi> will not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. If by Arguments you would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me, ſo plainly againſt the life of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as that I am bound to blind or kill my ſelf in order to my good, there's ſomewhat within me that would confute them beſides reaſon: And why ſhould not the Life of Grace alſo be a principle of ſelf-preſervation? As for your Reaſon, that men muſt let alone the Scripture and hearken to their Teachers for fear of hereſies, it will never take with me till I can believe you to be leſs ſuſpected guides then Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and till I can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that a Scholar may not learn of his Book &amp; his Teacher both without any contradiction.</p>
            <p>And then for your devotions, it is not all the Arguments in the world, that would ever
<pb facs="tcp:61063:11"/>
reconcile me to them, while I have that Law in any prevailing meaſure written in my heart, that teacheth me to worſhip God in Spirit and in truth. What man of Spiritual experience can chooſe but diſtaſte your way of worſhip, that doth but read over one of your offices, and Lady's Pſalters, and ſee the affected repetition of words, and the ludicrous kind of devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which you teach the people, more like to charms then ſerious prayers to God! eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if he alſo obſerve the huge number of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which the very body of your worſhip is compoſed of. As there is ſomewhat in nature, that hindereth a man, from delighting to eat chaffe, or feeding upon meer air; ſo is there ſomewhat in the new nature of a Chriſtian, that is againſt this trifling and jeſting with God.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:61063:12"/>
followers. I have endeavored as well as I could to be acquainted with them where I came and I have known but very few of them, but have been either Whoremongers, or Swearers, or Drunkards, or Gameſters, or ſenſual livers: nor did I ever meet with one to this day, to my beſt remembrance, that manifeſted a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual frame of heart, or had any delight to ſpeak of the workings of God upon the ſoul, and the ſweet communications of the love of Chriſt, or could give any ſavory account of any ſuch ſpiritual workings in them: but all their Religion was to ſtick to the Romiſh Church, and go on in their ceremonious forms of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, abſtaining from this meat, or that, and rioting and pampering their fleſh on Holidayes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If I had known this to be the caſe onely of the common people in <hi>Italy,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> I ſhould not have wondered: for I know that moſt of the people, do take up their Religion but upon carnal accounts, and accordingly will uſe it: But to find it thus in <hi>England,</hi> where your number is ſmall, and you pretend to hold your Religion in ſo much ſelf-denyal, the ſtate being againſt you; and therefore your party ſhould be the pureſt zelots, and ſhew the face of your doctrine in its greateſt glory; this makes me judge of the tree by the fruites. And the obſerving of this hath made me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,
<pb facs="tcp:61063:12"/>
that ever you can make the holineſs of your Church, the matter of ſo great oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as you do: Yea that ſuch men as <hi>H.P. de Creſſy</hi> can have the face to pretend that your admirable holineſs in compariſon of ours, was the means of their converſion to you. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy man! with whom did he converſe while he ſeemed a Proteſtant? or where did he live? But this was not his fate alone; but of divers of his ſtrain. When they are carnal Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, abhorring the power of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which they profeſs, and avoiding and reproaching the practicers of their own Religion, and ſo have no communion with them, nor experience of their holineſs; it is a righteous thing with God to leave them to ſo much blindneſs, as to run from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> for holineſs; and that becauſe they abhorred purity, they ſhould be ſo blinded as not to diſcern the beauty of it, and yet to dote on the name and coate of it, which may be put on in the morning, and off at night. And indeed this hath ſomewhat increaſed my averſneſs; to obſerve that by how much the more godly and conſcionable any are of our profeſſion, the more they are againſt yours: and that ſo few of this ſort are turned to you, that I yet know not certainly of one, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeemed a Godly perſon. And the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ignorant ſort of people that know not
<pb facs="tcp:61063:13"/>
what a Church is, nor what Religion is, and that live in ſenſuality and wickedneſs, are the favourableſt to your wayes, yea ſo forward to promote them that many of them would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be yours if the times were but changed to you; and theſe are the people that I have known become your proſelites. When we have loſt our labor upon them, and left them in their wickedneſs, and they that were filthy are filthy ſtill, then ſome of them turn Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and this forſooth in admiration of the holineſs of your Church: When I confeſs for ſome of them, I have not been ſorry to hear that they were turned to you: for I thought, it may be the liking they have to you, might make them hearken more to your reproofs, then to ours, and poſſibly you might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them from Whoredoms and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Swearing, and Lying, when we were out of hope: But when I perceived that they fled to you for an indulgence in their ſin, becauſe ſome of theſe are but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſins with you, and they have a palliate ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial cure at hand to befool them; I then acknowledged the juſtice of God againſt them. I am none of thoſe that think that there is none among you ſhall be ſaved. I have read that in ſome of your Writers, that perſwadeth me it came from a ſanctified heart. I am ready to acknowledge and honor the Spirit of Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:61063:13"/>
wherever I can diſcern it. But I muſt profeſs that I was never yet ſo happy as to converſe with a Papiſt, that manifeſted an experienced, gracious, heavenly mind; though I am truely willing to make the beſt of them. And that your Church ſhould be as the ſink or channel, to receive the excrements and filth of ours, is no great argument of its holineſs in my eyes. And if a few that are leſs ſenſual turn to you, it is commonly, as far as I can diſcern, the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants or ſervants of ſome of your way, that are led by worldly reſpects, and they are ſuch ignorant ſouls that they know not what the Religion is which they are turned to, nor are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give a reaſon of their change. I have ſpoke with ſome affected to your way, and ſome turned to it, that have thought our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was yours, and yours was ours: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that we taught that men might live without ſin, and you taught otherwiſe: and have denyed that you hold the doctrine of mans merits, and divers the like. Are not theſe good Catholikes, and well converted, that be of our mind, and do not know it? And I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve among your own Writers, that uſually thoſe that write in the moſt heavenly ſtrain, are thoſe that give ſome wound to your profeſſion, by ſome conſiderable oppoſition, as <hi>Mirandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, Gerſon, Bernard,</hi> and many more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61063:14"/>And it hath more diſaffected me to your way, to obſerve how low the deſign of your Religion is, in compariſon of ours: You can let the common people be as blind as Moles, and worſhip they know not what! And you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt confin Religion unto Votaries and Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. When as the deſign of our Religion is to make the generality of our Paſtoral charge more holy by far then your retired Votaries. And (as far as I am able to learn) I do verily think that there are in the ſmall Town that I live in, ſome hundreds of ſouls, that have more true ſelf-denyal, humility, acquaintance with the ſaving works of Grace, abhorrence of ſin, delight in God, and believing ſerious thoughts of heaven, then is to be found in twenty of your Monaſteries. When I am in one of their meetings which you account but a curſed Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical conventicle, I can behold their diligent attendance, their humble learning, their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, orderly, ſerious devotions, and afterwards their painful recollections and improvement of what they learn. But among you, I ſhould ſee a dumbe ſhew, a pompous oſtentation, compounded of Ceremonies, and words which are as no words, being not by the people under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. And I am certainly informed by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers that have known them, and by your own confeſſions, that you have Prieſts even like your people and your ſervices. Even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
<pb facs="tcp:61063:14"/>
men, that are but able to read their Maſs; like ſome of the worſt of our old Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, whom we have caſt out: However you may have learned Jeſuites and Fryars, that are bred up chiefly for your Theological wars, while the people that live in peace under you are famiſhed.</p>
            <p>It hath alſo much increaſed my diſaffection, to obſerve, by what groſs kind of cheating you carry on your cauſe. You make a noiſe with the oſtentation of Miracles; but we can never ſee one of them, nor have certain proof of it. I confeſs if I could ſee them, they would work on me much: and I would go from Sea to Sea to ſee one: but I know not whither to go with the leaſt hope of ſuch a ſight.</p>
            <p>You talk much of perfection, and keeping the Law of God without ſin: But how long will it be before you will ſhew us one of thoſe ſinleſs perfect men? I have enquired of thoſe that I thought moſt likely, and they have told me that ſuch men there be in the world, but would not be intreated to ſhew me one of them. Nay, it amazeth me, that you ſhould glory of perfection, where it is ſo hard to find ſincerity, and to meet with a man that will not curſe and ſwear, and whore, and be drunk. Yea more to find that after this oſtentation of perfection, you come ſo low as to make thoſe to be perfect which we ſuppoſe to be in a damnable ſtate:
<pb facs="tcp:61063:15"/>
For how many abominable ſins do you make to be venial? Do I need to tell you what ſome of your own Writers ſay of Fornication; and of a Prieſt rather keeping a Concubine then a wife; and what gaines have come to the Church by Whorehouſes? and what a trade it is at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> &amp;c. To give inſtance but in the ſin of lying, how light do you make of it? yea you fear not to teach your Engliſh Proſelytes, That <hi>[A lye is a mortal ſin, when it is any great diſhonor to God, or notable prejudice to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor; Otherwiſe if it be meerly officious or jeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is but a venial ſin]</hi> They are the words of <hi>H.T.</hi> (they ſay <hi>Henry Turbervile</hi>) in his Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, <hi>pag.</hi> 160.

That <hi>[By this we muſt know when a ſin is mortal, and when venial: Becauſe to any mortal ſin it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, both that it be deliberate and perfectly voluntary—]</hi> And then ſet altogether, and conſider what your Writers make of venial ſin: no worſe then your Doctor <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſaith, that [<hi>Venial ſin hath not perfectam rationem peccati,</hi> but is <hi>Analogically called ſin: and that non eſt contra Legem; quia venialiter peccans non facit quod lex prohibet, nec pretermittit id ad quod lex per praeceptum obligat, ſed facit praeter le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem: It is not againſt the Law, nor forbidden by it, but beſide it.</hi>] 12. <hi>qu.</hi> 88. <hi>art.</hi> 1. <hi>ad</hi> 1.

But onely as it hindereth the luſtre of Grace, and therefore may be done away without the infuſion of habitual grace,</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 8.7.2. <hi>c.</hi> Apply this now to your laſt inſtanced caſe. It ſeems now that the Law of God forbiddeth not Lying, when it diſhonoreth God but <hi>a little</hi> and not <hi>greatly,</hi> or when it is a prejudice to another but not <hi>notable</hi>; It forbids not men to lie Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly or in jeſt; as <hi>H.T.</hi> ſpeakes. Nay it ſeems if you curſe or ſwear or blaſpheam the name of God, or kill your own Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is but a venial ſin, if you do it not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately,</hi> and <hi>perfectly voluntarily.</hi> And is not here a fine doctrine to make men perfect? Have you no way to make your ſelves perfect, but by making the Law of God imperfect? How can you perſwade us to value ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection? Doth <hi>H.T.</hi> think that a man that hath the uſe of Reaſon is not bound by God to <hi>deliberate</hi> of all the weighty actions of his life! And if a man ſhall kill and blaſpheam in paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſay [<hi>I did not deliberate; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no ſin: God did not forbid it me</hi>:] Shall this excuſe him? Or is ſuch doctrine to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured among Chriſtians? If God do not make it a reaſonable mans duty to uſe his reaſon in the greateſt things, and to deliberate of what he ſaith or doth, I know not what either Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb facs="tcp:61063:16"/>
or Law is made for. I think on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary that [Not deliberating, eſpecially in weighty caſes is a heinous ſin, and the principal cauſe of all other ſin, in many of the ungodly. So I ſay of the other limitation: that (it be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly voluntary</hi>] Paſſion may make a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my or murder but <hi>imperfectly voluntary</hi>; and yet that proveth not that God forbiddeth it not. For the will it ſelf is under a Law, which puts it upon <hi>duty,</hi> and not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains it from ſinful volition or nolition: And therefore if the will do but ſuſpend its act, in whole or in part, and thereby let the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded faculties miſcarry, I ſhall yet believe that this is forbidden, and a proper ſin. What if you have a charge of the ſouls of your flock; and you ſleep while they are miſled: Or if you were a Phyſician, and had charge of your patients lives; and you fall aſleep till they are paſt recovery; are you no ſinner, and do you not go againſt the Law? Yes, you are a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer: For though the thing be not voluntary <hi>quoad actum voluntatis,</hi> it is morally or imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively voluntary, <hi>propter omiſsionem actus.</hi> If <hi>Wolverhampton</hi> Papiſts be fed with ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as this; they may well be <hi>many,</hi> but they are unlikely to be good. Inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (which I took for one of the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying ſins) it ſeems is a notable preſervative from ſin: For be ſure you deliberate not, and
<pb facs="tcp:61063:16"/>
you break no Law of God what ever you do. And if there be no Law againſt Lying, except the lyes of the higher ſtrain that are by <hi>H.T.</hi> excepted, no wonder then if Papiſts be Lyars.</p>

If you call me out to any more of this work, I mean the next time to preſent to the world a Catalogue of your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions among your ſelves, that it may appear how notable your unity is? If the Jeſuites are to be believed, what a ſilly ſottiſh generation are your ſecular Prieſts? If your Prieſts are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, what a ſeditious hypocritical, cheating packe are the Jeſuites? I ſpeak not the words of your Proteſtant adverſaries, but of thoſe of your own Church. Do I not know what <hi>Guiliel. de Sancto Amore</hi> and many another ſay of your own Church? Do you think I never read <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Quodlibets,</hi> and the many pretty ſtories of the Jeſuites exploits there mentioned by him? I do not think that you ſuffer many of your own followers to read theſe books that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt one another by your ſelves.

               <pb facs="tcp:61063:18"/>
what this Church is? One ſaith it is the Pope with a General Council; and another ſaith it is a General Council, though the Pope diſſent. One ſaith the Pope is fallible, and the other ſaith a Council is fallible. One ſaith, a Pope is above the Council, and another ſaith the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil is above the Pope. And now what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of your Religion? Nay is it not unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable that you are of two Churches ſpecifical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different? Certainly a body Politick is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified from the <hi>ſumma poteſtas.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the <hi>French</hi> make a Council the <hi>ſumma poteſtas,</hi> the ſovereign power; and the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> make the Pope the ſovereign, and a third party make the Pope and Council conjunct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And then you have another deceit for the ſalving of all this, that increaſeth my diſaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. You glory in your preſent judge of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, and tell us it is no wonder if we be all in pieces that have no ſuch judge. And what the better are you for your judge; when he cannot or dare not decide your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies? No, he dare not determine this fundamental controverſie, whether himſelf or a Council be the ſovereign power, for fear of loſing the <hi>French</hi> and thoſe that joyn with them. So that it muſt remain but <hi>dogma Theologicum</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61063:19"/>
and no point <hi>de fide,</hi> what is the <hi>ſumma poteſtas</hi>; and yet all that is <hi>de fide,</hi> even our Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Salvation muſt be reſolved into it? And doth not this directly tend to infidelity? Would you have ſerious Chriſtians deliver up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſuch a maze as this for the obtaining of unity? What the better are you for a judge of controverſie, in all thoſe hundreds of differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are among your ſelves, when your judge either cannot or will not determine them? Are not we as well without him as you are with him? Plain things that are paſt controverſie have no need of your judge! It is no contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie with us whether Chriſt be the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> whether he roſe, aſcended and will judge the world: And if we go to darker points, your own judge will ſay nothing or worſe. Why do you cry out ſo much againſt expounding the Scripture otherwiſe then according to the ſence of the Church, when your Church will give you no interpretation of them? Do not your expoſitors differ about many hundred texts of Scripture, and neither Pope nor Council will decide the controverſies? Theſe are therefore meer deluſions of the world, with the empty name of a judge of controverſies. And indeed you ſometime ſhew your ſelves that you have no ſuch high conceit of your Pope (whatever you would make the world believe) as to truſt his judgement. Your own Prieſt <hi>Watſon</hi> tells
<pb facs="tcp:61063:19"/>
us in his <hi>Quodlib. pag.</hi> 56.57. That the Jeſuites
<q>[Preached openly in <hi>Spain</hi> againſt Pope <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> the laſt of all holy memory, and railing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him as againſt a moſt wicked man, and monſter on earth: they have called him a <hi>Lutherane</hi> heretick, they have termed him a Wolf; they have ſaid, he had undone all Chriſtendome if he had lived: and Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf as judge paramount being asked what he thought of his death, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Qui ſine paenitentia vivit, &amp; ſine paeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia moritur, proculdubio ad infernum deſcendit:</hi>

and to an Engliſh Doctor of our Nation he ſaid,

               </q>
And yet we muſt hold our Belief in Chriſt on the credit of ſuch a mans infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>But yet I have not come to that point of your Schiſme which above all things in the world doth alienate my mind from your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. And that is your ſeparation from all other Chriſtians in the world! I find in my ſelf ſo great an inclination to unity, and the title [Catholike] is ſo honourable, in my eſteem, to them that deſerve it, that if I had found you to have the unity and Catholike Religion and Church which you boaſt of, it would have much inclined me to your Church and way. But when I find you like the Donatiſts confining the
<pb facs="tcp:61063:20"/>
Church to your party, and making your ſelves a Sect and Faction, and unchurching and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the far greateſt part of the Chriſtians in the world; this left me aſſured that you are moſt notorious Schiſmaticks. When I ſaw ſo much knowledge and holineſs comparatively among the Reformed Catholikes, and ſo much igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and wickedneſs among the Papiſts (even here where are but a remnant that adhere to their Religion againſt the courſe of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) and when I read ſo many plain promiſes in Scripture, that <hi>Whoever believeth in Chriſt ſhall not periſh,</hi> and that <hi>if by the ſpirit we mortifie the deeds of the body we ſhall live,</hi> and that if we <hi>Repent our ſins ſhall be forgiven,</hi> yea that <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath the promiſe of this life and that to come</hi>; and then when I find that the Papiſts for all theſe certain promiſes, do unchurch and damne us all, becauſe we believe not in the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> as well as in Chriſt; this ſatisfied me as fully that you are moſt audacious Schiſmaticks, as I am ſatisfied that you are Papiſts, What! muſt I be a Papiſt on ſuch grounds as theſe? Muſt I believe becauſe you tell me ſo, that all the moſt conſcionable heavenly Chriſtians that I am intimately acquainted with are unſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ungodly, and in a ſtate of damnation? When I am a witneſs of the earneſt breathings of their ſouls after more communion with God; When they would not live in one of
<pb facs="tcp:61063:20"/>
thoſe ſins that you call <hi>venial,</hi> for all the world; When they mortifie the fleſh, and live in the ſpirit, and wait for Chriſts appearance. And yet that ſuch as the Papiſts ſhall be ſaved that are ſo far below them, becauſe they believe in the Pope of <hi>Rome?</hi> Why you may almoſt as well perſwade me to become a Papiſt by telling me that you have eyes in your heads, and noſes on your faces, and the reſt of the world have none. Doth Chriſt ſay, <hi>He-that believeth, and repenteth ſhall be ſaved</hi>; and muſt I believe that all Proteſtants ſhall be damned, let them believe and repent never ſo much? This is to bid me <hi>[ceaſe to believe Chriſt]</hi> that I may believe the Pope <hi>[Ceaſe to be a Chriſtian]</hi> that I may become a Papiſt. I am confident I ſhall never be Papiſt, if it may not be done but by believing that all the Godly that I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with are ungodly, and in the way to hell.</p>

The moſt of them never acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the ſovereignty of your Pope. And a few ages ago, before Mahometaniſm and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm diminiſhed the number of Chriſtians in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> the Papiſts were but a ſmall proportion. There are but lately taken off from the Chriſtian Religion, its probable, twice as many as all the Papiſts in the whole world: If it were but the Kingdomes of <hi>Nubia</hi> and <hi>Tenduc,</hi> how far would they go on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? A Biſhop of your own, and Legate of the Popes that dwelt in thoſe Countries, ſaith, that the Chriſtians in the Eaſterly parts of <hi>Aſia</hi> alone, exceeded in multitude: the Chriſtians both of the Greek and Latin Churches: <hi>Jacob. a Vitriaco Hiſt. Orient. c.</hi> 77. And which is more; the whole Church for many hundred years after Chriſt were far from being the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>! And indeed had Chriſt no Church till the Pope became univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Monarch? Muſt <hi>Paul</hi> be damned becauſe he was not one of <hi>Peters</hi> ſubjects? Do not your conſciences know that ſwearing obedience to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> was a thing unknown for many hundred years, yea that it is a novelty in the world? Muſt Chriſt loſe for ever the moſt of his Church, even thoſe that never
<pb facs="tcp:61063:21"/>
heard of <hi>Rome</hi>; becauſe they believe not in the Pope? Never ſhall I be Papiſt while I breath, if I muſt be engaged to ſend the moſt of the Chriſtians on earth, to the Devil, and that upon ſuch an account as this. Theſe things are ſo uncatholike, ſo unchriſtian, ſo inhumane, that I wonder and wonder a hundred times, how any learned, ſober men among you, are able to believe them. For my part I am a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved <hi>Catholike</hi>; that <hi>own the univerſal Church of Chriſt</hi>; and cannot limit my charity to a <hi>corner</hi> or a <hi>faction</hi>; eſpecially ſo <hi>groſs a one as yours.</hi> I own not the errors or other ſins of any of the Churches, ſo far as I can diſcover them: But if I muſt make them Hereticks and unchurch them for theſe (yea even thoſe that go under the name of Neſtorians, and Eutichians) I muſt needs put you in among them, who I think do erre more groſly then they. But I am none of your judge: Nor none of your moſt rigid adverſaries. I am one that have been oft called a Papiſt in print, for avoiding ſome of thoſe extreams, into which ſome others have run from you. I am one that cannot chooſe but hope that there are thouſands that ſhall be ſaved that profeſs themſelves of your Church and way. But that I cannot do ſo my ſelf, and the Reaſons why I cannot do it, I have thought good here to let you know. Many more there are, but
<pb facs="tcp:61063:22"/>
I have mentioned ſome of them in the following Diſputations, to which I refer you. I can truely ſay this in the preſence of the Lord that knows my heart, that if I knew it my ſelf, I would moſt gladly turn Papiſt before I ſleep if I could diſcern it to be the way of God: Yea if I had but any probability of it, and knew but the man that could give me ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory evidence on your ſide, I would wander from Sea to Sea to find him, as weak and unfit for travail as I am. And therefore if <hi>any learned man among you,</hi> have ſo much <hi>confidence</hi> of his way, and <hi>charity</hi> to my ſoul, as to <hi>perſwade</hi> me to his opinion, <hi>he ſhall at any ſeaſonable time be wellcom,</hi> and I ſhall thankfully entertain any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that he can bring, according to my ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. But then I muſt deſire him to deal plainly and come <hi>bare face't,</hi> and not to juggle under the vizor of a <hi>Seeker,</hi> or any other Sect; for that way will never take with me.</p>
            <p>And I muſt further here profeſs that this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per comes not with any cruel or bloody deſign againſt you. I write not to exaſperate the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors againſt you, ſo far as to deal unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with any of you. And whereas under the vizor of the ſects before mentioned you are of late ſo earneſt in pleading for a toleration, deal but impartially like honeſt men, and I will ſet in with you. Procure but a toleration for
<pb facs="tcp:61063:22"/>
the Reformed Chriſtian Religion in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> and your part of <hi>Germany, Portugal,</hi> &amp;c. and I ſhould willingly petition the ſovereign Powers in <hi>England</hi> that you might have as much liberty here: But that <hi>you</hi> ſhall have <hi>full</hi> liberty here, and Proteſtants have <hi>none</hi> where you can hinder it, this is not equal dealing. But how comes it to paſs that you that pretend ſo much to unity are in this alſo of ſo many opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſts are for liberty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> are againſt it? But I muſt cry you mercy: I now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, It is but your ſelves that you think have right to liberty here, and others ſhould have it but in order to yours. As hardly as you think you are uſed in <hi>England,</hi> you live openly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and no man that I hear of layeth hands on you: When you know if a <hi>Spaniard</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> be known to be a Proteſtant, hee's as ſure tormented and burnt at a ſtake as the coat is on his back. Do you not know this to be true? Were I in thoſe places where your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath its will, I know one leafe of this book would cauſe me to be burnt to aſhes: that I am alive is becauſe I am not in your power: But for my part I wiſh not the ſhedding of one drop of your blood, nor your impriſonment or baniſhment, but only your moderate and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary reſtraint from open iniquity and ſeducing of thoſe that are unfurniſhed to encounter you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61063:23"/>I have ſome invitation to make this profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the uſage of a Juſtice of Peace of this County; who was ſo far your friend as to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure me and others for a late Gratulation, and petition to his Highneſs the Lord Protector, ſubſcribed by many Juſtices, and by the Grand Jury and thouſands of the County; and to cenſure the ſaid petition to be of a cruel and bloody complexion; inſerting to your honor and the reproach of the Reformed Churches, a vindication of your Religion from the guilt of the Powder-plot and Spaniſh invaſion, and other foreign bloody acts, and charging as much on the Reformed as can be charged on you, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Hiſtory, called <hi>[The Image of both Churches.]</hi> And what was this bloody petition of this County? Why? when you had murthered, and baniſhed, and ſtarved ſuch a multitude of the poor Proteſtants in <hi>Savoy,</hi> and we were aſſured of it by a Narrative from the Lord Protector himſelf, inviting us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to relieve the remnant, in the ſenſe of your continued bloody dealings, and of the ſad caſe of thoſe poor people, and the favor of his Highneſs toward them, we returned him a thankful acknowledgement of his care, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our deſires to uſe the moſt effectual means to hinder the growth of ſo bloody a doctrine, leſt it ſhould reach our ſelves at laſt, yet adding that we deſined no rigor as to your perſons: but
<pb facs="tcp:61063:23"/>
craved the promoting of the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and of unity among our ſelves as the means of our preſervation. The world is come to a fair paſs: when our brethren are murdered by thouſands, we are bloody for mentioning it, and blaming you for it, and deſiring our ſelves to be preſerved from your doctrine and rage, ſo as without any rigor to our perſons. Alas poor Proteſtants! When your throates are cut by the merciful Papiſts, you are cruel and bloody for ſaying ſo; When they have killed one half, the other half is bloody if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to eſcape. By my good will I'le never come to the Bench for Juſtice where this Gentleman hath power: For if I accuſe a thief for robbing us, or a murderer for murdering twenty of my friends, I may on theſe terms expect to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted cruel for complaining: Yea though I adde [I pray Sir ſpare the perſon of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer: onely do your beſt to prevent the death of the reſt of my friends] I may look to be told its a bloody requeſt. But perhaps if leiſure ſerve I may ſay more to this Gentleman, in a full Reply to his paper.</p>
            <p>Yea I am ſo far from deſiring your blood, that I hope I have given you no abuſive lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Sure I am, I come far ſhort of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage that you give one another, where you may judge me to be moſt ſharp.

               <head>QUERY. Whether the Reformed Catholike Chriſtian Religion, commonly called Proteſtant, be a ſafe way to Salvation?</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE great buſineſs of the Divel the Enemy of Mankinde, is to keep man from that Salvation, which Chriſt hath ſo dearly purchaſed, ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly offered, and hath appointed us ſuch excellent helpes to attain: To which end it is <hi>his firſt</hi> endeavor, that men may not know or Believe that there is ſuch a Felicity, and what it is, and how much to be deſired; and <hi>his next,</hi> to keep them from knowing the way to it, and the <hi>laſt</hi> is, to keep them from walking in that way when they know it.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61063:29"/>
By the firſt means he keeps from Salvation, all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts and Heathens that know not, or believe not the life to come: by the ſecond, all Infidels that Believe not Chriſt to be the way, and all Hereticks that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not thoſe Truths which are of abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ſubordination to Chriſt: and by the third, all Hypocrites and unſanctified, ungodly, impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent men, in the viſible Church, that yet have a ſuperficial Belief of theſe Truths.</p>
               <p>Our Queſtion in hand is for the eſcaping the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of theſe ſnares, by diſcovering which is the <hi>ſafe way to Salvation?</hi> The Policy of the Devil hath always endeavoured to hinder the world from knowing this way, by theſe two means: Firſt, if it be poſſible by keeping them in utter darkneſs, that this way may not be revealed to them, or being revealed, may not be underſtood: Secondly, or if that will not do, by making ſuch a number of by-ways on every ſide, that the true and onely way may hardly be diſcerned. And this is his end in raiſing ſo many Hereſies; and this is the courſe he takes to miſlead them that have eſcaped from the darkneſs of Infidelity. He begun this trade betime, even in the dayes of the Apoſtles: They ſaw the multifarious off-ſpring of the Deceiver ſprouting up apace in their own times: yet did it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enter into their thoughts to tell the Church, that by this, all Hereſies ſhould be known, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>ſhould condemne them,</hi> or to ſend it down to all poſterity as the true touchſtone to tell them which was the onely right way among all theſe Hereſies, to wit, <hi>That which is believed by the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61063:29"/>
might have ſaved them much labor in giving us that Body of ſacred Doctrine which they have made indeed the Touchſtone of the <hi>ſafe way</hi>; and it might have ſpared us much more labor of ſearching and ſtudying which is the way; and we might all have ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and been reſolved without any more ado. Surely the Apoſtles were not ſo envious to our eaſe and ſafety, as to have ſilenced this eaſie way if they had known it themſelves. But as every Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick when he findeth out a New way, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the Old, as inconſiſtent with his New, ſo do the Papiſts; Since this new way hath been cryed up, that [<hi>No man can come to heaven but by</hi> Rome] it is their buſineſs to deter people from any other way, and to that end, to tell them that there is no ſafe way but theirs. As the Quakers tell us, that there is no way to Heaven but theirs, and ſome <note n="*" rend="inter">Much contrary to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcene,</hi> who ſaith that the Rebaptized do crucifie Chriſt again, <hi>Orthod. fid. li.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>p.

them for their ſins, and that hath the Heavens for his Throne, and to whom the Sun it ſelf is as Darkneſs, ſhould yet be ſo taken with a Town cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Rome,</hi> built and long inhabited by Idolaters, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with the blood of thouſands of Martyrs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which the fouls under the Altar cry out [<hi>How long Lord Holy and true wilt thou not avenge our blood</hi> &amp;c.] as to ordain that no man in the remoteſt parts of the world, even the Antipodes that never heard of the name of <hi>Rome,</hi> can be ſaved, though he ſhould never ſo much believe in Jeſus Chriſt, unleſs he Believe in the Biſhop of this Town and obey him when yet with <hi>Andradius</hi> and other Papiſts, its a hard queſtion whether a man may not be ſaved in thoſe heathen Countries without believing in Chriſt himſelf. Is it not a marvaile that we never read that <hi>Rome</hi> was once named by Chriſt himſelf, and that it never was put into our Creed as one of the neceſſary Articles to ſalvation? eſpecially when we find there the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> and Communion of Saints, which ſure would have been ſome way intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be the <hi>Romane</hi> Church or that which is head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Biſhop, if it had been ſo indeed. I find but three names (ſtrictly ſo called) in the Creed, and the Popes or <hi>Romane</hi> Churches is none of them: One is Jeſus Chriſt, and the other is hers that bore him, and the third is his, that Judged him to death; and this indeed was a <hi>Romane</hi> name, and if the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of it in the Creed will do them any ſervice, let them make their beſt of it.</p>
               <p>But however, this advantage the enemy of the Church hath got by it, that the new <hi>Romane</hi> Title, hath made the old Catholike Title ſeem queſtionable to many, and now ſo great is the audacity of the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

Pope, that he not onely queſtioneth whether any Chriſtians ſhall be ſaved that believe not in him as well as in Chriſt, but he flatly denyeth it; and what he cannot get by Scripture and reaſon, he would get by threatning and terrible words to affright the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, telling them that Proteſtants are not of the true Church or Religion, nor in a ſafe way to ſalvation, becauſe they will not be the ſubjects of the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>: Well, we ſhall briefly prove our way to be ſafe, if not to the ſatisfaction of perverſe, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or paſſionate and prejudiced men, yet I doubt not to the ſatisfaction of all humble, impartial, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent perſons, that are willing to know the truth, and deny themſelves, that they may know it, and do not ſtifle it by their luſts, or impriſon it in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs in their byaſſed reſolutions.

               <p>As that was called <hi>A Catholicke Epiſtle,</hi> which was directed to the whole Church, and not to any one perſon or people; ſo is that the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> which containeth all Chriſtians.</p>

               <p>So that by the name <hi>[Chriſtian]</hi> which expreſſeth all my Religion it ſelf Poſitively conſidered, I am differenced from Heathens, Jews, Mahometans, and all Infidels, and thoſe (by ſome called Hereticks) who uſurpe the name of Chriſtians, while they deny part of the very eſſentials of Chriſtianity. And by the name <hi>[Catholike]</hi> I adde nothing Poſitive to the former, but onely intimate that I am of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church, and negatively exclude my ſelf from all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided parties, or from any that are yet in that Church, and yet take up any dividing titles or wayes therein, though they withdraw not from it; as they are ſuch, I am none of them, and therefore diſclaim (when I expreſs my Religion) ſuch private names; I am no <hi>Lutheran, Calviniſt, Arminian, Papiſt, Socinian,</hi> &amp;c. but a Catholike.</p>
               <p>But yet when I ſay I am a <hi>Reformed Catholike,</hi> I purpoſly diſclaim the Corruptions of Popery, and in that word renounce their Errors as ſuch, as by the word <hi>Catholike</hi> I renounced their Schiſme: And ſo I may agree with <hi>Luther, Calvin</hi> or any man in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, ſo far as they hold to the word of God: ſo that if malicious adverſaries will put the name of

It is not other mens faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon us the name of a man, or of a Sect that proves us Sectaries, or that we had our Religion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally from that man. Yet do we ſo much reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence their names, that we rejoyce in their labors for the Church, and bleſs God for them, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to imitate them in their holy doctrine and lives, though we make none but Chriſt the Lord of our Faith</p>
               <p>As for the terms of the predicate they need no great explication. By <hi>ſalvation</hi> we mean principally Everlaſting Glory in Heaven: By the <hi>way</hi> to it, we mean the means appointed by God for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. The principal means indeed is Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who is eminently called, The way, and no man cometh to the Father but by him. But in ſubordination to Chriſt all other means are the way.</p>
               <p>By a <hi>ſafe way,</hi> we mean a way that <hi>in ſuo genere</hi> is ſufficient to the attainment of the end; ſo that all that ſincerely are that way ſhall attain that end; A certain means of happineſs to all that faithfully uſe it.

For it muſt be known that no Religion (or ſound Doctrines) will ſave a man that is not faithful in the reception and improvement of them. A True Religion will not ſave him that is not True to his Religion. And therefore it is no wonder if multitudes even of Proteſtants do periſh, though their Religion be the onely Religion in the world. For they are not heartily of the Religion which they profeſs. They have that doctrine which is the ſeal, and fit enough of its own nature <hi>quantum in ſe</hi> to imprint the image of God upon their ſouls: But if they keep this ſeal in their Cheſts, and apply it not effectually to their hearts, they may have unholy hearts and lives, though they profeſs a holy faith and Religion, and therefore may periſh for all that profeſſion; yea and periſh moſt deplorably becauſe their profeſſion doth aggravate their ſin. If a mans Religion (or believed doctrines) be bad in the maine, the man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf muſt needs be bad too; and therefore no man of ſuch a Religion can be ſaved: But if a mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (or profeſſed doctrines) be never ſo good it is poſſible he may be bad that doth profeſs them: and then no Religion can ſave a wicked man. So that of the true Religion ſome are ſaved, but not all: but of a bad Religion (in the main) no man can be good, or be ſaved.</p>

               <p>One would think among Chriſtians the Major ſhould be unqueſtionable: But here the corrupt <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> have preſumed to make a new word of God, that ſo the determination of the caſe might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, unleſs we will go up to theſe Philiſtines to ſharpen our weapons: For they deny the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be the whole word of God, or ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to be the Rule for deciding of controverſies in matter of ſaith, and tell us, that unwritten Traditions are another part: And thoſe Traditions are ſuch as are received by the whole Church as delivered down from the Apoſtles; and that whole Church is onely the <hi>Romane</hi> party: and thus do they by their own Authority undertake to damne all the reſt of the Chriſtian world, and make themſelves onely the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church: and by this trick of wit they have got one half of Gods word into their cloſets, and that it is his word, which they ſay is his word: And that you may know that they are no blabs or reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſecrets, they have for ſome hundred years kept this cloſe as a ſecret to themſelves, yea from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as well as to us: ſo that when the common Proverb takes that to be a ſecret which one or two knows, but not when three know it; yet theſe men have a word of God which all the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church is the keeper of, and yet thoſe that keep it, know it not themſelves, much leſs can we that ſtand by come to the knowledge of it; but we muſt all wait till the laſt Pope have breathed out his laſt determination, before the Catholike Church that is ſaid to keep it can come to know what is the

               <p>As for the Minor, that our Religion is moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Scriptures, I ſhall now ſay but this to the proof of it. Firſt, we take the Scriptures for the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Teſt or Rule of our faith and practice; and we tye not our ſelves to any other by-rule which may force us to a miſunderſtanding of it. It is onely the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that we ſtill profeſs doth contain our Religion: And it is the chief part of the quarrel between us and <hi>Rome,</hi> that they will not take this word for the perfect or ſufficient Rule of Judgement. It is this word onely that we appeal to, and deſire to be judged by: And the Papiſts wilful declining of this Tryal and Judgement doth give any impartial obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſufficient cauſe to ſuſpect, that they take the Scripture to be againſt their cauſe, or elſe why ſhould they not have as much confidence in it, and commit their cauſe to it as well as we.</p>

               <p>And I need not to ſay but theſe two things for proof of the point.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That their own Writers confeſs that the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative or Poſitive part of our Religion, as it was here in <hi>England</hi> profeſſed, was not againſt the word of God, contained in the holy Scriptures, only they told us that the Negatives were, of which we ſhall conſider further anon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As it is the great care of the Papiſts to keep the Scriptures from the people, accounting it the Original of Hereſies to have them tranſlated (as <hi>Arboreus</hi> and many expreſly ſay) and burning men to aſhes for reading the Scriptures, when God will burn them in Hell, if they obey them not (which they are not like to do without knowing them) ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath convinced them that where the reading of the Scriptures in a known tongue is but permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there doth our Religion moſt encreaſe, and Popery decay; ſo that if this one means were but

They know this well enough, or elſe they would never ſo torture poor Chriſtians by the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition for having a Bible in their houſes.

In a word, multitudes of volumes have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved that Scripture is againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</p>

That Religion is a ſafe way to Salvation, in which the Church in the three or four firſt Ages at leaſt was ſaved: But the Church in the three or four firſt Ages at leaſt was ſaved in that Catholike Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, which now is called the Reformed or Proteſtant Religion: Therefore this is a ſafe way to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>I mention not the former Ages as if all other fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Ages had come to heaven by any other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, then the former; but 1. becauſe in them alone there is a ſufficient proof of the Major Propoſition: None could be ſaved in it, eſpecially not ſo many Ages of the pureſt times, if it were not a ſafe way. 2. Becauſe ſome Popiſh Errors began among the worſer ſort of Ambitious, Superſtitious Prelates to creep in betimes; and Popery it ſelf appeared in the world ſoon after the ſix hundredth yeer, and was openly eſtabliſhed about the thouſandth yeer. And according to the degrees of corruption in the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61063:36"/>
Church there was a greater difficulty of ſalvation, becauſe more impediments: but ſtill thoſe that were ſaved, were all ſaved in and by the ſame Religion of the former Ages; and if they were ſaved in any Corruption, yet not <hi>By</hi> it, but <hi>from</hi> it, or againſt it.</p>
               <p>As for the proof of the Minor as it requireth a full volume of it ſelf, to produce the particular Teſtimonies of the Fathers for us, ſo is it already done in many Volumes: And becauſe the continual clamor of the Papiſt, is, that Antiquity is on their ſide, I ſhall anon diſprove them in the fundamenta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Believers, and all that, the Proteſtants receive.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to them, were a true Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7. and all the Doctrine that <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to them we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> telleth the Elders of <hi>Epheſus, Act.</hi> 20.27. that he had not ſhunned to declare to them the whole councel of God: and this is ſummed up in <hi>[Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance toward God, and Faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt] verſ.</hi> 21. And whatſoever <hi>Paul</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to theſe <hi>Epheſians</hi> or any other Churches or perſons, we believe.</p>
               <p>But what ſhould we talk any more with ſuch an arrogant unreaſonable ſort of men, that dare main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that the belief of all the Holy Scripture is not large enough to ſalvation. Atheiſts and Infidels ſay of the Scripture, that it is too big to be all true: And Papiſts ſay that it is not big enough to bring a man to heaven that believeth and obeyeth it. Shall the Holy Ghoſt endite a Volume as big as the Bible, and when he hath done ſhall any pretending to be Chriſtians, perſwade the world that he that believeth all this, ſhall be damned if he believe not the cloſet. Traditions which the <hi>Romane</hi> Biſhop pretendeth to be the keeper of?</p>
               <p>Nay ſee the ſtrange contradictions of this giddy fiction! They lock up this Scripture it ſelf from the common people in an unknown tongue: They damne the tranſlating of it as the root of all Hereſies, and burn men to aſhes for uſing the Bible; when they cannot keep it unknown any longer, they tranſlate it themſelves as far as they can to their own advantage and put it forth with their perverting Annotations; and yet when they have all done, they condemne any
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61063:40"/>
that read it without a ſpecial licence from their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary: which in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time grant to avoid ſuſpicions; but in <hi>Spaine, Italy,</hi> &amp;c. too few if any at all. And when they have written voluminouſly to prove that the Scriptures are not neceſſary to the people for ſalvation, and that Ignorance is the mother of devotion, they come back again, and diſpute againſt the Proteſtants, that the whole Scripture is not ſufficient to ſalvation, and he that believes but the Scriptures is not in a ſafe way to ſalvation. It ſeems then that the Popes Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons are more neceſſary then the Scripture: For a man may be ſaved without the knowledge of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but not without the knowledge of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Pope: Yes, that he may too: if ſome of them miſtake not, if they will but implicitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Catholike Church, and that the Pope is the infallible ſoveraign of the Chriſtian world, and believe ſome Articles of the Creed upon his credit, he may be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Scripture or Canons, ſo he be but ready to believe and obey whatever ſhall be offered to him by the Pope for the time to come.</p>
               <p>Moreover Chriſt and his Apoſtles do frequently promiſe Remiſſion and ſalvation to all that truely Repent, that love God in Chriſt, that mortifie the fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but all this do the Proteſtants, and their Religion teacheth them to do it. <hi>Paul</hi> concludeth that, <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jeſus, that walk not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit,</hi> Rom. 8.11. But the Proteſtants are in Chriſt Jeſus, and their Religion teacheth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth them ſo to walk: therefore there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them (that do ſo) and they may with

the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. Challenge all the Papiſts in the world. It is God that juſtifieth, who ſhall condemne us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> telleth <hi>Timothy</hi> that the holy Scriptures are able to make him wiſe to ſalvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. therefore they may make us alſo wiſe to ſalvation. And he addeth, that <hi>[All Scripture is given by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto all good works,]</hi> verſ. 16, 17. It were endleſs to recite all that proveth the ſalvation of them that believe and obey the holy Scriptures. But this all true Proteſtants do. I ſhall therefore leave this taske, and next hear what the Papiſts can ſay to the contrary, and what they are able to produce to prove that we are not in a ſafe way to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. There is but one ſafe way to Heaven: The Proteſtant Religion is not that one way: Therefore not a ſafe way. The Minor is proved thus: That Religion which the Church hath owned from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles dayes till now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is that one way: The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion is not that which the Church hath ſo owned: therefore it is not that one Religion. The Minor is proved by parts: 1. As to Doctrine, 2. as to Diſcipline, 3. as to worſhip. 1. The Church ever ſince the Apoſtles dayes, hath maintained the Doctrines of, 1. Free-will to good or evil, 2. of Predeſtination upon foreſeen faith, 3. of mans me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, 4. of Juſtification by Inherent Grace, 5. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the certain Perſeverance of all the Juſtified, and conſequently againſt their certainty of ſalvation.

6. Vowed Chaſtity and Monaſtical Life. In Diſcipline the Church ever held, 1. The Popes Supremacy and Univerſal Juriſdiction; 2. The Government by Biſhops over Presbyters: 3.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To the Major Propoſition of the main Argument, I anſwer. The word <hi>[ſafe]</hi> referreth to ſome Danger that we are ſafe from: The way may be called ſafe therefore, either in reſpect of ſin or damnation: Alſo this way may be called <hi>[one]</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Eſſentials of Religion, or elſe in reſpect of ſome inferior truths and duties, that are not of abſolute neceſſity to ſalvation. And ſo I ſay that there is but one Religion as to the Eſſential and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary points, in which a man can be ſafe from Damnation. And there is but one Religion as comprehending all the Integral parts, in which a man can be ſafe from ſin: But yet that Religion which in the Eſſentials and Abſolutely neceſſary points is but one, may yet conſiſt with errors in lower and leſſer things in the minds of thoſe that hold it; and yet be a ſafe way to ſalvation, though not ſo ſafe as to freemen from all ſin. And conſequently there may be differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces among true Chriſtians that ſhall be ſaved, though there be nothing but perfect Harmony in the entire
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61063:42"/>
Doctrine of Chriſtian Religion as delivered from Chriſt and his Spirit: Becauſe no man holds that Doctrine entirely and perfectly without any error or ignorance, and therefore there will be much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among thoſe that ſhall be ſaved. To the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor of the Pro-ſyllogiſme, I anſwer, Implicitely and in Generals the Church hath owned the perfect truth in all ages, becauſe it hath Believed that all that God ſaith is true, and that the Scripture is his word: But explicitely and particularly the Church hath not held all the truth of Religion, in any one age ſince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. For every man on earth hath been Ignorant, and the moſt knowing men erroneous in ſome things: ſeeing we are all imperfect, and here know but in part. And ſo one particular Church might erre in one thing, and another in another thing, as the differences about Eaſter, Rebaptizing, the Millennium, Infants Communicating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhew they did. And of the ſame Church one Member might erre in one thing and another in another thing: it being as certain that no two men on the earth are in all things of the ſame minde, as that none on earth are perfect in knowledge. To the Minor I anſwer, that the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on called Proteſtant is the ſame in all points abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to ſalvation which the Church hath ſtill owned! And in other inferior points, the Churches having not been all or alwayes of one minde, ſome ages were more pure, and others more corrupt: The Proteſtant Religion is neerer to that of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er times then the Papiſts is: It is the ſame in the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials; it is the neereſt it in the Integrals; it is more remote from latter corruptions introduced in times more remote from the Apoſtolical pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:61063:42"/>To the particular inſtances of our differences from the former Churches, I anſwer particularly. 1. For Free will to God, if you mean a natural freedome, which is [the wills ſelf-determining Power] ſo the Proteſtants maintain it as well as the Fathers. If you mean a moral freedom from ill-inclining habits, which is properly a right-diſpoſition, ſo the Fathers maintained it not.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Scultetus</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> and others might miſtake the Fathers ſence and think that they ſpoke of moral Freedom, when they ſpoke but of natural, which is inſeparable from the will. And its like that they did ſo, ſeeing the Fathers maintained Original ſin, which is that pravity of humane nature, which is clean contrary to moral Free-will. 2. And if the Fathers were for a Free-will in a moral-Ethical ſence, ſo is one part of the Proteſtants as much as they were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if they were in the right, ſo are thoſe Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants? If in the wrong then the other part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants are in this, in the right. 3. This is a point that men may differ in, as much as the Fathers did from us, and yet be in a ſafe way to ſalvation. 4. The Dominicans and the Jeſuites differ about it as much as we and the Fathers; yea, they cannot yet agree, what natural free-will is. 2. For Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon foreſeen faith. <note n="*" rend="inter">In this the Ancients differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among themſelves <hi>Auſtin</hi> and his followers being for abſolute Predeſtination and for Reprobation upon fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen unbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We confeſs that men are Elected to Glory and Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from guilt, upon foreſeen faith: But we ſay withall that they are Elected to that faith; and that God did foreſee it as a thing which he intended to give, and not as a thing which corrupted unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate nature would produce. 3. And we ſay alſo, that this is a point that men may differ in that yet are in a ſafe way to ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to the point of mans merits, we ſay; that the Fathers differed from us but in word and not indeed: It ſeemed good to them to call every moral aptitude or Ordination <hi>ad Praemium,</hi> that is, the Rewardableneſs of our actions, by the name of merit; and every Rewardable work meritorious. We thinke it fitteſt to forbear this name. This Verbal difference makes not two diſtinct Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As to the point of Juſtification, we confeſs that the Fathers commonly called that Juſtification which we now call Sanctification. And we our ſelves maintain that Sanctification doth conſiſt in Inherent Graces This difference therefore being but verbal, the Religion and the way to ſalvation is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the ſame.</p>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61063:44"/>
and therefore we appeal to the Scripture. But yet we know that theſe are not points of abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to ſalvation; ſo that whether thoſe Churches, or we were miſtaken, yet is our Religion the ſame, and both they, and we in a ſafe way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For matters of Government and Diſcipline we ſay 1. That we undertake to manifeſt it as cleare as the light, that the Popes Supreme Headſhip, and univerſal juriſdiction, is a novelty introduced above ſix hundred years after Chriſt. 2. For Dioceſane Epiſcopacy and their ordination, ſome of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches do own it: But it is not a matter ſo neceſſary to Salvation, as that all men that will be ſaved muſt needs be of one minde in it. 3. We confeſs and maintain the neceſſity of true Penitence and ſuch confeſſion of ſin as is neceſſary to manifeſt Penitence to the Church after a notorious ſcandal: and of confeſſion to thoſe that we have wronged: and of private confeſſion to our Paſtors, in caſe that we cannot have a through cure of our wounds, or comfort to our conſciences without it. Laſtly, as for the Ceremonies mentioned which the former Churches uſed, and as for the bare name of a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Altar (while they agreed with us in ſence) we take them not to be matters of ſo great moment, as muſt make them and us of two Religions; as if both were not in a ſafe way to ſalvation. The beſt men on earth may differ in as great a matter as one of theſe: and if they in a miſtaken zeal ſhall depart from the Apoſtles, ſo that we cannot imitate both the Apoſtles and them, we had rather of the two leave them then the Apoſtles; yet holding with them ſtill in the maine.</p>

               <p>But we have been too long on this: let us come to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61063:59"/>
the confuters next untruth; and that is [That the <hi>Grecians,</hi> &amp;c. do in no one point agree with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants as ſuch] what hath been ſaid doth ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhame that fiction.</p>
               <p>But he inſtanceth in our differences: And 1. he ſaith [<hi>The</hi> Grecians <hi>hold one ſupreme head of the whole Church under Chriſt</hi>] <hi>Repl.</hi> An immodeſt ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to uphold a cauſe thats like it.</p>

ſence that [we are Juſtified by Works, and not by faith onely] for in <hi>James</hi> his ſence we maintain it; elſe we ſhould deny the Scripture: The queſtion is not therefore abſolutely, whether we are Juſtified by Works? but, In what ſence we are, and in what not? We ſay that Chriſt is the onely Satisfier of Gods Juſtice and Meriter of Righteouſneſs; and that Faith is the onely Receiving Condition; and that the Works of the Law that <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth have no hand in it; and that the Works of Grace which <hi>James</hi> takes in, are but conditions without which our Juſtification (begun without them) ſhall not be continued, and of our fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Abſolution or Juſtification in Judgement; and ſo are but a Particular, and not an Univerſall or Legall Righteouſneſſe.

               <p n="5">5. He ſaith <hi>[They maintain Freewill, even in the beſt actions. You not] Repl.</hi> Freewill is either 1.

Moral, and that is 1. Political, when a Governor gives the ſubject leave to do a thing; and ſo we maintain that God giveth our Wills Freedom to all good, and to no evil: Or 2. Ethical, which is nothing but the right inclination and Habits of the will with the abſence of the contrary Habits: And ſo we ſay that, the better men are, the Freer, that is, the better are their Wills: And the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted have not this Freewill: nor the converted in perfection till they come to Glory: For the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

is the Goodneſs. And ſeeing the Will ſo far Free Ethically as it is Good, Vertuous or Holy, the Queſtion then is, Whether every mans Will be Good and Holy? which I am conceited you will not dare to affirme. A covetous man, a drunkard, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

If you know of any thing elſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Freewill beſides theſe three before mentioned, we ſhould be glad to know it too.

               <p>Why you'l ſay, perhaps, that its here, That we deny the will to have that <hi>Indifferency</hi> which you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, as to oppoſite objects. But we are loath to ſight with you in the Dark. Do you mean by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency</hi> an Indifferency of Natural Power, or an indifferency of inclination or Habite? The firſt we do not deny: The will is a natural faculty that hath naturally no determination to One, where many means are propounded, but is undetermined, and hath a natural Power to determine it ſelf to either: But yet you know the Wills Natural Power is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed according to inclining Objects and Habits: And

               <p>The ſecond Chapter is the meer ebullition of foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh malice, deſerving no reply to thoſe that do not deſire to be deceived. He would prove that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe laxe principles of our charity, we may agree with Jews, Turkes, Mahometans! As if we needed a diſpute to prove that theſe are no Chriſtians, and that the <hi>Greeks, Abaſſines,</hi> &amp;c. are: But ſuch diſputes do the Papiſts put us upon.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop had concluded in his Sermon, that [<hi>If we ſhould ſurvey the ſeveral profeſſions of Chriſtianity that have any large ſpread in any part of the world, and put by the points wherein they differ one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and gather into one body the reſt of the Articles wherein all generally agree, we ſhould finde ſo much truth in them, as being joyned with holy obedience may be ſufficient to bring a man to everlaſting ſalvation; neither have we cauſe to doubt but as many as do walk according to this rule, neither overthrowing that which they have builded by ſuperinducing any damnable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies thereupon, nor otherwiſe vitiating their holy faith, with a leud and wicked converſation, Peace ſhall be upon them and Mercy and upon the</hi> Iſrael <hi>of God.</hi>]</p>
               <p>And what hath the Confuter to ſay againſt this? Why firſt he begins with the Sacraments, to try whether thoſe commonly agreed on may ſave. And here he firſt tells us, that <hi>[Some Churches are for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſome for three, and ſome for two, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> the nominal differences about the word Sacrament be firſt laid by (unleſs you think that word neceſſary to ſalvation) and then we ſhall the better ſee what real difference remaineth. 2. The two Sacraments then are confeſſed
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61063:66"/>
by all, and the uſe of the reſt which you call Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: This much (in its own place) then may ſave, where no more is confeſſed. 3. You vainly put in the <hi>excluſion of more,</hi> for thats none of the things that all agree on: All agree that there are two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: and thoſe may ſave. But all agree not that there is but two. This man therefore ſeems to dote; when he ſhould gather up the common agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments according to the Biſhops propoſal, he gathers up the diſagreements, or vainly pretendeth that we agree in nothing. What, do not you confeſs that Baptiſme and the Lords Supper are Sacraments? and do not we do ſo too?</p>
               <p>Next he comes to the uſe of Baptiſme, and ſaith that [<hi>The</hi> Romanes <hi>and</hi> Greeks, <hi>ſay, that there is no other uſe of baptiſme but to waſh away ſin: The Proteſtants of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Geneva <hi>ſay, that it is no laver of Regeneration at all, but onely a ſeal of Gods promiſe made to the party baptized: and that the childe unbaptized may be ſaved and the baptized damned.</hi>] <hi>Repl.</hi> 1. You make your ſelves (much more the <hi>Greeks</hi>) worſe then you are. Do not your own maintain that Baptiſm admitteth into the Church and granteth many other priviledges, beſides waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away ſin. 2. We ſay, that to the children of promiſe it doth ſecondarily and by obſignation waſh away (or pardon) ſin by way of obſignation and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne exhibition, as the promiſe doth primarily as a deed of gift or legal Grant: as alſo that in the ſame way it ſecondarily conveyeth further Grace accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding to the capacity of the ſubject, and admitteth into the Church. And all this is commonly confeſt by your ſelves and all Chriſtians of the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Abaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine</hi> Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This much alone without your
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61063:66"/>
additions is as much (at leaſt) as is neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be believed concerning baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Next he cometh to the Lords Supper, and ſaith, that one party holdeth the real preſence and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not? And what of this? Doth that prove the inſufficiency of what all are agreed on? what we hold, you deny not: We hold the ſignifying, and ſealing and exhibiting uſe of the Sacrament (though we deny Tranſubſtantiation) And dare you deny theſe? We hold that it is the commemoration of the ſacrifice of Chriſts body and blood offered once on the Croſs for the ſins of the world: and that it is a means of Church-communion: And dare you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny theſe? Lay by your Additions, and that which we are all agreed in is enough to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>His next inſtance is about Faith; Becauſe we ſay, that Hiſtorical faith may be in Devils, and Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous faith in the wicked, and <hi>Calvin</hi> defineth juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith to be a firme and certain knowledge of the love of God to us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> that it is an undoubted perſwaſion of the pardon of our ſins and adoption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this faith is by the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> condemned to the pit of hell, therefore he concludeth that there is no ſaving faith common to Papiſts and Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Here again you vainly and fallaciouſly bring in the diſagreements, and over paſs the agreements. 1. We are agreed that all thoſe which the Proteſtants call the Canonical books of Scripture are the word of God: and true, and particularly all the Articles of the Creed, and many things more: We are agreed that Chriſt and life is offered by the Univerſal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the Goſpel to all that hear it: and that all muſt firſt believe the truth of this promiſe and then
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61063:67"/>
heartily conſent to the offer and accept the benefit, and alſo believe and fear the threatning, and joyn ſincere love and obedience to all this. This we are all agreed in: And this is certainly ſaving to all that ſincerely believe and do as they thus profeſs. But then, whether Hiſtorical faith be common or not? whether aſſurance or ſtrong perſwaſion of pardon, be faith, or juſtifying faith, with other the like, theſe we are not agreed in; and without theſe we may be ſaved.</p>
               <p>The next exception is only this, The Biſhop tells us not what be thoſe Hereſies that deſtroy this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faith. <hi>Rep.</hi> And doth that croſs his former charitable concluſion? What? becauſe he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes not an alien task? Why in general, they are any thing that is ſo held as that the common Articles of faith cannot be held with it, and that practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.</p>
               <p>The ſum of the next paſſage, is this [<hi>That its ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd for us to call them the true Church, or ſay they may be ſaved, when we have charged them with ſo much error and idolatry,</hi> &amp;c] <hi>Repl.</hi> 1. We onely ſay that you are a polluted part of the Church. 2. If your ſalvation be made ſo difficult by your errors look you to that: The Biſhops concluſion (of the ſufficiency of the <hi>communiter credita</hi>) is nevertheleſs ſound, though you deſtroy your ſelves by your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt additions. 3. Multitudes among you believe not your Infallibility, Tranſubſtantiation, and many the like errors. 4. Many that behold them as opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ſpeculatively, may yet hold the contrary truthes practically, not diſcerning the contradiction.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Popery</hi> is a certain farrago, a mixture of many grievous errors in the doctrine of Faith, Government and Worſhip, expreſſed in their Authorized writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61063:68"/>
eſpecially in their decretals and Councils, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the Chriſtian Religion which they profeſs; the whole being denominated from that one falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is, the Univerſall Biſhop, and Viſible Head of the Univerſal Church and Chriſts Vicar-General on earth, and that only is the Catholike Church, and thoſe only Catholiks that ſo believe.</p>
               <p>Where note 1. That the Papiſts profeſſing to be Chriſtians, do firſt own the ſubſtance of Chriſtian doctrine, and then corrupt it, and contradict it by this fardle of their own inventions ſuperadded. They profeſs to believe the holy Scriptures to be the word of God, and to be true: every Book that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (and more) They profeſs to believe all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the ancient Creeds commonly called the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, the <hi>Nicene,</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinopolitane.</hi> It is not the Chriſtianity or true doctrine which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, which we call <hi>Popery.</hi> 2. It is therefore onely their own invented corruptions, by which they contradict the Chriſtian verity which they profeſs, which we call <hi>Popery.</hi> 3. Note, That the common denominating corruption, is the forementioned do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Popes Univerſal Epiſcopacy and Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or a ſupreamacy at leaſt, if not Infallibility: and that the Catholike Church, and the <hi>Romane</hi> Church is all one: and the Pope is the viſible center of its Unity. 4. Note alſo that as to the reſt of their corruptions, they agree not among themſelves what is to be eſteemed of their faith or Religion, and what not: and therefore it cannot be expected that we ſhould give you an exact enumeration of the points of their faith, and ſo a compleat deſcription of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, which is ſuch a ſelf-contradicting unreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

But their errors may be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted into theſe three rankes. 1 Thoſe that are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by the Pope and his (ſuppoſed) general Councel: Theſe they all receive and own. 2. Thoſe that are eſtabliſhed by the Popes Decretals without a Council. Theſe ſome own as points of their faith, and ſome reject them. I will not adde as the third<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thoſe that are eſtabliſhed by a Council without the Pope; not becauſe there never was a Council that diſſented from him in Good, but becauſe it is a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter at leaſt to find any Council that did go beyond or without him in Evil, or erred without his Approbation. 3. The third ſort therefore ſhall be thoſe opinions that are commonly maintained by their moſt Approved Writers which are publiſhed in books that are licenſed and commended by the Popes Authorized agents, but are not determined by the Pope or his Council. Theſe though they contend for, and lay great weight on them in their diſputations, yet dare they not own them as any part of the matter of their faith, leſt they ſeem to be what they are; divided and mutable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A man would think that thoſe volumnious hot diſputes about Divine things, did intimate that the Authors did <hi>fide divin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If you ask me, which be thoſe doctrines which they take for points of faith, which we call Popery; I muſt refer you to their Decretals and Councils on one ſide, and Gods word on the other; and all the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61063:69"/>
Doctrines in thoſe their Canons or determinations that are againſt the word of God, are the doctrines which we mean by this name. If they do lay greater ſtreſs upon any one point than others, its likely to be on thoſe that are put into their Creeds and Vows, and therefore I ſhall onely recite the latter half of their <hi>Tridentine</hi> Creed, ſeeing they will own that or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now here is a double ſafety conſiderable in Doctrines anſwerable to a double danger.

Multitudes of people while they take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon termes in Divinity in a wrong ſence, do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Propoſitions which by plain conſequence, if not directly contradict the Fundamentals according to the proper genuine ſence of the words; when yet in the ſence as they miſtake and miſuſe them in, there is no contradiction. Even as many on the other ſide, do hold the Chriſtian verity in words, who in ſence deny it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 7. We have great reaſon to think that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny millions of the Laity among the Papiſts, if not the far greateſt part of them, do not cordially em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the moſt of the Popiſh corruptions in doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, nor the moſt dangerous of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they do not underſtand them, and ſo cannot ſo much as ſpeculatively receive them. It is not one of a hundred, perhaps of many hundreds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that knows all contained in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> alone, much leſs in all the reſt of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61063:72"/>
Council, and Canons and cuſtomes wherein they place their Religion. Nay perhaps its but few of their Clergy that know this comparatively. So that it is but an implicite general belief that they can give to ſuch Canons as are unknown, which is not a belief of the particular doctrines contained in them, as ſuch.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe (I hope among moſt or many of them) they are firſt taught the Creed, the Lords Prayer, and ten Commandments (or at leaſt the Creed, and Decalogue, though the Lords Prayer be uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually taught them in Latine) which contain the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of Chriſtian faith and practice: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have reaſon to hope that theſe are deeper in their minds then any contradictory doctrines: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they muſt have ſo much time afterward, to build upon this foundation their hay and ſtubbles, that we have great reaſon to hope that it is but few that throughly underſtand or entertaine them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe we know that the generality of the people, or a very great part of them, do look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Clergy as having a carnal ſelf-intereſt to carry on, and ſo far have hard and different thoughts of them; though they are yet captivated by them too much.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe we ſee that the Pope is faine to keep them in ſubjection by the moſt cruel force of ſecular power: by the bloody inquiſition, tormenting and burning them, or raſing wars againſt them to ruine them; or elſe by worldly honors, dignities, and riches to entice and enſnare them; which were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs if he could carry it by the cogent evidence of his doctrines or their underſtandings.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:61063:72"/>5. Becauſe we ſee by experience, that even here with us among their few moſt zealous and voluntary Proſelites, it is but very few that call themſelves <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Catholikes, or Papiſts, that indeed know what Popery is: Nay moſt of them, if you do but name ſome points of the Popiſh faith, will tell you that you ſlander them; and they hold no ſuch thing. I have talked with many of the Laity, and find very few that will own the doctrine of mans Merits, but profeſs to reſt on the Merits of Chriſt onely: The like I could ſay of other points: By which it is plain that the Prieſts do hide from the Laity ſo much of the venome of their doctrine as they think will prove di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſtful to them, and dare not let them know the worſt.</p>
               <p>

Theſe perſons before deſcribed, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that part of the Clergy, who caſt off much of the <hi>Romane</hi> corruptions, and yet adhere to their party, are not <hi>full</hi> and <hi>compleat Papiſts,</hi> but onely Papiſts <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> incompleat, and of a lower ſort, and ſo are not in ſo great danger of damnation as the reſt: even as the Scab is not ſo bad as the Morphew, nor the Morphew ſo mortal as the Elephantiaſis, or the full Leproſie; though all are of kindred one to another.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 11. Whoſoever is ſaved among the Papiſts; whether he be more or leſs tainted with theirs errors, it is not <hi>By Popery</hi> that he is ſaved, but <hi>from Popery,</hi> or againſt it by the Chriſtian faith. So that if a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt may be ſaved, it muſt be as a Chriſtian, and not as a Papiſt: Popery and Chriſtianity having ſome contrariety; ſo that it muſt be by the prevalency and predominency of the Chriſtian faith againſt Popery if ever he be ſaved. If a lyer might be ſaved it muſt not be by lying, but by faith in Chriſt and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. If a Leper, or one that hath the Plague, or the like diſeaſes, may live, it muſt not be by the Leproſie or Plague that they muſt live; but by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural vigor and the help of Medicine by which they are preſerved from the killing power of theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,</p>
               <p>And here you may take notice, what a fond and vain deluſion it is, by which the Prieſts do perſwade the poor people that their Religion is a ſafer way to heaven then ours, even becauſe that we confeſs a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61063:73"/>
Papiſt may be ſaved, but they affirm that a Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant cannot be ſaved. For 1. Some Proteſtants think they may be ſaved, and ſome deny it. 2.

Their condemning of all Proteſtants doth make themſelves worſe, but it makes us never the worſe, nor our caſe ever the more dangerous. Chriſt hath told us that all men ſhall know us to be his diſciples, by Loving one another, and hath bid us, judge not that we be not judged, for with what judgement we judge, we ſhall be judged: and <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that charity thinketh not evil, but hopeth all things: Is it then a good &amp; Chriſtian arguing to ſay that they are ſafer then we, becauſe they are more c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Suppoſe that a company ſhut up in a Peſthouſe, being raging mad with the Plague, or otherwiſe diſtempered in their brain, ſhould cry out, that all the Town are ſick and will certainly dye, except themſelves. Were it wiſe reaſoning now to ſay [You confeſs that ſome of thoſe that are ſick in the Peſthouſe may eſcape; but they ſay that none of you that are out can eſcape, therefore it is ſafer to be with them then with you.] Even ſuch is the reaſoning of the Popiſh Prieſts in the preſent caſe. It is the diſeaſe of Popery that of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61063:74"/>
its own nature cauſeth them to condemne all the world except themſelves: And it is becauſe we are free from their diſeaſe, that makes us not ſo raſh and haſty in condemning them: But yet as charitable as we are to them, we are ſo charitable withall to our ſelves, that we would not be in their caſe, for all the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 12. We may well conclude therefore that whether a Papiſt may be ſaved or not, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely Popery is no ſafe way to Salvation.</p>
               <p>If a cup of Poiſon be tempered for the killing of men, and one drinks it all, and dyeth, another drinks almoſt all, and dyeth, another drinks leſſe, and yet uſing no remedy dyeth, another drinks but a little, or taking more, yet uſeth ſome effectual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and ſo with much ado ſcapeth death.

               <p>I come now to prove the Propoſition laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
               <p>In general 1. Popery is <hi>No</hi> way to ſalvation; Therefore it is no ſafe way. God hath no where preſcribed it as a way to ſalvation; therefore it is not a way to ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the way toward damnation, and from ſalvation; therefore it is no ſafe way to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The proof of all together ſhall be next fetcht from ſome general reaſons drawn from the dangerous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Popery; For if I ſhould deſcend to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular error I muſt be voluminous, and do that which is ſufficiently done by multitudes already.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:61063:74"/>Arg. 1. <hi>Thoſe doctrines which are founded upon a Notorious falſhood, and reſolved into it, are not a ſafe way to Salvation. But ſuch are the doctrines which we call Popery: Therefore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Minor, They are founded on and reſolved into the doctrine of the Popes Infallibility, or at leaſt his Councils: This the Papiſts do confeſs and maintain. But that this is a Notorious falſhood, is evident.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that it is notorious that Popes have erred, and judicially erred, and erred in matters of faith. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is put to anſwer to no leſs then fourty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of erring Popes; and how ſhamefully or ſhameleſly he doth it, any Learned man that will ſearch the records and peruſe the caſe, may ſoon diſcover.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It is notorious that Councils have erred. I ſhall not now intermix my Teſtimonies to interrupt the plain courſe which I have begun, but rather give you the proof of all this diſtinctly by it ſelf in the next diſputation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Papiſts themſelves confeſs this that we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm. I mean, One part of them do confeſs that the Pope may err (as the <hi>French</hi>) and the other (the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi>) confeſs that a Council may erre. One ſaith the Infallibility is not ſeated in the Pope; and the other that it is not ſealed in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, particular or general, of which ſee <hi>Bellarmine de Conciliis lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.

do croſs the Popes inſtructions. 3. Yea if the Legates have no certain Inſtructions, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and all they, may conſent in error: And he proves the two former by the inſtance of the ſecond Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and the <hi>Conſtantinopolitane</hi> Council in the time of Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the firſt, which erred, ſaith he, becauſe the Popes Legates followed not his inſtructions. The third he proves by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Baſil Seſſ.</hi> 2. which together with the Popes Legate did by common conſent Decree, that the Council is above the Pope, which now (ſaith <hi>Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p n="4">4. Some Popes themſelves have confeſſed that they are not the ſeat or chief ſubject of the infallibility: As <hi>Adrian</hi> the ſixth who hath wrote his judgement of it, that the Pope may err out of Council. And in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion we ſhall do the Pope much wrong if we ſhall not believe him when he ſpeaks the truth, and tells us that he is fallible. Did <hi>Bellarmine</hi> better know Pope <hi>Adrians</hi> underſtanding, then the Pope knew his own? Surely I muſt do as I would be done by: and if any man ſhould perſwade me that I know that which I do not know, or that I am infallible, when I know my ſelf ſubject to error. I ſhould confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently expect that all men would rather believe me of my ſelf then believe another of me that ſpeaks the contrary: And ſo will I believe Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> that he was fallible.</p>
               <p>But of this more in the next diſputation; where you ſhall have fuller proof.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. <hi>If Popery do build even the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it ſelf (as held by them) on a foundation that is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly uncertain, or elſe certainly falſe, then is it no ſafe way to ſalvation: For it would extirpate Chriſtianity it ſelf.</hi> But the Antecedent is true, as I ſhall thus prove.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are divided and diſagreed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves even their greateſt Learned Doctors about the very foundation of their faith, as I ſhall further ſhew in the next argument: They believe upon the infallible judgement of the Church, and they are not agreed what that Church is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They build the aſſurance of their faith upon ſuch a ground as none of the common people, no nor any Doctors in the world, can have the knowledge of: therefore their faith muſt needs be uncertain. To manifeſt this I ſhall review one leaf that I wrote heretofore on this ſubject in the Preface to the ſecond Part of the <hi>Saints Reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the Authority of the Church they ſay, upon which we muſt believe that the Scriptures are the word of God, and were it not for the Churches au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative affirmation, they would not believe it (ſaith one of them, no more than <hi>Aeſops</hi> Fables) Now ſuppoſe they were agreed what this Church is, and that we now take notice of their more common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it is, all the Biſhops of the Church headed by the Pope, or a General Council approved of and confirmed by the Pope, I would fain know how the faith of any of us that live at a diſtance, yea or of any man living, can be ſure and ſound, when all theſe following particulars muſt be firſt known,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61063:76"/>
before we can have ſuch aſſurance. 1. It muſt be known that God hath given to the Church this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of judging what is his word, and what is a point of faith, and what not: ſo that that is ſo to us, which they judge ſo; or that we are bound by God to believe them. Now which way doth God give the Church this Power? Is it not by Scripture, or unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tradition in their own judgment? And by what means doth he oblige us to Believe the Church in ſuch determinations? It muſt be alſo by Scripture or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Tradition by their own confeſſion: For if they fly to univerſal Tradition, and natural obligation, they give up their cauſe, and let go their Authoritative Tradition and Obligation, as from their <hi>Roman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> Church. So that a man muſt (according to their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) believe that the word of God (written or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written) hath given Power to the Church to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what is the word of God before he can believe the word of God, or know it to be the word of God: that is, He muſt know and believe the word of God before he can know and believe it.

               <p>We need to go no further for the proof of the Antecedent then to what is ſaid already. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly maintain that we muſt receive our faith and the Scriptures upon the Authority of the infallible Church: and they are not yet agreed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor ever like to be what that infallible Church is. And the difference is not with a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable diſſenters, but in their main body. The Papiſts of <hi>France</hi> maintain that it is a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

Council that is infallible, and that the Pope is fallible: The <hi>Italians</hi> maintain that a General Council is fallible, and the Pope is infallible. Some others think that both of them are falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeparated, but both infallible when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur. And ſome think that they are both infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble though ſeparated. If the Church be the foundation, and all muſt be received upon its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible authority, then no man can be ſaved that knows not which this infallible Church is: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Italians,</hi> one part or the other of them do erre in their very fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, when one ſaith, <hi>This</hi> is the ſubject of infallibility, and the other ſay, <hi>This is it.</hi> And if a Pope or General Councel differ, to whom muſt the people hearken? One part of them ſaith that the Pope is above the Council; and others of them ſay the Council is above the Pope, and of this mind have been General Councils themſelves, as the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and of this mind <hi>Bellarmine</hi> names, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Cameracenſis,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Cuſanus, Joh.

               <p>What a ſtrange impudency then is it of theſe men, to make the ſilly deluded people among us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that they are all of one mind, and its we that are divided: when as they are never likely to agree in their very principles and great funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, <hi>Who it is that is the infallible Judge</hi>? And till men know <hi>Who it is,</hi> what the better are they know, that ſuch a judge there is ſeeing that the ſpecies exiſteth only in the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, and no man can believe him, or apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him as the infallible judge, till he know that it is he indeed that is ſuch.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:61063:82"/>Seeing then according to their own principles, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>French</hi> Papiſts or the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Papiſts muſt be in the way to damnation, how ſhall we know which it is and which to joyn our ſelves to with any ſafety? Were it not for weakening the Popes intereſt, they would burn the <hi>French</hi> Papiſts as Hereticks as well as us.</p>
               <p>Arg. 4. <hi>If Popery be a new deviſed way to heaven ſuch as the Apoſtles never knew nor the Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them for many a hundred year (in the main parts of Popery) then is it no ſafe way to ſalvation</hi>: But the Antecedent is true: therefore ſo is the conſequent.</p>
               <p>The conſequence they will not deny, that which the Apoſtles &amp; the Primitive Churches went in is only the ſafe way to heaven (for there are not many ſafe ways) But that which the Papiſts as Papiſts go in, is not that which the Apoſtles and Primitive Church went in: therefore it is not the ſafe way. And that the Apoſtles and firſt Churches knew not Popery, but it is a new Religion, or new corruption of Religion, appeareth by comparing the particular points with Scripture and Antiquity: For Scripture which is the trueſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, it may give any indifferent man juſt cauſe of ſuſpicion that the Papiſts do ſo obſtinately refuſe to be tryed by it; which plainly ſhewes that they take it not to be on their ſide. And for the Councils and Fathers, for the firſt three hundred years or much more, they ordinarily ſcorn us for mentioning them to this end, becauſe they ſay they wrote not of the points now in controverſie, and therefore are unfit to determine them. But did not thoſe ages take up their faith on the ſame grounds as we ſhould do now?
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61063:82"/>
And can they be all ſilent about the onely ground of faith? If the Pope of <hi>Romes</hi> infallible authority had been the ground, would they not have told us ſo? How could they convert the infidels, and confirm believers without acquainting them with the grounds of their Faith? And what they took for the grounds their writings ſhew. Nay he that ſhall faithfully and impartially peruſe the Writers of the firſt three-or four or ſeven hundred years, is blind if he ſee not the novelty of Popery, and in particular of the Popes infallibility, univerſal headſhip and Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and his pretended authoriry to be the Judge of controverſies, with the reſt of his uſurpations. Our Divines, <hi>Chamier, Jewel, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher, Field,</hi> and many others have manifeſted this ſo largely, that it would be ſuperfluous for me to do it after them, and ſomewhat will neceſſary fall in with the next diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>
               <p>I do not deny but that many ceremonies, and many controverted doctrines were very ancient: as the uſe of Chriſme, and a white garment, and milke and honey to the newly baptized, exorciſme, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation by impoſition of hands, the Memories of the Martyrs, with prayers and praiſes at their graves, or places of ſuffering; the oft uſe of the ſigne of the Croſs, the obſervation of <hi>Lent</hi> (as well as <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſontide</hi>) not to kneel on the Lords day, not to eat things ſtrangled or bloody, ſo the doctrines of the power of Free-will, and predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon foreſeen faith, and the miſuſe of the terms <hi>[Merit and Juſtification]</hi> the denyal of the perſeverance of all Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were too early and commonly entertained. But theſe be not the things that we call Popery, nor wherein the great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61063:83"/>
between us, and the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> doth conſiſt. But as for the great points in difference between the Papiſts and us, it is ſo evident in all antiquity, that Popery is a novelty, and that they have deviſed a new way to heaven which the Apoſtles and the Churches for many hundred years did never know, that onely groſs ignorance of the Churches records, or a willingneſs to be deceived, can keep men from the knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>And here I might eaſily prove what is ſaid of the novelty of Popery, even from the confeſſions of their own moſt learned writers, that ſo they may not ſay, it is concluded from our own miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Antiquity; But that it would ſwell this diſputation beyond the intended bulk and bounds. I ſhall onely give a brief touch in a few points of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which may ſhew you what to think of their charging us with novelty, and of their general pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to Antiquity.</p>
               <p>Of the humane Ordination of Papacy, and its late increaſe beyond its ancient bounds, and the limitation of Eccleſiaſtical Power; I ſhall deſire you to ſee what in the following Diſputation is cited out of their Cardinal <hi>Nicol. Cuſanus,</hi> a man ſo violent for the <hi>Eugenian</hi> faction, that <hi>Aenaenas Sylvius,</hi> afterward Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond lamenteth that ſo learned a man ſhould be the pillar of that Popes cauſe; and a man ſo cloſe to Papal intereſt, and ſo addicted himſelf to domineering, that he oppoſed his Prince <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmund</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and cauſed the ſame Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond to take his part, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> and all his Counſailors, and his ſubjects, for taking this Cardinal priſoner

               <p>The conſequence of the Major will not be denyed; for they confeſs that Chriſts Church is but one; He had not a Church of one ſort for the firſt ages, and a Church of another ſort ſince: though its accidents may vary, yet ſo doth not its eſſence. The Minor I prove thus, That which the Papiſts make to be the Catholike Church, is only all thoſe Chriſtians that acknowledge the Pope to be the univerſal Biſhop and head of the Catholike Church, having univerſal ſupreme juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Mother and Miſtris of all other Churches, and its only a Catholike Church convertible with the <hi>Romane</hi> Church.

We have long ago challenged them to give us the leaſt proof of ſuch a Church in all antiquity, and they give us nothing, but ſuch forced paſſages that are nothing to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that its hard for the moſt charitable rational man to believe that they do indeed believe themſelves, and do not know that they hypocritically endeavor to cheat poor ſouls by their vain cavils. All the Papiſts on earth will never be able to anſwer what our Divines have ſaid already to prove the novelty of their Papal headſhip: nor can all the Popes ſervants in the world bring us one word of currant antiquity for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after Chriſt, to prove that ever ſuch a Church was once dreamed of, as they now call the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Catholike Church. Indeed <hi>Rome</hi> was called then, a Catholike Church, and ſo was <hi>Alexandria, Antioch,</hi> and all that held the Catholike faith, and were not he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical: but it was never known till <hi>Boniface</hi> had u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped the Title of univerſal Biſhop above 600. years after Chriſt (which he procured by <hi>Phocas</hi> a Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that uſurped the Empire when he had ſlain the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Mauritius</hi>) that the <hi>Romane</hi> Church and the Catholike Church was all one, or that it was neceſſary to make any particular Church or perſon Catholike, that they acknowledge the univerſal headſhip and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the <hi>Romane</hi> Pope, much leſs his infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>

               <p>And here I muſt needs annex this obſervation; What a ſhameleſs cheat it is by which the Papiſts do delude the ignorant, perſwading them that theirs is the old Religion, and the ancient Church which hath continued from the Apoſtles without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that we are men of a new Religion, and of a Church that had never a viſible being till the dayes of <hi>Luther, Coſterous</hi> the Jeſuite in the Preface to his <hi>Enchiridion</hi> inſtructeth his deluded novices how to deal with the Proteſtants by urging them with three Queſtions (which we ſhall reſolve anon to his ſhame) and the laſt of them is a challenge to us [To name one man before <hi>Luther</hi> that agreed with us in all things] But we challenge, and moſt confidently challenge all the Papiſts on earth to name one man for three hundred years after Chriſt (I might ſay ſix hundred years) that agreed with them (not in all things but) in their very Articles of Faith, yea in thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We do moſt confidently return on them their own demands? We would know from any of them where their Church was for three hundred (yea for ſix hundred) years after Chriſts birth? And we wonder how they can think to be ſaved in a way that was not known for ſo long time? Do they think themſelves wiſer then Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and all the Chriſtian world for ſo many hundred years. Again we challenge them to ſhew us the leaſt proof that ever there was ſuch a thing for ſo long time, as a Catholike Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible with the <hi>Romane,</hi> and headed by the Pope as the univerſal Biſhop having a univerſal juriſdiction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the reſt, or an infallible Judgement in determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of controverſies in matters of faith. It is none of the leaſt of our Reaſons why we dare not be of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> faction or opinions, called by them their Church and their Religion, becauſe it is ſo new, and we dare not venture our ſouls upon new wayes, nor dare we believe that Chriſt hath two ſorts of Churches eſſentially different ſince his Reſurrection; one ſort before the Popes univerſal headſhip, and the other ſince: nor dare we once imagine that Chriſt had no true Church on earth till Pope <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> would needs be the univerſal Biſhop, or till <hi>Rome</hi> was advanced to the dignity and titles which it doth now uſurpe. I deſire no better iſſue then this
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61063:89"/>
of our difference: Let any Papiſts living bring out their cauſe to the tryal of antiquity, and let them that are of the moſt Ancient Church and Religion, carry the cauſe. If we prove not theirs new and ours the moſt ancient, or if they prove theirs more Ancient then ours (as ſince Chriſts Reſurrection) then we are contented to be of their Church and way.</p>

He that ſhall conſider of all the Chriſtians in the world at this day, who ſubject not themſelves to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and may truly be reputed to be of the Catholike Church, will ſee that the Papiſts are but a ſmall part of the Church: But eſpecially if we conſider them as they were not many ages ago, much more numerous then now they be. The <hi>Grecians,</hi> the <hi>Syrians</hi> called <hi>Melchites,</hi> the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> and

                  <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> the <hi>Georgians,</hi> all of the <hi>Greek</hi> Religion beſides the multitude of the ſame Religion diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed throughout the <hi>Turkes</hi> dominions; alſo the <hi>Abaſſins, Egyptians, Armenians, Jacobites,</hi> who are neer of a mind, and differ from the Papiſts, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not to their authority: Beſides all the Reformed Churches in <hi>Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Hungary, Tranſylvania, Brittain, Ireland, France, Belgia, Helvetia,</hi> and other parts with thoſe in the <hi>Indies</hi>; I ſay conſider of all theſe Chriſtians together and it will appear that the Papiſts are but a few to them, or not neer ſo many as they. But if you further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the ſtate of the Chriſtian world not many ages ago, when the Turkes had not yet ſubdued the Eaſtern parts, and when the <hi>Abaſſian</hi> Empire was much more large, and <hi>Nubia</hi> and other Countries had not revolted, it will appear that we may well ſay that it was but a ſmall part of Chriſtians compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively that did acknowledge the univerſall head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and juriſdiction of the Pope, or ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him: beſides many other points of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in which they differ from him. I know that the Papiſts ſay, that theſe are all either Hereticks or Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and ſo no part of the Catholike Church. But the accuſation of Schiſme is the meer voice of Schiſme, and for Hereſie, its true that all men and Churches have their errors, which yet deſerve not the name of Hereſie: The <hi>Jacobites</hi> and the reſt that are neer them, are afraid of acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two Natures in Chriſt, leſt it lead them to make two perſons with the Neſtorians; but yet they are not plaine Eutichites: and both they and the Neſtorians acknowledge Chriſt to be perfect God and perfect man; only the Neſtorians do amiſs
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61063:90"/>
have theſe two natures, <hi>two perſons</hi>; and that the Euticheans in flying too far from them are afraid to call them two Natures, though they confeſs the Godhead and Manhood to be really diſtinct; yet they ſay that both are as it were conjoyned or coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into one Nature: ſo that wiſe impartial men think that the Eutichites (or at leaſt theſe Chriſtians that are ſo called amiſs by the Papiſts) do but miſuſe the term <hi>Nature</hi> for the term <hi>Perſon,</hi> and ſo deny two <hi>Perſons</hi> onely in ſence, and two <hi>Natures</hi> only in name, and that by the ſame miſuſe of the terms the Neſtorians do affirm two <hi>Natures</hi> onely in ſence, and two <hi>Perſons</hi> in words onely. Of this I deſire the Reader to conſider What <hi>Luther</hi> hath ſaid <hi>de Conciliis</hi> This I muſt needs ſay, that if I did not exerciſe the ſame charity in judging of the Romaniſts, as I do in this excuſe of the Jacobites, and other Chriſtians that are not of their Communion, I ſhould be forced to cenſure the former much deeper then the latter, and if by all their errors I muſt hold the reſt to be Hereticks or Schiſmaticks, I muſt by the ſame meaſure judge the Romaniſts to be doubly Heretical, as I certainly know them to be moſt noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly Schiſmatical. For though I know that they are not ſo barbarous and unlearned as moſt of theſe forementioned Chriſtians, and alſo that they are free from many of their miſtakes, yet withall they have many more in ſtead of them which the other are free from. And for the Proteſtants they are Hereticks only on this ſuppoſition, that the Pope be Judge.</p>
               <p>By this time then it partly appeareth how great a part of the Church of Chriſt the Papiſts do differ from.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:61063:90"/>But yet this is not all, nay the ſmaller part. For if you will but conſider the ſtate of the Church of Chriſt for the firſt three hundred, yea five or ſix hundred years, you will find that the Papiſts do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from them all, even from the whole Church. For then the Popes univerſal Epiſcopacy and juriſdiction was not known in the world (as is ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.)</p>
               <p>All theſe doth the <hi>Romane</hi> party now ſeparate themſeves from: All theſe they do pronounce to be no true Churches or true Chriſtians, but Hereticks and Schiſmaticks: All theſe do they condemn to the pit of Hell. They have now concluded that onely thoſe are of the true Church, that acknowledge the Maſterſhip or univerſal Headſhip of the Pope, and the Miſtrisſhip of the particular <hi>Romane</hi> Church which none of all thoſe forementioned did. They now conclude that none can be ſaved but who are of this (new-framed) Church of theirs.</p>
               <p>Now I do appeal to any reaſonable impartial man alive, whether there be any more notorious Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks on earth, then theſe men; that dare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church the far greateſt part of Chriſts Church on earth at preſent, &amp; the far pureſt, and renounce com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them all, and proclaim them Hereticks or Schiſmaticks, and ſentence them all to the flames of Hell: Yea that dare do the like by all ages of Chriſtians that have gone before them; yea that dare unchurch and damne to Hell the whole Church of Chriſt for many hundred years! For what do they leſs when they unchurch and damne all that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not their new made univerſal Biſhop which the Primitive Church never did? And when they make that to be eſſential to the Catholike Church
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61063:91"/>
which the firſt Catholike Church did never know? I know there be ſome Enthuſiaſts and Anabaptiſts and ſuch giddy perſons, that do as the Papiſts do, condemn all the Churches of Chriſt except themſelves. But yet the Schiſme that they have made hereby is nothing to that which was made by the Papiſts, who have ſet the Chriſtian world into a flame of diſſention, and make it their very buſineſs daily to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What more evident then that the Papiſts have ſeparated from all other Chriſtians in the world? How dare they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the far greateſt part of Chriſtians on earth to eternal torment? yea and (by plain conſequence, though they will not acknowledge it) the whole Church of Chriſt for many hundred years? were it but one ſoul that they ſhould preſume to cenſure, they might well bethink them of an anſwer to <hi>Pauls</hi> Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.

Do the blind Papiſts think that any ſober conſiderate impartial Chriſtian can be of their mind, and damne the moſt of Chriſts Church on earth, meerly becauſe they will not be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> If this Article be ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation, Why do not we find it in any anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61063:91"/>
Creed? Why muſt we not ſay [I believe in the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>] as well as [I believe in God?] Or if indeed it be the Pope and <hi>Romaniſts</hi> that is meant by [the holy Catholike Church] why would not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of the Creed tell us ſo? And why did none of the ancient Churches underſtand and expound it ſo? And why did no age add the word <hi>[Romane]</hi> and call it [the holy <hi>Romane</hi> Catholike Church.]</p>
               <p n="2">2. And then withal, beſides the preſent Schiſme which they have made, they have laid the ground of a perpetual ſchiſme. For they have made a new defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Catholicke Church, and made it another thing then it was before, and they have made a new head and center of its unity; ſo that all the old ſort of Chriſtians to the end of the world, that cannot change their Church and unite to the new head and center, muſt needs be of a different body from the <hi>Romaniſts.</hi> And if theſe men ſay that it is the reſt of the Chriſtian world that firſt withdraws from them. 1. Let them prove that the <hi>Greek, Abaſſins</hi> &amp; the reſt of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world that deny ſubjection to them, except theſe in the Weſt, were ever under them. 2. And as for the Reformed Churches if they were drawn in heretofore (I mean their forefathers) to countenance the <hi>Romiſh</hi> uſurpation &amp; tyranny, they withdraw only from that uſurpation, &amp; ſeparate from <hi>Rome</hi> only as it is a faction &amp; not as from a Church. If we be drawn into a ſchiſm &amp; ſeparation from all the Chriſtian world, by the fraud of <hi>Rome,</hi> is it unlawful for us to repent &amp; return to the unity of the Catholike Church, and to renounce the Schiſm that we were guilty of? This is our great ſin? we are ſchiſmaticks becauſe we will not continue ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks? we are Schiſmaticks by caſting off the Schiſm of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe we will not be Schiſmaticks by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing to ſeparate from all the Churches elſe on earth.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:61063:92"/>3. But let us come to the tryal with them who laid the firſt Schiſmatical Principle? Was it not they that firſt defined the Catholike Church as equipol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent with the <hi>Romane</hi>? and firſt made the univerſal Headſhip of their Pope to be the center? Did ever <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> or any Apoſtle do ſo? Did they give us ſuch a definition of the Catholike Church? Or did the Church do ſo for many a hundred year after them? Prove this well, and take all; and we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to turn Papiſts without delay. The plaine truth is this. The Catholike Church for many hundred years after Chriſt was that Body of Chriſtians who were united or centred only in Chriſt the head, and held communion in the fundamentals or great and neceſſary points of faith and worſhip: and had no mortal head or Center: But the worldly greatneſs of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> occaſioneth the inflation and proud uſurpation of her Biſhop, and he will needs make himſelf the Center of union and univerſal head, when there was no Center or head, but Chriſt before: And is not this the vileſt Schiſme that men can tell how to be guilty of? ſuppoſe that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> having his Dominions remote one part from another, ſome in Europe; and ſome in the <hi>Indies,</hi> that for five or ſix hundred years the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> ſhould acknowledge no other head but the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the Governors of each Province ſhould receive their ſeveral Commiſſions immediately from him, and ſtand in no regimental ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to one another, but onely be bound by the King to have communion and hold correſpondence for their mutual ſafety and the common good: If now after ſo long time the Vice King of <hi>Mexico,</hi> ſhall by Degrees make himſelf the ſovereign of the reſt,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61063:92"/>
firſt claiming onely the firſt place in their Aſſemblies, becauſe he is Governor of the greateſt City; and then requiring them to do nothing without him, or his conſent, and at laſt proclaiming himſelf the head of the <hi>Indies</hi> under the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and that none are ſubjects to the King but thoſe that profeſs themſelves alſo ſubjects to him, but all the reſt are rebels and traytors, and to be uſed accordingly; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting and commanding all to fall upon them and uſe them as ſuch: And all this upon pretence that <hi>Spain</hi> is ſo far off, that the King there is inviſible and inacceſſible to them in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and therefore the King hath given him a Commiſſion to be his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, as being more viſible and acceſſible. If now the reſt of the Preſidents, Governors, and Provinces, ſhall refuſe to acknowledge the Headſhip of this man, and ſhall declare that they dare center to no head, but the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> without his expreſs Commiſſion manifeſted, and the Provinces of <hi>Mexico</hi> and the adjacent parts onely ſhall be otherwiſe minded and ſubject themſelves to the uſurper, who is it that cauſeth the Schiſme in the King of <hi>Spains</hi> dominions? And which partie is it that holdeth to the ancient terms of unity? and which are the dividers? I need not ſtand to make a particular application: It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo, between us and the Pope with his Romaniſts. The Church of old was centred onely in Chriſt and headed onely by him: At laſt the Pope pretending Chriſts diſtance and inviſibility, and a Commiſſion that he hath from Chriſt to be his Vicar General (written in letters that none can read but himſelf and his party) will needs become the viſible head and center: and whereas before thoſe onely were the rebels that rejected Chriſt, now all muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61063:93"/>
that are not ſubject to the Popes.</p>
               <p>And to aggravate the crime by the addition of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, all this Schiſme and ſeparation muſt be carryed on by a pretence of unity: They make the poor ſimple people believe that the Pope being the Head and center, there is no unity to be held but in him, and that we muſt all be guilty of Schiſme that unite not in him, and that all our diviſions are cauſed by our departing from this center of unity: when it is himſelf that hath divided from the reſt of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world, and would drown the infamy of it by accuſing others of the ſame ſin that he is ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly guilty of. By which we may well ſee, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing others is none of the ſureſt ſigns of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but too common a trick to divert the ſuſpition from themſelves. When the Papiſts that are the greateſt Schiſmaticks on earth, do make ſuch an outcry againſt us as Schiſmaticks, becauſe we have repented of our joyning with them in their Schiſme, and will not confederate with them in evil, againſt the Laws of Chriſt, and the neceſſary means of the unity of his Church.</p>
               <p>Arg. 7. <hi>If the faith of Papiſts as Papiſts, which is it that we call Popery, be a meerly uncertain, changeable thing, ſo that a man can never tell when he hath it all then is it no ſafe way to Salvation. But the faith of Papiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> (as ſuch) is ſuch a meerly uncertain change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing: Therefore it is no ſafe way to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The conſequence of the Major, I ſuppoſe they will grant. For how can that be a ſafe way, 1. which is uncertain, 2. and changeable; when the true way
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61063:93"/>
to ſalvation is one and the ſame, and changeth not ſince Chriſt had eſtabliſhed and ſealed his Laws.</p>
               <p>All the queſtion therefore is of the Minor: which I prove, 1. From the Popiſh principles, 2. From their Practices, both which do plainly ſhew that their new Religion is a meer Weather-cock that muſt fit with the winde of the mutable conceits of the Pope and his Clergy. Even like the Religion of the Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts that wait ſtill for new Revelations to be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to the Scripture.</p>
               <p>And firſt for their principles, one is that [The Scripture is not the whole word of God, or ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent rule of faith or manners, but onely a part of the Word and Rule, and that unwritten Traditions are the other part: Yea <hi>Ruſhworths</hi> Dialogues, <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> and the reſt of them ordinarily, tell us that Scripture was not chiefly given to be a Rule of faith at all: ſaith <hi>Bellarm. de verbo dei li.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>[Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Scripturae pracipuus non eſt, ut ſit Regula fidei, ſed ut variis documentis, exemplis, adhortationibus, nunc terrendo, nunc inſtruendo, nunc minando, nunc con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolando adjuvet nos in hae peregrinatione.]</hi> that is <hi>[The chief end of Scripture, is not to be a Rule of faith: but that by divers documents, examples, adhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, ſometime by affrighting, ſometime by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing, ſometime by threatning, ſometime by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, it may help us in this our peregrination.]</hi> It is then unwritten Traditions that are part of Gods Word, and at leaſt part of the Rule of faith: And where theſe Traditions are to be found, and what they are, and how many, and by what notes they may all be known, either they dare not tell us, for fear of bringing mens faith to a certainty, from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61063:94"/>
the lock and key of the Pope, or elſe in telling us they do but cloud the buſineſs with general terms, or elſe diſagree among themſelves. That the Scripture it ſelf is delivered to us infallibly, we doubt not: and thereby we know the Canonical books: But this may be done without another word of God: The act of Delivery from the Apoſtles is not a new Revelation or Word of God, but the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural means of conveying the word to thoſe for whom it was intended: And the <hi>object</hi> of that Act of <hi>Delivery</hi> was not another Word of God, but all and onely theſe ſame Canonical Books: ſo that I know which is the Canon (among other reaſons) becauſe I can prove (not by another Word of God, but) by infallible humane Teſtimony (ſuch as I have of the Laws of this Land) that the Bible, and theſe particular books in it were actually delivered by the holy Writers to the Churches. If God write the two Tables of ſtone, and therein make known that they are his Laws, and then Deliver theſe to <hi>Moſes,</hi> this <hi>Delivering</hi> is not a new Word of God, but a neceſſary act for the promulgation of the Word: So that if you aske an Iſraelite how he knows, whether onely the ten Commandments and all thoſe ten were contained in the Tables? He can prove it to you by the Tables Delivered, and by proving the Act of <hi>Delivery,</hi> though he could bring no other word of God which told you what was in thoſe Tables. And indeed, if theſe muſt needs be another Word of God, beſides the Delivering Acts to prove the former to be the Word of God, and tell us its parts, then there muſt alſo be another word to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that ſecond Word to be the Word of God, and another to diſcover that, and ſo in <hi>infinitum.</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:61063:94"/>
Our acknowledged neceſſary Tradition, therefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But for the Papiſts that will have another part of the Rule of Divine faith, they will never be able to tell us what it is, and where, and to let us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand when we have all. <hi>Bellarmine de verbo dei non Scripto li.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. layes down five Rules by which we may know the true Traditions. The firſt is <hi>[When the whole Church embraceth any thing as a point of faith, which is not found in the Scriptures of God, we muſt needs ſay, that this was had from the tradition of the Apoſtles.]</hi> The ſecond is <hi>[When the univerſal Church keepeth ſomewhat which none could conſtitute but God, and which is not found written, we muſt needs ſay, that this was delivered from Chriſt and the Apoſtles.]</hi> The third is <hi>[That which is kept in the univerſal Church, and through all times paſt, is deſervedly judged to have been inſtituted by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, though it be ſuch a thing as the Church might inſtitute.]</hi> The fourth is <hi>[When all the Doctors of the Church do with one conſent teach that ſuch a thing deſcended by Apoſtolical Tradition, either Congregate in a General Councel, or writing it apart in books, this is to be believed to be an Apoſtolike Tradition.]</hi> The fifth Rule is this <hi>[That is without doubt to be believed to deſcend from Apoſtolical Tradition, which is held for ſuch in thoſe Churches where the ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles is entire and continued.]</hi> Theſe are <hi>Bellarmines</hi> five Rules.</p>
               <p>But 1. What the particular Apoſtolical Traditions are which are Gods Word according to theſe Rules, he had more wit, or leſs honeſty then to let us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.

Is it becauſe the word of God is indeed yet unknown? or cannot be known? or becauſe it is not fit to make it known? or becauſe the Pope muſt pretend to the keeping of theſe hidden Laws, that ſo the world may receive them at his mouth?</p>
               <p n="2">2. And I would fain know whether theſe Rules of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> to know the unwritten word by, are themſelves the Word of God, or not? If they be, are they written or unwritten, and how known to be ſo? If not, then it ſeems we may have Rules and means which are not the word of God, by which we may infallibly know which is the true word of God? And then there needs no unwritten word to deliver or prove the written word.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And why may not another Doctor by theſe Rules, know the unwritten word, as well as the Pope, and another Church as well as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>?</p>
               <p n="4">4. And why may not the Chriſtian people through the world procure from ſome one charitable Pope, through ſo many hundred years, a Catalogue of thoſe unwritten verities, that the word of God may be once commonly known, and men may know when they have all, without uncertain dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies on the Pope, or travailing in vain to <hi>Rome</hi> to know.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And for thoſe few that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in, <hi>viz.</hi> The perpetual Virginity of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> The Baptiſme of Infants, the validity of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks Baptiſm, the faſt of Lent, the inferior orders of the Clergy, the veneration of Images. To the firſt, I ſay, It is no Article of Divine Faith, but of humane Eccleſiaſtical: The ſecond is proved fully out of Scripture: And ſo is the third, if you take it of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61063:96"/>
ſuch Hereticks (in a larger ſence) as expreſly exclude nothing eſſential to baptiſm, but expreſly include it all: But for the reſt, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſhould remember how elſwhere he defendeth the Council that required the rebaptizing of thoſe that were baptized by the Pauliniſts, becauſe they were Anti-trinitarians. For Lent, I ſay, no more can be proved of it, but onely that it is an ancient Eccleſiaſtical conſtitution. And the inferior orders are apparently novelties, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced after the firſt age, if not the ſecond too, and not mentioned in any of the firſt writers, but the ſum of Church Officers enumerated without them. Much more novel is the unlawful uſe of Images in Churches or as immediate inſtruments to excite devotion in prayer, and for other lawful uſe, we deny it not.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But principally I would intreat <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the Pope that hereafter they would obtrude no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written word upon us, but what is proved to be ſuch, at leaſt by his own Rules. Let us have ſome proof that it proceedeth from the univerſal Church, and not their naked word without evidences. And then we muſt intreat them to be ſo honeſt, as not to unchurch the <hi>Greeks, Abaſſines, Armenians, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> and all the Chriſtians in the world except <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> that ſo they may be the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, and then prove any thing to be the word of God by their own Teſtimony alone. Nor yet to perſwade us that ſuch a Council as theirs at <hi>Trent</hi> conteined the whole Catholike Church real or repreſentative: nor yet to bring us two or three Fathers, and ſay that thoſe were all the Doctors of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:61063:97"/>More particularly I anſwer to his Rules in order. To the firſt I ſay. 1. That prove if you can that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole Church embraced any thing as a point of Divine faith which is not contained in the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word. 2. If the whole Church embrace it, then it is no ſecret, and therefore we all may know it, yea and actually do know it as well as the Pope.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond Rule I ſay, You may prove a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken obſervance of rites by the greater part of the Church, but prove that the <hi>whole</hi> Church kept any thing unwritten, which none could conſtitute but God: But if they did, ſtill it muſt needs be known to all, and therefore not controvertible, or lockt up in the Popes cloſet. Prove alſo that the univerſal Church may not erre in ſome leſſer matters about Chriſts ſuppoſed conſtitutions.</p>
               <p>To the third I ſay, If by <hi>[all times paſt]</hi> you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Apoſtles, then we grant your Rule: but meer Eccleſiaſtical Canons may be obſerved through all times ſhortly after the Apoſtles, and yet not as Apoſtolical, but Eccleſiaſtical: Yet when you come to try your Traditions by this Rule, I am not out of doubt that you will but diſgrace them, and fail your Readers juſt expectations.</p>
               <p>To the fourth I ſay, 1. I will believe you, if you ſpeak of all the Doctors of the Church next to the Apoſtles, or ſo neer as that the danger of miſtaking was not great. 2. But I do not believe that you will find any of your Traditions aſſerted to be Gods Word, by all the Doctors of the Church (not neer all) in any one age: unleſs you make your faction to be all.</p>
               <p>The laſt Rule is but a meer trick of wit to get the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61063:97"/>
key into the Popes hand alone: To which I ſay, 1. A Church that hath had an interrupted ſucceſſion of true Paſtors from the Apoſtles, may fall into many errors in proceſs of time, which in <hi>Tertullians</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> dayes, when the memory of all the Apoſtles practices were ſo freſh, they could not fall into ſo eaſily. 2. Thoſe Churches have received their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written verities, either by writings from their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors or without: If by writings, why cannot others find it there as well as they? If without, it muſt be an uncertain, and mutable means; or by a means ſo publike ſtill that all as well as they may know of it. 3. And we undertake to prove that the ſucceſſion of true Paſtors of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> See hath been long ago, and often interrupted. And therefore this Rule will not ſerve your turns.</p>
               <p>But though I have been long upon this principle of the Papiſts to prove the uncertainty of their faith, yet the next is the chief that I intended, which alſo proveth the mutability of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Papiſts ordinarily hold that <hi>as to us,</hi> that is Gods Word which the Pope with his Clergy ſay is Gods Word; and that his determination or Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that this or that is a point of faith, doth make it <hi>to us</hi> a point of faith, and neceſſary to be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſalvation, which before was not ſo; So that according to the Papiſts, the Churches faith muſt alter at the Popes pleaſure (at leaſt with his Clergy) And by new declarations and determinations, he may make them a new Article of their Creed, when he will: ſo that their faith is as mutable and fallible as their Pope; and this they are themſelves aware of: and therefore feign him to be infallible that they may prove their faith infallible: which if they could do
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61063:98"/>
(as they never can) yet ſtill their faith is mutable by their own confeſſion, if not by revocations, yet by new additions <hi>as to us:</hi> ſo that their Religion is in continual progreſs or flux, and groweth in quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as every Pope doth adde his Determinations. Now I would know of any Papiſt in the world, or of the Pope himſelf if he would condeſcend to ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, whether they are ſure that yet they have all that is made neceſſary to be believed to ſalvation, upon ſuppoſal of their determination? How can they tell but that their ſucceſſors may make the Creed as long again as it is, and make their Religion another thing? I know they will ſay, that <hi>as to them</hi> no more is <hi>de fide</hi> then the Pope determineth to be ſo.</p>
               <p>But then, 1. If he would not determine it, no man ſhould be bound to believe in Chriſt, and ſo none be damned for unbelief.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If it be a benefit to have all points of faith determined, Why are they not done, but one Pope muſt adde one, and another adde ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the end of the world (if Chriſt ſhould let them go on.)</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sure the preaching of any one Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtle or other Preacher of the Goſpel in the firſt age did leave the unbelievers without excuſe; and not onely the Cathedral Determination of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> And why then doth not any Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers Revelation of Gods will from his Word, oblige men now to believe as well as it did then?</p>
               <p>And 3. It is evident and undenyable that their practice is according to their principles. The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Religion changeth ſo faſt by the new addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61063:98"/>
of ſeveral Popes, that it is not the ſame thing now, as it was heretofore. Look but into the Oath, or <hi>Trent</hi> Confeſſion which I recited in the beginning, and you may preſently ſee how their Religion is ſwelled bigger then it was. All the Popes Decretals, or at leaſt all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of <hi>Trent,</hi> and every General Council (at leaſt, confirmed by the Pope) do enlarge their faith, as they adde any thing to what went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. What a multitude of things are <hi>de fide</hi> now, that were not ſo within a thouſand years? What man can give up himſelf to ſuch a growing Religion, where we muſt waite on the Pope, as the Enthuſiaſts do on God, for new Additional Revelations? And cannot know when we have all or halfe. How can they tell but their Creed may fill more volumes yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that all their Popes have done with it?</p>
               <p>Nay further note, that the Pope can make not onely new wayes to Heaven, but ſeveral wayes to Heaven at once. He could once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with the <hi>Bohemians</hi> for receiving in both kinds, and yet make it neceſſary to the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others, to take it but in one, becauſe he ſo decreed it to be given. So that there ſhall be one Creed in one part of the world, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the reſt.</p>
               <p>It is a damnable Hereſie in parts that are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely under his power, for the vuglar to read the Scripture in their own Tongue. But in <hi>England,</hi> he can make it Lawfull, leſt it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his deſignes, though his Doctors have long determined that it is the Mother of all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.</p>

And while the eager con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders on either ſide endeavor to have the Pope determine the controverſie on their ſide, no Pope durſt do it for fear of loſing the reputation of his infallibility with the adverſe party; and ſo the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful Popes have long ſuffered their Doctors to live in contention, and to write voluminouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one another, and their <hi>Romane</hi> Church to be broken into parties, becauſe they would not once open their mouths to decide the difference. But now at laſt it pleaſed Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the tenth (though he durſt not touch the principal points) to favor his Jeſuites ſo far as to determine five of the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted points for the Moliniſts againſt the Janſenians (when Pope <hi>Clement</hi> was once about determining all for the Dominicans as they thought) Mark here the agreement of the Papiſts, and the ſtability of their faith. Before the determination each party main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61063:99"/>
their way as <hi>de fide,</hi> and accuſed the other as Heretical: ſome boldly prognoſticated (as our <hi>Thomas Anglus</hi> alias <hi>White</hi>) that the Pope would never determine the controverſie about Predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And now the Pope hath tryed the ſtomacks of his Dominicans with the Determination of theſe five Articles. Firſt, to ſee how they will digeſt them before he went further: And he pronounceth them to be Heretical, and ſome of them temerarious, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, and blaſphemous too, condemning them with <hi>Anathema</hi>: Now thoſe become points of faith on one ſide, and Hereſies on the other which were none before. Till this Determination the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> wanted five Articles of their Creed, or had five fewer then now they have: A man might have been ſaved before, that had believed, that <hi>[Liberty from neceſſity is not neceſſary to Merit]</hi> with the reſt of them, but now all of that belief muſt be damned. And was not the Pope unmerciful to the poor Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans, to ſend them all to Hell, that cannot change their belief, knowing how hard it is for a learned Tribe, eſpecially ſo countenanced by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> to alter their mindes unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at a word. And yet in the <hi>Trent</hi> Confeſſion they muſt all ſolemnly ſwear and vow that all things deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, defined, and declared, by the ſacred Canons and Oecumenical Councils, eſpecially that of <hi>Trent,</hi> they do <hi>without doubting</hi> receive and profeſs: though no man had ever heard the Popes Reaſons, yet if he do but ſee the Determination of their Church, he muſt preſently not onely believe the contrary to what he believed before, but do it alſo <hi>without doubting</hi>; though they'l confeſs millions are ſaved that believe Chriſt to be the Son of God, though

not without doubting. Well: but ſee what unity is procured by the addition of theſe new Articles to their Creed? The <hi>French</hi> Doctors aſcribe to his holineſs that the ſaid Articles may be taken in ſeveral ſences: The one ſence is Heretical, <hi>Lutheran</hi> or <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinian,</hi> but that is a ſence, <hi>That the words lawfully uſed will not hear, but onely may malignantly be faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to them</hi> (ſay they) The other ſence (which is genuine and proper) they <hi>Def<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

More of the like contention about his holineſs Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions you may ſee in <hi>Tho.

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61063:100"/>
grant the more turbulent party their words, and the more obedient party their ſence</hi>: ſo that when the Pope hath done all that he can to determine their contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, they will ſtill ſay, that he determineth but the words (nay he doth but grant one party their words) and not the meaning: and ſo not onely ſence, but bare terms muſt be made Articles of faith.</p>
               <p>And here you may ſee the great force of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts arguing for a neceſſity of a living Judge to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of the ſence of Scripture, becauſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is ſo ambiguous that each one will elſe wreſt it, his own way: And do we not ſee, that the Pope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, after ſo many years deliberation, determine five ſhort Articles ſo expreſly and plainly, even when he doth it of purpoſe to decide the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as to make his learned Doctors underſtand him? but that each party doth take his words to be either for, or not againſt their opinions, and hold their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions as faſt ſince his determination as before: And ſo they do by <hi>Auguſtine, Thomas</hi> and the Council of <hi>Trent:</hi> each party confidently perſwading the world that they were of their ſide.

               <p>So that the Principles and Practices of the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts do aſſure us that their faith is unfixed, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mutable; they may be one year of one Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and another year of another, as pleaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that for my part I deſire not either to be ſhut out of heaven at the pleaſure of every new Pope, nor to be of ſo uncertain and changeable a Religion: And I cannot think therefore that Popery is a ſafe way to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Arg. 8. <hi>That Doctrine which derogateth from the written Word of God, and ſetteth the Decrees of men above it, enabling them to contradict its moſt expreſs inſtitutions, is no ſafe way to ſalvation: But ſuch is the Doctrine of Popery: therefore it is no ſafe way to ſalvation</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Major is unqueſtionably true among true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. For the proof of the Minor I ſhall only give you three inſtances of the Popiſh Doctrine, becauſe I intend not to be too particular, left I be too large.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, their affirming the Scripture both to be inſufficient to diſcover the whole doctrine of faith, as being but one part of Gods Word, and Tradition the other part, and alſo to be no Word of God at all <hi>to us,</hi> till the Pope and his Clergy do authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively determine it ſo to be; or that we cannot know the Scripture to be Gods word, but upon the Authority of the Churches determination. But of this I have ſpoken before, and ſhall do more in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpute.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:61063:101"/>The ſecond inſtance that I give is, Their changing Chriſts moſt expreſs inſtitution, by withholding the Cup in the Lords Supper from the people, and giving them but half the Sacrament. I am not now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting about the efficacy or inefficacy of one half, ſo delivered; but proving the intolerable Arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Papiſts that dare ſet up the will of man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Gods Word, and give power to the Pope to change Chriſts Inſtitutions; and not onely to adde but to diminiſh, and expreſly to contradict Chriſt, and forbid what he commandeth. I know they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that it was but to the twelve Apoſtles that Chriſt gave the Cup, and not to the Laity: True, nor the bread neither: but then if he intended that none but the Clergy have the Cup, why may they not as well ſay ſo of the Bread? But do not theſe deceivers know? 1. That Chriſt gives this reaſon of his adminiſtring the Cup <hi>[Drink yee All of it: For this is my blood of the New Teſtament which is ſhed for many for the Remiſſion of ſins?]</hi> So that if this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hold to others, if his blood be ſhed for the ſins of others as well as for the Clergie, then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand extendeth to others <hi>[Drink ye all of it.]</hi> And do they not know that <hi>Luke</hi> further intimateth this in his narration of the words of Chriſt [<hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my blood which is ſhed for you</hi>?] So that thoſe whom it is ſhed for (and we may diſcern to be Believers) it may be applyed to. 2. And do they not know that <hi>Paul</hi> delivereth the doctrine both of the Bread and Cup, as from the Lord, to the whole Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and not onely to the Clergy? Is it not all that he expreſly commandeth to <hi>[Examine themſelves, and ſo to eat of this Bread and Drink of this Cup?]</hi> Alas, they
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61063:102"/>
know all this: they cannot but know it, and yet they will contradict the expreſs word of God: God ſaith <hi>[Drink ye all of it]</hi> and [<hi>Let a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine himſelf, and ſo drink</hi>:] The Pope ſaith, Let none of the people drink of it, but the Clergy on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. What is this but to abrogate Gods Laws, and ſet up the Popes above and againſt it? Yea unleſs it were to ſhew the world their Power to contradict Chriſt and deſtroy his word, who can imagine what ſhould move them to this attempt? If there were any temptation of profit or honor in the buſineſs (as there is in the maintaing of the Popes ſupremacy, Purgatory, Indulgences, Pardons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) we ſhould not wonder at it: But what profit, or honor, or pleaſure is it, thus to contradict Chriſt? and for them that adde ſuch a multitude of their own Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, to affect ſo to cut off one half of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Rite and matter which Chriſt ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Nay thirdly, Do not theſe men know that the Bread and Cup were both given to the people by the Primitive Church? and that it ſo continued for many hundred years? and that their alteration is a meer novelty. Yes, they know all this: For the matter is ſo far paſt doubt that they cannot but know it. And yet theſe deceivers would make the people believe that they are of the old Religion, and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is new. Theſe are they that cry out againſt our caſting off Apoſtolical Traditions, and the Churches conſtitutions and cuſtoms, and going in new wayes which our forefathers knew not: Theſe are they that make it a mark of an Apoſtolical Tradition, that the <hi>whole Church</hi> hath received it, and that as from the Apoſtles. And yet theſe men dare caſt off,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61063:102"/>
not onely that which they know the whole primitive Church received and practiſed as from the Apoſtles (as <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Tertullian,</hi> and all antiquity profeſs) but alſo is expreſly contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. With what face can theſe that exclaim againſt novelty, introduce ſuch a palpable novelty into the Church? with what face can they that ſo cry up anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, gainſay all antiqiuty? and they that cry up <hi>the whole Churches conſent,</hi> ſo go againſt the conſent of the whole Church for ſo many Ages after the Apoſtles? They dare not deny but this part of Popery is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>New,</hi> againſt the conſtant practice and Canons of all Churches.</p>
               <p>The third point which I ſhall inſtance in, is, Their performing Gods publike ſervice in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and forbidding the people to read the Scriptures in their known vulgar Tongue; when as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath written the greateſt part of a whole Chapter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. expreſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this opinion and practice, and for uſing of a known tongue that others may underſtand and be edified. The evaſions by which they would elude that part of Scripture; are ſo ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that I think it not neceſſary to recite them: but rather ſuppoſe that they need no other confutation than the bare conſiderate reading of the Text; and therefore I ſhall venture the Reader (if he have common capacity and impartiality, and be but willing to know the truth) upon any thing that the Papiſts ſhall be able to ſay, for their Latine Service, and locking up the Scriptures, ſo be it he will but read that Chapter conſiderately. And are not theſe good Teachers in Chriſts School that will lock up the Grammar from their Schollars, when it is
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61063:103"/>
the very office of the Presbyters to teach it the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? And to hide from them that word of the living God, which he hath given the world to be their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory to ſalvation? The Prophets, and Chriſt and the Apoſtles did ſpeak and write this word in a know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Are not theſe the men that take away the Key of knowledge, and will neither enter in themſelves, nor ſuffer others to enter? They do expreſly contradict the Commands of God, and bid the people not read the Scripture, when God hath charged them to write it on the very poſts of their houſes, and on their doors, and that it be as a frontlet between their eyes, and that they teach it their children, ſpeaking of it lying down and riſing up, at home and abroad, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6 &amp; 11. God makes it the mark of the Bleſſed man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2, 3. To me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate day and night in his Law, as making it his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: and the Papiſts commonly maintain in their writings that to have the Scripture in the vulgar tongue is the root of all hereſies. God maketh the ſtudy of his word the duty and mark of all his Diſciples, and the Papiſts make it the mark of a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, and have burned many a one for it here in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes and tormented and burnt many by their bloody inquiſition for it abroad. The very Phariſees thought that their vulgar were curſed that knew not the Law, and the Papiſts will not let it be made known to them leſt it make them accurſed. God ſaith [<hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony: if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them,</hi> Iſa. 8.20.] The Papiſts cry out <hi>precul — hinc</hi> away: let it alone, meddle not with
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61063:103"/>
it, it will make you Hereticks: And indeed they have had large experience that the way which they call hereſie, and contradicteth their impieties, is moſt effectually promoted by the word of God: and therefore they think they have ſome reaſon to ſpeak againſt it. Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith <hi>[Theſe things are written that ye might believe, and that believing yee might have life throagh his name]</hi> Joh. 20.31. The Papiſts ſay, Read not theſe holy writings, leſt they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy your faith, and bring you to damnation.

The Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>[Whatſoever things were written aforetime, were written for our Learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scripture might have hope]</hi> Rom. 15.4.

Gods anger againſt the Jews was that <hi>[He had written to them the great or wonderful things of his Law, and they had accounted them as ſtrange things]</hi> Hoſ. 8.12. And the Papiſts will force people to be ſtrange to theſe writings. Yet how familiar (comparatively) they were to the vulgar Jews and their very children <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

which forbiddeth the reading of the Scripture, in the vulgar tongue, except only to thoſe that the ordinary ſhall think will receive good and not harm by it, and ſo ſhall have a licence from him in writing, and they pronounce that the common permiſſion of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures thus doth more harm then good: The ſame Index was after encreaſed and approved by Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5. and <hi>Clemens</hi> 8.

it, for their own ends. For Neceſſity hath no Law.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, and confidently conclude, <hi>that Popery is not a ſafe way to heaven,</hi> becauſe it doth 1. both vilifie Gods Scriptures as an inſufficient Rule, and but part of his word: And 2. preſumeth to alter its moſt expreſs inſtitutions (as the Cup in the Lords Supper) And 3. expreſly contradict it, in forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Prayers of the Church to be in a known tongue. 4. And forbid the publike reading of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in a known tongue. 5 And forbid the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating of Scripture, and the reading of ſuch tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations even by any private man, unleſs he have the Ordinaries Licence, which he may get in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where there is no remedy. The Kingdome of the Devil is called in Scripture the Kingdom of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and Chriſts Kingdom is called, a Kingdom of light: and when ever God converteth a ſinner, he tranſlateth him from the Power of Darkneſs into his marvellous light, even into the Kingdom of his dear Son, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9.

They deny the Major, and tell us, that it is no longer Bread but the Body of Chriſt: But that they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that thing which we call <hi>Bread,</hi> and they call <hi>Chriſts Body,</hi> with Divine worſhip, they do not deny. Onely ſome would excuſe them from the guilt of Idolatry (which is a worſhiping the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inſtead of the Creator) by this, becauſe they think it is Chriſt that they worſhip, and ſo interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively it is he in deed and the worſhip right. But if they will think that to be Chriſt which is not Chriſt, and then worſhip it, that will not excuſe them from being ſome kind of Idolaters: What if they will think a Ranter or Quaker to be Chriſt, who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſt? are they therefore excuſable if they worſhip them? Then why might not the old Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Idolaters be juſtified, or thus excuſed, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they thought that the Sun and Moon had been Gods. And when they worſhiped an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, they thought that ſome Deity had affixed
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61063:107"/>
this ſpecial preſence to that Image: What if an <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> thought that an Oxe was God, or that a Deity did dwell in him, were they therefore no Idolaters? And then, how hainouſly God taketh the ſin of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, the Scripture fully witneſſeth.</p>
               <p>That which we have to do, therefore is onely to enquire whether indeed it be <hi>bread</hi> or Chriſts body, a creature or the Creator which they worſhip?

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>heſe Reaſons (very briefly) which come firſt to my thoughts to prove that the Bread is not turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very body of Chriſt, but remaineth Bread ſtill.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the Bread were Chriſts real Body, then Chriſt had two real bodies: for he had one ſitting at the table, which delivered the Bread, and if the Bread were another, he had two: or elſe the body that Chriſt ſate and lived with, was not a whole body, but a part: But Chriſt had but one body, and that was entire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It would follow alſo that Chriſt had a living and a dead body, a ſenſible and inſenſible body both at once.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It would follow that the Apoſtles did tear Chriſt true fleſh, and draw out his blood as well as the Jews did.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yea and that they began to the Jews, and did it before them: And therefore why ſhould the Jews act, and theirs be ſo much differenced?</p>
               <p n="5">5. It will follow that either Chriſt had one body
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61063:107"/>
torne by the Jews, and another by the Diſciples, or elſe that one part of his body onely was crucified and not the whole: for the other part was eaten and drunk by the Diſciples before.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Alſo either Chriſt had one body that did Riſe again and another that never roſe, or elſe it was but one part of Chriſts body that roſe from the dead; for the other part was eaten and drunke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The like may be ſaid of his aſcenſion; Then it is not Chriſts whole body that aſcended up into heaven: for part of it was eaten before by the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and digeſted by them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It will follow that Chriſts glorified body is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and may be digeſted by a mans ſtomacke, and turned into dung: For ſo is that which is eaten.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It will follow alſo that Chriſts body may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an integral part of our very natural bodyes, and ſo his body is become ſinful, as being a natural part of a ſinner: for the Bread and Wine do nouriſh us, and turn into our ſubſtance.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Yea it followeth that Chriſt doth thus turn into the ſubſtance of every child of the Devil that eateth the conſecrated Bread, and drinketh the Wine. For they certainly nouriſh him and turn into his ſubſtance: A moſt horrid conſequent: For what communion hath Chriſt with <hi>Belial</hi>?</p>
               <p n="11">11. Nay (which is in ſome reſpect more horrid and abominable to imagine) it will follow, that the Glorified body of Chriſt may turn into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a mouſe or a Dog: for if they eat it, the bread will certainly nouriſh them, and become their ſubſtance.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:61063:108"/>12. It will follow that either Chriſt hath an inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible body, or elſe men hurt him by eating him in the Euchariſt.</p>
               <p n="13">13. It followeth that Chriſt hath as many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand bodies, as there be conſecrated hoſts, or elſe that by continuation of parts it is every where, and filleth all the world (which the Papiſts diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow.)</p>
               <p n="14">14. It followeth that Chriſts body admitteth of augmentation, and either daily or weekly receiveth new made parts, or elſe that he hath new bodies made daily.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Alſo it followeth that a creature (either the Baker or the Prieſt) may make God, or make his Saviour, at leaſt inſtrumentally: which is a horrid imagination.</p>
               <p n="16">16. It followeth that either Chriſts body hath the accidents of colour, taſte, dimenſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are there ſenſible, or elſe that thoſe Accidents have no ſubject, which is a contradiction.</p>
               <p n="17">17. It followeth alſo that Chriſt hath not indeed a true humane body, if it be ſuch as is before im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</p>
               <p n="18">18. And it followeth that the body of Chriſt is (part of it) condemned, hated of God, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the Devil. Becauſe his body was turned into the bodies of many millions of wicked men, which muſt be ſo condemned, hated and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Alſo it followeth that the Scriptures are not true, which tell us that the heavens muſt receive him (in that humane nature which aſcended from earth) till the times of the reſtitution of all things, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.21. and that he ſhall come again to judge the world.</p>
               <p n="20">
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:61063:108"/>20. Laſtly it will follow that a man muſt not truſt his ſences: that though my eyes, my ſmell, my taſte, my feeling, tell me that this is <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> yet they are all deceived: and not mine only but all the ſenſes in the world, to which they are objected. And if that be true, 1. What reaſon have I to truſt any Papiſt living? For all my good opinion of him muſt be ultimately reſolved into ſomething that I <hi>ſee</hi> or <hi>hear</hi> of him: And it ſeems, I am uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I <hi>ſee</hi> or <hi>hear</hi> him indeed or not. 2. And then how can I tell that I or any man is ſure of any thing? For if the ſenſes of millions in perfect health may be all deceived in this, why not in other things, for ought we know? 3. And then how can any Papiſt tell that the Bread is turned into Chriſts body? If he ſay, becauſe the Church or the Scripture ſaith ſo; How knoweth he that, but by hearing or ſeeing? and therefore for ought he knows his ſenſes may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived when he thinketh he heareth or readeth ſuch a thing, as well as when he thinketh that he ſeeth, feeleth, ſmelleth, and taſteth Bread and Wine.</p>
               <p>And is there not need of very ſtrangely cogent evidence now to impell them to believe againſt the concurrent vote of Scripture, ſenſe and reaſon? And what is the ground of their contrary belief? Not the Ancient Church (unleſs they willfully or negligently deceive themſelves) for the ſtream of antiquity is full againſt them: ſo full that its hard to believe that any of them thats verſt in antiquity can truly think that antiquity is for them, if they have but the common reaſon of men to underſtand what they read. What is it then that bringeth them to this belief? Is it the Scriptures? Thats not likely, becauſe they make ſo light of it, and ſwear to take
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61063:109"/>
it in the ſence of the Church, or ancient Doctors (in which laſt they are here and oft moſt deſperately forſworn) It muſt be then upon the Authority of the preſent Church, that is, the Pope and his Clergy, that they entertain this hard belief. That is, The Pope and his Clergy believe it, becauſe they ſay it themſelves, and the reſt believe it becauſe the Pope ſaith it. And is it truely poſſible that any man ſhould have ſo good a conceit of himſelf, yea or any other think ſo well of him, as to believe unfeignedly ſo great a thing upon ſo weak a ground? Can the Pope therefore believe it becauſe he doth believe it? Or is it not too probable that thouſands of them are of that Belief which <hi>Melancthon</hi> ſometime told them of very ſmartly [<hi>You</hi> Italians <hi>(ſaith he) Believe Chriſt is in the Bread, before you Believe that there is any Chriſt in heaven</hi>] while they pretend to a faith above men (that is, to believe Impoſſibilities upon the Popes credit) I wiſh they prove to have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon belief of Chriſtians; and that in heart they do not (as once one of their Popes did) account the Goſpel but a commodious fable. But let us ſuppoſe that indeed it is the word of God that is the ground of their ſtrange belief, and that <hi>[Hoc eſt Corpus meum, This is my body]</hi> is the very word that doth convince them, as ſome of them do pretend. I would here be bold to aske them that ſay ſo, a Queſtion or two. 1. What, if the Ancient Church had intecpreted this Text as we do, againſt your Tranſubſtantiation? would you then have believed it upon the bare Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of this Text? What need I ask this? Your own Oaths and Profeſſion ſaith, No: It is not then any evidence in this Text that compelleth your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. And let me adde, that if I prove not (in a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61063:109"/>
fair debate upon a juſt call) that the ancient Church for many hundred years after Chriſt, was againſt Tranſubſtantiation, I will give all the Papiſts in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> leave to ſpit in my face (for all the high expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Euchariſt that ſome fathers have.) 2. What is there in thoſe words <hi>[This is my body]</hi> that can perſwade any ſober Chriſtian to their ſtrange belief? What is it, becauſe that they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and not figuratively to be underſtood? And how is that proved? Is it becauſe we muſt not force the Scripture, but take it in the plaineſt, obvious ſence? I eaſily grant it. But who knows not that both in Scripture and in all our common ſpeech, the figurative ſence is oft the moſt plain and obvious, and the literal the moſt improbable? What three ſentences do we uſe to ſpeak together without ſome figurative expreſſion? I will appeal to any unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced man of reaſon, whether a Chriſtian that ſhould newly read thoſe words of Chriſt, and had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard them or read them before, would not ſooner take them in our ſence, then in the Papiſts? They may eaſily try this upon a new convert, if they pleaſe: and I dare make their own conſciences judge, if they have any left to befriend a common truth. What is there more in <hi>[This is my Body]</hi> being a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental buſineſs, then for a man that is in a room among many Images, to ſay [<hi>This is</hi> Peter <hi>or</hi> Paul, <hi>or this is</hi> Auguſtine <hi>or</hi> Hierom <hi>or</hi> Chryſoſtome?] And would not any unprejudiced ſtander by ſuppoſe that the moſt obvious ſence of thoſe words is [<hi>This is the picture of</hi> Peter, Paul, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi>] Or would a man eaſily believe that it was the meaning of the ſpeaker, that this Picture was the very real fleſh and blood of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and all other Pictures that ever ſhould
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61063:110"/>
be made after the ſame exemplar, ſhould be ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated? So what is the obvious ſignification of thoſe words <hi>[This is my body]</hi> but [<hi>This is the Sacrament or Repreſentation of my Body</hi>?] Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when his real body was diſtinctly there preſent, and he expreſly biddeth them <hi>[Do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me.]</hi> 3. I would deſire any Papiſts living to tell me, why the Text doth not as much oblige him to believe that <hi>[The Cup is the New Teſtament]</hi> ſubſtantially without a figure, as that <hi>[The Bread is his Body]</hi> For the Text as expreſly ſaith one as the other, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.20. <hi>This Cup is the new Teſtament in my Blood.</hi>] Yet I ſuppoſe they will be content to ſay that by <hi>[The New Teſtament]</hi> is meant, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Seal of the New Teſtament. 4. Why will not theſe blind wretches believe the Holy Ghoſt, who calls it <hi>Bread</hi> at the eating after the conſecration? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26, 27, 28. three times together; and tells us that the uſe of it is to remember and ſhew the Lords death till he come.</p>

But theſe things have been ſo oft told them, and are ſo viſible in their Offices and other writings that I ſhall paſs them over.

enough in ſuch caſes) yet their learned Schoolmen and Doctors tell us another tale, as is too viſible in many of their writings.</p>
               <p>Arg. 10. <hi>That Doctrine which teacheth men to turn the moſt of Gods worſhip into meer unreaſonable ceremonies and vain formalities of mans dev;iſing, is not a ſafe way to ſalvation. But ſuch is the doctrine of Popery: Therefore,</hi> &amp;c</p>
               <p>The Major is certain: For 1. God hath taken down the ceremonial Law which he himſelf had made, and therefore will not give leave to man to ſet up another in its ſtead, and to burden his Church with unnceſſary things. 2. It is contrary to the freedom and ſpiritual ſtate of the Goſpel Church. The Apoſtle bids us ſtand faſt in the liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt hath made us free: And Chriſt ſaith, that God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and Truth: for ſuch worſhipers the Father ſeeketh: And he telleth the formal cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Phariſees, that they worſhipped God in vain, teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.23, 24. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1.</p>

Prayers alſo are uſed in Latine, ſo that the ſubſtance of publike worſhip is thus made a very Picture, or unreaſonable ſervice: Yea, they teach them to pray partly in Latine in private, and partly with vain repetitions, multiplying over the name Jeſu, nine times together, and rehearſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their canting ſhreds, and numbering their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers on their beads to keep tale, and obſerving ſuch and ſuch hours, and praying to Saints, to one Saint for this and another for that, giving the elogies and prayers and praiſes to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that are due to God alone: Sacraments they multiply: even Marriage which in the Clergy is a deadly ſin, and the avoiding it by the Laity is a work of ſupererogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet muſt it be a Sacrament.

And how can any unprejudiced man, that is but poſſeſſed with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and truely knoweth what it is to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, imagine that God is pleaſed with ſuch hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrionical gandes, and childiſh things? I confeſs the reading of their very books of devotion, their offices to our Lady, and others the like, which are ſtuffed with ſuch ſuperſtitious and unreaſonable paſſages, ſeems enough to me to turn the heart of a ſober man againſt their way. For who can think that the Holy and Bleſſed God will be delighted in their vain bablings and childiſh cantings, and affected ropetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of words, and ſaying, and hearing we know not what? would any wiſe man regard ſuch expreſſions of love or honor? If your friend or your child ſhould expreſs his Love and reſpects to you by mimick geſtures, and gambals, and making ſtrange faces, or repeating over your name nine times in a breath, or ridiculous cantings, complements and actings like a Stage Player, would you applaud, or delight in ſuch
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61063:112"/>
expreſſions of love and honor as theſe? Or would you not rather ſay as the Philiſtine King of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> when he ſpit, and ſcraped on the Wall, Have I need of mad men? It is ſure a carnal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable doctrine, that leadeth men to ſuch car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal unreaſonable ſervices, of that God who will be ſerved reaſonably in ſpirit and in truth. They that have but an Image or ſhadow of Faith and Grace, and can expect no more of Glory, are like enough to be well pleaſed with theſe Images and meer ſhadows of Gods worſhip: But its like to be otherwiſe with him that hath a ſpirit of ſupplication and holineſs within him, and hath known by experience what it is to walk with God, and offer him acceptable ſacrifices, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the tokens of his acceptance and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The very buſineſs or prize which they ſo much contend for, is Pompe, Greatneſs, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, yea Tyranny in the world: ſo that it is evidently Pride, Vain-glory, and Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that ſets them on, and is the Spring of all
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61063:112"/>
their conteſts. Whats the chief part of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, but whether the Pope and Cardinals of one City, even <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall be the Rulers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of all the Chriſtian world, and all Princes and People obey them? What unprejudiced man can be ſo blind, as not to ſee that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt is Tyrannical, and that their Dominion is their Religion, and their Pride is their faith, and that the queſtion is but that which one would think Chriſt had once ſufficiently deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, Who ſhall be the greateſt? Did not Chriſt chide his Diſciples for this conteſt? and ſay, With you it ſhall not be ſo? But the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, having no better way to prove the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture a noſe of Waxe, and as flexible and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiform, as they accuſe it to be, then by making it ſo to themſelves by abuſive violence and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting it, puting by the plaineſt words that Chriſt can ſpeak, and will take his Deciſion for no Deciſion, when it makes againſt the Deciſive Power of their Pope.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And this is yet further manifeſt, in that ſuch a multitude of their Popes have been Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, Murderers, Heretickes, Simoniacall, buying the Popedome with money, and poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another to obtain the Popedome, and living in it liker beaſts then men?

I will now onely inſtance in that which is freſh before our own eyes in <hi>England.</hi> The Papiſts know that Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts and Separatiſts are erroneous; they know that Ranters and Quakers are abominable; and yet for their own ends, dare they here in <hi>England,</hi> put on the vizard of Anabaptiſts and Quakers, and with all poſſible ſubtilty and zeal, and unwearyedneſs, go up and down to ſeduce the people to be Anabaptiſts and Quakers, as they did a while ago to be Seekers, if not Infidels. This is ſufficiently known and proved not only by the Popiſh pretended Jew that turned Anabaptiſt at <hi>Hexham,</hi> and was taken at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and others of them taken, but by many other Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, ſome upon oath of thoſe that have heard ſuch confeſſions from their mouthes; and many have known them in the Quakers Aſſemblies, that have ſeen them before elſwhere: And all this is done by them that they divide us and break us in pieces, and ſteal a credit to their pretended unity and Church Government, and turn the hearts of the people from our Miniſtery, and unſettle them, and make them more capable and receptive of their own opinions, and that they may make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers abroad believe that we are all running mad. And can that doctrine be of God, which teacheth men to do ſuch abominable things? Or is that like to be the cauſe of Chriſt that muſt be thus upheld? Is that perſon guided by the Spirit of Chriſt, that dares draw others to the vileſt blaſphemies and wickedneſs in a diſſembling garbe, that ſo he may promote his

               <p n="3">3. The third inſtance that I give is, their abomin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able forgeries, and depravations of ancient writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: Feigning Decretal Epiſtles of their Popes, and many other writings under the names of ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and preſuming to expunge, alter, and falſifie the true writings of the Fathers, and of the better ſort of their own, as is proved already againſt them by many, and I need not here recite: (See <hi>Doctor Feat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes</hi> aforeſaid <hi>Confer.

                  </gap>4. That there was above eight hundred thouſand perſons that made profeſſion of the faith of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi>: (And ſome of their own Popiſh writers ſay, that it was ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that they affirmed themſelves to have thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſucceſſively from the Apoſtles: And yet the Papiſts would make men believe that <hi>Luther</hi> was the firſt founder of the Reformation) I deſire the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that can have it to read Mr. <hi>S.

The very perfidious <hi>French</hi> Maſſacre at once was thought in a few dayes ſpace and a little room to murder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirty thouſand perſons, and this in a pretence of peace and quietneſs. So many bloody bouts hath that Nation had, that it is not like to be ſtill unaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. The cruelty of the Inquiſition in <hi>Spaine</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other parts, will hardly here be believed. The moſt horrid cruelty of the Papiſts in <hi>Ireland</hi> lately were beyond all the reſt. The number that they murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in time of peace by a ſudden inſurrection is almoſt incredible. In the very Province of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> alone, about a hundred and fifty thouſand were computed
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61063:117"/>
to be murthered. But God hath gone far in aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their blood already. What ſhould we mention ſuch leſſer matters as the burning ſo many in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, the Powder Plot to have blown up King and Parliament; with many ſuch fruites of the <hi>Romane</hi> fury? In a word I conclude, that it is not like to be the cauſe of Chriſt that hath been ſo long upheld by ſuch Deviliſh inhumane bloody means; nor is it like to be true Doctrine which poſſeſſeth men with ſuch a bloodthirſty ſpirit; nor is it a ſafe way to ſalvation to ſwim thither through the blood of Saints: nor is it any better then a cruel ſcorning of Chriſt when they have perſecuted him, to murther Chriſtians by thouſands for ſeeking Reformation, or not yielding to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> errors, and then to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge us to name or ſhew our Reformed Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Luther,</hi> or to accuſe us of Schiſm for ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them: Theſe Wolves will accuſe, where they cannot devour.</p>
               <p>Arg 12. <hi>If Popery do adde to all theſe abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons impenitency and uncurableneſs, then it is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no ſafe way to Salvation: But Popery doth adde to all theſe abominations, impenitency and uncurable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Therefore it is no ſafe way to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </p>
               <p>I do not mean that the perſons are ſimply uncur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; but while they are Papiſts, or go according to their fundamental principle, they are utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable and impenitent. For their Principle is that their Pope or Church cannot erre, but is infallible: And ſo they are bound to ſtand to all their Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations right or wrong: For if they ſhould repent
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61063:118"/>
of any, and we return from any ſmall or great, they ſhould in ſo doing proclaim that they were fallible, and ſo let go the principle of their profeſſion. So that there is no hope of repentance and amendment of any error once determined of, but onely by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canting the point of their Infallibility, to make way thereto. If therefore repentance and amendment be of neceſſity to Salvation, what Will become of theſe men that ſuppoſe themſelves ſo infallible? and how can that be a ſafe way to ſalvation that locks up the door againſt repentance and amendment? Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry therefore is no ſafe way to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Arg. 13. <hi>That profeſſion which plungeth men into certain perjury, and engageth them to impoſſibilities, and contradictories, is no ſafe way to ſalvation.

Let theſe proud deceivers ſhew us if they can when the Fathers, or any one of the Ancients, did ever take any ſuch oath himſelf, or perſwade others to it? Yea or that they have conſented to any one of theſe Articles of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> faith, and <hi>Trent</hi> oath? What more evident to any man that hath any acquaintance with the Fathers, then that theſe wretches do here moſt palpably forſwear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Even as if they ſhould ſwear to believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but according to the Ancient Creed, and withal ſwear to believe that Chriſt never dyed, roſe, or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, or that there is no reſurrection, or ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.

               <p>I would here have added as the fourteenth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: That Popery is a mixture of old condemned errors, formerly called Hereſies; which the ancient Church hath teſtified againſt; and therefore it is no ſafe way to Salvation: And here I ſhould have tryed their particular errors not yet mentioned, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, as their Doctrine of Merits and Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>Let us next here what is ſaid of moſt moment, to prove Popery to be a ſafe way to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>That Religion which hath been delivered down from the Apoſtles to this day without interruption, is a ſafe way to Salvation (For it is the ſame that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and all the ancient Chriſtians were ſaved in) But the Religion of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is that which hath been delivered down from the Apoſtles: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

And of this I deny the Minor, and ſay that Popery is not the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Religion, the Apoſtles and Primitive Church never knew it: There was no ſuch creature as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt known in all the world till ſix hundred years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the birth of Chriſt: It was about 606. when Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> did firſt claim his univerſal Papacy and

When they have once arrogated to themſelves the name of the Catholike Church, and taught the people to believe as the Church believes, that is, to believe that all is true which the Pope and his Clergy will report of themſelves, it is then an eaſie matter for them to prove any thing to be true which makes for their turn: then they may ſay, The Fathers are for them, and that they have their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſovereignty from S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

The word [Church] doth uſually ſignifie among Chriſtians, a Chriſtian ſociety, or a company of Chriſtians aſſociated for Gods worſhip and mutual edification: ſometime any company of Chriſtians whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo aſſociated or not: ſometime thoſe are called [Chriſtians] as diſtinct from Infidels, who profeſs moſt of the ſubſtance of Chriſtianity, but deny ſome part, or who profeſs the whole ſubſtance or the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, though they contradict it again by plain conſequence in other ſuperadded points: Though theſe as compared with the Orthodox are wont to be called Hereticks. We deny not but that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Papiſts are ſuch Chriſtians, and that as the word [Church] is applicable to combinations or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies conſiſting of ſuch materials, ſo far the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ſts are a true Church; ſuppoſing that we onely ſpeak of Metaphyſical Truth. But as the word [Chriſtian] is taken for one that ſo holdeth the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Chriſtian Faith, as not to ſubvert them by plain conſequence after he hath profeſſed them, ſo it is yet under diſpute whether the Romaniſts be a true Church, and therefore not to be taken as granted.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61063:121"/>
However thoſe Proteſtant Divines that grant them to be a true Church, do ſay that it is but by a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical verity, convertible with the eſſence; but that Morally it is a falſe Church and not a true; as a thief is a True man, that is, truely a man, but he is not a true man, that is, not an honeſt faithfull man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The thing called [The Church of <hi>Rome</hi>] con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth not of Homogeneal parts: or at leaſt that word ſignifieth ſeveral ſorts of perſons. There are ſome that with the Pope and his Cardinals entertain the full body of Popery, and enſlave the reſt: There are multitudes of the people, that ſilently live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, and let them alone, and are defiled by them in many things, but receive not the great and moſt dangerous part of their corruption. Theſe are not equally to be called the Church, nor are they equally in danger of damnation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I deny the conſequence of the Major Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; For if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be a true Church it is becauſe they are true Chriſtians, and not becauſe they are Papiſts: ſo that to argue [The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a true Church, therefore Popery is a ſafe way to Salvation] is as unſound as to argue [<hi>Gebezi</hi> the Leper is a living man: Therefore the Leproſie is a thing ſafe or profitable to mans life] Popery is the diſeaſe of their Church, and Chriſtianity is it that makes them a Church: You may well therefore co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To the confirmation I anſwer, That the Religion of Papiſts hath two parts: The Chriſtian Religion, as they are Chriſtians, and that maketh them a true Church if they be one. And the Popiſh cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> To the Antecedent or Minor I anſwer, that Papiſts be not all of a ſort: ſome may be ſaved, and ſome cannot, if they ſo live and dye. If you aske who may and who may not? I anſwer, that all thoſe of them that hold the ſubſtance of the Chriſtian faith, and that practically, notwithſtanding their errors; or that hold no errors but what conſiſt with the Practical holding of the Chriſtian faith, theſe ſhall be ſaved: But all thoſe that finally hold any error which for matter or manner is inconſiſtent with the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical holding of the Chriſtian faith, ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the conſequence of the Major I anſwer, by denying it; and that on the aforeſaid account. If a Papiſt be ſaved, it is not <hi>by Popery,</hi> but <hi>from Popery.</hi> It is therefore no better reaſoning than to ſay [If a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per may live, then the Leproſie is wholſome, or a ſafe to preſerve life] I have already ſpoke more to this.

or danger of damnation very terrible, though you were not certain to be damned.</p>
               <p>Obj. 4. <hi>There is but one true Church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently but one ſafe way to Heaven: That one Church is the <hi>Romane</hi> Church: And therefore they and onely they, are in the ſafe way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>

But if you ſpeak of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular aſſociations of Chriſtians called particular Churches, there are many thouſands: And ſo we ſay that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is (at beſt) but one particular Church, or one combination of ſome particular Churches under the Biſhop of that City: But that <hi>Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Romane</hi> party, are the whole of the Catholike Church of Chriſt, we do with abhorrency deny.</p>

Univerſality abſolute (ſo that all errors or other parties ſhould be excluded) the Church hath never had the happineſs to enjoy ſince the begining of its flouriſhing in the Apoſtles dayes.

The <hi>Ethiopian, Alexandrian</hi> and other Churches can as truely boaſt of theſe qualifications as <hi>Rome.</hi> 2. The Papiſts lay a higher claim to them then they can make good. As 1. I have ſhewed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready how far they are from unity, who are not only of ſo many Religions or wayes of Diſcipline; and of ſo great diſtance in many doctrinals, as the controverſies among themſelves do manifeſt, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are ſo diſagreed about the very center of their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their infallible ſoveraign Power, whether it be in the Pope, or a General Council, or both? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their unity is but of their own party, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts: And ſo all other parties are at ſome unity among themſelves: or many at leaſt. If <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had prevented the Pope, and got the Title of univerſal Biſhop, or Pope, as he did (by compoſition) of univerſal Patriarch; and had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that this would have united the Churches, I think it would not have juſtified his cauſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How can the Papiſts for ſhame pretend to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality either as to the preſent or former ages? Is it nothing that all the <hi>Ethiopian, Greek,</hi> and Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches are not of their party, beſides many a thouſand more? Or will they arrogantly condemne all the reſt of the Chriſtian world as heretical, and then ſay that they are the whole Church? Did they not learn this of the Donatiſts? But what is become of their modeſty who pretend to an univerſality, for the time paſt, when all the Chriſtian world was againſt their preſent belief, and there was not ſuch a thing as a Papiſt known (and revealed to us) in the world of ſix hundred years after the birth of Chriſt.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving already enquired whether the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> or the Reformed Churches are in the ſafe way to Salvation; we ſhall now more particularly enquire whether their faith or ours be built on the ſurer grounds. Our Belief is thus reſolved: we believe the Chriſtian Doctrine to be True, becauſe the True God is the Author of it. We diſcern that God is the Author of it, both by his Intrinſicke and Extrinſicke Seals or atteſtations of it: in that it beareth his image and ſuperſcription, and is confirmed by his undoubted uncontroled Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61063:125"/>
and other effects which lead us to the cauſe. The revealing containing ſigns or characters are the the holy Scriptures. That theſe Books were written by the Prophets, Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, and were confirmed by Miracles, and are uncorrupted in the main, we are infallibly aſſured of, by the evident certainty of the hiſtorical atteſtation and Tradition: For we depend not barely on the credit of a deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or deceitful man (ſuch as is the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>) or of any fallible ſociety of men; but on ſuch Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as we can prove by plain reaſon to be infallible, containing in it, beſides the Teſtimony of the Pope and all his party, the ſame Teſtimony alſo of all the reſt of the Chriſtians in the world, yea and of the very Hereticks who were enemies to much of the truth; and enough alſo even from the mouths of Infidels to confirm us: ſo that by this infallible hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and univerſal Tradition, we have a fuller diſcovery that theſe Books are the ſame that were written by the Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then we have that the Statutes of Parliaments in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> or Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> are the ſame that they pretend to be: And to a man that heareth not God himſelf or the Lord Jeſus or the Apoſtles, and hath not their immediate inſpirations, we know not how the Laws of heaven ſhould be more fitly delivered in an ordinary rational way, nor what ſurer other means ſuch as we can expect, who live at ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the firſt receivers of it: unleſs we would have God to ſpeak to every man as he did to <hi>Moſes,</hi> or have Chriſt or Apoſtles ſtill among us, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God muſt make us all Prophets by his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary inſpirations. And laſtly, the true meaning of this word we underſtand as we do the meaning of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61063:126"/>
other Laws or writings having moreover the aſſiſtance of the ſpirit, which is neceſſary becauſe of the ſublimity and ſpirituality of the matter, and the neceſſity of the great effects upon our hearts: Our Teachers by Tranſlation and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtructions are our helpers (as they muſt be in other things that we would learn) and by the help of them without and of the ſpirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, we are able to underſtand the meaning of the words (eſpecially comparing text with text) and ſo receive the ſanctifying impreſs upon our hearts. And thus is the Faith of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Catholike Reſolved. He receiveth the Bible from the hands or mouth of his Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (and perhaps firſt believeth them <hi>fide huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> that it is Gods Word:) He knoweth that this Book was written in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi> by the Prophets and Apoſtles, by Infallible Hyſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Univerſal Tradition. He knoweth that they did it by Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, by the Image of God which he findeth on it, and by the uncontroled Miracles by which they ſealed it. He believeth it to be True, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it thus proceeded from the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo is the Word of God who is moſt True.</p>

                  </gap>llible in judging of matters of Faith? 3. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Faith muſt be reſolved into this infallible judgement of theirs? Our intent in this preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute is to deal moſt with the ſecond, yet ſo as it is connexed with the other two; and therefore ſhall take them in on the by, but ſay leſs to them diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and the rather becauſe there is ſo much ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready by our Divines, as all the Papiſts on earth will never be able ſolidly to anſwer: To let paſs all thoſe beyond Sea that have effectually confounded them, we have <hi>Brittans</hi> enough to hold them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual work: as <hi>Jewell, Reignolds, Whitaker, White, Field, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher, Camero, Baronius, Davenant, Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> (to whom they have lately loſt their cauſe, by ſhewing in a vain and frivolous Reply, how little they have to ſay againſt him) with many more, who will either remain unanſwered, or the anſwers will be worſe to the adverſaries cauſe, then ſilence it ſelf; which we have ſufficient ground already to foretell.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt of theſe controverſies (to diſpatch it in ſhort) as we diſtinguiſh between <hi>Judicium De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretionis, Directionis, &amp; Deciſionis,</hi> a Judgement of Diſcretion, of Direction, and of Deciſion, ſo we kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>w that it is onely the later that properly denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateth a Judge in the publike and ordinary ſence. Take our doctrine in theſe few Propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſay that every Chriſtian hath a judgement of Diſcretion, to know that the Chriſtian Faith is true, and Scripture is the word of God: Or elſe he were no Chriſtian, or faith were not an act of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Reaſon, but a bruitiſh thing. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:61063:130"/>
we confeſs the Pope either hath or ought to have.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Every Paſtor of the Church hath a judgement of direction; that is, it belongeth to him by office to be a Director of the people, and to teach thoſe the Chriſtian Faith, that yet receive it not, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm thoſe in it that have received it: And they ought to have abilities for the work of this office. If therefore the Pope were a true Paſtor, Biſhop, or Preacher, this power we ſhould confeſs to be in him, as in others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It belongeth to theſe Teachers alſo, to be ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially careful to preſerve the ſacred Scriptures from corruption, and to deliver them down to poſterity in the purity as they receive them, and to tranſlate them into known tongues, that the people may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them. Though others alſo have a part in this work, yet the Paſtors of the Church have by Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the chiefeſt part.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It belongeth to them alſo to be witneſſes and informers of the people, how themſelves did receive the Faith and Scripture from their Anceſtors, and to ſhew them how it came down to our hands by certaine Infallible Tradition from Age to Age.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Church guides they are both Preſervers of the Scripture, Witneſſes of the Tradition, and Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the truth, and have ſuch a power of judging a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> belongeth to all theſe three.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In theſe acts of their office they ought to be Believed, and that on a threefold account. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the evidence which they ſhew to prove the truth of their Aſſertions: Though ſtrictly this is ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther to be called <hi>Learning,</hi> and ſo <hi>Knowing,</hi> then <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lieving</hi>:
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61063:130"/>
and is common to Teachers with any others that ſhew the ſame proofs; Yet it being ſuppoſed that ordinarily they have much more Knowledge in the things which they teach then other men have, therefore we may well ſay that it more belongeth to them to convince, and more efficacy is in their Teaching becauſe of their proofs, and better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment is due to their Teaching. 2. Such a Belief alſo is due to them as all men ſhould have in their own proſeſſion, wherein they have long ſtudyed and laid out their time and labor, and wherein they are commonly known to excell other men. Every man that is leſs ſtudyed in Law, Phyſicke, or any other Science or Art is bound in reaſon to give ſome credit to Lawyers, Phyſicians and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that Study and Practice thoſe Arts. This is but a humane Faith. 3. Beſides this credit before mentioned which Infidells themſelves may give to the Miniſters of the Goſpel (according to their capacities) there is a further credit due to them from profeſſed believers, and that is, as they are officers authorized by Chriſt, and have a promiſe of his aſſiſtance to the end of the world: which though it make them not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in all matters of Faith, yet doth it aſſure them of a more than common help of Chriſt, if they are his ſervants indeed.</p>
               <p n="7">7. There is more of this kind of Belief due to many Paſtors <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> than to one, and to the whole Church than to any part.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:61063:131"/>8. The credit of the Church or any Paſtors in witneſſing to the faith, dependeth on their compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency for ſuch a Teſtimony; which conſiſteth in their ſufficency or Ability, and their fidelity, which they are rationally to manifeſt that it may gaine cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with others.</p>
               <p n="9">9. In things which God hath left undetermined in Scriptures and committed to the Governors of the Church to determine of, they have a Deciſive Power. 1. For the Time or Place, or the like cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Gods worſhip they are neceſſary in General (<hi>viz.</hi> there muſt be ſome Time, Place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) but not in ſpecie (ſuch a Time, ſuch a Place is not neceſſary, unleſs it be ſome that God hath already made choice of) Here the Church guides muſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively Determine, whereupon the people are obliged to obey; unleſs in ſome extraordinary caſes, where the Determination is ſo perverſe and contrary to the General Rules which Scripture hath given for it, that it would overthrow the ſubſtance of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it ſelf. 2. And in caſe of Church cenſures, when any man is accuſed to deſerve Excommunication; the Church Governors have a Judicial Deciſive Power, as to thoſe ends, though not to make a man guilty that is Innocent, yet to oblige the people to avoid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the perſon whom they Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; except in ſuch palpable mal-adminiſtration and evident contradiction of the word of God, which may nullifie their ſentence (for even here their Power is not unlimited.)</p>
               <p n="10">10. No man or company of men (much leſs the Pope) hath a proper Deciſive Judicial Power in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Chriſtian faith, or whether the Scripture, or any part of it; be the word of God or not?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:61063:131"/>For the opening of this, underſtand what we mean by a Deciſive Judicial Power: to wit, ſuch as a Judge hath in a controverted cauſe, where the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff and Defendant muſt ſtand to his Judgement, be it right or wrong: ſo that though the ſentence be not juſt, yet muſt it be Deciſive and obligatory: ſo that he hath Power to Judge <hi>in utramque partem,</hi> on either ſide, and the judgement muſt be valid. Such a Deciſive power no creature hath in theſe caſes that we have now in hand.</p>
               <p>Where let it be ſtill remembred, that it is not the name, but the Thing that we contend about. If they will call that a Deciſive Judicial Power, which is ſo limited to one part, or ſide, that it ſhall not be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid or obligatory to the ſubject if it erre, or go on the other ſide, concerning which all men have a judgement of Diſcerning granted them by God (ſo far as they are able to Diſcerne, they have leave and authority) then we eaſily grant, that every Paſtor of the Church is thus far the Judge of Faith and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: That is, if any man doubt whether the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture be the Word of God, and ask a Preacher or Biſhop, he hath Power to ſay, Yea: but not to ſay No: But this is no Judicial Power: but a Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Witneſſing act: For the people are bound to diſobey them, if they erre, and therefore bound to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry whether they erre or not; and not to follow their judgement further then it is right and ſound: therefore they have no deciding Judicial Power: which I prove thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If the Pope or any other had ſuch a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Deciſive Power, then might they oblige us to Believe that there is no God, that Chriſt is not the Redeemer, that Scripture is not the word of God,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61063:132"/>
and ſo they might caſt Faith and Scripture out of the Church: But this is falſe and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; therefore the Pope hath no ſuch Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p>For the conſequence, it is manifeſt, ſuppoſing that the Pope ſhould give judgement againſt God, Chriſt, or Scripture, then men muſt (by this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) be bound to obey it, and forſake God, Chriſt, and Scripture for the Pope.</p>
               <p>Whereunto add a ſecond Argument from a further abſurdity: Then either ſuch as renounce God, Chriſt, and Scripture may be ſaved, or elſe God bindeth men (by the Pope) to renounce him and the faith to their own damnation. But both theſe conſequents are falſe and abominable: Therefore.</p>
               <p>I know they will here reply, that we muſt not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the Pope can err in his judgement, and therefore being infallible, he will certainly make no ſuch falſe Deciſion. To which I ſay, 1. Why then ſhould it be ſaid that God hath given Authority to decide in <hi>utramque partem,</hi> on either ſide? Doth God give a man Authority to do that, which he hath promiſed him and all others that he ſhal never do: But he will keep him from? This is to make Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to be impious, and his Grace to the Pope onely to hinder the execution of them in an impious way. Who dare ſay openly that [God hath given authority to the Pope to judge deciſively and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily that there is no God, Chriſt or Scripture, though he will graciouſly hinder him from ſo doing] If the Papiſts ſay that they do not ſay ſo, I would know then what their judicial power in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is? Is it onely this, that the Pope hath Power to judge, that there is a God, a Chriſt, a word of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:61063:132"/>
God? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why ſo have others as well he? If they ſhall dare to ſay, that matters of faith are not ſuch to us (that is, we be not obliged to believe them) till the Pope have determined them: I anſwer, What! is no Heathen or Infidel bound to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is a God, a Chriſt, a Scripture, till the Pope tell him ſo? Shall all Infidels be excuſed in judgement, that had the Goſpel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them by any other Chriſtians except the Pope or others in his name? Is no man on earth bound to believe in Chriſt that knows not the Popes mind in the matter? And muſt men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Pope before they believe in Chriſt? And muſt they believe in Chriſt onely becauſe the Pope bids them, or becauſe they firſt believe in the Pope? I do not think that either the eares of Good Chriſtians, or rational Infidels will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſuch doctrine. And what is this Believing in the Pope that muſt go firſt? Is it not to take him to be Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, and that Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was Chriſts Diſciple, who had a promiſe of infallibility, which is now devolved to the Pope: And muſt this be believed before men believe in Chriſt? We muſt believe what he promiſed, and who were his ſervants, before we believe in himſelf? This is a ground too like the Popiſh ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure.</p>
               <p>But perhaps, they may in time grow mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and tell us, that it is not in all points of faith, but ſome onely that the Pope is made Judge: He may not judge about Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether he be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> but about his Doctrines?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:61063:133"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. By what warrant will they diſtinguiſh, and claim power in one, which they have not in the other? 2. Is it all, or ſome of Chriſts Doctrines that the Pope is Judge of? If all, then it ſeems he muſt judge whether he that Believeth ſhall be ſaved, or not? Whether we ſhould love God or hate him? Whether we ſhould ſeek firſt Gods Kingdom, or worldly vanities? And whether a man ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Murder, Adultery, Theft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or not? May he decide theſe on either part? or on one only, as others may do? May he judge that there is no Judgement, Reſurrection, or life Everlaſting? I know they dare not ſay it: If it be but ſome of Chriſts Doctrines that the Pope is made Judge of, then let them tell us which it is, and give us their proofs, and they ſhall hear more from us. Let it be the ſmalleſt point they will imagine; Hath God given power to the Pope to contradict him and give him the Lye? If God ſaith, It is ſo: May the Pope ſay, It is not ſo? What if the Pope ſay that the Goſpel of <hi>Mathew</hi> or <hi>Luke</hi> or <hi>John</hi> is no part of Gods word? Muſt we believe him? What if he tell as that the world was made in five days and not in ſix? Muſt we believe him? 2. If they yet flye to his infallibility, I ſhall ſpeak more to that anon (though the former anſwer may well ſuffice them) But to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. The Scripture is Gods Law. The Pope is not the Judge of Gods Law: therefore he is not the Judge of Scripture.</p>
               <p>The Major I hope no Chriſtian will deny. The Minor is evident from the nature and uſe of Laws and Judgements: The Law is <hi>Norma judicis in judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cando:</hi> the Judges Rule: He is not to Judge the Law, but the cauſe of particular perſons by that Law. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:61063:133"/>
as to the right guidance of his own act of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive Judging the cauſe of the perſon, he hath a Judgement of diſcretion concerning the ſence of the Law; but, as if he Judge upon a falſe expoſition of the Law, the party may appeal from him, ſo (which concerneth our preſent caſe) he hath no power to Judge the Law it ſelf: As he cannot make a plaine text to bear a falſe ſence, or oblige the ſubject to believe a falſe ſence: ſo in a doubtful caſe it belongeth to the Law-givers onely to interpret their own Laws. Onely a ſentence of a lawful Judge grounded upon a falſe expoſition, may ſometime be executed among men where juſtice cannot be had: but no man is bound to Believe that it is true and juſt: <hi>James</hi> tells men what it is to pretend to be a Judge of the Law, in ſtead of doing it, and leaving that to the one Law-giver, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4, 11, 12. And if the Pope be made Judge of every controverted difficulty in Scripture, then why is he ſo unfaithful that he hath not hitherto written us an infallible Commentary on it? and why doth he not determine all the controverſies about it, that among his own followers remain yet undetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? (of which more anon.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. If the Pope be made the Deciding Judge of Faith and Scripture, then either of the plain points, or onely of the controverted difficulties, or of both: But not of the plain points: For 1. That which is evident and not under controverſie, needs no Judge: To the ignorant there may be need of an interpreter and teacher, but not of a Judge: 2. Such texts of Scripture do oblige us whether the Pope Judge of them or not: Therefore there is no need of his judgement that they may oblige us. Who dare think that a man is not bound by the word of God,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:61063:134"/>
to love God above all, to believe the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and of us, to love Chriſts diſciples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unleſs he know the judgement of the Pope. Do not all Laws of the Land oblige the ſubject upon the bare legiſlation and promulgation, before the Judge med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with them? If they did not firſt oblige us to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there were no place for the Judge to ſentence us to puniſhment for diſobedience. It is the Legiſlator that oblige<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h to duty by his Law, proclaimed or any way publiſhed in his name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But judgement interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to oblige men to puniſhment, and bring it to execution, and to help them to that which by the Law is their right. If therefore it be evident in the very nature of Laws and judgement, that we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by Gods Laws to Believe and obey them in the ſeveral particulars before any judgement of the Popes; it is then but dotage to talk of a Judicial Deciſive power in the Pope to oblige men to Believe thoſe ſame doctrines, and obey thoſe ſame precepts of the word. And for the dark and controverted texts. 1. Thoſe are not of that moment, as that mens ſalvation muſt lye upon the expoſition of them. The points abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation are plainly delivered. 2. Obſcurity ſhews the need of a Teacher, but not of a Judge. At leaſt its plain, that when any Teacher ſhall remove the obſcurity, thoſe texts oblige us as well as the plaineſt. 3. As I ſaid, If the Pope be Judge of all difficult controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted texts, he is an unfaithful Judge that will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them to us, and decide ſo many controverſies as yet depend. What good will it be to the Church to have ſuch a Judge of difficult controverted texts of Scripture, as in the conſciouſneſs of his ignorance dare not give us his judgement? but hath left them
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61063:134"/>
undecided theſe fifteen hundred years? This dumbe Oracle that hath eyes and ſees not, and a mouth but ſpeaks not, is not a fit foundation for the Churches Faith. 5. Where God calleth men to Office and Power, he accompliſheth or fitteth them in ſome meaſure for the performance of it: but God hath not fitted all Popes, no nor any, to Jugde Deciſively of all controverted difficultyes in Scripture, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: Therefore he hath not made them Judges of them. The Minor ſhall be further proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non: Many Popes have been ignorant, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned; many Heretickes, unfit to decide all ſuch controverſies; and they have ſhewed their unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by their non performance or ill perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>The great Objection of the Papiſts is this.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>What! Shall every one be the Judge of Scripture? and take it in what ſence he pleaſe? ſhall every unlearned man or woman expound it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own fancies? then we ſhall have variety of expoſitions. Whether is it fitter for the Church or every ſimple fellow to be Judge</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Neither? Hath God made ſubjects to be Judges of his Lawes by which they muſt live, and by which they muſt be judged? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they nor your Pope, muſt be Judges of the Lawes, in a proper ſence, but obeyers of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſay not that the people ſhould expound the Scriptures as Teachers of others (unleſs in their own callings, as to the children ſervants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when they are able) This we reſerve to the Officers of the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:61063:135"/>3. Nor do we ſay that any people muſt expound Scripture according to their own fancies or miſ-guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conceits, but according to the true meaning of them. 4. Nor ſhould they in difficult caſes which are paſt their underſtandings, preſume of their own wit to know the right meaning; but have recourſe to the Teachers that God hath ſet over them, that ſo by their help they may learn the meaning of that word which they underſtood not. 5. And if their Teachers be ſingular, or give them juſt cauſe to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their skill or fidelity, they have more reaſon to regard the Judgement of the Judicious, then of the ignorant, and of the whole Church then of any one or few; ſo far as the credit or authority of men, muſt ſupport a learner while he is a learning. 6. But what! Is it indeed ſuch a monſtrous heretical conceit in the eyes of a Papiſt, that every Chriſtian ſhould have a <hi>Judicium diſcretionis,</hi> a Judgement of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to perceive and diſcern which is truth and which is falſhood? Good Lord, whether will the heat of contention carry men? Why if they muſt not have this diſcerning judgement. 1. Then God doth bind them all to be fools, and ignorant. 2. And then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and the Chriſtian Faith, are the endowments of bruits that know not what they hold or do, and not of Reaſonable men. 3. Or elſe they that will be Chriſtians muſt have no Faith or Knowledge; which is a contradiction. Is not Faith an act of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion? Muſt not he that believeth the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Everlaſting Life, believe them with his own underſtanding? And doth he not in believing them, Judge them to be True, and Judge the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary doctrine to be falſe? 4. Why will you read, or preach Scripture to the people, if you would
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61063:135"/>
not have them receive it, by a judgment of diſcerning? would you not have their judgment diſcern the Truth of what God hath written, or the Prieſt ſhal preach to them? 5. Doubtleſs you will allow them a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Diſcretion, about the Popes Decrees and Canons, and your own Determinations. How can they believe you, if they do not by judgement diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the things you ſay to be true? And why will you not allow them the like towards God and his Word? Will you ſay, It is their duty to believe the Pope, and their ſin to believe God? Or its their duty to underſtand the Popes Laws, and their ſin to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Gods Laws? Why? what do you ſay leſs when you yield them a judgement of diſcretion as to the Pope or Church, and deny it in Reſpect to the Word of God? If you ſay that they will miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I anſ. 1. So will the Pope and the beſt and wiſeſt man on earth in ſome part: becauſe while we are here, we know but in part. 2. Their error is their ſin: But doth it follow that they may not ſee at all, for fear of miſſing their way? Muſt they put out their eyes, and be led by the Pope, for fear of erring? Muſt they not know or labor to know, for fear of miſtaking? Will any Maſter take this well of his ſervant, to put out his eyes, or do nothing, for fear of doing his work amiſs? Or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to go his journey, leſt he miſs the way? Then we muſt not judge of the Popes Laws neither, and conſequently, not judge them to be true, for fear of erring in our judgement. When you prove that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the true Church, would you not have the people judge of your proof for fear of err<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? This is even to make beaſts of Chriſtians. 3. What are Teachers for, but to guide them, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61063:136"/>
help them to underſtand. If you are afraid leſt they ſhould erre, be the more diligent in inſtructing them. But this is the difference between the work of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Teacher and ours. They make it their work to put out mens eyes that they may have the loading of them, becauſe they are troubled with an imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their ſight, and therefore will erre if thoſe imperfect eyes be left in their heads: we make it our work, by all means we can uſe, to cure their eye ſight that they may be able to ſee themſelves, in the mean time adviſing them, while their eyes are under cure, not wholly to truſt to them, but to uſe the helpe of others, to ſhew them the way, and to tell them of dangers. The Proteſtant will ſet his Childe to School that he may learn to know, that which through childiſhneſs he knows not: But according to the Popiſh way, we ſhould forbid them all books or learning, leſt they miſunderſtand them; and let them never know any thing leſt they know amiſs. The next ſtep, is to ſend them to Bedlam. The Apoſtle would have men have their ſenſes exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed to diſcern Good and Evill, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts would not have the people to have a judgement of Diſcerning: If they muſt not Diſcern, they muſt be ignorant: When God ſo much requireth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolleth knowledge.</p>
               <p>But I'le leave this Queſtion, and paſs to the next.</p>
               <p>Qu. 2. <hi>Whether the Pope be Infallible, in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive judgement which he pretendeth to</hi>? Which we deny.</p>
               <p>But before I come to give the reaſons of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61063:136"/>
I ſhall further declare our judgement about the whole matter of the Churches Infallibility, that the true ſtate of the controverſie may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
               <p>And 1. We eaſily grant that as there is an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive certainty in all points of the Chriſtian Faith, and in the very truth, ſo the Pope is infallible while he believeth and declareth nothing but the truth. He and every man elſe that ſpeaks according to Gods word, is ſo far infallible, becauſe that word is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. They need not thank us for this conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We grant that neither the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (if a true Church) nor any other particular true Church can erre in fundamentals, or in points of abſolute neceſſity to ſalvation, <hi>in ſenſu compoſito</hi>; that is, while they remain a true Church, they never deny the eſſentials of a true Church: For if they once deny the eſſentials, they do <hi>eo nomine</hi> ceaſe to be a true Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We grant that Chriſts univerſal Church ſhall never deny any one point of Faith eſſential to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, or abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation: For then Chriſt ſhould have no true Church on earth (when the whole ſhould thus Apoſtatize or turn Hereticks) and all the then preſent world ſhould be damned.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Church as Reaſonable ſenſible men are infallible in many matters of fact, of which they may give us unerring reports: as that, This Bible was delivered as the word of God by their Anceſtors, as <hi>they</hi> might teſtifie it was delivered to them: and that this Creed or ſum of Faith alſo was thus delivered in the words now in uſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:61063:137"/>5. There is an infallible certainty in the evidence which the former Church hath left, and the preſent Church poſſeſſet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to prove that this ſame Scripture was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, and was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the firſt Churches, and from them, down to us: and that multitudes of miracles were wrought for the confirmation of the Doctrine contained in them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. An illiterate perſon may have an infallible cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that all points neceſſary to ſalvation are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in certain tranſlations of Scripture, and that ſo far, and much further, they are truely tranſlated, and that ſuch things there are in that Book as the Readers affirm there to be, though himſelf cannot read them. For all this is infallibly diſcovered by common conſent, and eſpecially of adverſaries: When all men that are certainly able to judge, and are honeſt and impartial, affirm it without doubt, and thoſe that would gladly contradict it, as being by their intereſts carryed thereto, yet cannot do it, or at leaſt not with any conſiderable pretence: This gives men as infallible a proof, as the common teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of men doth, that there is ſuch a City as <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Paris</hi> which we never ſaw.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And we further grant, all that Teaching and Witneſſing power to the Church officers, which was expreſſed under the laſt Queſtion; and all that due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Belief and obedience to them, which was there aſſerted. So much for our Conceſſions.</p>
               <p>But we deny, 1. That either the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> or a General Council are naturally or ſupernatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly priviledged from all error in matters of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will, or that they are priviledged from the danger or poſſibility of teaching theſe their errors to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61063:137"/>
others, even to the Church. 2. We deny that the Pope or the <hi>Romane</hi> Clergy are ſecured from the danger of Apoſtaſie or Hereſie: They may fall ſo far as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Fundamentals or Eſſentials of Chriſtianity: though the Univerſal Church ſhall never ſo fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>We ſhall firſt ſpeak of the Popes Infallibility, and afterward of a General Council, that we may ſpeak to the ſeveral parties among the divided Papiſts herein.</p>
               <p>And againſt the Popes Infallibility we thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 1, They that lay claim to this Infallibility, do give us no proof of their claim: Therefore they cannot expect that we ſhould believe them. The proof lyeth on the pretenders, who give us no proof.</p>
               <p>If they can prove it, it muſt be either by his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural perfection, or ſome ſupernatural endowment, by which the Pope muſt be more Infallible then other men: The former they pretend not to (and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) The later they do pretend to: But, if God ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally have aſcertained all Popes of an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility in matters of Faith, then he hath done this either by his written Word, or by unwritten Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or both: by which it muſt to us be proved: But he hath done it neither by his written Word, nor by unwritten Tradition. For Tradition they muſt ſhew it us, either in certain monuments of the Church which are in ſtead of writing (but that they cannot do) or elſe in the mindes of all the members of the Church. For that which concerneth all their
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61063:138"/>
Salvation, muſt be delivered to all: But this they cannot ſhew: Nay we ſhew them the contrary: that is, the greateſt part of the preſent Church on earth denying any ſuch Tradition: and the moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Writers of the former Ages, telling us the contrary, and all taking the Pope as fallible, ſo that they cannot give us one line of any one Father or Council for many hundred years after Chriſt, that ever had ſuch a conceit as theirs. And if they will pretend to a private Tradition which none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have received and are entruſted with, and ſo make themſelves the abſolute Judges of their own cauſe, and give us no proof but their own words, we will believe them as faſt as we can, but we muſt deſire them not to be too haſty with us.</p>
               <p>And for the written Word they cannot thence prove a grant of their infallibility. 1. Becauſe they tell us that we cannot know the Scripture to be the Word of God, but by their infallible judgement: Therefore we muſt know their judgement to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible firſt; and therefore it is firſt to be known ſome other way, and not by Scripture. Indeed here they have long tired themſelves in their Circle, which ſome of them would hide by vain words if they could, but <hi>Holden</hi> and others of them are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to confeſs it, and that they have no way out but by retiring to the univerſal teſtimony or tradition as an infallible evidence, in ſtead of the Authoritative judgement, or infallibility, or private Tradition of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> They tell us that we cannot know the Scripture to be the Word of God, but by the infallible judgement of their Church (And that is in the Iſſue of the Pope) And when we call for
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61063:138"/>
the proof of that infallibility, they refer us to the Scripture. So that this is plainly to ſay that neither Scripture nor Papal infallibility can be proved; and ſo to forſake both Popery and Chriſtianity: Then it ſeems, no man can know the Popes infallibility but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the authority of Gods word, which cannot it ſelf be known till that infallibility be known. It muſt be Gods Grant, written or unwritten that muſt prove their infallibility: But that word or Grant, written or unwritten, cannot be known to be of God, till we firſt know their Authority to judge, and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in judging: It evidently follows therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, that neither one nor the other can be known, becauſe no one of them can be known till the other be firſt known.</p>
               <p>But 2 If we could know the Scripture to be Gods Word, before we know their infallibility in judging, yet we cannot know the true ſence of that Scripture (as they confidently tell us) firſt: Well then, I am one that doubt of the Popes infallibility, and demand his proof: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> turns me to <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. <hi>I have prayed that thy faith fail not.</hi> I muſt know how I ſhall be ſure that this is the meaning of that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture (which is ſo little apparent to an ordinary eye) He hath nothing to tell me, but that the Church ſaith ſo: And how ſhall I know that the Church is in the right? Why becauſe it cannot erre. And how ſhall I know that? Why by this Text. And ſo they are amazed in another Circle, paſt recovery. For they expreſly and frequently tell us, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is no good evidence but when it is rightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded: and that no expoſition is right but that which is given by the infallible judgement of the Church; and ſo the Popes infallibility cannot be
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:61063:139"/>
known till the true meaning of Texts be known that prove it; and the true meaning of thoſe Texts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known, till their infallible judgement be firſt known: What follows therefore, but that neither of them can be known? The true product of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. This is the uſual ſucceſs of falſe arguing for a good cauſe; to overthrow both the cauſe and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſo do the Papiſts as much as in them lyes overthrow both Chriſts Doctrine and their own.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But let us examine the particular proofs from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that they bring His firſt proof (<hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Pontif. cap.</hi> 3.) is from <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. [Simon, Simon, <hi>Satan hath deſired,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but I have prayed for thee that thy faith faile not, and when thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi>] Doth this Text ſay that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is infallible? Yes, if you will take <hi>Bellarmines</hi> word. And firſt he tells us that (among themſelves) there are three ſeveral expoſitions given of this Text; and it is but one of the three that will ſerve their turn: Good ſtill! And how ſhall we know that this one which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hit on, is the right? Let any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial man peruſe his reaſons, and make his beſt of them: For indeed there is no reaſon in them. But on the contrary I ſhall preſume to tell them, why I ſuppoſe that this Text doth not talk of the Popes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility. 1. Becauſe here is never a word either of the Pope, or of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of Infallibility. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the thing here promiſed is expreſly reſtrained to one individual perſon, <hi>Simon.</hi> 3. The thing here promiſed was about <hi>Peters</hi> perſonal Faith, and not about infallibility in judging. For 1. In that reſpect that Satan deſired to ſift <hi>Peter,</hi> in that reſpect Chriſt promiſed the not failing of his Faith. But it was in
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61063:139"/>
reſpect of his perſonal Faith, and not his Cathedral judgement that Satan is here ſaid to deſire to ſift him: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. It is expreſly ſaid to be [his Faith] that ſhould not fail: But his Faith, is not his tongue or Cathedral ſentence: words be not Faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is not all degree of infallibility or not failing that Chriſt prayeth for to <hi>Simon</hi>: but he onely pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that his Faith may not be overcome, foreſeeing that it would ſhake, and that he would deny him: So that this is no promiſe of perfect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility to <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf as appeared by the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf was to be <hi>converted</hi> from ſome failing: Therefore he was not exempted from it: And the caſe here in hand is ſuch as that <hi>converſion</hi> had reſpect to. Therefore it was not, that he ſhould not fail in Cathedral Determinations; for he was not <hi>converted</hi> from ſuch. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> here moſt immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly would intimate that the text ſpeaks not of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> converſion from any ſin, but of his <hi>turning</hi> to his brethren to ſpeak to them; as if it were [When thou turneſt thee to ſpeak to thy Brethren, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them] Nothing but the Popes infallibility, or the groſs fallibility of common reaſon, could make a learned man think that this is the ſence of the Text.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Papiſts pretend that here is ſomewhat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>Peter</hi> which the reſt of the Apoſtles were not partakers of: But that is not ſo: For, if it were (as it was) that he ſhould not Apoſtatize: the ſame was given to them all (except <hi>Judas</hi>) If it had been that he ſhould be infallible in teaching the Church, ſo were the reſt too as well as he. The reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61063:140"/>
of mentioning <hi>Peter</hi> in particular, was becauſe Chriſt foreſaw the temptations and lamentable fall of <hi>Peter</hi> in denying Chriſt with curſing and oathes: from which he had need of a ſpecial converſion, that God might not forſake him and give him up to a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall failing of his Faith.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Two things, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> are here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for <hi>Peter:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Bannes in</hi> 2.2. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>a.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 149. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining the text to <hi>Peter</hi> alone.</note> The one is that he himſelf ſhould never loſe the faith, nor fall as to his faith. The ſecond is, that he as Pope ſhould never teach any thing contrary to faith, or that none ſhould ever be found in his ſeat that ſhould ſo do: Of which priviledges (ſaith he) perhaps the firſt did not deſcend to his ſucceſſors, but doubtleſs the laſt did.</p>
               <p>But note here what a paſs this learned Cardinal hath brought his great cauſe to. 1. The text ſpeaks but of one thing and not of two: <hi>Faith</hi> is one thing, and <hi>Cathedral determination</hi> is another. Doth Chriſt mean both, when he names but one? Expreſly it is onely the firſt priviledge that he promiſeth <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and ſaith not a word of the later: It was his Heart, and not his tongue that was the ſeat of faith, and that Chriſt eſtabliſheth: which is alſo evident by the iſſue: for ſure his tongue failed by ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the faith, when he curſt and ſwore that he knew not the man. 2. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth that this priviledge [that his own faith ſhould not fail] extendeth not perhaps to the Popes: ſo that for all this their faith may fail: If ſo 1. Then the onely priviledge mentioned in the Text extendeth not to them: For it ſpeaks of no more: The text promiſeth them nothing to the Pope, but what it never promiſed
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:61063:140"/>
to <hi>Peter.</hi> 2. And if it did promiſe both priviledges to <hi>Peter</hi> (that neither Faith nor tongue ſhould fail) how can <hi>Bellarmine</hi> prove that one part belongeth to the Pope, when he confeſſeth the other doth not? The Text ſpeaks but to the ſame perſon, and not in one half to one, and in the other half to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. I may well argue therefore in this manner: To whomſoever Chriſt here promiſeth that his faith ſhall not fail, to him onely doth he ſpeak in this text: But he promiſeth onely to <hi>Peter</hi> here that his faith ſhould not fail, therefore it is onely <hi>Peter</hi> and not the Popes that he ſpeaks of. The Major is clear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the intelligible ſence of the words (and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath not yet proved a myſtical ſence) The Minor is confeſſed by himſelf.</p>
               <p>Laſtly <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith (<hi>de verbo dei li.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3.) that <hi>[Onely out of the litteral ſence of Scripture, effectual arguments are to be fetched]</hi> But this great argument of his for the Popes infallibility is not fetcht out of the literal ſence of Scripture: therefore by his own confeſſion it is uneffectual and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Text which he cites to this uſe, is <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. <hi>[On this Rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it]</hi> A double ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument he would fetch from hence. One from the Name <hi>Rocke,</hi> the other from the nature of a <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> which both imply firmeneſs. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Note that here is in the Text not one word of the Pope, of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> more then any other, or of infallibility. 2. How doth he prove, that by the <hi>Rocke</hi> is not meant <hi>Peters</hi> Faith, or that Doctrine which he confeſſed but <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf? 3 If he had proved it, are not all the Prophets and Apoſtles as
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61063:141"/>
well as <hi>Peter</hi> called the foundation? <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. So that here is no more promiſed to him, then what was elſwhere promiſed and given to the reſt: Onely his preſent confeſſion, occaſioned the promiſe to be made expreſly and particular at that time to him. 4. As the reſt of the Apoſtles were the <hi>Foundation</hi> on which we are built, and yet their ſucceſſors are not ſo: So though <hi>Peter</hi> were the <hi>Foundation,</hi> it followeth not that all or any of his ſucceſſors are ſo.</p>
               <p>The third text which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> citeth is <hi>Joh.</hi> laſt <hi>[Feed my Sheep.]</hi> Where note again, 1. That here is not a word of the Pope, or <hi>Rome,</hi> or infallibility. 2. Did not Chriſt bid the reſt of the Apoſtles <hi>Feed</hi> as well as <hi>Peter</hi>? Sure <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. He bid them all, <hi>Go teach all Nations, baptizing them, and teaching them to obſerve all things whatever he commanded them.</hi> And what could <hi>Peter</hi> do more in Feeding? Yea thirdly, Are not all Paſtors, though inferior to Apoſtles bound to Feed the Sheep of Chriſt? and yet it follows not thence that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would next prove this from [The High Prieſts wearing the Urim and Thummim, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.] When he firſt confeſſeth that it is not agreed among Jews or Chriſtians what theſe are: And yet it will ſerve him for a proof. 2. The Prieſts were not infallible for all their Urim and Thummim: therefore no more is the Pope. They judged Chriſt not to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and therefore crucified him. They lived and died Infidels, and hardened the people in the ſame Infidelity, for which they were broken off and unchurched.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:61063:141"/>3. And whereas he argueth that the High Prieſt was infallible becauſe the people were to go to him for reſolution of difficulties, and obey them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. I muſt ſay that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had ſome fault in his eyes that cauſed him to overlook the Judge, and name onely the High Prieſt. God ſendeth them to the Judge, who was the chief Magiſtrate in thoſe dayes, as well as to the High Prieſt; as any man that will read the text may ſee. If therefore the one of them be infallible, becauſe of this, why is not the other ſo too? But perhaps they will make the Pope to be the ſucceſſor both of the Magiſtrate and Prieſt, and ſo to be the univerſal Emperor as well as the univerſal Biſhop; and uſe both his ſwords, that ſo this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe may belong onely to him: For he will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant every King or Judge to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By this rule the reſt of the Prieſts alſo ſhould be infallible: For the people were alſo to receive the Law at their mouthes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When was there ever one Prieſt in any age ſo impudent at <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and his faction are, to plead for or pretend an infallibility in themſelves? Let them name one Prieſt or perſon if they can, that ever had ſuch a conceit of themſelves, except it were Gods Prophets in the matters of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</p>
               <p n="6">6. What if the Jews High Prieſt had been infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Whats that to the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> any more then to another man? Hath he indeed yet proved himſelf ſucceſſor of the Jews High Prieſt? Except as a corrupter of the Law, and a perſecutor of the Church of Chriſt.</p>

May I not well ſay that it is no marvaile that they are ſuch ill friends to Scripture, who have no more Scripture (that is, none at all) to befriend the very foundation of their cauſe? And may I not juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recite again <hi>Bellarmines</hi> own concluſion <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de verbo Dei c.</hi> 3. and from thence ſhew them that their cauſe is built upon confeſſed fraud and vanity [<hi>It is agreed b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But yet one other Argument he hath, though not from Scripture, and no more: and that is from a double pretended experience: And his firſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is [<hi>That in all the other Patriarchal ſeats there have been Hereticks, but not in that of</hi> Rome.] But here 1. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> muſt be judge, or the Pope who is a party, before all the Patriarchs can be thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. 2. And what if that were true? Can he ſay the like of all the Biſhops, as well as Patriarchs? If not, they may as well hence prove themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, as the Pope can do. 3. Whether ever there were in the chair at <hi>Rome</hi> either Pope <hi>Liberius</hi> an Arrian, Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> a Monothel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:61063:142"/>His ſecond experiment is that <hi>[The Pope without a Council hath condemned many Hereſies, which upon that very account have been taken for true Hereſies by the whole Church of Chriſt] Anſ.</hi> But you muſt firſt unchurch the greateſt part of the Catholike Church, and damne moſt of the Chriſtians on earth, the <hi>Greeks, Armenians, Abaſſines,</hi> &amp;c. and make your own faction, to be the <hi>whole Church of Chriſt,</hi> before you will ever give us the leaſt proof of this. All the Church doth not do that which your flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers do. Nor did the ancient Church do any ſuch thing. As other Biſhops condemned Hereſies as well as the Pope, ſo many a Hereſie was judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch by the faithful, without any more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of the Pope then another Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</p>
               <p>Having ſeen thus how little their great Champion hath to ſay for the Popes infallibility, I could will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly have look't about me into ſome of the reſt of them, to ſee if they can ſay any more; but that its known that moſt of them tread the ſame path Only I may not over paſs the new way that ſome of them have taken up of late, to prove their infallibility, and to avoid their common Circle. And this you may ſee in the Jeſuites late ſuperficial anſwer to <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling worth.</hi> Forſooth, they tell us, that when they prove the infallibility of their Church from Scripture, it is but for our ſakes becauſe we confeſs the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Scripture, but not of their Church. But when they go according to the true nature and order of the matter, then they ſet the Church before the Scripture, and independantly of it.] The reaſon of this Jeſuite (ſuppoſed to be <hi>Knot</hi>) is this [Becauſe the Church is before the Scripture, and becauſe the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:61063:143"/>
Miracles wrought by the Apoſtles did firſt prove their own infallibility, and from thence ſecondarily the infallibility of their Doctrine. And when we are in high expectations of the proofs of the <hi>Romane</hi> infallibility by his Arguments which are Independent of Scripture, and before the belief of it, he tells <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s that it is by the like Aaguments as the Apoſtles proved their infallibility, which he thus enumerateth <hi>So the Church of God by the like ſtill continued Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Notes, of many great and manifeſt Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Sanctity, Sufferings Victory over all ſorts of enemies, converſion of Infidels, all which Notes are daily more and more, conſpicuous and convincing, and ſhall be encreaſing the longer the world ſhall laſt</hi>] And withall he tells us, that [<hi>Theſe Miracles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>prove them to be infallible in</hi> All <hi>things, and not</hi> onely <hi>in ſome, or elſe we cannot know which thoſe ſome be, and what to believe and what not.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Thus you have the ſum of the new Fundamentals of the Romiſh faith, and of the famous confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Chillingworth.</hi> But all theſe Knots are eaſily loſed without cutting; yea ſhake them onely, and they fall looſe like Juglers Knots.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We eaſily grant that Chriſt the head of the Church was before the Doctrine by himſelf deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the fleſh, as it containeth many things ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the old Teſtament and the doctrine of <hi>John,</hi> Baptiſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its evident that Chriſt himſelf gathered his firſt Goſpel-Church by preaching his Doctrine, that is, he drew them to be his Diſciples, by convincing them that he was the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Lamb of God that takes away the ſins of the world; ſo that this his Doctrine was before this his Church.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:61063:143"/>3. We grant that the Apoſtles were Apoſtles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore themſelves did preach the Goſpel as Apoſtles: But it was the Goſpel, and preacht by Chriſt, before they preach't it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We eaſily grant that both Apoſtles and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel were long before the writing of this Goſpel, which we call the holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We grant that the Apoſtles Miraculous works did ſufficiently prove, not ſome onely, but all the Doctrine which they delivered to the Church or any part of it, in the name of Chriſt and as his: For though they confirmed onely thoſe Doctrines which were delivered in execution of their Commiſſion, yet ſeeing God would not have ſet to this ſeal, if they had gone beyond and againſt their Commiſſion, therefore it alſo aſſureth us that they kept cloſe to it. But this proved them not infallible before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that Commiſſion, nor afterward in any point which they ſhould deliver as their private opinion, which they fathered, not on the Inſpiration of the Spirit. The Apoſtles were not infallible about Chriſts Death, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion, when they underſtood them not: The Diſciples were not infallible about the Acceptableneſs of Infants to Chriſt, when they forbad them to be brought. <hi>Thomas</hi> was not infallible about Chriſts Reſurrection when he believed it not. <hi>Peter</hi> was not infallible when he gave Chriſt that Satanical councel, for which he was <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>antum non</hi> (almoſt) excommunicated, <hi>Mat</hi> 16.22, 23. Even preſently after the great promiſe to him; Nor when he denyed that he knew Chriſt, with curſes and oathes; nor when he diſſembled and <hi>Barnabas</hi> with him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We maintain that the Apoſtles Doctrine thus
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:61063:144"/>
ſealed by Miracles, and Delivered in Writing to the Churches, doth carry with it an Atteſtation from God of its infallibility, if there be never more Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle wrought in the world. For the proof of this I refer the Reader to my Determination in a Book Intitled, <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonableneſs of Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. It is this ſealed Doctrine contained in Scripture, and preached by Miniſters, which converteth men to Chriſt, and maketh them Chriſtians, and therefore it is in order before the preſent Church and the cauſe of it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We deny and confidently deny that God hath Commiſſioned the Pope to do the work which he Commiſſioned the Apoſtles to do, and gave them the power of Miracles to confirme, that is, to Atteſt the Works, Sufferings, Reſurrection, and words of Chriſt as eye or ear witneſſes of them from himſelf: and to be the firſt promulgators of ſome of his Laws to the univerſal Church, and to deliver down an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ſealed Scripture, to all ſucceeding Ages, and by the ordinary working of Miracles to convince the unbelieving world. Let him ſhew his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for this Apoſtleſhip if he would be believed.</p>
               <p n="9">9. We as confidently deny that the Pope is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, or is inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles were, that ſo they might infallibly deliver us Chriſts doctrine.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And they cannot expect that we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve till we have ſome proof of it, that the Pope, or the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath the Power of working Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, or are endowed with a ſpirit of Miracles, or that they can convince thoſe that deny the Scriptures by their own Miracles that they are the true Church,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61063:144"/>
or that ever they confirmed thoſe points by Miracles, which is, now called Popery.</p>
               <p>Thus much to let the Jeſuite know where we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from him: And now to the point. We call for his proofs, which he here mentioneth to us in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral names <hi>Non eſſe &amp; non apparere</hi>; are to us all one. Give us ſufficient proof of your ſealing the Doctrine of Popery by Miracles, or the Popes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility by Miracles, as the Apoſtles did the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and their preaching, and then you ſhall car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the cauſe, and we profeſs that we will rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly paſs into your Tents, and proclaim you Prophets or Apoſtles of Chriſt: But when we live among you, and ſo did our Fathers before us, and hear you prate and boaſt of Miracles, when we cannot ſee that ever you did ſo much as make a dead flea alive again, nor cannot ſee the leaſt Miracle from you, if we would ride or go as far as our horſe or legs can carry us, to ſee it, what can we take you for but the moſt ſhameleſs ſort of chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?</p>
               <p>If you could accuſe us of negligence, as if we might ſee your Miracles if we would but travail for it, or of unbelief, as if we denyed that which we have evidence of, we might bear the blame: but there's no ſuch thing. I profeſs as weak as I am, I would go many a hundred miles to ſee ſuch Miracles as you boaſt of, if I had ſufficient ground of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation that I might not loſe my labor. And I would read over any Volumes that I were able to find ſuciffient Teſtimony of them. But where is this teſtimony? <hi>Knot</hi> refers us to <hi>Brierly,</hi> and others to ſuch like reciters of their Fables. And when all is done, there are three ſorts of Miracles that they
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61063:145"/>
ſpeak of. 1. The Miracles of the Apoſtles and firſt Churches mention in Scripture, and theſe are againſt Popery; ſo that we may well ſay that the doctrine which contradicteth Popery is confirmed by Miracles in that the Scripture is ſo confirmed. 2. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of the following Churches till ſix hundred. Theſe were comparatively few, and leſs certain, and fabulous mixtures in many of the reports of them. But whatever they were, they were no confirmation of the Popes Infallibility, or univerſal Epiſcopacy or Juriſdiction, which neither the Inſtruments of thoſe Miracles, nor any man elſe on earth, as far as can be proved did then believe. And whereas there were ſome Ceremonious fopperies that were then uſed, which the Papiſts do yet uſe, and would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us that theſe Miracles were confirmations of them, we deny it, and profeſs the nullity of their pretended proofs. They ſay, [If they be not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in all things, how can we believe them in any thing?] I anſw. Becauſe that 1. Their Miracles are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Atteſtations to ſome thing, that is, to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, but not to all things that they may think! Nor could they ever work a Miracle to confirm ſuch private opinions. 2. And the ſubſtance of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity which their Miracles do atteſt, were more unqueſtionable before atteſted by Scripture and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Miracles; whereas the errors which they intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced are contradicted by Scripture and the Miracles that atteſted it.</p>
               <p>And whereas they would make the Apoſtles caſe to be like that of the Fathers: It is very much different. For though the Apoſtles Miracles were atteſtations to all their doctrine, as well as to ſome part; that was becauſe they were Officers Commiſſioned by
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61063:145"/>
Chriſt to that work, to deliver his doctrine firſt to the world, as inſpired infallible men, and to ſeal it to poſterity for future certainty: But the Fathers had no ſuch work in Commiſſion; but onely to preach the doctrine thus ſealed and delivered them by the Apoſtles, and therefore their Miracles were to another more private, and reſtrained uſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Commiſſions and work; that is, to convert thoſe perſons to the faith that knew of them, by a ſubſervient atteſtation, ſo that it could oblige none to believe them in other things, much leſs in their miſtakes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third ſort of Miracles are thoſe of later times contained in their Legends. And ſeriouſly, would the Jeſuites perſwade us that theſe are of equal authority with the Miracles mentioned in Scripture? or any whit like them?

of their own Writers do openly Note for Lyars. <note n="e" rend="inter">Whites <hi>Works</hi> fol. pag. <hi>158.</hi>
                  </note> Which challenge the Popiſh Replyer had no mind it ſeems to take up.</p>
               <p>But though it belong to the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> to prove their Miracles (which prove their Infallibility with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scripture) and not to us to prove the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, yet I ſhall try to ſhame their confidence by a few pertinent Queſtions, when it ſhall appear how little they have to ſay in anſwer to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 1. And firſt I deſire to know of them whether the Miracles that prove their infallibility without Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture are wrought by the <hi>Preſent</hi> Church, or by the Church of former ages onely? If by the preſent, why cannot we ſee them? Why are we ſtill ſent to Saint <hi>Brigit,</hi> or Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> or Saint Somebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that is long ago dead and gone? We thought once we had had one neer us here, I mean, the Boy of <hi>Bilſon,</hi> who did wondrous things in favor of the Papiſts; but in the Iſſue, by the induſtry of Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> he was proved to be a counterfeit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf trained up by the Papiſts for the cheat. But if it onely the Generations that are dead and gone that wrought Miracles, then I would further aske. 1. Doth it not ſeem then that your Church is Apoſtate, in that it hath loſt the gift of Miracles, which you ſuppoſe ſo neceſſary? And how will the Gifts of your predeceſſors prove your preſent infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, any more then the Gifts of the predeceſſors of the <hi>Greek</hi> Biſhops will prove their infallibility that now are? 2. If paſt Miracles may ſerve with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preſent, then what need any more than the old Miracles of the Apoſtles? And then why are not
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:61063:149"/>
all the Apoſtles ſucceſſors infallible as well as the Pope? Seeing all the Apoſtles had the gift of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles (and many thouſand more) Therefore thoſe paſt Miracles ſhould prove all Biſhops infallible that ſucceeded them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Queſt.</hi> I deſire alſo to know whether it be your Pope himſelf that Works theſe Miracles, or ſome other perſons? And if others, whether it be onely ſome of your Church, or all? If it be the Pope himſelf, why then have we more murthers then Miracles charged on your Popes by your own hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians? and why will not his holineſs do ſome Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in charity to poor Hereticks? Why do you boaſt no more of you Popes Miracles? One I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs we read of in the Golden Legend, that Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the firſt by the means of a woman kiſſing his hand was ſo vehemently tempted with luſt, that he was fain to cut his hand off: but the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> having compaſſion on him, joyned his hand to his body again. But this is no foundation of our faith.</p>
               <p>But its plain that it is Saint <hi>Becket,</hi> and Saint <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git</hi> and Saint <hi>Katharine</hi> that you ſend us to for Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and not to the Pope: And then I would further know whether one mans Miracles will prove ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man infallible unleſs they were wrought in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the aſſertion of that other mans infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility? It ſhould rather prove Saint <hi>Brigit</hi> and Saint <hi>Katharine</hi> infallible that are ſaid to have the Revelations and Miracles, then the Pope, that had none. Would it prove the Patriarch of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> infallible, if any one that is under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould work a Miracle?? Or are you ſure that there is no Miracle wrought among the <hi>Grecians, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſines</hi> or <hi>Armenians</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:61063:149"/>Moreover, if you are All Miracle Workers, why can we never ſee one, nor have certain proof of one? But if it be but ſome very few of you (as good as none) how will that prove the infallibility of your whole Church? When the Apoſtles wrought Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, that proved their <hi>own</hi> infallibility: but that proved not the infallibility of all in the Church nor of every teacher in it, nor of the greater number of them</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Queſt.</hi> If your Pope and Church be proved infallible, by ſuch Miracles as the Apoſtles were doth it not follow then that all your Popes are inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red perſons or Prophets as the Apoſtles were by which the gift of infallibility was conveyed to them?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Yea will it not follow that all your Church are inſpired Prophets, if all your Church be thus infallible: But you cannot expect that we ſhould too eaſily believe theſe. If you have Apoſtolick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility grounded on the like Miracles, then muſt you not be each one diſ-junctly infallible, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were; and not onely altogether?</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Queſt.</hi> And is it not plain then that all your dictates are Gods word, if you have the ſame ſeal and inſpiration as the Apoſtles had? And ſo your Pope, at leaſt, if not each one of you muſt make us new Revelations, or new Scripture: And is not this hainous arrogancy, thus to equal your ſelves with Prophets and Apoſtles, when you are none? They could but be infallible, and ſo you ſay is the Pope, They could but ſeal their doctrine by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and ſo you ſay doth your Church.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Will you grant that we are all infallible here in <hi>England,</hi> if we can prove any Miracles done among us and by us?</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Is it not abſolutely neceſſary to the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61063:150"/>
validity of the Teſtimony of a Miracle, that it be not controled by ſome greater Miracle or evidence? Otherwiſe the Magicians in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>

                     </gap>imon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> might have gone away with better reputation. But your pretended Miracles are con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rolled by far greater and ſurer, and therefore of no force: For yours are to confirm a doctrine contrary to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which was confirmed by many ſurer Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. This we are ſtill ready to prove, though here we take it for certain: but you uſe to decline that t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yal.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Queſt</hi> Is not every Prieſt infallible, and every Church that hath the Euchariſt, according to your doctrine? For ſure Tranſubſtantiation is a Miracle: I do not think you will deny it. And a Prieſt, even in deadly ſin, may be an inſtrument of this Miracle, if your Church be infallible. Is, there then no Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt among the Abaſſines, Greeks, or any that ſubject not to you? Or are they all infallible? And if Miracles be as common as Tranſubſtantiation, the priviledge proved by them muſt be as common. So much to Maſter <hi>Knots</hi> firſt proof of his Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without Scripture.</p>
               <p>His ſecond Independent proof, is [Sanctity] But Sir 1. Are all Saints infallible? Sure you dare not ſay ſo?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Will the Sanctity of one man, as Saint <hi>Francis</hi> or Saint <hi>Dominicke,</hi> prove the infallibility of the Pope that hath no Sanctity? By what means? Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if Saints be infallible, a Murdering, Simoniacal, Drunken, Fornicating Pope (as yours confeſs many of them were) are not like to be infallible; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Saint <hi>Brigit</hi> cannot make the Pope infallible by that Sanctity, that would not make or prove her ſelf infallible.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:61063:150"/>3. Who muſt be judge of your Sanctity and ours? Your ſelves no doubt. For my part, if my ſalvation lay wholly upon the paſſing of a righteous cenſure between us in this point, I muſt needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that even in <hi>England,</hi> where the Papiſts ſhould be of their beſt ſort, becauſe it is not the common way of the Nation, but a diſcountenanc't way, and where they are but few, yet I have known ſo few of them that have not been common Swearers, Curſers, Drunkards, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, or the like, and yet fewer that ever mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted any ſerious minding of God and the life to come, or any experience of the work of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on their hearts; and who ſhewed any more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs than what ſay in certain ceremonies, words, geſtures or other formalities; and on the contrary I know ſo many Proteſtants of heavenly hearts (as far as I can judge) and obedient lives; that there is no compariſon, in my moſt impartial judgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Papiſts and Proteſtants in matter of holineſs. If this therefore be the proof of infallibility, ſure God will excuſe me, if I take <hi>England</hi> to be as infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible as <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe he requires me not to put out my eyes, nor to ſay the Swan is black, and the Crow white, becauſe the Pope ſhall ſay ſo before me. And yet we ſtill diſclaim all pretences to ſuch infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>The third mark that <hi>Knot</hi> brings, is their [Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.]</p>
               <p>But 1. Sure the Pope ſuffers but little (in this life: but in the next, let him look to himſelf) How then do other mens ſufferings prove him infallible?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do not the poor Greek Churches and other Chriſtians under the Turks, ſuffer more then the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts?</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:61063:151"/>3. Do they not make us ſuffer incomparably more then they? Is it not impudence almoſt inhumane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the murder of ſo many thouſands of the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes, Waldenſes, Bohemians,</hi> after the Maſſacres in <hi>France, Savoy, Ireland,</hi> the burnings in <hi>England,</hi> the Powder-Plot, after their bloody inquiſition of ſo long continuance, and the reſt of this kind, to tell the remnant of their ſurviving neighbors, that their ſufferings prove them infallible, while our ſufferings prove us Heretical?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Is it not ambition and deſire of Rule that is the very cauſe which they contend for? Whats the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable quarrel ſo much as that all the world will not be ſubject to them? And yet the ſufferings of theſe men prove them infallible? If one Butcher <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France,</hi> and another <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and others would blow up the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament with Gunpowder, is the Pope infallible if ſome of theſe be hanged? Or what if ſome of them have ſuffered from infidels? Are not others as ready ſo to ſuffer as they? and have ſuffered as much as they?</p>
               <p>The next mark that he layes down is [Victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all ſorts of enemies] But is it over their minds, or over their bodies that they mean? If the firſt, who muſt be judge of their victories, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? I never heard any of them plead their cauſe but in my judgement they had the worſt. There i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> no party but may turn divers others to their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath got far more followers in the world then Chriſt; and Heatheniſm than either. If Papiſts can turn all theſe, why do they ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtill to be confined to ſo ſmall a part of the world? And if it be victory over mens bodies that
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:61063:151"/>
they mean, I ſay the like. Have not the <hi>Turkes</hi> a larger Dominion than the Pope? Have they conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Great <hi>Turk,</hi> the Great <hi>Mogol,</hi> the Grand Cham of <hi>Tartary,</hi> &amp;c? Are we not as infallible as they on this account, when we conquer them? It ſeems then, when Papiſts are ſo induſtrious to enlarge their Dominions, to deſtroy their enemies by Poyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning or ſtabbing Kings, or other means, it is that they may have a further Teſtimony of their infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>The laſt mark which the Jeſuite mentioneth, is [the converſion of Infidels.]</p>
               <p>But 1 If that be a ſure Mark, we are infallible as well as they: For we have been means of converting Infidels. And ſo have the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that diſown the Popes infallibility.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If that Argument be good, then it was not only the Apoſtles, but all that converted Infidels at the firſt (or after) preaching of the Goſpel, that were infallible: which ſure they never pretended to.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If it will prove any body infallible, its liker to prove them ſo that did convert any Infidels, then the Pope that onely gives them leave or order to do it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let them not boaſt too much of their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, till we have a better character of their new made Chriſtians, and a better report of their means of converſion, then <hi>Acoſta</hi> and other of their own Jeſuites give us, who have been eye witneſſes of the caſe. To cut men off by thouſands or millions, and force the reſt to Baptiſm, as cattle to watering, when they have nothing of a Chriſtian but the name and that ſign, and ſome forget the name it ſelf; this is
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:61063:152"/>
not a converſion much to be boaſted of. Nor muſt they think that all are Chriſtians that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> conquereth for love of their Gold and Silver Mines. The Apoſtles did not convert Infidels by an Army, but by the word and miracles; but it is the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> ſouldiers that have been the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al preachers to work the converſions that you have moſt to glory in. If the Jeſuit had put his proofs into well formed Arguments, what ſtuff ſhould we have had?</p>
               <p>So much for the Anſwer to <hi>Chilling worth,</hi> and the new Fundamentals of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> faith, by which they can prove their Pope infallible without being beholden to Scripture for its help (And I marvaile not at their contempt of Scripture-Teſtimony to them, unleſs there were more, or more appearance for them then there is.)</p>
               <p>Having conſidered the Papiſts proof of their infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, I ſhall next (though it be more then the cauſe obligeth me to) ſay ſomewhat to prove the Negative, and ſo proceed to my ſecond Argument againſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 2. If the common ſenſes of ſound men (or their ſenſible apprehenſions) be infallible, then the Pope with his pretended General Council is fallible: But the common ſenſes of ſound men are infallible: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know not how we ſhould come neerer hand with a Papiſt, nor to plainer dealing, then to argue from common ſenſe. And as to the Antecedent, Either ſenſe is infallible, or it is not: If it be, I have that I ſeek. If not, then mark what follows.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:61063:152"/>1. Then no man can be ſure that the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is true: For the proofs of it all vaniſh, if ſenſe be not infallible. If you plead the Miracles of Chriſt and his Diſciples, no man was ſure that he ſaw them. If you plead the death and Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Aſcenſion of Chriſt, no man was ſure he ſaw them, and therefore could give no aſſurance of it to another. All the Diſciples ſenſes, and the worlds ſenſes were (or might be, for ought we know) deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nor are you ſure that any writings or traditions came down to us from the Apoſtles: For the eyes of the Readers and the ears of the hearers might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. 2. And then moſt certainly the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and all his Clergy are fallible: For they cannot be ſure of that which the Apoſtles and following Church were not ſure of: Nor can they be ſure that in reading and hearing, their eyes deceive them not. And I take it for granted that the Pope and his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy do uſe their ſenſes, and by them receive theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into their intellect. Nay if ſenſe be fallible, no man in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can tell whether there be any ſuch place as <hi>Rome,</hi> or any ſuch perſon as the Pope at all, or ever was. Nay what elſe can any man be ſure of?</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe you will marvail why I beſtow ſo many words on ſuch a point: But you ſee what men we have to deal with: When all the quarrel between us muſt be iſſued by this point, whether common ſenſe be infallible? For if it be, we infallibly carry the cauſe: Yea whether it be or be not, as ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
               <p>I come next therefore to prove the conſequence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that I do thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:61063:153"/>The judgement of the Pope and his pretended Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council is directly contradictory to the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion or judgement of common ſenſe: therefore if common ſenſe be infallible, the Pope and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil are fallible.</p>
               <p>The conſequent is unqueſtionable; the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent I prove by this known Inſtance.</p>
               <p>Common ſenſe takes it to be bread and Wine that remaineth after the words of conſecration: The Pope and his Council ſay, it is not Bread nor Wine that remains after the words of conſecration: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgement of the Pope and his Council is directly contradictory to the apprehenſion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, I appeal to the ſenſes of all men that ever received the Euchariſt. Whether ſeeing, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſmelling, and taſting, do not as plainly take it to be Bread and Wine, as they do any other Bread or Wine at their own tables? and whether they can ſee or taſte, or ſmell, or feel, any difference to give them the leaſt cauſe of doubting? I am ſure I have the judgement of thouſands and millions on my ſide, which in a matter of ſenſe among ſound men, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly enough. And if the Papiſts are ſo mad as to tell me, that it is otherwiſe with their ſenſes; and will ſeriouſly profeſs that their eyes, and taſte, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do not take theſe for Bread and Wine, but perceive that they are not, I will take them for ſhameleſs lyars, or madmen; and I ſuppoſe no man in his ſenſes will blame me for ſo doing. Well I its pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> doubt that all our ſenſes tell us its Bread and Wine, as confidently as they tell us any thing is ſuch. And it is certain that the Pope and his Council tell us it is not Bread and Wine: If our eyes be infallible that
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61063:153"/>
read it, and our ears that hear it from their own mouthes; then this is ſure enough and too ſure; I know they will not deny it: I would they would, we ſhould then be ſomewhat neerer a reconciliation. What now can be ſaid to avoid the concluſion, is paſt my underſtanding; ſave onely that it is poſſible that ſome of them may come in with ſome alluding diſtinction to ſee if they can blind mens ſenſe and reaſon; and ſo perhaps they'l tell them that 1. ſenſe is infallible, on ſuppoſition of the right conſtitution of the medium, but elſe not: or 2. that ſenſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but of accidents, and not of ſubſtances, and the accidents of Bread and Wine are here; or 3. that ſenſe is infallible in common caſes, where ſubſtances and accidents are not ſeparated, as here they be. To which (if ſuch ſtuff deſerve an anſwer) I reply, 1. What medium is here queſtionable or queſtioned by you, but the accidents themſelves, which you ſay are the objects. Sure the aire is clear and perſpicuous: the diſtance is not too neer or too far off; our eyes and taſte are ſound. 2. I think ſenſes judge of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances with their accidents: The eye ſees <hi>ſubſtantiam coloratam,</hi> and the hand feeleth the <hi>ſubſtantiam qualem &amp; quantam,</hi> and not onely <hi>qualitatem &amp; quantitatem ſubſtantiae.</hi> But let that controverſie go how it will, I am ſure the ſubſtance is <hi>objectum ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Otherwiſe all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned abſurdities will follow, and ſtill the Pope and Church will be fallible: For then the Apoſtles and others that ſaw Chriſts Miracles could be ſure onely of the accidents, and not of the ſubſtance.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61063:154"/>
Then no man is certain whether it was Chriſt himſelf that lived on earth that was crucified, and roſe again, or onely the accidents of Chriſt: And then no man knows whether there be a Pope at <hi>Rome,</hi> or onely the accidents of a Pope: and ſo of the reſt. 3. And to the third part of the anſwer I reply, That if ſenſe be infallible when ſubſtances and accidents are inſeparable, then it is alwayes infallible: For the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident ſeparated from the ſubject doth periſh. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over how ſhall we know whether ſubſtances and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are ſeparated or not? If we be ſure of that by ſenſe, then ſenſe is ſtill infallible ſo far: if not, then ſenſe is fallible, becauſe it knows not when it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth any more then naked accidents. But indeed its a contradiction to talk of accidents that are not <hi>ſubjecti alicujus accidentia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Senſe is infallible (ſuppoſe the right temper of the Organs, object, Medium) till God tell us the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but then it is fallible: But in the point of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation God hath told us the contrary to what common ſenſe apprehendeth: Therefore here ſence is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Senſe muſt in order be firſt known to be infallible, before you can tell any thing that God hath ſaid or wrote, of its fallibility or infallibility: or elſe you cannot tell but your eyes in reading, or your ears in hearing thoſe words of his, did deceive you. 2. Senſe and Reaſon are the judging faculties which God hath given to mankind for the diſcerning of their objects. It is not therefore to be imagined that God doth turn the great Deceiver of the world, and by ſupernatural light contradict the Light of Nature, even the apprehenſions of the ſound and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61063:154"/>
general ſenſe of the world: Gods ſupernatural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valations preſuppoſes his Natural ones, and are addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereto, but do not contradict them: for then God ſhould contradict himſelf when both are his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations. God cannot lye, ſaith the Apoſtle: And what were it for God to lye or ſay truth, but onely to make a deceitful or not deceitful diſcovery of his mind and will or the effects to us? Indeed, there may through our imperfection be a deceit of the ſenſes, when the Organs are diſtempered, and the medium, or object are not conveniently diſpoſed: and every ſuch diſtance, impediment, or other ill diſpoſure, is not as Gods voice to tell us the thing as what to our imperfect ſenſe it ſeems: But if the common ſenſes of men, that are ſound and not hindred by any ſuch impediments ſhall yet be all deceived meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a contradicting ordinance of God, then it would ſeem that God gave man contradictory lights and guides. And their objection ſeems to be as bad, as if they ſhould ſay ſo of Gods word [That it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way true, except where God tells us the contrary] but if it might be falſe at any time, how can you tell that that very word is true which you pretend doth tell you of the falſhood of another word: ſo ſay I here. If ſenſe be not alwayes infallible (where it hath its requiſite aſſiſtance) then how can you tell that your ſenſes are infallible when you are reading <hi>[Hoc eſt corpus meum, This is my body]</hi> which you think contradicteth the infallibility of ſenſe? For 2. Is the infallibility of ſenſe a thing that is known by nature, or by ſupernatural Light? Not by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Light (unleſs conſequentially) where doth Scripture or your Tradition ſay, that ſenſe is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time infallibe, and ſometime fallible <hi>(ſuppoſit is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitis)?</hi>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:61063:155"/>
And nature tells you no more of the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of any other acts of ſence (or Receptions) then of thoſe ſame which you pronounce to be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We challenge you and all the world, to prove that ever God hath revealed in Scripture, that the common ſences of men, are deceived about their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per objects, the requiſites in Nature ſuppoſed; Or that ever he made any ordinances for the deluding or contradicting the ſences of his Church? Or ever ſaid any ſuch thing; Cannot Chriſt ſay <hi>[Hoc eſt corpus meum: This is my Body]</hi> but he muſt needs proclaim a deluſion of the ſences of all men that take it to be Bread? Then when God ſaith <hi>[Hoc eſt fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus meum: This is my Covenant] Gen.</hi> 17.10. He muſt proclaim all mens ſences deceived; becauſe ſence faith it was but Circumciſion, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will confeſs it was but the ſign of a Covenant. Then when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith [This Rock was Chriſt] it muſt proclaim that all the Iſraelites ſences were deceived, that thought it to be a true Rock: when a Papiſt will confeſs that the meaning is [This Rock repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or ſignified Chriſt] As if among many Images, you ſhould ſay, This is <hi>Peter,</hi> and this <hi>John,</hi> and this <hi>Paul,</hi> this were plainly to ſay, This ſignifieth <hi>Peter</hi> or repreſenteth him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and doth not proclaim that deceit of ſence. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cannot deny but that it is called in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. &amp; 11. Bread and the Cup ſix times over, as after the conſecration; and here his ſhifting anſwer is, that things are ſaid to be in Scripture what they ſeem to be, as the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent is called a Serpent, and ſo here he pleadeth a Trope. Good ſtill! The Scripture calls it [Bread] ſix times neer together, after the conſecration, and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:61063:155"/>
it calls it [Chriſts Body] once (when his living body ſate by) Now the Queſtion is which of theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are Tropical. And we muſt believe <hi>Bellarmine</hi> that the text which calls it ſix times Bread, muſt needs be Tropical, and that which calls it once [Chriſts Body] muſt needs be underſtood without a Trope. And this is all the evidence they can bring that God hath proclaimed mens ſences to be fallible. Nay all that we need for our cauſe is but to take <hi>[eſt]</hi> for <hi>[ſignificat]</hi> which is ſo common that one would think there ſhould not ſuch unnatural abſurdities be admitted to avoid it, as overthrow our huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>When we plead that Chriſt had a true body, and that a true body may be ſeen and felt, becauſe Chriſt bids them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. <hi>See and feel, for a ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwereth that <hi>Sence is infallible in poſitives, and therefore thence we may ſay</hi> [<hi>This is a body becauſe I ſee it ſelf, but not in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives; and therefore we cannot ſay [This is not a body becauſe I ſee it not.]</hi> And what need we more then that which is here granted? By his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion then we may conclude that [This is Bread and Wine, becauſe we ſee, feel, ſmell, taſte it.] Yet no doubt, we may alſo argue that it is not a natural body, becauſe it is not viſible or ſenſible.</p>
               <p>So much for this ſecond Argument, which I may thus with full advantage enforce: If ſence be either fallible or infallible, the Pope is fallible: But ſence is either fallible or infallible: Therefore.</p>
               <p>If ſenſe be fallible the Pope is fallible, and all his Church for their ſences, and the Apoſtles and their followers were fallible.<note rend="inter">☜</note> If ſence be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, the Pope and his Council are fallible; becauſe
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:61063:156"/>
the common ſences of all ſound men take that for Bread and Wine which they expreſly ſay (as <hi>de fide</hi> to be believed) is not either Bread or Wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 3. If the Pope and his pretended General Councils have erred already, then are they not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible: But the Pope and his pretended General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils have erred already: Therefore they are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>
               <p>As the firſt Argument was taken from the no proof of his infallibility, and the ſecond from the common ſenſes of mankind, ſo the third is taken from certain experience; which is a medium ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that their vain words and ſubtil evaſions, have the leſs force to elude or obſcure it. Of the validity of the conſequence there is no queſtion can be made. He that hath erred, is not infallible.

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:61063:158"/>
writings of all Popes are of infallible verity: But all the writings of all Popes are not of infallible verity: Therefore the Pope is not infallible.</p>
               <p>The conſequence of the Major Propoſition will be denyed by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> unleſs it be limited to ſuch writings by which the Pope doth teach the Church in matters of faith: Though indeed they will never prove him infallible in Teaching the Church while they confeſs him fallible in his own judgement, yet let us for diſputation ſake grant them this: But then (for the proof alſo of the Minor) I proceed thus: All the Theological writings of <hi>Leo, Gregory, Gelaſius, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colus</hi> 1. <hi>Adrian</hi> 6. and other Popes are not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: But all theſe writings were to teach the Church in matters of faith: Therefore all the Popes writings which are to teach the Church in matter of Faith, are not infallible. I think no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ober Papiſt will maintain that all theſe writings are infallible. And that they are written about matters neceſſary to be believed or done for our ſalvation, is evident to any man that readeth them. And if they were not written to teach the Church to what end were they written? Do Popes publiſh writings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout matters of Religion, and not to teach the Church by them? If they ſay, it is but to teach part of the Church: I anſwer. 1. What part is it? and where is the limitation expreſſed: for example, of <hi>Gregories</hi> Dialogues, Morals, <hi>de officio Paſtoris,</hi> &amp;c. 2. The Pope in a Provincial Council may teach but part of the Church, and yet <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith that he is there infallible.</p>
               <p>Moreover if all the Popes writings be infallible, from his gift of infallibility, then they are equal to the Scriptures; nay what are they but Gods word,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:61063:158"/>
and all Popes are Apoſtles or Prophets, that is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired men (of which more anon:) but thats falſe: Therefore.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Theſe writings come not from the Pope as Pope, but as a private Doctor, and ſo he may err.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Can the Pope lay by his relation when he is teaching the Church, &amp; do it as a meer private Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, when he is not a meer private Doctor? It is a hard ſtrait that the Papiſts are in to tell us, and themſelves, when the Pope teacheth as a private Doctor, and when as Pope? They are never likely to be agreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this among them. And all that we have for it, is but the private word of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and ſome ſuch diſputers; but we have no Scripture, Canon, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal, to tell us how we ſhall know one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If therefore we have no infallible means to know when the Pope teacheth as a Pope, and when as private Doctor, then we have no infallible means to know when he teacheth infallibly: But the former is moſt certain, therefore ſo is the later: And ſo if the Pope were infallible, it would do us no good. If they draw forth rational probabilities, and make every private man judge of them, they may as well warrant men by ſuch means, to judge of the ſence of Scripture, which they ſo much abhor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 5. If General Councils be infallible, or to be credited, then the Pope is fallible: But according to one party of the Papiſts, a General Council is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible: therefore the Pope is fallible.</p>
               <p>The conſequence of the Major is eaſily proved 1. Becauſe General Councils have differed from the

And are the Papiſts forced to yield us thus much? I would fain know then from <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or any Papiſts ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving him, whether that General Councils do erre in faith, and be Hereticks or not, for that their judgement?

                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 6. From the Papiſts own open known con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: If the Papiſts themſelves do confeſs both Pope and Council to be fallible, they have little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to blame us for affirming the ſamewhich they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs: But the Papiſts themſelves do confeſs both Pope and General Council to be fallible: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not mean that all the Papiſts confeſs it of both, but one part of them confeſs it of one and the other
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:61063:160"/>
of the other of them. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and his fellow Jeſuites with the <hi>Italian</hi> party do confeſs that a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council may erre in matters of Faith: The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Venetian</hi> Papiſts, with all the Doctors of their party affirm that the Pope may erre and be a heretick, and teach hereſie: ſo that by the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of one half of them a Council may erre and by the confeſſion of the other half the Pope may erre.</p>
               <p>If any imagine that though both may erre diſ-junct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet not conjunctly, I ſhall onely now ſay, that the conceſſion that each of them diſ-junctly may err, deſtroyeth the force of all thoſe Arguments which are brought for their infallibility; and therefore will prove it of them alſo conjunctly. But we have yet further proof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 7. If the very ſubſtance of Popery be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a fardell of errors brought in by the Pope and his Council to corrupt the Chriſtian Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, then certainly the Pope and his Council may erre: But the Antecedent is true: Therefore ſo is the conſequent.</p>
               <p>All the Queſtion being of the Antecedent, and it being proved before in the former diſputation, and fully by our writers againſt them, I ſhall thither for brevity refer you. What impudency is it to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch abundance of corruptions contrary to the expreſs word of God and after all this to ſay, they cannot erre when they have ſo plagued the Church with their errors? They teach men to ſerve God in an unknown tongue, and ſpeak and hear they know not what, to worſhip the Bread with divine Worſhip, to
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61063:161"/>
receive onely the bread, when Chriſt ordained that they ſhould have the cup, and ſo do aboliſh one half of the Sacrament, they adore the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and other Saints, they plead for juſtification by the merit of their own works, as having a condignity of the reward; they make the Church a new thing by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a new head and center of unity and a new and daily mutable Religion, in a word they poiſon both Church policie, Worſhip and Doctrine by their err<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors; and when they have done they ſtand to it that they cannot erre. Like a Leper that ſhould maintain he cannot poſſibly be Leprous, when he is covered with it already: or like a ſwearing or drunken beaſt, that ſhould ſwear that he never did ſwear nor was drunk, nor ever can be, when he lyeth drunk in the dirt, and breaths out his oaths. What need any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial diſeerning man any other proof that the Pope and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not infallible, then actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to obſerve the ſwarm of their errors that have troubled the Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 8. If the Popes themſelves are to be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or if they are not to be believed, they are not infallible. But either they are to be believed or not: Therefore.</p>
               <p>If they be not to be believed, what need there any more proof? If they are, what need there alſo any more proof, when they themſelves confeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fallible? Not a Pope for above ſix hundred years after Chriſt did ever pretend to infallibility as can be proved: Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the ſixth, one of the moſt Learned and beſt that ever they had this many hundred years, hath written his judgement that the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:61063:161"/>

Thus you hear what a Pope ſayes of himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 9. If the Pope be infallible, then either it is his mind in believing, or his tongue in ſpeaking, or his pen in writing, that is infallible. But it is neither his Mind, nor Tongue, nor Pen: Therefore he is not infallible.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That his mind is not infallible, in point of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, is confeſt by the Papiſts themſelves. One part of them ſaying he may erre, and the other maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he may be a hereticke, and that many have been ſo.</p>
               <p>That his tongue and pen is not infallible when his underſtanding erreth is plain.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that otherwiſe he ſhould be infallible in diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and God is feigned to promiſe a man to keep his tongue from error when he ſpeaks againſt his own heart; which cannot be proved, nor ſoundly imagined.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:61063:162"/>2. The infallible dictates of the Pope while he er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in mind ſhould be all either unreaſonable acts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as being the words of one that knoweth not what he ſaith, or interpretatively lies. For when a man ſpeaks contrary to his judgement, if his words be true in themſelves yet they are interpretatively lys, becauſe he ſo takes them, and intendeth them as falſhoods to deceive others. For inſtance, If Pope <hi>John</hi> the 23. that was depoſed by a General Council upon Articles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited againſt him for denying the Reſurrection, and the Life to come, ſhould with his tongue have taught the Reſurrection and the Life to come; this had been as lying to him, though the thing it ſelf be moſt true. And we muſt have a promiſe that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> and his Clergy, among all the Lyars in the whole world, ſhall be the onely infallible Lyars. A happy ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Lyars ſure? But where is that promiſe?</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was for the error of the tongue as well as of the mind, that the Clergy deſpoſed <hi>Liberius</hi> &amp; <hi>Felix,</hi> and that the Councils of <hi>Piſa, Conſtance,</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> depoſed the other Popes above mentioned. For 1. they could not know their minds but by their words. 2. They charged them with the errors of their tongues as well as mindes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 10. If Popes be infallible in the matters which they underſtand not, then it muſt be by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm or prophetical inſpiration. But all Popes are ignorant of many Divine Truths, and ſome more notoriouſly ignorant, and yet neither All nor Any of them (for ought is ever proved) were Prophets, or divinely inſpired: therefore they are not infallible.</p>
               <p>For the Major its plain, that as no erring man muſt
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:61063:162"/>
ſpeak againſt his own mind, if he be infallible, ſo an ignorant man (in thoſe points) muſt 1. either have his ignorance cured ſuddainly by prophetical inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: or elſe 2. muſt ſpeak as in an extaſie, without or beſide his own mind: there being no other way im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginable.</p>
               <p>And as for the Minor I prove both parts of it. 1. That Popes are ignorant of many Divine truths, I prove thus. 1. They that are ignorant of many truths revealed in the Scriptures, are ignorant of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Divine truths: For Scripture being Gods word, all that is therein revealed is Divine truth. But Popes have been ignorant of many things revealed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: therefore I need not ſure ſtand to prove the Minor, for they confeſs it themſelves. And if the Pope underſtood all the Scripture, he were ſure the moſt damnable ſinner in the world, for not revealing his knowledge to others. 2. Yea ſome of them have been ſo notoriouſly ignorant and unlearned that their own <hi>Alphonſus a Caſtro</hi> ſaith (<hi>adverſ. hareſ. li.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4.) that
<q>
                     <hi>[It is certain ſome Popes be ſo unlearned, that they do not underſtand the Grammar.]</hi>
                  </q>
And ſure if they that underſtand not any Hebrew or Greek (which are the languages in which the Scripture is written) no nor the Latin Grammar ſhould underſtand all the Bible and erre in nothing, it muſt needs be by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, and by Prophetical inſpiration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But that all Popes be not inſpired Prophets, nor illuminated by Miracles, I will leave to be judged by the Papiſts themſelves. Read <hi>Platina, Stella,</hi> yea or <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelf, or if they have any other that is a more notorious Paraſite to them, and let them be judges.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 11. If the Pope and his Council be infallible, then it is either in All things that God hath reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scripture or are neceſſary to be known, or but in ſome: If he be infallible in all things neceſſary to be known, believed, or decided, then will it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Pope is the moſt cruelly wicked man on earth, and the greateſt enemy to the truth and Church that will ſuffer the Church to lye in ſo much ignorance and contention, and will not reveal the truth to reconcile and enlighten them. Why doth he not write an infallible commentary on all the Bible to perfect our knowledge and end all our quarrels? And why doth he not write an infallible ſummary of all his ſuperadded traditions? Hath not Chriſt told him that no man lighteth a candle to put it under a Buſhel, but where it may be ſeen of all?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why doth not one Pope reveal that which they think fit to reveal; but leave it to ſucceſſors one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another to do it by degrees? Dare they ſay that there is any point of faith revealed in Scripture, and neceſſary to this age to know, which was not meet to be revealed by the Pope to the laſt or former age?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Why do ſo many of themſelves, yea their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils ſo much contradict their Popes in many things, if he be infallible in all things? And all of them confeſs that either a Pope, or a Council may erre?</p>
               <p>But if it be but ſome things that the Pope is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in, then how ſhall we be ſure which be thoſe ſome? Can we know before he diſcloſeth them, or onely
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:61063:163"/>
after? I ſuppoſe they will ſay [It is in all thoſe things which he determineth or declareth] But if that be the rule to know the extent of his infallibility by; then I Every Pope beginneth to be infallible, when he beginneth to Determine or declare, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. 2. And then every Pope increaſeth in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, as he increaſeth his Decretals or Canons. 3. And then one Pope is much more infallible then others, who have made more decrees then others. 4. And then ſome Popes were never infallible, who never made any decrees or determinations or expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions at all, ſo that their cauſe is loſt, if their actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al diſcoveries be the Rule of the extent of their infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility. And yet I cannot imagine what elſe they can ſay that may have any appearance of conſiſting with their intereſt.</p>
               <p>For it is either a Poſitive or a Negative infallibility which they mean and aſcribe to their Church. If a Poſitive, then 1. All the foreſaid abſurdities unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably follow; whether they ſay that they can infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly teach us all things (and will not) or but ſome? But if it be a Negative infallibility which they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain (<hi>viz.</hi> that the Church ſhall never teach any falſe doctrine; Or the Pope ſhall never deceive us by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding any error, though withall he may poſſibly teach us but part of the truth, yea the <hi>neceſſary</hi> truth, yea perhaps teach us none at all) I ſay, if this be their meaning, then every infant or bird or beaſt hath as glorious a priviledge as the Pope of <hi>Rome:</hi> For every infant and bruit is ſo infallible; that we are certain they will not deceive the Church by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any error.</p>
               <p>Perhaps they'l ſay that the Pope is poſitively in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible as a ſufficient Teacher of the Church, in all
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:61063:164"/>
things <hi>de fide</hi> at that time, or neceſſary to ſalvation; and negatively infallible in all the reſt, which are not <hi>de fide</hi> or neceſſary: To which I anſwer: 1. Either ſuch points are <hi>de fide</hi> and neceſſary before the Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declare them ſo, and he therefore declares them ſo becauſe they are ſo: or elſe he declares them <hi>de fide</hi> and neceſſary before they are ſo, that by declaring them ſo, he may make them ſo. If the firſt, 1. then the Papiſts have loſt their cauſe; for thats it which they deny, at leaſt <hi>quoad nos,</hi> though not <hi>in ſe,</hi> as they uſe to diſtinguiſh. 2. And then its plain that no Pope hath been poſitively infallible in <hi>neceſſariis,</hi> or all points <hi>de fide</hi>: for no one hath declared all, nor are they yet all (ſay they) declared by them, but every Pope may ſtill add more, and who knows when we ſhall have all. But if they take the later way, then 1. They ſuppoſe that Gods word how expreſs ſoever doth not make a point to be <hi>de fide</hi> and neceſſary, till the Pope declare it ſo (at leaſt <hi>quoad nos</hi>: and how it can be <hi>de fide</hi> and neceſſary, any other way then <hi>quoad nos,</hi> they ſhould do well to declare: For that which is <hi>credendum, eſt ab aliquo credendum</hi> (that which is to be believed, muſt be believed by ſome body) and that which is neceſſary is neceſſary to ſome one.) So that the Goſpel ſhall be no Goſpel with them, nor the Law of God any Law, though we read it and hear it a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, till the Pope tell us by parcels the meaning of its particular words and ſentences. 2. They make the Popes acts to go before their objects, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the nature of actions: while they make him to declare a point to be <hi>de fide</hi> that it may become <hi>de fide.</hi> For to declare that <hi>it is ſo,</hi> ſuppoſeth that it <hi>is ſo,</hi> and not onely that it <hi>will</hi> or <hi>ſhall</hi> be ſo <hi>de futuro.</hi> 3. And
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61063:164"/>
ſo they make all the Popes infallible Declarations, Expoſitions, and Determinations <hi>de fide,</hi> to be Lyes: for if he Declare a thing to be neceſſary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neceſſary, or declare this or that to be the ſence of Scripture, before it is the ſence of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or to be <hi>de fide</hi> before it be ſo, what is this but plaine lying? But if they ſay that he declareth it to be <hi>de fide</hi> and neceſſary onely for the future, and not to have been ſo before this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, then the forementioned Abſurdities fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. And alſo 1. The Pope is then a Goſpel-maker, and the Law giver of the Church, and that in ſpirituals and internals; and conſequently it is he that is the King of the Church (who hath the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative power, and without whom nothing that Chriſt hath ſaid ſhall bind us) 2. Then the Churches faith is mutable and in a continual change by new additions: For the Decrees or Expoſitions of every Pope do make more Articles of faith then were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. 3. Then the preſent Papiſts are not of the ſame Religion as their fore-fathers (or their fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not of the ſame with them) nor do they go to Heaven by the ſame way: For according to their own doctrine, if the preſent age of the Church did not believe as <hi>de fide</hi> many things more then the former ages were bound to believe, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved. 4. And then it is evident unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> to make more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, Decrees or Determinations! and ſo to make us of this Age, ſo much work to do before we can get to heaven and ſcape damnation, which our forefathers never had to do.</p>

                  </note> one of them reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to this, that theſe Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are no cruelty, becauſe they make not ſalvation more difficult, but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate that which was neceſſary before (or to that ſence) But 1. It ſeems then that ſomewhat was neceſſary and <hi>de fide</hi> before the Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, determined or declared them ſo: By that time we are plainly told which thoſe points be, the Papiſt that undertakes and performeth it, will finde himſelf at a ſad loſs. 2. But is this man ſerious? Doth he think indeed that it is not eaſier to believe the Apoſtles Creed, than to believe all that is in the Councils of <hi>Trent, Baſil, Conſtance, Laterane,</hi> with all the reſt, and all the Decretals (both the Popes and <hi>Iſidore Meccator's alias Peccator.</hi>) For inſtance, before the Pope determined the other day for the Moliniſts againſt ſome part of the Dominican, Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenian doctrine, both parties might have gone to heaven: But now the poor Dominicans, muſt change part of their doctrine, or go to hell fire. I demand now whether the Popes determination have not made ſalvation harder to many then before? I appeal to all the Thomiſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dominicans, Janſenians, whether the Pope hath facilitated their ſalvation by this deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination? I appeal to <hi>Tho. Whites</hi> friendly combate with <hi>Franciſc. Macedo</hi>; &amp; to the late Animadverſions of the <hi>French</hi> Doctors on the Popes determinations.</p>
               <p>Further I adde that if all the Popes infallibility Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive be onely in points of abſolute neceſſity to ſalvation, then many a private Doctor, nay every Chriſtian man or woman, is at preſent, as infallible as the Pope: for it implyes a contradiction to be a true Chriſtian, and not to believe all that is eſſential to
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:61063:165"/>
Chriſtianity, or abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation. And if it be not <hi>de praeſenti &amp; in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> but <hi>de futuro &amp; in ſenſu diviſo</hi> that they mean it, that is, that another man may fall from the faith, but the Pope cannot, 1. Clean contrary, we maintain, and the Papiſts confeſs, that no elect perſon ſhall fall quite from the faith. 2. But a reprobate Pope may: witneſs <hi>John</hi> 23. and many another. So much for that Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 12. If every Pope be infallible (Poſitively in all matters of faith, or in expounding all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) then all Popes are of equal underſtanding and fidelity in matters of faith, and Scriptures. For the moſt learned, wiſe and pious can go no higher, but to be able infallibly to interpret all Scripture, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare all Gods will concerning our faith and duty. But ſure all Popes are not equal. None of thoſe children or dunces that <hi>Alphonſus a Caſtro</hi> ſaith underſtood not the Grammar, are equal to <hi>Pius</hi> 2. or <hi>Adrian</hi> the 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 13. If every Pope be infallible, then ſtudy, learning, conſultations, yea and Councils are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: for the moſt unlearned Pope is as infallible as the moſt learned; and after all the ſtudy in the world, conſultation and advice of General Councils, he can he but infallible; and ſo, ſay they he was before. If they ſay ſtill, that, before he was but negatively in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; I ſay again, ſo is a block, an infant or an ideot. But that ſtudies, learning, conſultations and Councils are not needleſs, I ſuppoſe all Papiſts will grant: therefore they muſt grant that all Popes are not infallible.</p>

               <p>And for the Minor, that many Popes have been notoriouſly wicked, I need not prove it, while their own Hiſtorians and diſputers too, do ſo commonly confeſs it.

                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 15. Other Biſhops and Churches who have as good a pretence to plead for their infallibility as the Biſhop and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are yet generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged fallible, even by themſelves and by the papiſts: Therefore the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome</hi> alſo are fallible.</p>
               <p>All thats doubtful is whether any other Churches or Biſhops have as fair a plea for infallibility as the <hi>Romane</hi>? which I prove thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Plea of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> is that their Biſhop is the ſucceſſor of an Apoſtle who was infallible, and ſo the Promiſes belonging to him, do belong alſo to his ſucceſſors. And the ſucceſſors of the reſt of the Apoſtles may have the ſame plea: For all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, after the Holy Ghoſt fell on them, were infallible, as well as <hi>Peter</hi>: And therefore their ſucceſſors have as fair a plea as <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſors.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But there was not the like promiſe made to the reſt for their ſucceſſors ſtability as was to</hi> Peter. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There can no greater a promiſe to <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſors be ſhewed, then was made <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.29. to them all <hi>[Lo I am with you alwayes even to the end of the world]</hi> 2. The Papiſts (according to their new fundamentals) muſt not plead Scripture promiſes for their infallibility; for they ſay, their infallibility is in order firſt known, evidenced and to be proved,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:61063:167"/>
before it be known that Scripture is Gods word.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The plea of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> for their Popes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility is, that he is the ſucceſſor of <hi>Peter.</hi> But the Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> might as well pretend to be the ſucceſſor of <hi>Peter,</hi> and yet he pretendeth not to infallibility: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That Hiſtory which tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us that <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> doth tell us that he was Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> alſo; yea and that he was Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> before he was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo that <hi>Antioch</hi> is undoubtedly the ancienter Church. What reaſon then can the Papiſts give why the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> might not as well plead that he is <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, as the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>? Unleſs they could prove that <hi>Peter</hi> did by his laſt Will and Teſtament bequeath the honor of ſucceſſion, and the priviledges of infallibility to <hi>Rome</hi> onely; which they have not yet (that I can find) been ſo bold as to go about to prove. Otherwiſe, if one muſt needs be preferred, why ſhould not the eldeſt, unleſs they be diſinherited, and the younger hath the bleſſing, which muſt be proved. Whence is it but from the honor of their Antiquity that <hi>Antioch, Hieruſalem, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be preferred as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchates before all other Churches? And if An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity be a good reaſon for that, then why ſhould not <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> on the ſame account be preferred before <hi>Rome,</hi> ſeeing its beyond all doubt that they were both the more ancient Churches, and <hi>Antioch</hi> the more ancient ſeat of <hi>Peter,</hi> in the judgement of them that make him Biſhop of either. So that its clear that other Churches have as much or more to ſay for infallibility then <hi>Rome,</hi> who yet make no prentence to it.</p>

                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 16. The Apoſtles themſelves were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible till the holy Ghoſt fell on them, nor by any other help without the extraordinary inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt (for before, they underſtood not that Chriſt muſt dye, riſe and aſcend, till it was done: but <hi>Peter Mat.</hi> 16.20. diſſwadeth him from ſuffering) therefore the Pope if he might plead ſucceſſion from <hi>Peter,</hi> cannot expect more then <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf had; and therefore cannot expect his infallibility without his ſpirit and inſpiration: And therefore thoſe Popes that have not the Holy Ghoſt, and that inſpiration as <hi>Peter</hi> had, cannot pretend to be infallible, as his ſucceſſors: For they muſt ſucceed him in the cauſe, if they will ſucceed him in the effects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 17. If the Catholike Church be infallible, then the Pope and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible: But the Papiſts ſay the Catholike Church is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; therefore according to their own doctrine it muſt follow that the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are not infallible.</p>
               <p>The argument being <hi>ad hominem</hi> and the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent their own, all the doubt is of the conſequence: which I prove thus, either it is the real or repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body which they muſt call the Catholike Church: But both theſe are againſt the Popes infallibility: Therefore.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the real, no man can poſſibly know all their minds, nor ever expect that they ſhould in this life be all of a minde: therefore it is the Major part that we muſt have reſpect to, as its uſual in all ſuch

Bodies, or Aſſemblies. Now the greater part of the Catholike Church on earth, is and hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Popes infallibility. That it is ſo now, is well known, ſeeing all the Greeks, Abaſſin, Armenian, Reformed and other Churches are far more then the Papiſts. 2.

But the confeſſion of the adverſaries here may ſpare us more labour, who acknowledge that a General Council though rightly Congregated, and though the Popes Legates concur, may yet erre in the faith, if ſo be that the Pope doth not approve or confirme their Decrees. So that when they ſay that [All the Church cannot err] and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a General Council cannot erre; their own meaning is, that one man cannot erre; but All the Church (<hi>viz.</hi> a General Council) without him may erre.</p>

               <p>The Antecedent is ſo fully proved by our Writers, and ſo eaſily diſcernable by thoſe that read the writtings of thoſe times, that there needs not any more to be ſaid. That which I ſhall produce to this pupoſe, ſhall be anon to prove the following point and this together.

                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 20. If the Pope be not the <hi>Authorized</hi> judge of Scripture, nor our faith to be reſolved into his judgement (or the judgement of his Church) then is he not the <hi>Infallible</hi> judge of Scripture, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies about matters of faith. For he that is no judge can be no infallible judge: nor doth he need infallibility to qualifie him for a work which he was never called to, nor doth at all belong to him. It is not the Pope as a private Doctor, or as the Biſhop of a particular Church, which is made by them the ſubject of infallibility, but the Pope as the ſuppoſed head of the Catholike Church authorized to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret Scripture, and to judge of all controverſies of faith, into whoſe judgement (at leaſt with his Clergy) our faith, they think muſt be reſolved. If therefore we can prove the nullity of the ſubject we do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by prove the nullity of the Adjunct. And this leads us up to the third Queſtion, which we have now to deal with.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>Whether our faith muſt be reſolved into the infallibility of the</hi> Romane <hi>(pretended) Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative judgement? Or whether the Popes Authority and infallibility be the thing firſt to be known, and thence the truth of Scripture or Chriſtian Religion to be received as upon his judgement?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe this is not the principal point intended in this diſpute, and becauſe there is enough ſaid to it in the beginning on the by, and becauſe I have ſaid yet more for explication of the whole matter in the Preface to the later Editions of <hi>The Saints Reſt,</hi> I
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:61063:171"/>
ſhall therefore ſay but little to it now, reſerving a fuller handling it (if neceſſary) to a fitter ſeaſon. Only I ſhall here adde a few more Reaſons to prove that the Pope or <hi>Romane</hi> Church have no ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to be judge of Scripture or controverſies to all the reſt of the Churches on earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then I ſhall adde a few words to prove that we muſt believe in Chriſt and receive his doctrine before we believe in the Pope and receive his pretended authority and judgement, that is, without it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If the Pope (or his conſiſtory) muſt be the univerſal Governor and Judge to all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world, then muſt the greateſt part of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world be ungoverned and have no recourſe to their Judge. But the conſequent will be denyed by themſelves: therefore we have reaſon to deny the Antecedent.</p>
               <p>The proof of the conſequence is moſt obvious and certain from the Popes natural incapacity and inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency for ſuch a work (and ſo of his conſiſtory) It is naturally impoſſible that the Pope ſhould perform the works of this Government to all the Chriſtian world: therefore the conſequence is good. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make known his determinations to all: If all men through the Chriſtian world that have ſuch doubts to be reſolved as his Holineſs ſuppoſeth belong to him properly to reſolve, ſhould have recourſe to him for reſolution, O how much would the wayes to <hi>Rome</hi> be beaten and frequented? What a concurſe would be about his Holineſs doors? What time would he have to reſolve thoſe millions of men: If any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences or difficulties ariſe in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> or at the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:61063:172"/>
                  <hi>Antipodes,</hi> before they go or ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and receive an anſwer, the perſons are like to be in another world where they will have a more infallible reſolution. And if they live to ſee the return of their meſſengers, they muſt take it on the truſt of their words, that this is indeed his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſes reſolution. Hence it is that <hi>de facto</hi> there is ſo few people on earth, even of the Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that are really goverened or reſolved by the Pope himſelf, nor know what he is, or what is his minde: but all is done by his Miſſionaryes or Delegates; And if the Pope can delegate his power to others, and make ſo many others alſo infallible, then infallibility is not proper to himſelf: and then why may not the reſt of the Biſhops of the Church be as infallible, who are ſent by Chriſt, as theſe are that are ſent by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 2. If the Pope be ſuch an univerſal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and Judge, then all Popes muſt needs be damned for utter neglect of the works of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. For ſure when the wel-fare of the whole Church doth ſo much depend on the office of the head, it cannot but be damnable in him to be a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecter of the works of that office to the far greateſt part of the Church on earth. But he muſt unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably neglect (I mean omit) that work which it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to perform<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore.</p>
               <p>What I have further to ſay againſt the reſolving of our faith into his judgement ſhall be contained in theſe few Queſtions following.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:61063:172"/>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Doth he not contradict the very defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a Pope, that tells us that we muſt firſt believe him to be an infallible Pope, before we can believe the Doctrine of Chriſt? For a <hi>Romane</hi> Pope is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be the Vicar of Chriſt, the ſucceſſor of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> the head of the Church: And can he be thus known by a man that knoweth not or believeth not that there is a Chriſt, who is the Saviour and principal head, and who is ſuppoſed to ſend him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. And doth it not contradict the definition of a Church, to ſay that we muſt believe the Church before we can believe the doctrine of Chriſt? For what is a Church but a ſociety of Chriſtians, that is, men profeſſing the Chriſtian Faith? And how can they know that ſuch men are Chriſtians, or profeſs that faith, before they know what that faith is? And how can they know that they are to be credited as Chriſtians, before they believe that Chriſtianity it ſelf is of credit?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q</hi> 3. Is there any man breathing that can bring ſufficient Arguments to prove. 1. That there is a Church of Chriſt. 2. And that this Church is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible. 3. And that the Pope and Papiſts are this Church, before their hearers have received or believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the word of God? If they can, why have they not faln cloſer to work in this neceſſary point, when they know how much it would do to the determination of the whole? If they pretend ſuch Antecedent proof by miracles, as the Apoſtles proved the Doctrine by, I have ſhewed the vanity of this pretence (againſt <hi>Knot</hi>) before: and we muſt ſtill deſire them, if it be miracles that is their firſt witneſs, to let us ſee, or have certaine proofe of thoſe Miracles. We proteſt to all the world that we are heartily

willing to ſee them and know of them if they be true, but though we have lived in the midſt of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts all our lives, yet could we never to this day ſee any ſuch matter from them, nor hear ſo much as of any probable proofs of any. And would they have us in a matter of ſalvation to believe every pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. Whether thoſe that do not go this moſt abſurd way (of proving their Church infallible to an infidel that yet believeth not Gods word, and ſo by means antecedent to the belief of Scripture) muſt not unavoidably confeſs that Gods word muſt be firſt believed before the Popes or Churches infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or authority (and conſequently our faith depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in them, nor is reſolved into them) or elſe they are inextricably inſnared in the Popiſh circle, and contradictingly do make two <hi>primo credenda,</hi> the Church or Pope, the firſt to be believed, and yet the word of God is firſt to be believed? And do not <hi>Holden, Vane, Knot,</hi> and others of them ſee this, who therefore ſhun the circle, and uſe not the old ſhifts of <hi>Becanus</hi> and others to blind the eyes of thoſe that ſee them in it?</p>

               <p>I confeſs this Doctor allows us pretty fair quarter in compariſon of many others of his party. If they will but give us ſuch <hi>Open publike univerſal certain Tradition, which muſt be known to the very outward ſenſes of every Chriſtian,</hi> we ſhall be very ready to comply with them in receiving ſuch a Teſtimony. But if all the Romiſh Traditions had been ſuch, they would be known to all Chriſtians as well as to the Pope, and not lock't up in his Cabinet, and our ſelves ſhould ſure have known them before now, if we be Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 5. To proceed, I am very deſirous to
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:61063:175"/>
know whether it be upon the credit of the preſent Church (Pope or Council) or of thoſe former that are dead and gone, that we muſt receive our faith and the Scriptures? Or upon both? If it be on the credit of any former Church, then would I know of which age? whether of the neereſt, or the middle, or of the firſt and remoteſt age, that is, from the Apoſtles and the Church in their dayes? If from the laſt age, then 1. How know we their Teſtimony? If it be by their writings, Canons or Decrees, why cannot other men who are much wiſer and better, underſtand theſe as well as the Pope? And why do they not refer us to thoſe writings, but to their own determinations? If it be by the Fathers telling the children what hath formerly been believed, then, why cannot I tell what my Father told me, without the Pope, and better then the Pope that never knew him? 2. And then it muſt be known upon whoſe credit the former ages did receive that faith and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture which they deliver down to us? Doubtleſs they will ſay, from their predeceſſors; and they again from their predeceſſors, and ſo up to the Apoſtles. And why then may not we take it immediately on the credit of the Apoſtles as well as the firſt ages did? ſuppoſing that we have the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſure hand to deliver to us their writings, without meditation of the like inſpired prophetical perſons, or of any priviledged infallible judge of the faith; And if it be on this Teſtimony of former ages that we muſt receive the Scripture as the word of God, I ſhall then proceed further to demand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 6. Why may not the Greeks, Abaſſines, Proteſtants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that acknowledge not the Popes authority or infallibility, receive the Scripture as the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:61063:176"/>
word of God, as well as the Papiſts? Do they think that none elſe in the world but they can tell what was the judgement of the former Church? What records or Tradition have they which all the reſt of the world is ignorant of? Or dare they ſay (if they have the face of Chriſtians) that none of all the Chriſtians on earth, but Papiſts onely, have any ſufficient evidence that the Scripture was written by the Apoſtles, and delivered from them, and that this is it which is now in the Church? Can no man indeed but a Papiſts know the Scripture to be the word of God, upon juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able grounds?</p>
               <p>But if it be on the credit of the preſent Church (or both) that we muſt take the Scripture to be Gods word, then I ſhall further deſire to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 7. What is it which they call the preſent Church: Is it 1. The whole number of the faithful. 2. Or a major vote, or part. 3. Or the Biſhops, or Presbyters in whole or part. 4. Or a Council choſen from among them, 5. Or the Pope? If the firſt,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 8 Do they not then make all Chriſtians infallible as well as the Pope. And ſo they are <hi>in ſenſu compoſito</hi> in the eſſentials of Chriſtianity and the whole Church ſhall never deny thoſe eſſentials, but 1. whole particular Churches may, and 2. the whole Church may erre ſome ſmaller errors againſt the revealed will of God; the Apoſtle telleth us that we know but in part; and as in many things we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend all, ſo in many things we err all. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over if this be their ſenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 9. Will it not then follow, that the Pope cannot be proved infallible, becauſe it is moſt certain
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:61063:176"/>
that All the Church doth not take him to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: no nor the greateſt part of Chriſtians in the world. Yea if they will take none for Chriſtians but Papiſts, yet it will hence follow that there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that either Pope or Council are infallible. For the <hi>French</hi> take a Pope to be fallible, and the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> and others take a General Council to be fallible: and therefore the whole Popiſh Church being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed of it, we cannot be ſure that either of them is infallible. And moreover on this ground I demand,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 10. How ſhall we know (in very many caſes at leaſt) either which is the judgement of the whole Church or of the major part? What oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity have we to take the account? Or can no poor Chriſtian believe the word of God, that cannot take an account of this through the world?</p>
               <p>The ſame Queſtion alſo I would put, if they take all or moſt of the Paſtors for this Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 11. But if they take a General Council for the Church, I would firſt know, How we ſhall be ſure that ever there hath, at leaſt, theſe thouſand years, been ever a true General Council in the world? The Popiſh Doctors (as Doctor <hi>Holden de Reſolut. fid. li.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. <hi>pag.</hi> 156.) ſay that <hi>[It muſt ariſe to that degree of univerſality that there may not be any ſuſpicion of conſpiracies and combined factions, that ſo every prudent man may be able heartily to ſay that the Aſſemblies are truely General.]</hi> And is it ſo, when there are none but the ſworn obliged vaſſals of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Greeks, Ethiopians,</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and moſt of the Church are abſent? and when it is a known combination to promote their own eſpouſed cauſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 12. And then is the whole foundation of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:61063:177"/>
Divine faith extinct and loſt, when there is no Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council? It may be we may have no General Council of a hundred or ſix hundred, or a thouſand years together? Have we no Church then? Or no certainty of Scripture or of the faith? If they ſay that we are certain by the determinations of former Councils, then they ſpeak of the Church that is paſt and gone, of which I moved the doubts before: And the Canons of theſe we can read and underſtand as well as the Pope: But when we appeal to former Councils and Ages, they would hold us to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church, and that muſt be their own: and ſo be ſure to be judges in their own cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 13 I would know alſo whether it were by the judgment of a General Council that the firſt Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches believed the Scripture to be Gods word? Did not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believe the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> believe the Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and ſo the reſt, to be the word of God, as ſoon as they received them by an undoubted meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger from <hi>Paul</hi>? Or did they ſtay till they had the judgement of a General Council or of all the Churches? Indeed they made uſe of the intervening humane (but certain) teſtimony, of him that was the meſſenger or bearer of the Epiſtle, to know that it was the writing of <hi>Paul</hi> indeed: and ſo we ſtill maintain the neceſſity of a credible humane Teſtimony that theſe writings came from the Apoſtles hands: But <hi>Tychicus,</hi> or <hi>Trophimus,</hi> or <hi>Timothy,</hi> or <hi>Oneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:61063:177"/>
and not that the particular received it from the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal. How did the univerſal Church know that thoſe Epiſtles were written by <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus, Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, Philemon,</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> &amp;c. but on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the perſons and Church to whom they were written? or elſe of thoſe particular perſons or Churches to whom the Apoſtle did communicate a copy of them.</p>
               <p>

to believe themſelves without reaſon, and to expect that all others ſhould do ſo too. But if it be not from themſelves that the Pope and Council believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, from whom then is it? not from any others of the preſent Church doubtleſs, therfore it muſt be from the former Church: And if ſo 1. Have not we the ſame means to know that the former Church believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Scriptures as the Pope hath, and therefore may believe it without recourſe to him, and as infallibly as he? 2. And then it ſeems that acccording to their doctrine the Pope and his Council receive not their faith or the Scriptures on the ſame ground as all the reſt of the Church muſt do: ſo that the Church muſt have a twofold foundation of her faith, whereof one is neceſſary only to one part, and not to the other that is, All the reſt of the Church muſt believe the Scripture to be Gods word, becauſe the preſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Where is the Faith of the Church when the Pope is dead, and when there are three or four at a time, and when there is an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption by Schiſme thirty years together, as it is known there hath been: Hath not the Church then loſt her faith by loſing the foundation of it? Or whether then muſt poor Pagans have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to know that Scripture is the Word of God? If Infallibility ſurvive in other Paſtors, then it ſeemes it is not the Pope onely that is infallible, but others as well as he.</p>
               <p>And was not the Churches Faith reſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Infallibility of a Woman in Pope <hi>Joanes</hi> dayes? I know the ſhifts of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Onuphrius</hi> to make the world believe that the Story of Pope <hi>Joane</hi> is but a Fable: <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimondus Remondus</hi> is common on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>But the caſe is out of queſtion thus farre, that we have neer fifty of their own Writers,

               <p>And I marvaile why the Papiſts ſhould be ſo indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious in refelling it, as if their cauſe lay more on this then other things. If a Conjurer, a common Whoremonger, a Murderer, a Simoniſt, a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, may be the infallible judge of the faith, why may not a woman? Hath Chriſt laid more on the Sex then on all theſe? ſpecially if ſhe had but kept her ſelf honeſt, I ſhould have thought <hi>Joane</hi> had been better then <hi>John</hi> the 22. or 23. and many ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that yet was of the more worthy gender.</p>

And further I would know, If the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Rome</hi> were conſumed with fire, or the Pope-dome removed from that Sea (which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth, it is not impoſſile to be done) where then were the infallible head of the Church, and what were become of the Romiſh faith? If they ſay that this can never be, and that Chriſts promiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth the preſervation of the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, 1. It will be long before they will give us any proof of that. 2. Their own writers confeſs the contrary. 3. Let the end determine it. But if they ſay that infallibility is not tyed to the place, but to the Perſon, who ſhall be <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, we thought hitherto that to be <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, and to be the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> had been all one with them.

Laſtly I will appeal to the conſcience of any Papiſt that hath any conſcience left, and hath read the Fathers or Hiſtory of the firſt Ages of the Church whether the reſt of the Biſhops and Curches in thoſe times did believe the Scripture upon the credit of the infallibility of the Pope or the <hi>Romane</hi> Church? Did the reſt of the Apoſtles receive the Goſpel on the credit of <hi>Peter,</hi> or were they ſent by him? or did they receive their authority from him? Do they find that ever the Apoſtles, or any follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Biſhops of the Church did take ſuch a courſe to bring men to the faith, as firſt to teach them that the <hi>Romane</hi> Pope or Clergy were infallible, and therefore to perſwade them to believe the Scriptures or Chriſtian faith, becauſe they ſay its true. Is it poſſible that any learned Papiſts can ſeriouſly believe that this was the ancient way of believing? Do they think in good ſadneſs that the world was converted to Chriſtianity by this means? Sure it is ſcarce poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they ſhould be ſo far diſtracted by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and faction? Do they read in <hi>Clemens Rom.</hi> or <hi>Alexandrin,</hi> in <hi>Ignatius, Juſtin, Irenaeus, Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,

Origen, Cyprian,</hi> or any other of thoſe times, that the preachers that went abroad the world to perſwade men to Chriſtianity, did ever uſe this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Medium, or go this way to work?

infallibility. What man will go to evince a whole ſyſteme of doctrines to be true, and quite forget that medium, by which onely it is firſt to be proved? Would not this have found one place at leaſt if not the chief among <hi>Euſebius</hi> his <hi>Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> or <hi>Demonſtrations</hi>? Where was there ever in all Antiquity found ſuch an Argument as this to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince an unbeliever? [<hi>Whatſoever the Pope and Church of</hi> Rome <hi>determineth is true: But they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine that Scripture is the word of God, or that Chriſtianity is the right Religion: therefore this is true.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Nay further conſider: If this kind of arguing had been then uſed, may not any man ſee that hath not renounced his wits, that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens would have ſorely ſtuck at the Major propoſition? and that it would have met with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny objections and contradictions from them, that ſurely we ſhould have found ſome of them remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred to poſterity. Did <hi>Julian</hi> never ſtick at this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry principle of the faith, the <hi>Romane</hi> infallibility? who ſtuck at ſo many things in the faith it ſelf? Or have <hi>Cyril Alexandr.</hi> and others quite forgot to mention theſe among the reſt of his contradictions? Did it never come into the mind of <hi>Celſus, Porphyry,</hi> or any other unbeliever that we read of to doubt of and object againſt this fundamental infallibility? O what an incredible thing is this?</p>
               <p>Yea and yet the more incredible will it appear, if you conſider, that all the whole cauſe between the Chriſtians and the Infidels, according to the Popiſh conceit, muſt depend upon this one point of their infallibility. For what man will be ſo mad as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Church if he once believe that the Church
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:61063:181"/>
is infallible. Can they think that all the learned Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens were ſuch fools? It muſt needs be therefore that their firſt ſtop muſt be at the Major propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, even at this principle of the Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore certainly their moſt objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons would have been againſt it, and the moſt of the Chriſtian Doctors labor would have been in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of it: But that its certain they then believed no ſuch thing, and the Church was at that time utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unacquainted with the foundation of the preſent <hi>Romiſh</hi> faith.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if this Popiſh foundation had been then known, do you think that the Fathers would not have appealed to <hi>Rome,</hi> for a deciſion of all their perplexing controverſies? What readier way to have ſilenced all gain-ſayers, and ended all ſtrifes, and to have ſaved the labor of ſo many volumes, then to have beſtowed their pains with all diſſenters upon this one point alone [<hi>That</hi> Rome <hi>is infallible</hi>] and then have ſent them thither for ſatisfaction in all the reſt. Common reaſon muſt needs have told men of ſuch principles, that this was the way? But do we find that this way was taken? How come we then to have ſo many volumes of the Fathers controverſal writings, and not one Book, or Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or leaf or line, to prove the <hi>Romane</hi> infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?</p>
               <p>And becauſe the order of our diſcourſe hath brought us up to the judgement of the Fathers, I ſhall here give you a brief taſte of their judgement in this point, and ſo conclude this argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>If the Papiſts can make their followers now believe that <hi>Cyprian</hi> believed the Popes infallibility, or that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was the onely keeper of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or that Traditions were not to be tryed by the Scriptures, then you may ſee to what purpoſe it is
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:61063:183"/>
that they muſt needs be the judges of Controverſie and the ſence of Scripture, and why they call it a Noſe of wax; even that it may be at their ſervice, and ſo flexible as to yield to what ſence they will put upon it, when they will needs exerciſe the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority on the Fathers themſelves who in their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Epiſtles ſpeak as plain as they can.</p>

<q>[And for them that are at <hi>Rome,</hi> they do not in all things obſerve thoſe things which were delivered from the beginning, and do in vain pretend the Authority of the Apoſtles; as may be ſeen in that about <hi>Eaſter</hi> and about ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Divine myſteries, there are ſome diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities with them, and they do not equally obſerve all things as at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> they are obſerved.

But we do both joyn cuſtome to truth, and to the cuſtome of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> we oppoſe cuſtome but of the truth, from the beginning holding that which from Chriſt and his Apoſtles was delivered to us. Nor can we remember any beginning of this — Yea thou art worſe then all the hereticks — See then how igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly thou dareſt to reprehend them, who ſtrive for the truth againſt a lye. For who ſhould more juſtly be angry with the other? he that defendeth Gods enemies or he that conſenteth? But that it is manifeſt that the ignorant are haughty and angry, while for want of judgement and ſpeech they eaſily turn to indignation; ſo that of no man more then of thee doth Gods Scripture ſay, An haughty man breedeth ſtrife, and an angry man heapeth up ſins (<hi>Prov.</hi> 29.22.) For what ſtrifes and diſſenſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons haſt thou made through the Churches of the whole world?

Can there be one Body and one ſpirit with ſuch a a man whoſe ſoul perhaps is not one, ſo ſlippery and mutable and uncertain is it — And yet is not <hi>Stephen</hi> aſhamed to patronize ſuch againſt the Church, and for the defence of hereticks to divide the brother hood; and alſo to call <hi>Cyprian</hi> a falſe Chriſt, and falſe Apoſtle and a deceitful worker; who being conſcious that all theſe were in himſelf, did by prevention, object all that to another by a lye, which himſelf deſervedly ought to hear] So far <hi>Firmilianus.</hi>

<q>[<hi>Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſce fidem quam,</hi> &amp;c. that is, Reacknowledge that Belief which thou deſireſt to hear from the Biſhops but heareſt not. For they of whom it is required do write their own things, and do not preach the things of God; they have drawn about an endleſs and perpetual circle. For the modeſty of humane infirmity ſhould have contained all myſteries of divine knowledge in thoſe bounds of conſcience onely, which he believed in, and not after a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief confeſſed and ſworn in Baptiſm, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, to doubt or innovate any thing elſe. — Under the improbable occaſion of this neceſſity <note n="*" rend="inter">Of keeping the right ſence.</note> the cuſtome is come up of writing and renewing the Belief. Which after that it began rather to frame new things, then to retain what was received, it neither defended the old, nor confirmed the new, and Belief is now become rather (a belief) of the times than of the Goſpels: while it is written ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the years, and not held according to the Confeſſion of Baptiſm. It is a moſt perillous and miſerable thing, that we have as many Beliefs as Wills; and as many Doctrines as manners; and that as many cauſes of blaſphemy ſpring up, as there are vices. And when according to one God and one Lord, and one Baptiſm, there is one Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, we are faln from that Belief which is but one, and while many are made, they therefore begin to be, that there may be none. For we are on both ſides conſcious, that ſince the meeting of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice,</hi> we have wrote nothing but <hi>Beliefes.</hi> While there is quarrel about the words and queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

about the newneſs, and occaſion about the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguityes, and complaints about the Authors, and ſtrife about the parties, and difficulty in conſents, and while every one begins to be an Anathema to another, almoſt no one now is Chriſts. For we are carryed about by an uncertain wind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and either while we teach we trouble, or while we are taught we erre. And what is the change that is in the laſt years belief?

Hear it, not out of newpapers, but out of the Books of God.—Remember, that it is not a queſtion of Philoſophy, but in the doctrine of the Goſpel. I deſire not audience ſo much for my ſelf as for thee, and the Churches of God. For I have my Belief with my ſelf, and need none from without. That which I have received, I hold, and I change not that which is of God. But yet remember that there is no hereticke but doth falſly pretend that he ſpeaks that in which he blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, according to the Scripture. — (Here he names <hi>Marcellus, Photinus, Sabellius, Montaneus, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichaeus, Marcion.</hi>) They all ſpeak Scripture without its meaning; they pretend faith without faith. For the Scriptures lie not in reading, but in underſtanding, nor in prevarication, but in charity. Hear, I pray thee, what is written of Chriſt, leſt under them thoſe things that are not written be preached. Submit thy ears to thoſe things which from (theſe) Books I ſhall ſpeak; lift up thy faith to God: Hear that which profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Belief, to Unity, to Eternity. I will ſpeak to thee with the honor of thy Kingdom and thy faith, all things profitable to the peace of Eaſt and Weſt: under the publike knowledge, under a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing Council, under a famous contention. — I will defend nothing to ſcandal, nor that is without (or beſides) the Goſpel.]</q> Here he reciteth a ſhort creed in Scripture words, eſpecially about Chriſt.</p>

Here I deſire that it may be noted, 1. That Councils may erre and differ. 2. That they are ſo far from being the authorized judges of our belief, that in <hi>Hilaryes</hi> judgement, their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations have occaſioned the ruine and dangerous diviſions of the Church. 3.

<q>[Belike they are altogether ignorant what preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is practiſed in this wicked deed of theirs. For either they perſwade themſelves that the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures were not indicted by the inſtinct of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo are they Infidels, or elſe they think themſelves wiſer then the Holy Ghoſt; and what other thing do they in that than ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves poſſeſſed of the Devil?]</q>
               </p>
               <p>So that if we muſt go to the Arbitration of the Pope to know whether the Scriptures were indited by the Holy Ghoſt. We muſt go to him to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we muſt be Infidels or not? For they that deny this are Infidels. But I hope all the world will not remain Infidels, till they know the Arbitrement of the Pope, or till his Authority move them to be Chriſtians. For its an impoſſibility and contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that any man ſhould believe in Chriſts pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Vicar, as his Vicar, and believe an authority and infallibility which he or his Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Chriſt, before they believe in Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>How <hi>Tertullian lib. de Pudicitia c.</hi> 21. takes up the Pope, if he pretend to his pardoning power from <hi>Do tibi claves,</hi> or <hi>ſupra hanc Petram,</hi> I ſhall for brevity refer you to the place in him.</p>

                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:61063:202"/>I conclude this ranke of teſtimonies in the words of <hi>Tertullian [Credunt ſine Scripturis ut credant contra Scripturas]</hi> They believe without the Scripture,<note rend="inter">Tertull. de praeſcript.</note> that they may believe againſt the Scriptures. Had Scripture been for the Pope and Papiſts, then the Pope and they would have been for Scriptures; and then we might have ſpared all this ado. But becauſe it is againſt them, no wonder if they be againſt it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall next give a touch more of ſome paſſages of Councils concerning this controverſie. And firſt it is known that the firſt Councils did commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree that appeals ſhould be from a Biſhop to a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, or the Metropolitane, and that if the Synod of Comprovincials diſagreed, that the Metropolitane ſhould call ſome of the next Province to aſſiſt them, and that was the higheſt, unleſs there were a more general Council, as <hi>Concil. Antiochen. Can.</hi> 14. and divers more, beyond doubt, declare: So that here was no appeal to the Pope. Yea in the 6. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of that Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> it is decreed that till an offending Prieſt, Deacon, or Layman, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to his own Biſhop, or elſe have given ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to a Synod, that no other Biſhop ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him: ſo that <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf may not receive him: much leſs abſolve him.</p>
               <p>Alſo in the 22. Canon of the ſame Council (and in many other Councils) it is decreed that no Biſhop ſhall come into the City of another Biſhop, not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him about ordination, and if they there or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain any, it ſhall be void, and they ſhall be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by a Synod.

               <p>The caſe alſo which is related in <hi>Auguſtine</hi> between the Catholikes and the Donatiſts ſhews how far they were in thoſe dayes from dreaming of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> deciſive judgement. The great controverſie was, who had the true Church the Donatiſts, or the Catholikes? And the Donatiſts great Arguments were, that <hi>Caecilian</hi> had been ordained by Traditors, and therefore his party and thoſe that communicated with them were not the Church nor to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with. Mark now how the Catholikes plead this cauſe. 1. They procure it heard by the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors <hi>Cognitor, Marcellinus</hi>; and not by the Pope. 2. They never once fetch their proof that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church was theirs from their agreement with <hi>Rome,</hi> or ſubjection to the Pope, nor once in all their mention of the Catholike Church do give the Popiſh deſcription of it, or fetch it from the <hi>Romane</hi> Biſhop as the head; but over &amp; over again they prove that their Church is the Catholike Church becauſe it is [That which beginning at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is tranfuſed over all the world.] and frequently they give this ſame deſcription of it, and hence prove it out of Scripture, as is apparent in <hi>Auſtins</hi> writings at large. They never ſay, the Catholike Church is the <hi>Romane</hi> or that which ſubmitteth to the Pope. 3. Note (which is the chief thing that here I do intend) that it was publikely proved in the conference that firſt <hi>Melchiades</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> with other Biſhops were appointed to hear the buſineſs between <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus a nigris Caſis,</hi> and <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> and that they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:61063:205"/>
                  <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> and condemned <hi>Donatus</hi> And then that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> reſted not here but appealed to the Emperor, and the Emperor cauſed a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Biſhops to meet at <hi>Arles</hi> to hear over all the cauſe again, and theſe Biſhops not agreeing (though they were moſt of them againſt <hi>Donatus</hi>) the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was fain to determine the matter himſelf, who abſolved <hi>Faelix</hi> and <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> and condemned the Donatiſts, yet giving them <hi>liberum arbitrium,</hi> as it was called then, or Liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as it is called now. So that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> acteth but as appointed with others; and his judgement is not that higheſt from which there is no appeal; for the Biſhops at <hi>Arles</hi> muſt judge of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and the Emperor after them.

               <p>I ſhall now leave it to the conſideration of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, by this ſmal taſte of the judgement of former tmes, whether the <hi>Romane</hi> infallibility and univerſal government were a thing known to the Church of Chriſt of old, or yielded as ſoon as ambitiouſly ſought? And whether this be a ſit ground for us to build our faith upon, or
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:61063:208"/>
reſolve it into? And if any would ſee more of the reſiſtancy of their uſurpations, even when it was at the higheſt, he may read in <hi>Mich. Goldaſtus</hi> a multitude of Volumes, that will give him further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: or in Biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher de Succeſſ. &amp; ſtat. Eccleſ.</hi> he may find enough in narrower room.</p>
               <p>The laſt part of this diſputation ſhould conſiſt of an anſwer to the Popiſh Arguments for their cauſe: but I can find ſo little in any of their writings thats worthy to be taken notice of, more then what is anſwered before, that I ſhall not need to ſtand long upon this.</p>
               <p>They tell us that, if our Church be not infallible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then people have ſmall reaſon to hear us or regard us? or to truſt their ſalvation on the doctrine which we deliver to them,; ſeeing for ought we know, or they know, we may but deceive them, as being firſt our ſelves deceived; ſo that this makes way to infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity or uncertainty of the faith, if the Church be not infallible.</p>
               <p>This is their all, the firſt and laſt, for ought I can find (thats worth the repeating) and of how little value this arguing is, me thinks ſhould be very eaſie to apprehend.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Look back to the ſtating of the Queſtion, and remember how far we ſay the Church is fallible, and how far infallible, and it may ſuffice to confute all this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its not all one to be abſolutely infallible, and to be actually Not-miſtaken. Nor to be certain of ſome things, and to be certain of all things that ought to be known or believed: Nor to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by ſuch external evidence of verity and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

grace, as is ordinary to the faithful, and to be certain by a pretended priviledge above all the reſt of the world; even knowing the concluſion as ſuch without knowing the medium. We are certain that Scripture is Gods word: and certain that we are certain; and therefore <hi>pro tempore</hi> infallibly certain: And if we ſhould ſay that we are certain that no true Believer ſhall ever fall from this certainty, we ſhould ſpeak more agreeably to the Proteſtant do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine then to yours, who ſay that they may fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. And we maintain that there is ſtill an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive certainly or Infallibility (if I may uſe the word actively) in the word of God and every ſentence of it, which can never fail, if our faith ſhould fail. And we can manifeſt to our hearers ſuch grounds of their belief, as are infallible, and will never deceive thoſe that truſt in them</p>
               <p>Your argument therefore moſt vainly ſuppoſeth, that mens ſaith muſt be grounded on the word and credit of their Teachers, and that therefore they can have no ſtronger a faith, then is anſwerable to our credit with them. But its no ſuch matter: It is Gods Veracity and not ours that is the formal object of the hearers faith: We do not deſire (as it ſeems the Papiſts do) that they ſhould take their faith on truſt from us, and believe all on our words. We do but reveal to them that word of God, which is the ground of faith; and we prove it to be the word of God, and ſhew them that in it which will prove it ſelf to be ſo: ſo that as long as our Reaſons, Proofs, Evidences are infallible, what neceſſity is there that the ſpeaker muſt be infallible, and that in every thing that ought to be believed?

                     </gap>m)</hi> and why may it not be ſo with us? Will you ſay that you preach in the name of the Pope who is infallible? Why but, how do your hearers know that; Muſt they take it on the preachers word, who proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf fallible? Why then, may they not as well take it on our words that Chriſt and Scripture is infallible! When we ſay, we preach in Chriſts name, as confidently as you ſay that you preach in the Popes name? and ſo your doctrine and ours ſhould be both uncertain, if both reſted on the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible preachers word. But if you will not bid your hearers take your word, but will undertake to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to thtm by cogent evidence, that you are ſent by the Pope, and that he is infallible, and that you ſpeak nothing but what he infallibly warranteth you to ſpeak (all which will be incumbent on you to prove) then will we much more eaſily and truly prove, that God is true and that Scripture is his word (which is all that is incumbent on us to prove; ſeeing an infallible word, of an infallible God, muſt be heard, how fallible ſoever we may be) ſo that you might eaſily ſee, if you would that your task is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably harder then ours (even as much as to prove a falſhood is harder then to prove a truth.)</p>
               <p>How will you approve of ſuch reaſoning as your own in other caſes! What if ten men that have been at a fight, come home and tell you, which ſide had
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:61063:210"/>
the better? though they are all fallible, may they not poſſibly give you ſuch infallible proof of what they ſay, as may make it certain? What if all the Lawyers in the Land are fallible men, yea and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men in the Land; and do not know all things, nor all that ſhould be known about the Lawes? Doth it follow that theſe fallible men, may not infallibly know themſelves and infallibly prove to others, even by certain humane teſtimony, uncapable of deceit, that this or that is indeed a ſtatute Law of the Land made by King and Parliament? Do all men hold their lands and lives by Law, and ſo many dye at the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows by Law, and yet is it uncertain whether they be the Laws indeed or not, and all becauſe the men that ſay ſo, are not infallible (and all are dead that ſaw them made!) Why but a man may be certain of many a thing that yet is not infallible in all things, nor in all that he ought to know. Your argument therefore is ſtrong againſt your ſelves, who reſolve mens ſaith into humane credit, but its nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, who reſolve it into Gods veracity, and teach not men to take all upon truſt from our bare words. It is ſufficient that God is infallible when we perſwade them to believe, and that we can infallibly prove to them that the Scripture is Gods word, and what it containeth in the points of neceſſity to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We can without infallibility in all other matters, infallibly prove to them what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth them to Believe and Do as Neceſſary to Salvation. It is the infallibility of our proofs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not of our bare words, that is neceſſary to mens belief. But the Papiſts expect their miſled flock ſhould take their bare word, and ſo make the faith of their followers, a humane faith; and to blind the buſineſs they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:61063:210"/>
to a certain infallibility as if their ſayings were Divine.</p>
               <p>Men will make uſe of Phiſicians for their bodies though they be not infallible: Much more might they do it with encouragement, if they could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly tell them the true cure of every mortal diſeaſe, though there were an hundred ſmaller diſeaſes that they could not cure, or a hundred queſtions in Anatomy and about the nature of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which they could not reſolve. Why then ſhould men conceit that the Miniſtry is vain that is not infallible, and knoweth not all things. Hath Gods Church been without infallible ordinary guides from the creation to this day, and we muſt now begin to feign a Neceſſity of their infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity? Let it be ſufficient that God, and the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily inſpired Prophets and Apoſtles are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and that we have Teachers that can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly prove to us what he requireth of us in his words in points of Neceſſity to our everlaſting happineſs.</p>
               <p>And for themſelves, pretending to infallibility makes them not, nor procureth them infallible, whereas their voluminous errors, and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed practices grounded thereupon, and their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſelf-contradictions and mutations, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim aloud to the world that they are both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, deceived and deceivers: while the holy Scriptures whoſe ſufficiency they deny is by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves confeſſed to be of infallible verity.</p>

               <p n="1">1. IN the Sacrament of the Euchariſt they teach and urge the corporal preſence of the fleſh of Chriſt. As if that Sacrament were inſtituted to nouriſh bodies and not ſouls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And that the body and blood of Chriſt is made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſent in the Sacrament by Tranſubſtantiation, or converſion of the whole ſubſtance of the bread into the very body of Chriſt, and of the whole ſubſtance of the wine into his very blood.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this Tranſubſtantiation is made by reciting the Sacramental words, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> This is my body. And therefore they call theſe operative words.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That theſe words are to be muttered with a low murmuring: as if Chriſt had ſpoken them Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically to inchant the Bread, and not to inſtruct his Diſciples.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thus they expound them, This (<hi>i. e.</hi> under theſe figures) is my body, and yet they urge the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral ſence, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the body of Chriſt is made of the Bread in the Euchariſt as Wine was made of water.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="406" facs="tcp:61063:239"/>7. And yet that the Prieſts when they make the Body of Chriſt of the Bread, do not produce it <hi>(as ſome will have it)</hi> but do change the ſubſtance of the Bread into the very pre exiſting body.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That after the words of conſecration, the meer accidents, and indeed all the accidents of the bread and wine do remain.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That not ſo much as the firſt matter doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main after the change of the bread.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That the ſubſtance of the bread is conſumed and ceaſeth to be and yet is not anihilated.</p>
               <p n="11">11. That the ſubſtance of the bread ceaſing, the ſubſtance of the body of Chriſt ſucceeds, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under the accidents of the bread.</p>
               <p n="12">12. That thoſe accidents are not in any ſubject, nor do they ſubſiſt of themſelves, but are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by God after a ſupernatural manner.</p>
               <p n="13">13. That they are in ſomewhat elſe, but do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here in it.</p>
               <p n="14">14. That the body of Chriſt does remain in the hoſt, as long as the accidents of bread remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted.</p>
               <p n="15">15. That as long as the body of Chriſt is in the hoſt, It is accompanied with Angels.</p>
               <p n="16">16. That in the corruption of the ſpecies, there is matter ſubſtituted by God, in that very inſtant in which thoſe ſpecies ceaſe to be, and in which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe is Generated.</p>
               <p n="17">17. That the ſubject of theſe Accidents is quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which alſo it ſelf is an accident, and which they feign to ſubſiſt without a <hi>quantum</hi> that hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions.</p>
               <p n="18">18. That the Elements of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt do not nouriſh if taken in a great quantity,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:61063:239"/>
without a Divine Miracle. <hi>And therefore neither do they nouriſh the mice that take a ſmall quantity without a miracle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. But as they take away the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine, and ſo with that the ſubſtance of the Sacrament: ſo they rob the Body of Chriſt of almoſt all the eſſential properties of a true body by this fiction of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
               <p n="20">20. And as they feign the Accidents of bread in the Sacrament without the ſubſtance of it; ſo they muſt needs feign the ſubſtance of Chriſts body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Accidents of it.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Many do teach the preſence of Chriſts body, affirming that one and ſame body of Chriſt undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided does exiſt upon innummerable Altars, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where whole.</p>
               <p n="22">22. That the body of Chriſt being in many places at once, and yet not in the ſpace between, is not diſcontinued or divided from it ſelf in reſpect of its proper ſubſtance or quantity, but only is divided from it ſelf in reſpect of place.</p>
               <p n="23">23. That one and the ſame body of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in heaven and on earth, yea in innumerable places on earth at once is indeed viſible and palpable in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but on earth inviſible, and beyond all our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p n="24">24. Moreover they teach an Oral and Capernaiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Manducation of the fleſh of Chriſt, for they ſay the body of Chriſt in the Euchariſt is really and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually touched, broken, and eaten.</p>
               <p n="25">5. Yea that wicked men receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Altar, do chew the body of
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:61063:240"/>
Chriſt, and break it with their Teeth.</p>
               <p n="26">26. And upon the ſame account, is the very body of Chriſt devoured by Mice and Doggs, if they chance to eat the hoſt.</p>
               <p n="27">27. By reaſon of this Myſtery of Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, they call the Sacrament or conſecrated hoſt, their <hi>Lord and God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28. That the Maſs Prieſt when he makes the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or (as they themſelves ſpeak) the Body of Chriſt, he is the Maker of his Maker.</p>
               <p n="29">29. The Prieſt does adore the conſecrated Hoſt, and does offer it to others by lifting it up to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p n="30">30. And for the ſame end they keep it and carry it in ſolemn Proceſſion, that it may be publikely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored.</p>
               <p n="31">31. That the Euchariſt when it is carryed to the ſick is to be adored by all thoſe that meet it, thoſe that do adore it are to have indulgences, thoſe that don't adore it are to be counted Hereticks, and are to be perſecuted with fire and ſword.</p>
               <p n="32">32. By this Bread-worſhip they commit great idolatry, whilſt that they adore a peice of Bread, with the worſhip of <hi>Latria,</hi> which is onely due to God.</p>
               <p n="33">33. In honor of this Breaden-God they celebrate the feaſt of the body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="34">34. Although they confeſs Chriſt did adminiſter this venerable Sacrament with both Elements of Bread and Wine, and though they acknowledge this Sacrament was received of the faithful in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church with both Elements: Yet they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that it is to be communicated to the Laity in one kind or Element onely, and forbid the Prieſts
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:61063:240"/>
giving it to the people in both kinds, upon pain of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication.</p>
               <p n="35">35. They teach that whole Chriſt is in either of the Elements, and that the whole Nature of the Sacrament is to be found in one of them, neither is any more profit reaped from communion in both kinds then in one.</p>
               <p n="36">36. Nay that he gets more who communicates in one, in obedience to the Church, then he that communicates in both without that huge fruit of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
               <p n="37">37. But this taking away of the Cup from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may ſeem a ſmall matter; for it is done but once every year, at which time the Sacrament is given to the people: For in all the reſt of the Maſſes which are continual and daily, they deprive both the people and the Clergy that do not conſecrate it of both kinds. For in private Maſſes it is held forth to be ſeen by the people and Clergy, and to be adored, not to be received but onely by the Prieſt that makes it.</p>

               <p n="40">40. They have converted the Sacrament of the Euchariſt by which God communicates Chriſt to us, into a real Sacrifice in which they do offer up Chriſt to God.</p>
               <p n="41">41. Alſo the Table into an Altar and the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator of the Sacrament into a Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchizedek.</hi>

                  <pb n="410" facs="tcp:61063:241"/>42. They ſay this new Sacrificing is required, that Chriſts Body may begin to be an obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="43">43. That Chriſt in the laſt Supper did offer his body and blood in both kinds of Bread and Wine, to God the Father as an oblation.</p>
               <p n="44">44. That Chriſt did once offer up himſelf for us upon the Croſs, in the Maſs often by the hands of the Prieſts.</p>
               <p n="45">45. That tis one and the ſame ſacrifice which is done in the Maſs, and which is offered on the Croſs, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they differ in the manner of oblation being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blood.</p>
               <p n="46">46. Every Maſs Prieſt offering Chriſt to God the Father, prayes God to accept that Sacrifice, and to command that it may be carried by the hands of an Angel unto the high Altar of God.</p>
               <p n="47">47. And therefore they make the Prieſt Mediator between God and Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="48">48. The Prieſt in offering that Sacrifice to God for thers, is a Mediator between God and the men for whom he celebrates the Maſs.</p>
               <p n="49">49. That Chriſt, when he ſaid in the Supper, <hi>Do this,</hi> commanded the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors, that they ſhould Sacrifice him and offer him up to God the Father.</p>
               <p n="50">50. That by the ſame words Chriſt did appoint his Apoſtles to be Prieſts.</p>
