            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But if after honest labour and trauell recreatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be requisit, (and that nede no further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation because we fauour the cause wel inough) I had rather teach men so to play, as both honestye may be reserued, their wittes exersised, they them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues refreshed, and some profit also attayned, then for lacke of exercise to see them either passe the tyme in idlenes, or els to haue pleasure in thyngs fruitles and vncomely.

               <p>The seconde thinge considered in the men, is their fashion: for of eyther syde .8. are rounds, other .8. are triangles &amp; .7. (the king making .8) are squares. There fashion is such <hi>roundes triangles squares</hi>

But this difference is betwene the kinges, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the king of the euen nubers, hath a poin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted toppe, the king of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> odde numbers is not pointed, the cause dependeth vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of there numbers by which they arise into piramidall fashion. The third thing considered in the men, is the number that must be written or graue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon them which to learne plainely for practise marke these short rules.</p>
               <p>There be of eche kynde of men, two rankes or orders.</p>
               <p>The first ranke or order of roundes be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> digites euen or odde namely of the euen .2.4.6.8. of the odde .3.5.7.9.</p>
               <p>The second order of rounds are fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by multiplyinge these digites by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues as .2. times .2. is .4.3. times .3. is .9. Of the euen they be .4.16.36.64. of the odde they be .9.25.49, 81.</p>
               <p>The first order of the triangles are fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by addinge two of the roundes together
<pb facs="tcp:20707:12"/>
one of the firste order and another of the seconde order, as .2. and .4. make sixe 3. and .9. make twelue, on the euen syde they are these .6.20.42.72. on the odde syde .12.30.56.90.</p>
               <p>The second order of triangles be made by addynge one to euery one of the first order of roundes, and then multiplying that number in hym selfe: as .2. is one of the firste order of roundes, thereto adde one, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is .3. then .3. tymes .3. is .9. a triangle of the seconde order, on the euen syde. Likewise to thre a rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on the odde side, adde .1. so is it .4. then .4. tymes .4. is .16. On the euen parte, they be .9.25.49.81. on the odde parte .16.36.64.100.</p>
               <p>The first order of squares (in whyche are contayned the kynges) be made by addynge two triangles together, one of the fyrste order, and another of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde, as .6. and .9. make .15. likewyse 12. and .16. make .28. Amonge the euen they be .15.45. and .91. the Kynge .153. amonge the odde they be .28.66.120. and .190. the Kynge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20707:13"/>The last order of squares be found, by dobling of euery one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firste order of roundes, and after adding one, last of all by multipling that number in it self, as twise .2. is .4. and .1. added is .5. so .5. times 5. is .25. likewyse twyse .3. is .6.1. added is 7. then .7. tymes .7. is .49. These be on the euen syde .25.81.169.289. And of the odde syde .49.121.225.361.</p>
               <p>These numbers must be sette vppon the men both on the vpper side, &amp; also on the nethersyde. Except one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kinges, which must with the whole number of their <hi>pyramis,</hi> be marked, onely on the bottome. Because the sydes muste haue other nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, namely the highest point of the euen kyng, must haue .1. y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rounde next vnder him marke with .4. the vper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most triangle w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> .9. the nethermost w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> .16. The vpper most square muste haue .25. The nethermost square shall haue .36. The king of the odde vpon his head, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che is a rounde, not pointed hath .16. vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his first triangle .25. on the second tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle .36. vppon the fyrste square .49.
<pb facs="tcp:20707:13"/>
vpon the lowest square .64.</p>
               <p>Finally it shalbe good for the auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of confusion, to drawe a line vnder euery number. Ells may you take one for another, as <figure/> the euen round &amp; <figure/> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> odde rounde, may be taken one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with oute this lyne or some suche marke, lykewise <figure/> and <figure/> Tryangles bothe of one syde. And this is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the men, the fashion, colours and numbers.</p>
