            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Strange and Lamentable ACCOUNT OF A Bloody Barbarous Murther, COMMITTED <hi>By William Cloſe,</hi>

            </head>
            <p>STRANGE and Amazing are the Prodigious Wickedneſſes of this Age; and altho' the frequent <hi>Examples</hi> of Juſtice might give a ſufficient check to mens minds, yet we find the Puniſhment of many offenders, not forcible enough to deter others from the moſt <hi>Enormous</hi> of <hi>Crimes,</hi> viz. <hi>Shedding of Blood,</hi> and <hi>Deſtroying the Creatures of their own likeneſs,</hi> on whom God hath ſtamped his own Image, but among all the Cruel Scenes of Humane Rage and Barbarous Murthers that have lately happened, we preſent the Reader with one in this Paper, very Terrible and Dreadful, conſidering the Circumſtances that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One <hi>William Cloſe,</hi> ſometime a Servant to an eminent Citizen and Trader in <hi>London,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, about four Years ſince, contracted a Familiarity with a Young Woman that lived by the <hi>Royal Exchange</hi> in <hi>Cornhil,</hi> and at ſundry times they had meetings together, and went abroad to Treats, and merry Meetings, ſo that they were not only ſuppoſed, by the Kindneſs and Familiarity that appeared, to be extraordinary Lovers, but ſome concluded them to be Man and VVife, though, ſince this Fatal <hi>Accident,</hi> no ſuch thing, as far as we can Learn, is evident.</p>
            <p>This Familiarity continuing, there at laſt ſeemed to appear ſome ſigns of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and Diſcontent in either of them, eſpecialy in the Countenance of <hi>Cloſe,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, though not only his Countenance and Actions made it apparent, yet he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled it as well as he could, and they at certain times met as formerly, though the laſt meeting proved the moſt fatal, they had (as we are informed) ſeveral little Quarrels before, but Reconcilements of Friends, and their own humours made up the breach between them, when on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 2d. of <hi>September,</hi> it was agreed between them to go to <hi>Lambeth</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by themſelves, where firſt they went to an Alehouſe on the back ſide of the Town, &amp; there ſome words paſſing between them, the young Woman, apprehending ſome danger from <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>owring Looks, and riſing paſſion, threw away the Knife, that was brought in with ſome Bread and Chees, and bid the Girle, that came in with it, take it away, ſo that, miſſing of his opportunity to miſchief her there, he flattered her into a belief of his well meaning and good Intention towards her, and with many perſwaſions, drew her to a Tavern near the Church, where calling for a Pint of Wine, and ſome eatables, he (as it is ſuppoſed) took his opportunity (all at unawars to her,) to ſtrike her over the forhead with the Pot, which not only wounded her, but bruized, and dinted the Pot very much, at which ſhe gave a Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Cry, but whither the people of the Houſe did not preſently hear it, or mind it, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, but however, before they came up, her throat was cut with a Knife that had been brought up before, her windpipe being cut in ſunder, and ſhe in the Convulſions of Death, Strugling and Panting, though in vain, for Life, with great Effuſion of blood, ſome of which was ſprinkled on him.</p>
            <p>Upon this diſmal ſight, there being none but them two in the Room, he was apprehended as the Murtherer, and being carryed before a Juſtice of Peace, upon his Examination he made ſuch Slender and Frivelous Allegations for himſelf, that they made more againſt him, than for Excuſing him, wherupon he was Committed to the <hi>Marſhalſea Priſon;</hi> in <hi>Southwark</hi> where he now remains in order to his Tryal for wilful Murther. It is ſaid, during theſe familiarities, he had a Child by this young Woman, though not Marryed to her, which might probably be one main matter of breeding the diſcontent between them.</p>
