         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THe ſerious conſideration of our former Parliaments ſolemn Vows, Proteſtations, and Oaths (to maintain the Liberties,
Freedoms, and Priviledges of us the free born people of <hi>England</hi>) hath made ſo deep an impreſſion in our hearts, that
it can never be blotted out, nor yet can we let go out of our mindes, the Angel-like Declarations from the Army, in
vindication of our ſaid Laws and Liberties; and we alſo well remember the preſent Parliaments firſt Declaration, wherein
they told us, and alſo engaged, to tender our Lives, Liberties, and Eſtates, as much as their own, or the neereſt and deareſt
relations they had; yet notwithſtanding, we apparently ſee them turn their backs upon their promiſes and engagements, as
viſibly appears in your caſe; ſo that we have cauſe to cry out with the late Parliament, in their primitive being, Oh how appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
do we ſee our Laws, Liberties, and Priviledges (ſo much contended for, and for which ſo much treaſure, precious
lives, blood, and time hath been ſpilt and ſpent) forc'd and torn from us (<hi>p.</hi> 657. B. Decl.) and yet we can obtain no favour,
remedy, or redreſs; or any Petition received on the behalf thereof, though we have ſought as much after it, as the woman
to the unjuſt Judge, therefore we have juſt cauſe to complain with the Prophet, <hi>Ier.</hi> 22. 3. Even the Dragons draw forth their
breſts and give ſuck to their young, but the daughters of my people are cruel, as the Oſtridge in the wilderneſs, and our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuters
are ſwifter then the Eagles of the heavens, they purſue upon the mountains, and lay baits for us in the wilderneſs;
therefore we a<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e reſolved, come life, come death, to carry on a teſtimony againſt ſuch unrighteouſneſs and injuſtice of men,
very well knowing it to be one witneſs of God on earth, and ſo acknowledged by the Army (p. 40. B. Dec.)</p>
               <p>And we do alſo, in the names of our ſelves and many of our friends in <hi>Hartford</hi>-ſhire, ſalute you: it was no ſmall joy to us
when we heard that the Lord had by your Jury cleared you, whereupon in ſeveral places of our County, your godly friends
did upon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> laſt ſet themſelves ſolemnly to give thanks to the Lord, who had heard our Prayers, when men in power
rejected both us and them: for we went to them a hundred of us, and waited two days upon them, with our Petition on
your behalf, but could get no Anſwer, but that at preſent they could do nothing in it, one Reaſon was, as we were informed,
the paper that was printed that morning, called, Divers informations, that was ſent to them to conſider of, on purpoſe as we
verily believe, from ſome great perſon to obſtruct our buſineſs; do the Authors thereof think that the Lord ſearcheth the
hearts and trieth the reins, and that he will bring every work, and every ſecret thing to judgement? ſo we returned home
with ſad hearts, being aſtoniſhed to think that theſe men of whom we had ſuch choice hopes, ſhould deal ſo unworthily with
us and you; we waited till the Seſſions week came again, to ſee if they would remember themſelves, and do us right, but to
our hearts grief, we ſaw they would do nothing: we drew up another Petition, and choſe out five men from ſeveral parts of
the County, ſent it up ſigned with many hundred hands of the honeſt men of the County, as before; and we dare aver, they
were both as honeſt ſober Petitions, as ever were preſented to a Parliament; but then were our friends more ſlighted then
before, for though they wayted with <hi>Bedford</hi>-ſhire men, and your poor wife, three days with their three Petitions, they
would not ſo much as look upon them, but no marvel, for it is evident by what hath ſince fallen out, that they were reſolved
to lay the foundation of their power in blood, for they have ſlain you already in their hearts, and are guilty in the ſight of
God, of ſhedding your blood; and yet this is not ſufficient, unleſs they can have you actually ſlain, as appears, that beyond
all preſidents, you being cleered by a Jury according to Law, they ſtill keep you in priſon, and call into queſtion both Judge
and Jury, a thing they would not do, we are confident, to the verieſt rogue in <hi>England:</hi> Oh woful cruelty, beyond example!
we are perſwaded that the bleſſed name of God was never ſo prophaned by any generation of men in the world, nor his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
ſuch occaſion given them to blaſpheme, in as much as no men in power before them, did ever pretend to ſuch a degree
of holineſs and piety, and to make it onely a cloak to cover over their cruel and bloody ends, this fills our ſouls with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and our hearts with grief; eſpecially when we conſider what an opportunity was put into the hand of theſe men, to
have made both you and all the honeſt men in <hi>England</hi> their own, whereas now we ſubmit to them, even as the Turkiſh ſlaves
do to their tyrant maſters, in as much as they endeavoured at once to expoſe all our lives, liberties, freedoms and eſtates, to be
taken away at pleaſure, in caſe their actings be drawn into preſidents; if any of us do but anger Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> or any men in
favour with the General or Parliament, all muſt go for it; nay if any of us ſhould give you a cup of cold water in the name
of a Diſciple, we are as much felons as you were, and they had as much ground to try us for our lives, and in caſe a Jury
could not finde us guilty, they might detain us in ſlavery as they do you, againſt all Right and Juſtice. Good Lord! what do
theſe men think? can they imagine that your blood will be pleaſant to them? will it not be bitter in the end? yea doubtleſs; but
the Lord forgive them, though we cannot ſay, They know not what they do: it is true we judge not thus of all, for we know
that there are many precious ſouls among them, the Lord deliver them from the ſnare of the wicked, and the Lord give you
and us hearts to wait patiently upon him till he work deliverance for us; to whoſe gracious protection we ſhall conſtantly
commit you and yours.</p>
               <p>And ſo we conclude with the Armies own words, Oh when ſhall we ſee Juſtice diſperſed without partiality? or when ſhall
the weal of the publike be ſingly ſought after and endeavoured? we hoped to have put an end to all tyranny and oppreſſion, ſo
that Juſtice and Equity ſhould have been done, and the meaneſt ſubject to have enjoyed his right, liberty and propriety in all
things, upon this ground have we gone through all difficulties and dangers, that we might purchaſe to the people of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with our ſelves, a plentiful crop and harveſt of liberty and peace; but inſtead thereof, to the great grief of our hearts,
we ſee that oppreſſion is as great here, if not greater then ever, p. 8, 9. B. Decl.</p>
