            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE HONORABLE COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MITTEE
AT BVRY.</head>
            <head type="sub">The humble PETITION of the chiefe Inhabitants of the Liberty of St. Etheldred and
of Hoxon Hundred, in the County of Suffocke, on the behalfe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and others well affected:</head>
            <opener>Sheweth,</opener>
            <p>THat we doe with much thankfulneſſe acknowledge the great care and induſtry you have taken for the quiet
and proſperity of this County, whiles others have bin torne and broken with oppreſſion and deſtruction. And
as for that, ſo now for ſetting on foot ſo good a worke as the neceſſary arming of the well affected people, and
the juſt diſcovery of the other, lately manifeſted by your commands and Directions ſent to the ſeverall Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds.
A Worke (we confeſſe) of ſingular uſe, not onely for the preſervation of our Selves in quietneſſe and
tranquility, but even for the putting an end to the bloudy Diſtempers of the Nation, which our ſad Hearts mourne to
ſee. In which Commands and Directions of yours, We do humbly obſerve that there is not ſuch a ſufficiency and fulneſſe of
Authority &amp; Directions given, as is requiſite for the tranſacting &amp; carrying on ſo great a Work with power and effect, with
equality and proportion upon all: Without which, We humbly conceive the willing party will be diſcouraged, Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ariſe, and the Deſigne loſt in the Execution. For the ſeaſonable prevention whereof: That the Burden may be equally and
indifferently borne by all, That every one that injoyes a part in the Felicity and Peace of the County, may likewiſe beare a
part in the defence and ſaving of the County, We doe humbly Offer to this Committee theſe Deſires and Conſiderations
following:</p>
            <p>1 We humbly deſire that in this Time of danger, all Men well-affected from the age of ſixteene to ſixty, in this County
may forthwith be put into Armes, diſpoſed and caſt into Companies and Troopes both of Horſe and Foot, Commanders in
chiefe, Captaines and other Officers nominated and appointed over them, and to be liſted and exerciſed this winter ſeaſon;
The Abler ſort to find and ſerve on Horſe, the reſidue on Foot.</p>
            <p>2 We deſire that all men of ability may Arme themſelves, at their owne charge; And for others that are not of ability,
We deſire they may be Armed with Muskets and other uſefull weapons out of the Magazines of the County, and out of the
Armes that have or ſhall be taken from Malignants and diſ-affected.</p>
            <p>3 And ſeeing that Malignants and diſ-affected perſons are not to beare any Armes in this Buſineſſe, and yet altogether
unreaſonable, they ſhould be exempted from the Burden, We deſire that all ſuch may be taxed a full proportionable part in
money to this Service, and alſo all others of abilitythat ſhall not beare Armes in this Buſineſſe; All which may goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Arming of the poorer ſort, that are not able to Arme themſelves, and yet are willing to doe ſervice in this Cauſe:
And what theſe ſhall fall ſhort; to be ſupplyed either out of the ſequeſtred Eſtates of Delinquents, or at the generall and
equall charge of the Hundred or County.</p>
            <p>4 We deſire that a full and ſufficient power and Authority may be given for the calling of all Men together within
their ſeverall Hundreds or Diviſions, and to take the ſubſcriptions of ſuch as are willing, and to compell others that are not,
and to tax and proportion as well ſuch as ſhall be found Malignant or diſ-affected, as alſo all others of ability that ſhall not
beare Armes in this Buſineſſe, and that in caſe of Refuſall or refractorines, ſome penalty may be inflicted.</p>
            <p>5 Seeing it is commanded that a diſcovery ſhould be made of the ill-affected Clergy and others, and we having alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by ſad and long experience what prevailing influence the bold Doctrines and Converſations of ſuch have had, and even
ſtill have into the minds and affections of weake and unſtable people, which is yet more evidently confirmed by ſuch pariſhes
where ſuch are, We deſire ſome power and Authority may be given for the calling in of ſome fit perſons out of every pariſh
where ſuch are to teſtifie in that behalfe, that there may be a more full and thorough Diſcovery made of ſuch, then as yet
hath beene.</p>
            <p>6 We deſire that this honorable Committee would be pleaſed to uſe ſome ſpeedy and effectual means for the Repreſenting
theſe our humble Deſires either to the high Court of Parliament, or to our Noble and Highly Honoured Major Generall
of the Aſſociated Counties, for the full and powerfull Authorizing and eſtabliſhing of theſe things whereby they may be put
in Execurion before the winter ſeaſon be over (which paſſeth ſwiftly) that We may be able to riſe as one Man, to defend
Our Country from invading, or to aſſiſt our Brethren bleeding in the field. And your Petitioners ſhall not onely pray for
the felicity of this vigilant Committee, but ſhall be ready piouſly to Sacrifice our Lives in your Defence.</p>
