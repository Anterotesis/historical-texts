            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I <hi>Huldrick Van Speagle,</hi> doe inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously confesse my boldnesse, and crave pardon of the <hi>Brittains</hi> and <hi>Irish Nation</hi>; for that I (being a stranger) have presumed to write of such Drinkes as are Potable in their Climates and Countries; with such particularities of their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and vertues, as I have by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and practise, with my colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions out of divers learned Authors gathered. I purpose not to insist in a methodicall way, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my quality in a plaine and briefe Relation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18801:3"/>It is not unknowne to men of any reading, that this Iland which hath now regaind it's ancient name of <hi>Great Brittaine,</hi> was by <hi>Brute</hi> inhabited by the remainders of some scattered and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed <hi>Trojans</hi>: the drinkes they used in their best and worst of fortunes after their plantation here, are observed to bee these; <hi>Syder, Perry, Metheglin, Mead, Bragget, Pomperkin,</hi> and chiefely, though lastly, <hi>Ale,</hi> with its appendix <hi>Beere.</hi> Of which in order.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>SYder</hi> (whose Anagram is <hi>Desyr</hi>) desires and deserves the first place, as being the most ancient: it is made of Apples, and is of that antiquity, that it is thought by some to have beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and made by <hi>Eve,</hi> and afterwards practised by <hi>Cain,</hi> who by the making of it in the time of his vagrancy, got a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent estate. Certainely it was a most frequent and usuall drinke amongst the <hi>Trojans,</hi> and was with the remainder of that Nation, first brought into this Iland: It is called <hi>Syder a Sydera,</hi> (as the Dictionary tels me) of the Starres, whose influence in those Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish times was much invoked in the composure of that most excellent liquor, whereof my native Country of the County of <hi>Glocestershire</hi> most plentifully flowes; It doth much refrigerate and qualifie the inward heat of man, it is also very purgative, and cleanseth the small guts of all viscous humours, and is much me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorated by the addition of Sugar, in which way being taken the poorest cottage in <hi>Wales</hi> that affords it, outvies the Sollyard, and the men of that Countrey may without blushing (their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary vertue) paralell it with the glory of the Rhine.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>PErry</hi> is more Aromaticke, being made of Peares, from whence it seemes to have its Appellation: there is much disagreement amongst ancient and moderne Writers about the antiquity, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and derivation of the name of it; <hi>Gorbonus</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> sales, it was first made in <hi>Syria</hi> by one <hi>Pericles. Trappoza</hi> (a most learned <hi>Theban</hi>) ascribes it to one <hi>Periander: Nimpsbagg</hi> will have it from <hi>Persepolis</hi> a City in <hi>Persia:</hi> but some <hi>Brittains</hi> will, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to vindicate the Antiquity of times, of one <hi>Parry,</hi> a Nephew to <hi>Cadwallader</hi> the great, the last King of the <hi>Brittains,</hi> who was most <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="3 letters">

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18801:3"/>Others would seeme to derive it from <hi>Perrue</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> who in regard of the luxuriant soyle, and salubrious ayre abounded wonderfully with Peares; alleadging that <hi>Mangotapon</hi> one of the seven that hid themselves in a cave, called <hi>Particumbo,</hi> at that great deluge of the world, was at his comming forth (for he liv'd to come forth) the first compounder of this drinke, which in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Country he then called <hi>Perrue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amongst all these various opinions of forraigne Authors, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience tels us, that <hi>Worcestershire</hi> is our <hi>Brittish</hi> Magga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zin, or plentifull store-house for <hi>Perry</hi>; nor will I seeke further to dispute the poynt, the drinke being usuall and equall with what hath beene said before of <hi>Syder.</hi> It is very availeable in quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of thirst, good against obstructions of the liver and spleene, and most effectuall against contagious diseases, by the opinion of the Brittish Doctours, to whose treatises I referre the learned for larger instructions.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>MEtheglin,</hi> and <hi>Meade</hi> in regard of the coherence of their conditions, I may very well handle them together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any disparagement to either; how ever there bee some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in their severall compositions, yet the maine Ingredient being Honey stands allowable to both. The common appellation of the first by the name of <hi>Mathew Glinn,</hi> (although it seeme a Nick't name to the world) is generally received by the History of <hi>Monmoth,</hi> to be the Authours name of this Mellifluous mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for this <hi>Mathew</hi> dwelling in a Valley (for so the word <hi>Glinn</hi> imports Englished from the Welsh) being master of a very great stocke of Bees, and wanting vent for the issue of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, in an abundant yeare betooke himselfe wholy to his study, and being most ingenious in things of this nature, in a short time he profited so well, as out of his maternall or mother-wit, of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe he perfected this rare composure. This name being now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geminated by the quotidian calls of his well disposed Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, renders it vendible in the most municipall Townes of those parts, at the rates of six pence the quart, which is the most predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant price of any of our homebred liquors.</p>
               <p>Concerning the vertues of it, it is to be held in most extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb facs="tcp:18801:4"/>
regard, for it is purgative in respect of the <hi>Mell</hi> (or Honey) and of singular efficacy against <hi>Tremor Cordis</hi>; indeed the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much taking of it is to a melancholicke man in the nature of an <hi>Opiate,</hi> and therefore to be refused (if not taken with caution) by men of that constitution.</p>

               <p>HAving gone thus farre, it remaines that I speak something of what hath been, and now is used by the <hi>English,</hi> as well since the Conquest, as in time of the <hi>Brittains, Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> (for the former recited drinks, are to this day confin'd to the Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) so as we enjoy them onely by a statute called the courtesie of <hi>Wales.</hi> And to perfect my discourse in this I shall onely induce them into two heads, <hi>viz.</hi> the unparaleld liquor called <hi>Ale,</hi> with his Abstract <hi>Beere</hi>; whose antiquity amongst a sort of Northerne pated fellowes is if not altogether contemptible, of very little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme; this humour moved the scurrilous pen of a shamelesse writer in the raigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, detractingly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh against this unequal'd liquor. Thus

                     <l>For all of these, Ale is the onely drinking.</l>

               </p>
               <p>Of all Authours that I have ever yet read, this is the onely one that hath attempted to brand the glorious splendor of that <hi>Ale-beloved</hi> decection; but observe this fellow, by the perpetuall use
<pb facs="tcp:18801:5"/>
of water (which was his accustomed drinke) he fell into such convulsion and lethargick diseases, that he remained in opinion a dead man; however the knowing Physicians of that time, by the frequent and inward application of <hi>Ale,</hi> not onely recovered him to his pristine estate of health, but also enabled him in body and braine for the future, that he became famous in his writings, which for the most part were afterwards spent with most <hi>Aleoquent</hi> and <hi>Alaborate</hi> commendation of that Admired and most superexcellent Imbrewage.</p>
               <p>Some there are that affirme that <hi>Ale</hi> was first invened by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great, and that in his conquests this liquor did infuse much vigour and valour into his souldiers. Others say that famous Physician of Piemont (named <hi>Don Alexis</hi>) was the founder of it. But it is knowne that it was of that singular vse in the time of the <hi>Saxons</hi> that none were allowed to brew it but such whose places and qualities were most eminent: insomuch that we finde that one of them had the credit to give the name of a <hi>Saxon</hi> Prince, who in honour of that rare quality, he called <hi>Alla.</hi> Some <hi>Ale</hi>adge that it being our drinke when our Land was called <hi>Albion,</hi> that it had the name of the Countrey: <hi>Twiscus</hi> in his <hi>Euphorbium</hi> will have it from <hi>Albania,</hi> or <hi>Epirus, VVolfgang Plashendorph</hi> of <hi>Gusten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> saies that <hi>Alecto</hi> (one of the three furies) gave the receipt of it to <hi>Albumazer</hi> a Magician, and he (having <hi>Aliance</hi> with <hi>Aladine</hi> the Soldan at <hi>Aleppo</hi>) first brewed it there, whereto may be <hi>Aleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> the story how <hi>Alphonsus</hi> of <hi>Scicily,</hi> sent it from thence to the battell of <hi>Alcazor.</hi> My Authour is of Anaxagoras opinion, that <hi>Ale</hi> is to be held in high price for the nutritive substance that it is indued withall, and how precious a nurse it is in generall to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</p>
               <p>It is true that the overmuch taking of it doth so much exhile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the spirits, that a man is not improperly said to be in the <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> (observe the word I pray you, and all the words before or after) for you shal finde their first syllable to be Ale, and some wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are of opinion that the Turkish <hi>Alcaron</hi> was invented by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> out of such furious raptures as <hi>Ale</hi> inspir'd him withall; some affirme <hi>Bacchus</hi> (<hi>Alias Liber Pater</hi>) was the first Brewer of it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Indians,</hi> who being a stranger to them they named

                  </hi> signifies dead sleepe: <hi>Quies alta,</hi> Great rest; <hi>Altus</hi> and <hi>Alta</hi> noble and excellent: It is (for the most part) extracted out of the spirit of a Graine called Barley, which was of that estimation amongst the ancient <hi>Galles</hi> that their Prophets (whom they called <hi>Bardi</hi>) used it in their most important prophesies and ceremonies: This Graine, after it had beene watred and dryed, was at first ground in a Mill in the Island of <hi>Malta,</hi> from whence it is supposed to gaine the name of <hi>Malt</hi>; but I take it more proper from the word <hi>Matteolus,</hi> which signifies a Hammer or Maule, for <hi>Hanniball</hi> (the great <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Captaine) in his sixteene yeeres warres against the <hi>Romanes,</hi> was called the <hi>Maule</hi> of <hi>Italie,</hi> for it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured that he victoriously Mauld them by reason that his Army was daily refreshed with the spiritefull Elixar of <hi>Mault.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It holds very significant to compare a man in the <hi>Aletitude</hi> to be in a planetarie height; for in a Planet, the Altitude is his motion in which he is carried from the lowest place of Heaven or from the Center of the Earth, into the most highest place, or unto the top of his Circle, and then it is said to be in <hi>Apogaeo,</hi> that is the most Transcendent point of all, so the Sublunarie of a stupified Spirit, being elevated by the efficacious vigour of this uncontroleable vertue, renders him most capeable for high actions.</p>
               <p>I should be voluminous, if I should insist upon all pertinent and impertinent passages in the behalfe of <hi>Ale,</hi> as also of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive fame that <hi>Yorke, Chester, Hull, Nottingham, Darby, Graves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end,</hi> with a Toaste, and other Countries still enjoy, by making this untainted liquor in the primitive way, and how <hi>VVindsor</hi> doth more glory in that Composition than all the rest of her spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative pleasures, which is dayly strengthened by the Agitive endeavours of the most pregnant spirits there, whose superlative issue affords us a quotidian expectation, and questionlesse cannot but succeed with generall applause in regard of the undertakers; Also there is a Towne neere <hi>Margate</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> (in the Isle of <hi>Thanett</hi>) called <hi>Northdowne,</hi> which Towne hath ingrost much Fame, Wealth, and Reputation from the prevalent potencie of their Atractive <hi>Ale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will onely now speake somewhat of its vertues, and in the
<pb facs="tcp:18801:6"/>
weakenesse of my expressions shall crave pardon, of those many and learned Doctors of our Time, whose daily and gustave Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation addes to the glorious Splendour of that unequall'd Element.</p>
               <p>Concerning the fructifying or fruitfulnesse of <hi>Ale,</hi> it is almost incredible, for twice every yeere there is a Faire at a small Towne called <hi>Kimbollon,</hi> or <hi>Kimolton</hi> in North-hamptonshire, (as I take it) in which towne there are but 38. houses, which at the Faire time are encreased to 39. <hi>Alehouses,</hi> for an old woman and her daughter doe on those dayes divide there one house into two, such is the operation and encreasing power of our English <hi>Ale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First then, it is a singular remedy against all melancholick dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, <hi>Tremor cordis,</hi> and Maladies of the spleene, it is purgative and of great operation against <hi>Iliaca passio,</hi> and all gripings of the small guts, it cures the stone in the Bladder, Reines or Kidneyes, and provokes Vrin wonderfully, it mollifies Tumors and swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the body, and is very predominant in opening the obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Liver. It is most effectuall for clearing of the sight, being applied outwardly, it asswageth the unsufferable paine of the Gowt called <hi>Artichicha Podagra,</hi> or <hi>Gonogra,</hi> the Yeast or Barme being laid hot to the part pained, in which way it is ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to all Impostumes or the paine in the Hippe called <hi>Sciatica passio</hi>; Indeed the immoderate taking of it (as of the best things) is not commended, for in some it causes swimming in the head and <hi>Vertigo,</hi> (but I speake still of moderation) in which respect it is not onely availeable for the causes aforesaid, but for all defluxions and Epidemicall diseases whatsoever, and being Butter'd (as our Gallenists well observe) it is good against all Contagious disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Feavers, Agues, Rhumes, Coughes and Catarres with <hi>Hernia Aquosa &amp; vertosa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might proceed to nominate the Townes of the Kingdome that have their happinesse to enjoy their names from <hi>Ale, Ales<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord,</hi> in <hi>Hampshire,</hi> and <hi>Alesbury</hi> (or <hi>Aylesbury</hi>) in <hi>Buckingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> Where the making of Aleberries so excellent against Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks was first invented. As also of many Sirnames of great worth in this Kingdome, as these of <hi>Ale-iff, Ale-worth, Good-ale, Penny-Ale,</hi> and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the generous and antient name of <hi>Lamsd-Ale,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18801:6"/>
but not to insist further, in this straine, I make no question, but the Capacious apprehension of a free understanding will spare me that labour.</p>
               <p>I will therefore shut up all with that admirable conclusion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted upon in our time by a discreet Gentleman in a solemn As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, who, by a politick observation, very aptly compares <hi>Ale</hi> and Cakes with Wine and Wafers, neither doth he hold it sit that it should stand in Competition with the meanest Wines, but with that most excellent Composition which the Prince of Physitians <hi>Hippocrates</hi> had so ingenuously compounded for the preservation of mankinde, and which (to this day) speakes the Author by the name of <hi>Hippocras,</hi> so that you see of Antiquity, <hi>Ale</hi> was famous amongst the <hi>Troians, Brittaines, Romans, Saxons, Danes, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, English men, VVelch,</hi> besides in <hi>Scotland,</hi> from the highest and Noblest Palace to the poorest or meanest Cottage, <hi>Ale</hi> is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall, and for Vertue it stands allowable with the best receipts of the most Antientest Physitians; and for its singular force in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion of poison is equall, if not exceeding that rate Antidote so seriously invented by the Pontique King, which from him (till this time) carries his name of <hi>Mitbridate.</hi> And lastly, not onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by a National Assembly, but more exemplarily remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated by the frequent use of the most knowing Physitians, who for the wonderfull force that it hath against all the diseases of the Lungs, Justly allow the name of a <hi>Pulmonist</hi> to every <hi>Alebrewer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The further I seeke to goe the more unable I finde my selfe to expresse the wonders (for so I may very well call them) operated by <hi>Ale,</hi> for that I shall abruptly conclude, in consideration of mine owne insufficiency, with the fagge-end of an old mans old will, who gave a good summe of mony to a Red-fac'd <hi>Ale-drinker,</hi> who plaid upon a Pipe and Tabor, which was this:
<q>
                     <l>To make your Pipe and Tabor keepe their sound,</l>

                     <l>There growes no better med'cine on the ground,</l>

                  <hi>Ale</hi> is rightly called Nappy, for it will set a nap upon a mans threed bare eyes when he is sleepy.

The Physitian will commend it; the Lawyer will defend it, It neither hurts, or kils, any but those that abuse it unmeasurably and beyond bearing; It doth good to as

               <p>NOw, to write of <hi>Beere,</hi> I shall not need to wet my pen much with the naming of it, It being a drinke which Antiquitie was an <hi>Aleien,</hi> or a meere stranger to, and as it hath scarcely any name, so hath it no habitation, for the places or houses where it is sold doth still retaine the name of <hi>An Alehouse</hi>; but if it were a Beere-house, (or so called) yet it must have an Inferiour stile of hous-roome than An Alehouse; for <hi>An</hi> is the name of many a good woman, and the name <hi>An</hi> cannot be properly given to a Beere-Brewer, or Beere-house; for to say <hi>An</hi> Beere Brewer or <hi>An</hi> Beere house is ridiculous; but <hi>An Ale</hi>-Brewer or <hi>An Alehouse</hi> is good significant English; or to say <hi>An</hi> Beere brewer or <hi>An</hi> Beerehouse or (by your favour <hi>An</hi> Taverne) is but botching language in great Brittaine; but to say A <hi>Alebrewer</hi> or A <hi>Alehouse,</hi> is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper than to bid a childe A A in his Chaire, when there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chaire or stoole.</p>

               <p>I commend not intemperance in all these allegations, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may please to Remember my former test for moderation, and <hi>Sack,</hi> being so taken, will be to the moderate taker a comfort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst cares and crosses, and so with <hi>Iuvenals</hi> words in his foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth satire I shut up all;

            <l>So still, of all the workes of God, most glorious</l>

            <l>It doth surmount the Ayre, the fire it quenches</l>

            <l>Where many die, old, young, some great, some small,</l>
            <l>But water flouds plaies sweep-stake with them all.</l>
            <l>Earth may be barren, and not yeeld her store:</l>
