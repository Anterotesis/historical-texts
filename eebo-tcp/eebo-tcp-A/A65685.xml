            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Humble Petition of <hi>Edward Whitaker</hi> Gent. Prisoner in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>Most humbly sheweth,</opener>
            <p>THat your Petitioner having lain under a Close Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the said <hi>Tower,</hi> for about the space of Four months, by vertue of a Warrant of Commitment for High-Treason, under the Hand and Seal of Sir <hi>Leoline Jenkins</hi> Knight, one of His Majesties Justices of the Peace for the County of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> as by the Copy of Commitment appears; who by colour of his being Secretary of State, committed your Petitioner (though but a mean Commoner) to the said <hi>Tower,</hi> not only against the Common Law of this Land, but also against the Statute made in the Fifth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, which provides, That no Justice of Peace shall commit any Person but to the Common Gaol; nor is there any Provision in that Statute, that a Secretary shall have power to commit to an unlawful Gaol, more than other Justices of Peace.</p>
            <p>That by Law there is no Prison of State in <hi>England</hi> for Commoners, nor was the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London</hi> ever made use of as a Prison of State, but by Parliament, and the King and Council, for great Personages, out of respect to their Quality. Your Petitioner lying under this Oppression, petitioned this Court last Sessions to be Tried or Bailed, according to the Statute of the 31 of this King; and then prayed your Honours who were of the Degree of the Coif to grant your Petitioner a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> upon the said Statute, to bring your Petitioner before your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, in order to such Ends: He believing then (as still he doth) that such Writ could not be denied him, without the Forfeiture mentioned in the said last-recited Act; which Act was never intended to be defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or evaded by any Tower or Fort in <hi>England.</hi> For that your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner well knows, that a Commission of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> being in Execution in any City or County, the Commissioners that act therein have power to bring any Person before them, from any Prison what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever within the said City or County, to be tried or acquitted by the
<pb facs="tcp:64552:2"/>
Course of Common Law; much more since the making of the said Statute for securing the Liberty of the Subject, which was so intended, and not that the said <hi>Tower,</hi> which is in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middlesex,</hi> should debar any Person from having the Liberty of a Subject, contrary to the known Law of the Land.</p>
            <p>That your Petitioner being an innocent Person, and a free born Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>England,</hi> cannot but expect the full Benefit of the Law, as his just due; and is well assured, that if an Indictment was found against him at this or any other Sessions, the Writs of <hi>Habeas Corpus ad deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berandum &amp; recipiendum</hi> would certainly be of power enough to bring your Petitioner to that Court to be Tried, without any Scruple in Law, as also any other <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> upon the said Statute. And your Petitioner conceives there is the same Justice in granting your Petitioner such VVrits, to discharge him, if nothing be against him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so long Imprisonment, as to bring him to be Tried and Condemned.</p>
            <p>That your Petitioner conceives the Laws of the Land are the only Bulwarks which preserve the Nation, and every individual Commoner (in their just Rights) from Violence: The Kings of <hi>England</hi> being sworn to maintain the Laws; and such of your Honours as are Judges are sworn to administer Justice indifferently between the King and His Subjects, and not delay or deny Justice to any Person. Upon these Considerations, your Petitioner not being the last Sessions, according to his Petition, Tried or Bailed, as was then prayed, and your Honours not granting him his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> as desired, according to the said Statute of this King;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tour Petitioner therefore now most humbly prays your Honours (as his Right by Law) to be discharged from his Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment this Sessions: And that your Honours will grant your Petitioner an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to the Constable or Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> to bring your Petitioner and set him before your Honours, in order to be discharged from his Imprisonment according to Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <closer>And your Petitioner shall ever pray, <hi>&amp;c,</hi>
