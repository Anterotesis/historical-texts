            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This demie-god being perfected and ſent vpon the earth, when as none could condemn either the creature of want, or the creators for lacke of ſkil; <hi>Momus</hi> at length found this fault, that the gods had not made a window in his breaſt through which to perceiue the inward thoughts and ſecrets of his heart (meaning as I coniecture) that as the glitteringſt Diamond being broken diſtilleth the deadlieſt poyſon, as the ſtone <hi>Ceuranon</hi> burneth without when it freezeth within, and as the Nightingale hath a moſt ſweete voice, but vnfauourie fleſh: ſo there is none ſo comely in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but may be corrupt in his mind, none ſo fine in his feature, but may be faultie in his faith, nor any ſo louing in his looke, but may be lowring in his heart. Whereupon I thinke that <hi>Tully</hi> in his booke <hi>de Amicitia,</hi> conſidering the double dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of men, how they carried moſt commonly two faces like

For ſeeing there is nothing more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnto the life of man then to be enuironed with faithful and vnfained friends, into whom he may tranſport his affections, repoſe his ſecrets, and commit his enterpriſes, ſo he ought to beſtow the greateſt paines and careful induſtry in the finding of them, eſpecially in theſe our preſent times wherein flatterie is become ſuch a common arte and ſo much practiſed of moſt men, that almoſt euery ruſticall companion &amp; illiterate peſant can repreſent like a looking-glaſſe what mans quallities and conditions he wil: So that good cauſe hath euery one with <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſes</hi> to feare the incha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting harmony of ſweet ſinging <hi>Syrens,</hi> ſeeing vnder the faireſt flower often lurkes the fouleſt ſerpent and thoſe that profeſſe moſt liberal affection in words, are oft proued the deadlieſt enemies in deede. Wherfore not without good reaſon did <hi>Darius</hi> eſteeme more of his faithful <hi>Zaphirus</hi> then of his conqueſt of an hundred chiefe-taines of his Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian enemies, for kingdomes may be gotten by pollicie, and enimies ſubdued by the ſword, but an vnfained friend by nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be obtained, wherefore <hi>Zeno</hi> the philoſopher was of this opinion that the loſſe of a friend was only to be lamented: which <hi>Ageſilans</hi> the Greeke ſeemeth alſo to affirme, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded why he did more lament the heauines of his friends then the death of his children, made anſwere, I do not bewail the want of my wife, the loſſe of my goods, or the death of my children, for al theſe are but parts of my ſelfe: but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile the death of my friend which is another my ſelfe, whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:10896:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
like I am not likely euer to light vpon, ſeeing true frendſhip is ſo ſeldome ſeene, and being ſeene, ſo greatly admired, ſo that we reade of <hi>Alexander,</hi> who for his noble conqueſts and ſpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous regiment, was ſurnamed the great, that in al the prouinces kingdomes, and empires, which moſt victoriouſly he paſſed through, he found but one faithful and vnfained friend named <hi>Caliſtenes</hi>: The like we reade of <hi>Xerxes, Nero, Dioniſius,</hi> &amp; many other renowmed peers and potentates in the world, who are not reported to haue had any more then one friend. And if we allow of the counſel of <hi>Seneca</hi> a wiſe and diſcreete man, if he might haue many (as he cannot) yet wil not admitte any more then one: for if there be danger (ſaith he) in enemies, there can be no ſurety in the multitude of friends, ſeeing in reſpect of their number they breede difference of conſent and wil, with variety of conditions: and where is no conformitie of manners, there can be no perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in friendſhip. Furthermore one friend ought not to ſay to another, I wil not, or, I can not, ſince it is a priuilege in friendſhip to find nothing impoſſible: therefore who ioynes friendſhip with another, binds himſelfe not to deny the thing that his friend requires him to do, ſeeing in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the ful office of frendſhip, to owe to our friends our ſelues and al that we haue. But how can a man that is ſaid to haue many friends, execute this office of true friendſhip, when in the ſame inſtance one friend inuites him to a banket, and another ſends for him being ſicke: one requeſts him to pleade his cauſe againſt his aduerſarie at London, and another to ride with him about other affaires to Douer, where you ſee he can do his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to no more but one, and conſequently al the reſt do ſeeme to be deſpiſed, &amp; their friendſhip little or not at al regarded: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeareth, that true friendſhip can bee onely in the duall number, namely an vnfained conſent of two mens willes and affections, &amp; a tranſportation of two hearts into one body: and therefore a frend is called <hi>alter idem,</hi> another moity, or another ſelfe. The riuer that is diuided into many brookes, experience ſhewes vs the ſtreame to be very ſlowe and ſhallow: ſo loue which is deuided amongſt many cannot bee ſo great as that which hath but one ſubiect to worke on: and therefore <hi>Homer</hi> ſpeaking of a child whom his, father entirely loueth indeede,
<pb facs="tcp:10896:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
calleth him <hi>Solum, atque in ſenio natum,</hi> that is, his fathers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſonne, and borne when his parents were paſt hope to haue any more. Wherefore ſeeing thou canſt haue but one true friend, whoſe boſom muſt be a place of retract for al thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, opinions, actions, and interpriſes, what care and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpections oughteſt thou to haue in chooſing this one. They that trie poyſon by the taſte, deſtroy themſelues therewith, and he that wil admit a friend before he knoweth him, moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly hurts himſelfe whileſt he proueth him, as the Satire thought the fire to bee ſome great goddeſſe, by reaſon of the brightneſſe and warmth that it gaue, &amp; therefore would needs imbrace it, and kiſſe it, hauing burnt his venturous lips, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metheus</hi> tolde him the nature and force thereof: ſo paraſites or flatterers becauſe their words are pleſant to the eare, many imbrace them &amp; commit themſelues and al that they haue vnto them, til hauing tried their more ſecret operation they beginne to crie <hi>Caue</hi> when their coyne is conſumed, and to be chary whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue nothing whereof to take charge, then they can tell others, that mens harts and tongues, are no perfect relatiues, and that it is not alwaies true, that what the heart thinks, the tongue clacketh, &amp; can verifie it with a <hi>probatum</hi> of their owne. It were better to be wiſe too ſoone then repent too late, and to looke before we leape, leſt we fall into their ditch, for if we are once downe, there are few that wil lend vs their hands to help vs vp againe and carry vs through al the ſtormy waues of our diſtreſſe, as the dolphin did <hi>Arion,</hi> but euery one almoſt will anſwere as they did the young man in <hi>Plautus</hi> in his neceſſity, with a <hi>Non eſt,</hi> that is, faith friend you come to a wrong box, I ſtand in as much need as your ſelfe, or as the crow did the kite, when it happened the one to be bare of feathers, the other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that to him were no more then ſufficed him to flie, and yet they wil promiſe one in his proſperity neuer to forſake him, as <hi>Peter</hi> promiſed Chriſt, who in a while after did vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie him, and forſweare too, therefore not vnfitly did <hi>Plinie</hi> compare men vnto the fifh <hi>Palerna,</hi> which being paſſing white in the calme, yet becommeth blacke at euery ſtorme, and like vnto the <hi>Heban</hi> bloſſomes, which open with the dew and ſhut with the ſunne: ſo in proſperitie they fawne, but in aduerſitie

The <hi>Troians</hi> neuer ſhewed more fauour vnto any then vnto wretched <hi>Sinon,</hi> who afterward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied their citie vnto the <hi>Gaecians:</hi> and none was more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vnto <hi>Carthage,</hi> then ſtraggling <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and yet hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paied them with moſt ſhameful abuſes: <hi>Seuerus</hi> the Emperor neuer beſtowed more benefits vpon any, then on his ſeruant <hi>Plautianus,</hi> for he made him copartner with him in thempire, who ſhamed not for all this to hire <hi>Saturninus</hi> trecherouſly to murther his frend ſo faithful and lord ſo louing, <hi>Seuerus:</hi> The <hi>Babilonians</hi> neuer truſted any more then the forenamed <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirus</hi> who moſt villanouſly betraied them into the hand of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius:</hi> And <hi>Thraſo</hi> in <hi>Terence,</hi> neuer affected man more then his paraſite <hi>Gnatho,</hi> by whom he was deliuered vp as a prey to his enimies, with an <hi>hunc ego comedendum &amp; bibendum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis propino.</hi> But if theſe and the reſt whom we reade to haue taſted of the ſame ſauce had prudently pondered the ſugered ſubtilties of the world, they needed not to haue locked the dore when the ſteede was ſtolen, nor by their owne harmes to haue learned to beware. Therefore ſeeing we perceiue the trap, let vs not fooliſhly follow the traine, nor ſwallow the bait, wherin is ſhrowded the intent of our bane, neither let vs thinke with the pike to caſt vp the hooke which we haue ſwallowed, when wee pleaſe without preiudice to our perſons, for if we haue once entertained a knaue we ſhal not eaſily be rid of him, but preſently hee becomes like fulſome meate which wee cannot keepe in our ſtomackes, without hurting vs, nor vomit it vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone as it went in, but mingled with other meate, which would haue nouriſhed and cheriſhed vs: So when we haue receiued a counterfait and harbored him, with our hindrances we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continue with him but he wil hurt vs, neither ſhake him off ſo clearely, but heiwil go better away then he came, therefore <hi>Principijs obſta,</hi> take heede at the firſt, and thou ſhalt do wel i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, beleue not at the firſt that it is gold becauſe it gliſtreth, neither ſweare that the <hi>Polipus</hi> is white, becauſe he ſeemed ſo once vnto thee, nor that ſuch a one is an honeſt man, becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:10896:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thou neuer foundeſt him otherwiſe: for <hi>Proteus</hi> can turne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into more ſhapes then one, and <hi>Iupiter</hi> if he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the loue of a faire ladie, can turne himſelfe from a bull, into a ſhowre of gould to deceiue ſimple <hi>Danae</hi>: ſo a paraſite hath more cranckes in his budget to deceiue then one: he hath one for the ſcholler, another for the courtier, one for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, another for the yeoman, one for this good fellow, another for that. If he chaunce to meete with a ſcholler in the Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity troubled with an heauie purſe, preſently he calles to mind the ſaying of S. Paul, that willes vs to beare one anothers burden, and therefore without delay whileſt the ſpirit knocks he wil open, leſt be find not ſo much grace at another time, and therefore (becauſe birds of a feather wil flie together, and the ſcholler wil truſt or beleeue the ſcholler, rather then another) he begins to be as preciſe as a knaue in a cage: firſt he puts on the blacke cloake &amp; the falling hand, then he walkes like <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona</hi> in her equipage, with his eyelids cloſe, hee ſpeakes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without <hi>Propterea quod,</hi> to conclude, all the day he is in contemplation, or rather meditation how hee may beſt eaſe his brother of his burden, but if he perceiue that hee hath met with a wilie brother that hath read ouer <hi>Plutarch de diſcrimine adulatoris &amp; amici,</hi> then off goes the blacke cloake &amp; the long picardeuaunt, and hee muſt be cut againe according to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, then he makes rimes on <hi>Platoes</hi> crooked ſhoulders, and tries how he can ſcoffe at <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> ſtammering voice. If he chance to meete <hi>Bias</hi> ſomewhat whitteld in an alehouſe as hee walkes alone, as <hi>Struthias</hi> did, he commends him highly for ouercomming ſo many pewter-Iohns, and tells him how <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> is as much famous for his quaffing, as <hi>Thales, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Periander, Cleobulus, Chilon,</hi> and <hi>Pittacus</hi> were for their wiſedome, yea as <hi>Miſon</hi> himſelfe, whom <hi>Apollo</hi> ſaid to be wiſer then him. Furthermore he ſhewes him that a man is not borne onely for himſelfe, but alſo for his neighbours, and therefore it is a good deede of charitie to helpe a poore ale-wife away with a dozen of beere next his heart in a morning, alſo it is good to increaſe bloud, to quicken the ſpirit, and ſo to ſpeake more wiſely, and conſeqúently, to be more eſteemed, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wils him to call in the other halfe dozen, till at the laſt hee
<pb facs="tcp:10896:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath brought into his fooles paradiſe (his bed I meane) where he ſtrips him as cleane of his come as an ape of a taile, before drunken <hi>Bias</hi> can get out of his <hi>memento.</hi> Againe if he fal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with an idle and ſhameful magiſtrate, which cares not (as they ſay) which end goes formoſt, hee tells him magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracie is but a troubleſome toiling in other mens buſines, and the moſt profit that a man ſhal reape thereby, is but a wind of mens mouthes, and the moſt buſie bodies haue leaſt thankes, for their labours, and therefore it were as good, to neither me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle nor make, as to troble himſelfe and be neuer the better, but if hee perceiue him to be very laborious and painefull in his office, hee alſo beginneth to change his note, and tells him that it is a pleaſant thing to bee idle, but verie ful of diſcredit, and a man that hath loſt his credit, is halfe hanged &amp;c. If hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie with ſome liberal ſeruing creature hee can geſſe at his conditions, which are moſt commonly to ſweare, drinke, and hunt after whoores, if hee be a young practiſioner he teacheth him to ſwill it in, and ſweare it out, he reproues him friendly if he ſweare any baſe or beggarly oath, as by faith and troth, and as God ſhal iudge him, he telles him if hee loue his credit he muſt thunder them out like <hi>Iupiter,</hi> or elſe he ſhames himſelfe and al his friends. If he ſee him not wel at eaſe, he wiſhes him to purge himſelfe, if he underſtand not this myſtery, he tells him more plainly, that for a peece of money he wil fetch him a ſuppoſitiue out of petticoate lane that ſhal make him purge out all the groſſe humours in his body. But if hee perceiue him better diſpoſed, hee tells him that he plaies the part of an honeſt man, and al that he ſaid was naught, but to trie him, and if he had bin bent that way, friendly to haue diſwaded him from it, by which meanes he wins the loue and friendſhip of al men vnto himſelfe. But it were a world to ſay as much as might be ſaid, and altogether vnneedeful, ſeeing wee may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>Hercules</hi> his foote, the greatnes of his whole body, &amp; by theſe few things that flattery is a miſtery, which euery foole cannot vnfolde at the firſt. But if thou wouldeſt know the ſafeſt and ſureſt way to eſcape their fingers, then harken vnto the counſel of <hi>Epicarmus</hi> ſaying, <hi>Eſto ſobrius ac memento nulli temerè credere,</hi> that is, <hi>be wiſe and circumſpect in thy dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
<pb facs="tcp:10896:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and beleeue no man raſhly.</hi> Into which counſell before we go any further, let vs looke more narrowly: of whom doth he bid vs beware? What? of our enemies? why there is none ſo fooliſh except he be ſtarke mad (I thinke) as was <hi>Aeſops</hi> cocke that would beleeue the fox, to folow his counſel, of whom he knowes he is deadly hated, therefore belike he biddeth vs to beware of our friends, neighbors, and alies, whom no man mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſts, euery one beleeues and wil ſweare for their fidelitie. Therefore let vs call to mind whether our manifeſt, ſworne, &amp; profeſſed enemies haue done vs moſt miſchief, or our ſuppoſed friends, our kinſmen, and allies. Surely if we would ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hiſtories (witneſſes of former times) we ſhall perceiue more caſtles ouerthrowne, cities ouercome, kingdomes and empires vtterly waſted and extinguiſhed, by falſe hearted frends, and outwardly ſworne brethren, then by the mightie hand of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed ennemies, as <hi>Troy</hi> ſuffered more dammage in one night by <hi>Sinons</hi> fained teares, then by the power of the <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> in ten yeares, and more complaints in aduerſitie of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and frends, then accuſations of enemies, for againſt our enemies we furniſh our ſelues by ſea and land, wee erect ſtrong and mightie caſtles on the bordures, wee furniſh them with men, and munition, and al things requiſite for the defence of our liues, and liuing, and therefore we ſeldome are aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and if we be, we eaſily ouercome, but among fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens <hi>qui ijſdem ſacris ac fames vtuntur,</hi> there is continuall iangling and brawling, often going to law, yea betweene bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and brother, for iniuries offered: ſo that the miſerly father who hath bin a ſcraping together a little pelfe al his life time, caring not which way he came by it, ſeemeth to haue liued to haue ſet folkes together by the eares at his death; namely, the deuills for his ſoule, and his children for his goods, what then ſhould a man do to liue a quiet and peaceable life, and ſafe from the ſnares and engins of all men? ſhould hee ſeuer himſelfe from the company of all men as <hi>Timon</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> did? or els ſhuld he haue no eares like the picture of <hi>Iupiter</hi> in Creet, whereby he might be deceiued? ſhould hee ſcratch out his eies with the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> for feare of <hi>Venus</hi> charmes? or with <hi>Lewes</hi> the ſecond ſonne of <hi>Charles,</hi> king of <hi>Fraunce</hi>

Thinke not therefore with the ſwallow, euery ſun-ſhine to be a ſummers day, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one that ſhewes thee a faire face, to beare thee inwardly a faithfull heart, but thinke that the leaues of the Date tree wil change their colour if the wind be not alwayes in the ſame quarter: that <hi>Dedalus</hi> images wil flie away if they be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies tied, &amp; that flatterers wil fade if thou bind them not dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the bands of thy purſe ſtrings, therefore <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> compareth them to the <hi>Celedony</hi> ſtone, which retaineth his vertue no longer then it is rubbed with gold, and vnto the <hi>Marigold</hi> which openeth her leaues as long as the Sunne ſhineth, but with the leaſt cold begins to cloſe: So when for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune fauoureth a man, they laugh, when ſhe frowneth on him, they lowre.

We neede not borrow examples from former ages or antiquity, for (alas) euery citty. towne, and village, can lend vs whole legions of them, how one friend hath ſlaine another, how the father the children, and children haue ſlaine their fathers, yea they do not onely not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from murthering their deareſt friends and neareſt in bloud, but alſo if they be defeated of their wil, or iniured of one of whom they know not how to be reuenged, they wil not feare to kill themſelues, as <hi>Aiax</hi> did being defeated by <hi>Vliſſes</hi> of <hi>Achilles</hi> armour.

But his too tender heart toward his yonkers and wanton flatterers brought him to this, who made him abhorre like <hi>Rohoboam,</hi> the counſell of his deare friends and graue ſenatours, and ſo to runne headlong into all vices and villanies, vnbeſeeming a Prince or gouernour of a common wealth who is a rule vnto al his ſubiects, after which they ſquare out their actions and affections, as the Poet ſaith, <hi>Regis ad exemplum totus componitur orbis,</hi> that is as we ſay, Like maſter, like man, if the Prince be vicious, al his ſubiects (for the moſt part) are as bad or rather worſe, as when <hi>Traian</hi> was iuſt al his ſubiects loued iuſtice, and in <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> daies, al were wanton and giuen to gluttony and leachery, in that he was a glutton, and a drunkard, and one that loued a whoore as wel as his life: but againe to our matter.

ſee that the Amber ſtone freeſeth not within, when it frieth without, and to trie whether a mans properties be agreeing to his profeſſion, leſt like <hi>Ixion</hi> we take hold on a cloud when we thinke to embrace <hi>Iuno,</hi> and chooſe grapes in ſhew like thoſe of <hi>Darius</hi> vine, and looſe grapes in ſubſtance like thoſe of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandois,</hi> and abound with friends in words when we thinke to be inuironed with friends indeede. A man is as his mind is, not that forme and figure which may be pointed at, we ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a proper mans hand ſtrocke off for a traitor, and many more ſhould be, if we could know them by the faces, but their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſhal be great, when their conditions be without grace, they wil talke of vertue, when their mind is about ſame other villanie, like as our maidens do now a daies, which with their tongues wil ſacrifice perfumes to <hi>Veſta,</hi> when their hearts are offering ſmoking thoughts to <hi>Venus,</hi> ſo that without good trial it is almoſt impoſſible to know of what mettall they are made. <hi>Zancthus</hi> the Philoſopher ſurely bought not <hi>Aeſop</hi> before <hi>Cappadox</hi> and <hi>Cantor,</hi> for his outward perfections, but for his inward perfection, not for the ſhape of his body, but for the qualities of his mind, not for that he was the faireſt of the three, but the faithfulleſt of them all, not for that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed much, but that he ſaw he could performe moſt: <hi>eſt virtus placidis</hi> (ſaith the poet) <hi>abſtinuiſſe bonus,</hi> it is better ſomtimes to take the rugged Iem, before the pearle, &amp; to buy the fowleſt face before the faireſt viſage.

with a rod or a whip: which being for a while ſtrictly executed, cauſed ſwearing to be greatly abated in the court, but it did no good at all in the countrey.

But <hi>Clitem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtra</hi> is of a right contrarie opinion, wherefore the poets faine, that <hi>Agamemnon</hi> meeting <hi>Aeneas</hi> in hel, greeuouſly complaineth of her vnnatural fact, and wiſheth him neuer to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue a woman in any wiſe, neither was <hi>Clitemneſtra</hi> ſo cruel vnto her huſband becauſe ſhe was a woman, but becauſe ſhe was a moſt wicked and vnnatural woman, therefore we may beleeue a woman as wel as a man: but ſuch as mans naturall condition and qualitie that hee alwaies hates him, and bids o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beware of any thing by which hee hath bin endamaged or receiued any euil, as whom a ſerpent hath ſtung, hee wil al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies feare and bid others beware of the ſerpent, and whom a dog hath bitten hee wil alwaies auoid the fawning of dogges. In like manner are we affected one towards another, haue we beene hurt by a woman, then we exclaime againſt and bitterly ban al woman kind? hath our friend bin murthered or our ſelues ſpoiled by our gheſts, as <hi>Euritus</hi> was ſlaine by <hi>Hercules, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crece</hi> deflowred by <hi>Tarquine,</hi> &amp; <hi>Menelaus</hi> robbed of his wife and goods by <hi>Alexander,</hi> from that day forward we wil ſcarſe lodge any more gheſts, another hath bin hurt by his brother, an

other by his children. But it is but a folly to reckon vp particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, ſeeing not onely brothers, and kinſmen, ſtrangers and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance are wont to endamage and deceiue one another, but almoſt al men in general. Wherefore if thou bee wiſe miſtruſt al whatſoeuer. Do as the <hi>Eſſeis</hi> which were a kind of ſects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who admitted no man into their ſect vnder a yeare of probation, and after what time they had receiued him, yet had they two yeares more to proue his manners and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: ſo make not any of thy counſel ouer haſtely. Doth he ſay he is thy brother? yet ſee thou miſtruſt him, doth he tel thee of his honeſt behauiour and vertuous life? yet ſee thou miſtruſt him, haſt thou found in him ſome properties of an honeſt man, and vnfained frend? yet take ſome more time of trial and watch him neuer the leſſe narrowly in the meane while: for that which is ſaid of fortune may be ſaid more fitly (in my opinion) of man, that none knoweth whether hee ſhalbe like himſelfe to morrow or no. Therefore if a man by truſting another hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued any hurt, he is to bee counted a very aſſe, if hee ſhould blame him that hath deceiued him, when there is none to be blamed but himſelfe and his owne fooliſhnes. <hi>Threſſa</hi> might very wel haue laughed at <hi>Thales,</hi> when he fell into the ditch, if he had beaten the ſtones, or found fault with his feet when he ſhould haue bin angrie with himſelfe, that had not an eie vnto his ſteps: and <hi>Darius</hi> might iuſtly haue ſcoffed at <hi>Goraldus,</hi> when he had neuer a penney in his purſe, if hee had laied the fault vpon his companions, who allured him to lauiſh, when the fault was his owne that would not beware of them. But ſome man wil ſay, thou ſeemeſt to bid mee liue ſolitarie like a beaſt void of al companie when thou wouldeſt haue me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue any man? No, I counſel thee not to leave thy life in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarineſſe, but to liue warily &amp; circumſpectly, as one that hath learned to liue wel and happily: otherwiſe it is farre better to liue in the deſert amongſt brute beaſts, then to liue in the cittie without circumſpection and warines in al thy actions, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but by theſe two thou maieſt liue as ſafely as if thou were alone. There is no hearbe to perillous which hath not ſome one vertue that is pretious, nor no ſerpent ſo infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which is not moued with ſome one quallitie which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious.
<pb facs="tcp:10896:17"/>
What is worſe to the thirſtie then the briniſh Sea water, and yet what more commodious to the painful fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? and what more hurtfull to the fooliſh ſwaines, then the venemous viper? but to the ſkilful druggiers, what more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table? ſeeing from her they haue the moſt wholſome triacle: ſo although company keeping be very hurteful vnto ſome, yet to otherſome it may be very profitable, and a ſchoolemaſter to wiſedome. The wiſe and prudent man when he ſeeth euery one as an enemie readie to deuour him, he wil then be more warie and looke better about him, &amp; when he ſeeth euery one prying like <hi>Momus</hi> into his life and conuerſation, he wil then begin to liue as vprightly as <hi>Io</hi> leſt watchful <hi>Argus</hi> ſhould find him tripping: but the foole miſtruſting no man is quickly eaten vp aliue amongſt them. What is the reaſon that <hi>Saturne</hi> of all the other gods lay bound in the bonds of <hi>Briareus,</hi> but becauſe he was the moſt blockiſh and witles of al the other, and could ſcarſely looke about him in the ſpace of thirtie yeares? if thou art ſuch a one, thou wilt quickly lie inſnared in the traps of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſites, and lie faſt fettered in the chaines of penury. If <hi>Acte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> haue loſt the outward ſhape of a man, his own dogges will deuoure him, and if thou haſt loſt the inward ſhape of a man, which is reaſon or pollitike prudence, thine owne friends will not ſpare to deuoure thee, or ſpoile thee of thy goods. Nothing prouoketh the theefe ſooner then negligencie: if the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had tied care and circumſpection to their words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they had neither fallen into the mouthes of the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> nor had cauſe to feare their malice, and therfore <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith <hi>factus ſum mihimetipſi grauis,</hi> meaning, that the euils which do happen vnto vs (for the moſt part) our ſelues do procure them, <hi>Phaeton</hi> by his owne fooliſhneſſe was ſtricken from heauen with a thunderbolt, and <hi>Icarus</hi> by his owne folly was drenched in the Ocean, and the <hi>Scythians</hi> by their owne vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſednes in drinking the wines (which <hi>Cirus</hi> pretending flight had cauſed to be left behind him) were in their drunkenes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the <hi>Perſians.

than otherwiſe we would haue done, if we had none to emulate. <hi>Scipio Affricanus</hi> was of no account in Rome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Cyrus</hi> proweſſe and manhoode was blazed in <hi>Italy,</hi> emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating whoſe fortitude (as one angry with himſelfe that his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy ſhould goe beyond him) he atchieued that fame of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and valour as few had attained before him: and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles</hi> was wont to ſay, that he could neuer ſleepe or take any reſt, bicauſe the victory which <hi>Miltiades</hi> got was alwaies in his mind: and <hi>Caeſar</hi> had neuer aſpired to ſo great renowme, but by emulating the example of <hi>Alexander,</hi> whoſe victories when he read, he preſently burſt foorth into teares, for that at the ſame age wherein <hi>Alexander</hi> liued himſelfe, had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthie of memorie. Therefore as <hi>Alexanders</hi> renowne was the cauſe of <hi>Caeſars</hi> trauels, &amp; <hi>Miltiades</hi> victory the cauſe of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> watching: ſo let our enemies vigilancie be a ſpurre to rouze vs from negligencie and flatterers engins, to make vs more circumſpect. <hi>Oceamademus</hi> had neuer beene honoured with ſo manie triumphs, if he had not alwaies beene beſet with enemies, for it is ſaid of him, that when he had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued al his enemies, he gaue commandement that there ſhould not be aboue halfe of them put to the edge of the ſword, the reſt would he place neare the confines of his campe, which might keepe his ſouldiours from idlenes and ſecuritie, which cauſed him to haue ſo many ſo expert and ſkilfull ſouldiours, that not twiſe he is reported to haue euer beene ouercome. Therefore we ſee it is better to liue amongſt our enemies whom we are ſure do hate vs, then amongſt flatterers whom we ſuppoſe to loue vs, for we are neuer more neere drowning then when we ſaile neere the ſhore, nor neuer oftner indamaged then when we think our ſelues without danger. <hi>Sampſon</hi> liued ſafely inough among his enemies the giantly <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> but in his wiues lay where hee thought himſelfe ſafeſt, hee was quickly ſubdued: and <hi>Hercules</hi> was not ſo much tormented by the dragons in <hi>Heſperidos,</hi> as by the ſhirt which <hi>Deianira</hi> had ſent him in token of her faithfulnes.

as the <hi>Camelion</hi> into colours, or the iuggler into ſtrange deuices to deceiue the beholders, that can preſent a man breade in one hand, and his bane in the other, a fine ſhel and a rotten kernel, whoſe words are like alminacks that decipher nothing but vncertaintie, or like <hi>Pithias</hi> oracles which ſpeake one thing, and meane another: as <hi>Herod</hi> did to the wiſe man of the Eaſt, who promiſed to worſhip Chriſt, when he purpoſed to murther him, for if they had not by a viſion beene counſelled to haue turned another way, ſhould haue found vnder the ſhape of a Lambe, the ſubſtance of a Lion, vnder flouriſhing words diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling deedes, and vnder moſt curteous countenance, moſt curriſh conditions.
