            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But such is the nature of some savage creatures, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tameable monsters, that the more you seeke to winne them, the more stubborne and intracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they become.

I have heard the <hi>Spaniard</hi> much commended for his fidelity to his Prince, and true it is, that in <hi>Spaine</hi> a Taitor or Rebell, is hardly heard of in an age, only what mooved that Spanish <hi>Cavalero</hi> (who tooke the Admirant of <hi>Arragon</hi> prisoner at the battell of <hi>Newport</hi>) to quit his Countrey and Kings service, I know not: examples of their disloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are not many, and as fidelity or loyalty is the <hi>Spaniards</hi> prime vertue, so is it the glory of every good Subject, (as in this discourse I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to shew) to be faithfull to his Soveraigne, and loving to his Countrey, his native soyle, that both bred and fed him, and like a sweet and indulgent Nurse, will receive him (falne a sleepe) againe into her lap.</p>
            <p>The first Argument therefore I will use to perswade all subjects unto loyalty and fidelity unto their Soveraignes, is drawne from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity of their callings, seeing that God the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Soveraigne of Heaven and Earth, hath communicated unto them his owne Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, that we might the more feare honor, and be afraid to offend them, yea not so much as to thinke ill of them in our hearts; (<hi>For even the Birds of the ayre will reveale thy secret thoughts,

            <p>Again, all people ought to consider that they cannot enjoy any thing of all the wealth, riches, &amp; possessions God hath blessed them withall; if there were not <hi>Law, Iustice,</hi> and a <hi>Prince:</hi> now <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> is the end of the Law; the Law is the Act or Ordinance of the Prince, and the Prince is the Vicegerent of God, having soveraign powerover those whom hee hath given in charge, to rule

&amp; governe; so the Soveraigne is a speaking Law, and the Law a dumbe Prince; if therefore wee must live under and obey the Law, how much more the Prince, that made and establisht it, yea who gives vigor and life unto the Law? and makes a good King to have obedient and loyall Subjects, as <hi>Theopompus</hi> King of <hi>Sparta</hi> witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> when speaking to one of his domestique servants, who told him that the <hi>Spartane</hi> affaires did prosper well, because they had Kings who knew how to governe well, <hi>No, but rather</hi> (said he) <hi>but because the people know well how to obey; for the Kings commandement, and the Subjects obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience are correlatives.</hi> Men indeed unwillingly obey those who know not how to governe well, but where the Prince is a good Leader, hee is with all unanimity and alacrity followed; for if a Subject loves not his Prince, that is, if hee be not true and loyall unto him, what good will all his honor, wealth, dignity or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doe him, since there is no title in the world that becomes a Subject more then true loyalty; which no man can have; except true love and obedience precede and goe before, for want whereof, he makes shipwracke of all the honor and reputation, that he had formerly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased. As a Prince hath alway some occasion or other to make use of his Subjects; so are the Subjects bound by the Law of God, to serve, honour and assist him by all meanes possible to their abilities.
