            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE.</head>
                        <p>THere was a Book lately publish'd
against Mr. <hi>Petyt</hi> and my Self,
which not only treats us with Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantick
Scorn, like those that
are to Cap the Author within his Colledge:
but its seems, to trample on the best Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
our Government it self, under Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of its being <hi>New</hi> in the 49th. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">Against Mr. <hi>Petyt.</hi> p. 110.</note>
when it arose out of the indigested Matter
of Tumults and Rebellion; and so not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Legitimate Birth, as not born in Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock
between the King and his People, it
may be turn'd out of Doors, by the Help of
that Maxim.</p>
                        <p>Quod initio non valet, tractu temporis
non convalescit.</p>
                        <p>How can a Bastard become a Mulier?</p>
                        <p>The Treatise which was to prove the <hi>Fact,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Against <hi>Jan. &amp;c.</hi> p. 1. Matter of Fact only.</note>
was cried up for unanswerable; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
'twas imagined, that there was no
possibility left for a Reply; since the Writer,
who has render'd himself famous in his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
<pb facs="tcp:48036:3"/>
(as if he knew better how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
a Design than an Argument) pass'd
it about, only to such Hands as were obliged
by Promise, if not by Principle, to conceal
it.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>Mr. Petyt,</hi> and my Self, having by
Accident seen bis Book, and observed some
Heads which we intended to expose to the
World: At last, out comes the happy Birth;
yet 'twas hoped, that by that time, there
might be Proselytes enough to defend it, with
Noise and Acclamations, and Contempt of
all Opposers, Records, Ancient Historians,
and our Ancient or Modern Lawyers.</p>
                        <p>Though generally, in a Matter of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we ought to leave to the Reader, the
Censure of what we think we confute, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
remarking how absurd or criminal it is;
yet when such Reflections are almost the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Arguments on the other side, and they,
when pronounc'd, <hi>tanquamè Cathedrâ</hi> must
have some Authority, 'tis fit, that even these
trifles should have their due, provided they be
answered with Decency of Expression: And
we know in what manner the Wise Man
advises us to answer some People.</p>

us.</p>
                        <p>But why should I Apologize for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
of this Controversie in a way whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
New to me? Since the severest Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
are but retorted and transcrib'd from

may well be an Original, for 'tis without

                        <p>If in any thing I seem intemperate,
<hi>I may say with an Author well known,</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of Truth has made me so.</p>
                        <p>Our Author's very Notions are Satyrs
upon themselves; nor can any thing more
expose a Man, than a seemingly Gigantick
Endeavour to remove the fix'd Stars, the

forc'd to substitute, in their Rooms, such
pernicious ones, as would render the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

                        <p>By <hi>Manner</hi> is meant, (1.) in the same
Quality, Lords as Lords; and (2.) in
that Degree of the same Quality, which of
old time had been accustomed.</p>
                        <p>(3.) The <hi>Manner</hi> also implies the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of enjoying any Power in Parliament.
Thus the Lords were of old <hi>accustomed</hi> to
enjoy the ordinary Power, in a <hi>Manner</hi>
properly Judicial; and that the supream
<hi>Manner</hi> too. Whereas the Commons had
<pb facs="tcp:48036:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of that, only what was needful to maintain
their Priviledges; as to the Legislature,
the <hi>Manner</hi> was the same, Neither was
above, or could give Law to the other.</p>
                        <p>But in the judicial Power in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Commoners were no more to be
joyned with the Lords, than with the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
in Chief in the King's ordinary Court
out of it:<note place="margin">Vid. infra in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Book. p.</note> since the same <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
from the Lords, and answering to
that which was <hi>pro more,</hi> us'd to exercise
that Power, both in Parliament and out of
it; so that wherever they sate, they were in
the same Court: The Commons could not
exercise this Power with them out of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
therefore not in it.</p>
                        <p>Some will say, that no more is intended
by this Statute, than that every one who
receives Summons, must come, as was his
Duty and had been of old.</p>
                        <p>Whereas 'tis certain, they who did not
come as they were bound, were amerceable
before at the Common Law: nor was it
likely, that the King wanted a Law to
make good that Prerogative, which to be
sure he had over his Tenants by their very
Tenures, and could seize upon their Lands
for Contempt of his lawful Power, as the
Bishops were sometimes threatned,<note place="margin">Vid. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And this is enough against this Author,
since he makes the King's Tenants <hi>in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite,</hi>
to have been all that came to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
even by Representation, till the
<hi>8th. of Hen.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">Against Mr. <hi>Petyt.</hi> p. 42.</note> which 'tis his setled De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to prove, though sometimes he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
himself, and yields, that their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
by Knights Service came too.</p>
                        <p>Besides, the genuine Import of the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
leads me to this sense, especially, as
'tis joyned with <hi>Bounden:</hi> For he who
was a Commmoner till the Summons, was
not bound to come as a Lord; nay, was
not a Lord when he came; As appears by
the Writs to the Lords Assistants, in
the same Form with those which the Lords
have. So that the Statute; in my sense, is
manifestly in Affirmance of the Common
Law.</p>
                        <p>I shall lay at the Feet of the Lords my
Sentiments, in relation to their House, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

me in this Opinion, being many Acts of

                        <p>(2.) I differ from my Opponent, when
he would have it believed,<note place="margin">p. 228. supra.</note> that <hi>Ed. 1.

or as he exprest the same thing
before,<note place="margin">p. 227.</note> 
                           <hi>The Practice was then and ever
since accordingly.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And in this, he has dealt as unfairly by
Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> whom he quotes, as I doubt
not, but 'twill be found, he has done by
Mr. <hi>Petyt</hi> and me: For Mr. <hi>Camden</hi>
tells us, That he has this out of an Author
sufficiently Ancient, and thinks not, that
he differs from the Authority which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives,
when he says, 'Twas thus only, <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nec,</hi>
till there was a setled Right. And
this he makes 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. but this the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
vouchsafes not to take notice of.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:48036:7"/>
But how cheap does he make his applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Reasonings, when he would prove it
to be thus, ever to this very time, or the
time, of publishing his Libel, because it
was in the Reigns of <hi>Henry 3. Ed.</hi> 1.
and his Successors, to the time of that Old
Authors Writing; who, if we credit Mr.
<hi>Camden,</hi> wrote before 11 <hi>Richard</hi> 2.
of which he might be assured, by the way
of Writing in several Kings Reigns re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively,
to which Antiquaries are no
Strangers; or else by the Date annex'd
in the same Hand.</p>
                        <p>But to prove that the Learned <hi>Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceux</hi>
knew more of these things than this
Pretender, I shall shew, that <hi>Rights</hi> were
setled for coming to the House of Lords
long since.<note place="margin">Against Mr. <hi>Petyt.</hi> p. 175.</note> But he will say, possibly, That

                        <p>I think he swarms with Contradictions,

the Constitution of an House, separate from
the Commons, could not consist in the

                              <p>Mr. <hi>Petyt,</hi> in my Judgment, proves

<hi>Proprietors</hi> of <hi>Land,</hi> as such, had a <hi>Right</hi>

The <hi>Fact</hi> is used by both of us, as a
means to prove the <hi>Right: Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
as now called, and <hi>King's Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
as of old, are also insisted upon;
and even the <hi>Records</hi> and <hi>Histories</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to vouch the <hi>Fact,</hi> are, for the
most part, yielded us; so that the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
upon positive Laws and upon Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
is, either whether <hi>Right</hi> can
arise out of any <hi>Fact,</hi> or else, it is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Reason;</hi> what Sense
ought to be put on the Words of the

as is made out by an ordinary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
                              <p>Suppose a Witness in a Cause, swears
to a matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> and his Credit is
not denyed, but the <hi>Question</hi> is, in what

<hi>Reason</hi> must determine the <hi>Fact,</hi> by

                              <p>And the <hi>Right</hi> which arises from
thence, is from the <hi>Meaning,</hi> and the
<hi>Reason</hi> of the <hi>Statute,</hi> as well as from
<hi>the Fact,</hi> that it was made.</p>
                              <p>It will be said, Why do you stand

                              <p>You might have added, that before

Nor is there weight in the Objection,
that there was so small time between the
Death of one, and crowning another

whoever has had the Crown set on his

powerful Interest or <hi>Faction</hi> against him,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48036:37"/>
has generally been owned for <hi>King,</hi> and
had a tacit universal Consent.</p>
                              <p>Besides, all the Nation was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
when <hi>William the first</hi> was crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
any more than they were, when
he gain'd the Victory over <hi>Harold;</hi> and
therefore, if these two Coronations are
set aside as <hi>factious,</hi> so many the other, and
so it must be. For,</p>
                              <p>An Election is or ought to be,<note place="margin">Against Mr. <hi>Petyt.</hi> p. 51.</note> a free, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn,
deliberate, sober, sedate, <hi>and the

(where they have a Right,) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
the major part of them do choose this or

and Purposes, and not an undermining,
crafty, cheating and forcible Act of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

Person, or using this or that means, for the
obtaining their own Designs and Purposes.
Let him, I say, consider, and make a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between these two Acts of the whole

make a true Judgment of all the pretended

                              <p>How easily may this Rule be applyed

raised by the <hi>Pope</hi> for him, and by

and Powers in the highest Orb.
The Question was not whether they
should have a King or no; but who
should be the man.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>Confessor</hi> through some foolish
Vow, which was void in it's self, having

                                 <pb n="38" facs="tcp:48036:38"/>
they had none of his Issue to set their

would not think upon <hi>Edgar Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
who was Heir to him that wore the

that <hi>Monarch</hi> of their Choice, and as
'twas believ'd, the <hi>Elect</hi> of Heaven, was
in such esteem with them, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Worth, and the clearest Stream of

in respect of the Deference they paid
to his <hi>sanctified</hi> Judgment; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Recommendation in such a <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious

                              <p>And <hi>William</hi> himself, upon his Death-bed,
being ask'd to whom he would
devise his Kingdom, makes Answer,
that he would not pretend to dispose of
it, and gives this Reason, which argues,
that he thought he had no Right so to
do. <hi>Non enim tantum decus, haereditario

the <hi>Bastard</hi> got all the Lands of the

oppos'd, and without more Turmoils,
<hi>William</hi> had been crown'd; had he in
this Case been a <hi>Conquerour,</hi> in the Sense
contended for? And what makes the
Difference between his having it of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold</hi>
freely or by Force, in relation to

never have endeavoured to come in by

occasions a little Consideration of the

no other Authority for his being
the Author of it, than ones who has an

                              <p>'Tis there taken for granted, to be

in the first Sense; being to prove what
was the <hi>Feudal Law</hi> here,<note place="margin">New Glos p. 4.</note> he cites the
foreign <hi>Feudists,</hi> who acquaint us with
the Law of <hi>Feuds</hi> amongst them; but
this first Sense is not supposable, in that
this Law, upon that account, would
be as much the Law of Nations, as the
Law for the Advantage of Embassadors
wherever they come.</p>
                              <p>And this could not generally prevail,
but from the Authority of <hi>Catholick
Reason</hi> that should require it; but that
I do not find, since the Lord may have

speak of, as incident to <hi>Feuds,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

or nature of them being answer'd, from
whence will the Argument be brought
that it ought to be so? I will grant,
that it is not a <hi>Feud,</hi> unless there be
<hi>Utile Dominium,</hi> for that distinguishes
it from an <hi>Alodium,</hi> which sometimes
may yield no profit to any Superiour.
But those who well knew the Nature
of <hi>Feuds,</hi> teach us, that 'twas the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
of <hi>Feuds</hi> when they wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended

Estates were taken away too. And this,
that erroneous <hi>Glossary</hi> makes under the
<hi>Feudal Law</hi> too; for, from thence 'tis
inferr'd, that the great Tenants in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite,</hi>
had Right to impose Laws upon

the whole Kingdom besides, from the

                           <p>This <hi>(though no Conquerour)</hi> the Dr.
left out, either as being ashamed of it,
being 'tis little less than a Contradiction,
to say, a man was no <hi>Conquerour,</hi> and
yet seized upon all the Lands of the
Kingdom, and forc'd them to submit to
such Seizure; so that he conquer'd the
Land: or, because it contradicts his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>William</hi>'s being a <hi>Conquerour;</hi> so
that he himself had as much reason to
exeept against this Book, as others; but,
it seems,<note place="margin">Against Mr. <hi>Petyt.</hi> p. 35.</note> 
                              <hi>out of a stark Love and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
to Truth, he left only what was
against him, but took what was for his
Purpose. And for the Support of it's
Credit, tells us a formal Story; the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
to which, from outward Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
I never thought it worth
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48036:79"/>
the while to examine, since I have so
much Reason from within it self, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it to be <hi>spurious,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Against <hi>Petyt.</hi> p. 13.</note> and so ought he.
For, if he have any respect to that great
<hi>man</hi>'s Memory, he will not suffer him
to say, that <hi>William</hi> divided out the
whole Kingdom, to hold under the
<hi>Feudal Law;</hi> when before he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
of <hi>Gavelkind,</hi> the general Tenure
of the Lands in <hi>Kent, Feudalibus legibus

                           </p>
                           <p>(3.) The Lands of all these Grantees
of King <hi>William</hi> the First, descended to
the eldest, being held in <hi>Knights Service.
Si miles fuerit vel per militiam tenens,

                              <note place="margin">

                              <q> If a
man be a Knight, or holding by mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary

Law of the Kingdom, the Eldest shall
succeed his Father to the whole. </q>But
for the greatest Authority, we have an
Act of <hi>Parliament;</hi> which, having full
Power to alter the Tenure,<note place="margin">31 H. 8. c. 3.</note> enacts, that
certain Lands in <hi>Kent, shall descend as
Lands at Common Law, and as other
Lands in the said County, which never

                              <pb n="122" facs="tcp:48036:80"/>
Here the Descent of <hi>Knights Service</hi>
is the same with Descent at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law, which was to the Eldest;
and this is oppos'd to the Descent of
Lands in <hi>Gavelkind,</hi> which was <hi>Socage.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And thus have I proved every thing,
which upon this Head was needful, to
vindicate the Right of the <hi>English,</hi> and
to prove that their Rights were own'd
in Practice, notwithstanding the vain
Flourish of a <hi>Conquest.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It may be objected, perhaps, that the
<hi>Feudal Law,</hi> which <hi>was exacted and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by, and upon only the</hi> Normans,
might have related only to such as held
immediately of the King; for that his
Grantees might and did often grant out
to others and their Heirs for ever, to
hold in <hi>free Socage.</hi> Yet, this will not
do, because such Grantees would have
been <hi>Free-men;</hi> but, all the <hi>Free-men</hi>
of the Kingdom, were Tenants by <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Service,</hi> though by their Tenure,
any of them were only to pay a Rose,
a Spur, a Sum of Money, or any other
thing.</p>
                           <p>Therefore, hereby is my Argument
inforc'd, if <hi>William</hi> had been a <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi>
in the Sense strove for, as disseizing
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48036:80"/>
all the <hi>English,</hi> and making Grants of
their Lands to the <hi>Normans,</hi> and that
to hold by <hi>Knights Service;</hi> and all the
<hi>Normans,</hi> both they who were here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>William</hi>'s Entrance (if any such had
any shares allow'd them) and they that
came in with him, or followed for the
spoil, were under the <hi>Feudal Law,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
<hi>Knights Service;</hi> and these
were the only <hi>Free-men.</hi> How came
there to be such a Race of lawless Free-men,
as the <hi>Sokemanni?</hi>
                              <note place="margin">p. 31.</note> And how is it
possible, that <hi>the manner of holding our
Estates in every Respect, with all the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
incident thereto,</hi> should be <hi>brought
in by the Conquerour?</hi>
                              <note place="margin">p. 29.</note> 
                              <hi>Whoever reflects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

This clears, beyond Exception,
the Charter of <hi>Henry</hi> the First, which

that was held twice a year, when
this was but once; and the <hi>Sciremote</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from that. The first was the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs

                              <p>But, to convince him more fully of
the Absurdity of <hi>his Confidence:</hi> He
ought to remember, that the very <hi>Law</hi>
whereby he would prove all the <hi>Free-men</hi>
of the Kingdom to have been Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
by <hi>Knights Service,</hi> was in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of the <hi>Confessor</hi>'s Laws, and
that granted to those who had lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them, and knew the Benefit of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
themselves</hi> and their <hi>Properties</hi> in
the <hi>Great Councils,</hi> and the Nation too,
there, or by their Arms elsewhere, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48036:88"/>
out trusting the manage of all, to such
<hi>Thayns</hi> as held immediately of the King.
Nor were they then likely to quit their
former Advantages, when as appears by
the Story, they were in a probable
Condition of gaining more, if they
would: for, the <hi>English</hi> had got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by the Encouragement of Abbot
<hi>Fretherick, Exercitum numerosum &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissimum,</hi>
a numerous and most potent
Army: and in their Head, was he who
was the only <hi>Heir</hi> to the Crown, and
that a Title above the <hi>Confessor.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this, <hi>Prudentiâ feliciter eruditus,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Happiness to follow his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
and comply with the Occasion,
he granted St. <hi>Edward</hi>'s <hi>Laws,</hi> with some
Additions indeed, but not with such as
would defeat the whole. And I affirm
it, that though in his Additions he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
about the Tenures, or other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of his then or future Tenants, yet
there is not any thing which creates a
feud over the whole Kingdom.</p>

free from all Manner of Charge, but
their free Services, (which indeed, tho

does not exclude such, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

Since 'tis there abundantly proved,
that though that King's Charter seems
to some Understandings, to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48036:89"/>
provision for the summoning the
<hi>Great Council</hi> of the Nation; yet, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
provided for the summoning the
lesser Council, the more ordinary <hi>Curia
Regis</hi> only; the Tenants which were
Members of it, standing in need of a
Law, to relieve them from some Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
they were under. Whereas, the
constant practise from the Reign of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
the First, inclusively downwards,
evinces, that they who composed the
<hi>Great Council,</hi> had maintain'd their
<hi>Right, ad habendum commune Concilium
regni,</hi> uninterrupted: for a general
proof of which, the Authority of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton</hi>
was us'd, which shews, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
such Payments as lay upon the Kings
Tenants in <hi>Capite,</hi> or had their Rise
from <hi>Custom,</hi> there were other intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by the <hi>Common Consent</hi> of the
whole Kingdom; whence 'tis easie to
conclude, that King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter does
not <hi>exhibit,</hi> that is, prrticularly set forth
<hi>the full form of our</hi> English <hi>great and most
general Councils in those days.</hi>

how strongly soever it may be imply'd
from the words, even without the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation

had Right, is undeniable, from the

who those others were, and whether or
no all the Members of the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
of the Kingdom, or even all such

whatever may have been reserv'd to

from the manner in which the

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48036:94"/>
that <hi>the Great Charter common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attributed to</hi> H. 3. <hi>was</hi> non of his, <hi>but
properly the Charter of</hi> E. 1. But when he
sayes it was <hi>rather his Explication or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement
of that Charter of King</hi> John
<hi>and</hi> Henry 3.<note place="margin">p. 63.</note> He, by an unlucky dash

the Cause, granting that <hi>Et de Scuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giis

meaning of King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter, to be
divided; and in another Clause, from

made for any Summons to Great
Councils, or Parliaments, in the Charter
confirm'd</hi> 25 E. 1. And yet that Charter,
as appears by Record, is word for word
<hi>the same</hi> with that which was <hi>granted 9
H.</hi> 3. and the Charters of <hi>H.</hi> 3. and King
<hi>John, were not found to disagree in any thing,</hi>
then there was <hi>no Provision made</hi> in King
<hi>John</hi>'s Charter, <hi>for any Summons to Great
Councils,</hi> or <hi>Parliaments;</hi> no, not so much
as a general Provision, which I yield. And
if he will have it, that <hi>the Charter</hi> of E. 1.
was <hi>most properly his Explication, or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement
of that Charter of King</hi> John, <hi>and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48036:95"/>
H.</hi> 3. Does he not therein yield, that
there was provision made for Summons
to <hi>Great Councils,</hi> in the providing for all
the <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Free Customs</hi> of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
places: and if <hi>ad habendum Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune

The Charter of <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. may well be
taken for an <hi>Explication</hi> of the Charter
of King <hi>John,</hi> and if it were doubtfull,
what King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter meant by the

other makes it undeniable, that no other

but also, there is not a word of it in the
<hi>Magna Charta,</hi> confirm'd 25 <hi>E. I.</hi> which the
Dr. yields to be an <hi>Explication</hi> of King
<hi>John</hi>'s: and instead thereof; whereas, the
assessing of <hi>Escuage</hi> was mentioned about
the middle of King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter; in those
Charters of <hi>H.</hi> 3. and <hi>E. I.</hi> there is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
and distinct Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> 37. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Escuage,</hi> and that the very last, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the saving and reserving to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops,
Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Templars,
Hospitalers, Earls, Barons, and all others,
as well Ecclesiastical as Secular persons,
all their Liberties and free Customs, which
before they had.</p>
                              <p>But, as to the way of raising <hi>Escuage</hi> in
an especial manner, it is referr'd to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
course of Law, as 'twas in the time
of <hi>H.</hi> 2. whose Laws in general, were
then intended to be confirm'd. I cannot
but make a farther Remark, taking in that
evidence of <hi>Fact,</hi> which for a while I laid
by, that in all those Charters since King
<hi>John</hi>'s, upon the several Confirmations,
the Arch-bishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48036:96"/>
Earls, Barons, Knights, Free-holders, and
all of the Kingdom, are mention'd, as
granting to the Crown, a <hi>15th</hi> of all their
moveable Goods, and these that granted
the Subsidy,<note place="margin">Register f. 175.</note> in the old Register of Writs,
an Authority uncontrolable, are called
<hi>Commune Concilium Regni.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Wherefore, 'tis impossible for any man
of Reason, that considers, to fancy that
King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter, in the sense of the
Dr. and others, could exhibit the full form
of the Common Councils of the Kingdom
or Parliaments, till 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3.</p>
                              <p>Take my sense of the Council, which
way soever you read it, under the <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
and <hi>free Customs,</hi> will be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their whole Interest in the <hi>Legislature;</hi>
whereas otherwise, according to this
Charter of all their <hi>Liberties,</hi> the King's
<hi>Great Council</hi> had then only Power to
raise <hi>Taxes,</hi> though we find, that all along
they advis'd <hi>de arduis negotiis regni,</hi> and
consented to what passed into a Law.
Wherefore,<note place="margin">Against <hi>Jan.</hi> &amp;c. p. 13.</note> '<hi>tis strange there should not have
been the same care taken that they might have
thier</hi> Rights <hi>in Council</hi> setled, as well as
their <hi>Summons</hi> to it: but if this Charter
setled no other <hi>Right</hi> than this of granting
<hi>Taxes, Quere,</hi> What other power the <hi>Great
Councils</hi> have now, by our Author's Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples?
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48036:97"/>
For, admit that by the <hi>New Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
which, he says, <hi>was fram'd and set
up</hi> in the <hi>49th</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. a <hi>Right</hi> of coming
to the <hi>Great Council,</hi> was giv'n to a body of
men, who before that had none; yet there
was no additional power given to the
<hi>Council</hi> it self, that he or any man can shew.</p>
                              <p>Because I would encounter the whole
Force which they raise by colour of this
Charter, I address'd my self chiefly to the
proving, that, admitting that <hi>Et ad haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
commune consilium Regni aliter quam,</hi>
ought to be joyn'd, as of the same period
with de <hi>Scutagiis assidendis,</hi> 'twill not
make for the purpose of them that urge it,
being, upon strict Inquiry, it cannot be
thought to extend farther than to such
matters as concern'd Tenants in <hi>Chief</hi> only.</p>
                              <p>That this must be thus confin'd, is
prov'd.</p>
                              <p>(I.) Because there were <hi>Majores Barones,</hi>
not excluded by this <hi>Charter,</hi> and so their
ancient <hi>Right</hi> continued, tho they are not
within the meaning of that part he insists
upon; for this is only of Tenants in <hi>Capite,</hi>
that is, such as were subject to the <hi>Feudal
Law.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Chester</hi> for instance, was
not under it as Earl of <hi>Chester. Wardship</hi>
was a necessary Appendix to that Tenure;
but, even the <hi>Tenants</hi> within that <hi>County,</hi>
                                 <pb n="145" facs="tcp:48036:97"/>
though holding other Lands of the
King by <hi>Knights Service,</hi> were howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
out of the King's Wardship, much
more the <hi>Count Palatine.</hi> And surely,
no body before the Dr. ever took him
for a <hi>Feudal Tenant,</hi> by reason of the
County of <hi>Chester,</hi> though he might be
oblig'd to attend in the Wars, and pay
Escuage in case of Failure, for other
Lands held in <hi>Chief,</hi> in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                              <p>(2.) There were others came, and
upon other occasions than what are here
mentioned, as <hi>Falcatius de Brent,</hi> who
was to come even without forty days
notice, which was required in the Case
here; and whereas, giving Advice in
great Affairs, and the making of Laws,
were transacted in the <hi>Great Councils,</hi> no
such thing is mention'd in this.</p>
                              <p>(3.) We have the Resolution of a
whole Parliament, the 40th of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.
That the <hi>Common Council</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
of Tenants in <hi>Chief,</hi> was not the
<hi>Great Council</hi> of the Kingdom; for that
King <hi>John</hi> resigned his Crown in the first
<hi>Council,</hi> but as they declare, not in the
last: and this the very Circumstances,
attending the Resignation, evince.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="146" facs="tcp:48036:98"/>
(4.) If the opposite Doctrine be true,
then all the <hi>dignified</hi> and <hi>inferiour Clergy,</hi>
which did not hold in <hi>Capite, Abbots,
Priors,</hi> &amp;c. were excluded.</p>
                              <p>(5.) This must needs be no more than
a <hi>Common Council</hi> of the Kingdom, for
assessing <hi>Escuage,</hi> and such other <hi>Aid</hi> as
lay upon Tenants in <hi>Capite</hi> only; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
Tenants only, stood in need of
<hi>Relief</hi> from this Charter, they only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
concerned in the three things <hi>reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>
to the King, or in the Additions to
them, none other being charged in that
kind, without <hi>more</hi> general <hi>Consent,</hi> and
more than Tenants being Parties to the
Grant. Besides, not only the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
upon Tenants Services, but the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Incidents were called <hi>Auxilia,</hi> as
well as those others, which according
to <hi>Bracton, were not called Services, nor
came from Custom; but were only in case of
Necessity, or when the King met his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as</hi> Hydage, Corage, <hi>and</hi> Carvage,
<hi>and many other things, brought in by the
common Consent of the whole Kingdom.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Now, where the King reserves Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
to Tenure only, 'tis to be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that the Reservation is out of the
thing before mentioned, and so that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48036:98"/>
must be Services because of Tenure,
none but Tenants being named; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
when others are named, we may
well suppose the <hi>Aids</hi> given by others
too, to be intended.</p>
                              <p>(6.) We may here divide the benefit
to each sort of Tenant in particular.</p>
                              <p>I. As the Tenants by <hi>Socage</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure
only, were <hi>talliable,</hi> and that us'd
to be without their own Consent: here
they have a Consent given them.</p>
                              <p>2. As Tenants by <hi>Knights Service,</hi>
though not <hi>talliable,</hi> yet had hardship
in the Obligation to sudden Attendance,
convenient Notice is given, and it should
seem, that the want of this for the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
of <hi>Escuage,</hi> was their only grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
proper to be redrest; for their
Attendance in the Wars, was to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
by Necessity; and, as a Court
of Justice, there was no need of them.</p>
                              <p>(7.) There is a Difference to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
all along, between the <hi>Great
Council,</hi> and such an one as is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this Charter I. For the Persons
composing the one and the other. 2. The
matters of which they treated. And
3. the times of holding them.</p>
                              <p>

For the <hi>Great Councils,</hi> by his own
way of arguing, there was at least one
<hi>Great Council,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>William</hi>
the First, where, were more than Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
in <hi>Chief.</hi> The Tenants in <hi>Chief,</hi>
he supposes to have been only the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
and <hi>Foreigners,</hi> who were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the <hi>English</hi> Laws, and the <hi>only</hi>

                              <p>I need urge no more in this Reign,
except that which he hath yielded to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48036:99"/>
my hand, in effect, <hi>viz.</hi> that all the <hi>Free-holders</hi>
of the several <hi>Counties</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
met this King in a <hi>Great Council</hi> at
<hi>Salisbury.</hi> For, he himself tells us, that
all the <hi>Free-men</hi> of the Kingdom, held
by <hi>Knights Service,</hi> and here were all
the <hi>Knights;</hi> so more than Tenants in
<hi>Capite,</hi> and all the <hi>Free-holders</hi> too, as
they were <hi>Knights,</hi> all holding by <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Service.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But, if there were other <hi>Freemen,</hi>
such as held in <hi>Free and common Socage,

<hi>Military Service</hi> for the defence of the
Kingdom, though they held not by it,
why were not these <hi>Knights,</hi> as well as
the others,<note place="margin">Glos. <hi>p.</hi> 10.</note> since Tenure did not alter
the Condition of the Person? Especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
some of the Chief must have been
such, with much more Reason, to be
sure, than the Chief <hi>Knights</hi> under Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
in <hi>Capite,</hi> came to the <hi>Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi>
or had other <hi>Liberties,</hi> by vertue
of that Law, which he supposes to have
related only to Tenants in <hi>Capite.</hi> Does
he answer the Law of <hi>William the First,</hi>
which it seems, was my idle Invention,
of Common <hi>Free-holders</hi> being made
<hi>Milites</hi> in the County Court,<note place="margin">

that all the <hi>Free-men</hi> of the County
were <hi>Knights?</hi> He has not so much as
told us, the Argument is <hi>unintelligible;</hi> but
he thinks he has me upon the Hip, for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriating
the <hi>Milites</hi> to the <hi>Sheriffs,
Knights,</hi> since the <hi>Earls</hi> and <hi>Barons</hi> had
their <hi>Knights,</hi> and 'tis <hi>Milites illorum:</hi>

their proper <hi>Leader.</hi> Indeed, if the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
had been to the War, every Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in <hi>Chief</hi> must have produc'd his
<hi>Quota</hi> of <hi>Knights.</hi> Besides, though 'tis
<hi>Milites illorum,</hi> and others besides <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs</hi>
were there, yet 'twas before seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
limited, <hi>Barones &amp; Vicecomites

we are told, that the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> were some

                                 <hi>The Reflections are these.</hi> 1. That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to constant Practice,<note place="margin">p. 76.</note> I recite only
as much of the Record, which I produce to
settle my Notion, as in my own Judgment,
I think fits my Purpose, and conceal the
rest. 2. That I am a Plagiary of this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for that it was another Gentleman's,
that I conceal that too.</p>
                              <p>To both which, I plead, not guilty.
For, as I shall shew, what I left out of
the Record, was no Concealment, there
being nothing in it, which can make
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48036:102"/>
against me. My own Inspection of the
<hi>Record,</hi> occasioned this Notion, which
I borrowed from no man; not that I
speak this out of Vanity and Ostentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but to shew the Freedom of this
Gentleman's Censure, which out-runs
his <hi>Wit</hi> and his <hi>Knowledge.</hi> His <hi>Wit,</hi> for
if I borrowed this of another, and was
a Stranger to the <hi>Record,</hi> as he would
insinuate, more than once; if there were
any material part left out; how does
it appear, that I was guilty of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment?
And he not knowing <hi>the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Letter to the Earl of <hi>S.</hi>
                                 </note>
as he tells a noble Peer, could not
tell what Notions, not taken out of
other Authors, were my own, what
Mr.<hi>Petyt</hi>'s; since 'twas impossible, that
I, or the Gentleman, who is to bear
the burthen of them, should have told
him, he being equally a Stranger to both
of us.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>But the main Question is, whether I,
or my Instructor; did fairly, in citing
no more than thus much of the Record;</hi>

To which, I answer, That as the
Charge lay upon all that was first grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out in <hi>Capite,</hi> it was upon more than
Tenants in <hi>Capite,</hi> because of their Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;
nay, and he himself should
have put the Question of more, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
their Tenants were not charged:
but 'twill be said, that what was in the
hands of Tenants, was the Lord's own.
What need then was there for the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff
to distrain, without which the Lord
could not raise it by his Bailiff?</p>
                              <p>But, what Answer has he made to the
<hi>Record,</hi> in the very year in which he
supposes a Charge was laid by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
in <hi>Capite,</hi> upon all their Tenants,
that shews, that both the King and Lords
could not charge the Lords Tenants,
though to relieve the Necessities of the
Tenant in <hi>Capite?</hi>

Plea, according to which, the <hi>novum
Feoffamentum</hi> is allowed to be free,
where the <hi>Vetus</hi> was chargeable. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
he would have it, that <hi>Omnes alii de

out of marvellous Modesty, he owns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
not to have <hi>so much Knowledge of the

And yet in a few pages after,
<hi>forgetting himself,</hi> pretends to know that
Mr.<hi>Petyt understood not the latter part of
the Plea?</hi> Which he would have to be,
that only two <hi>Knights Fees were in the

Whereas, according to his Notion that
it was not regarded in the Levy, what
Fees were answerable to the King, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Original Grant, whether
in the hands of the Tenants in <hi>Chief,</hi> or
their <hi>Subfeudatories;</hi> the Payment was
by this <hi>Record,</hi> to be forc'd only from

the King <hi>might distrain in the Fees of the

Grant,<note place="margin">Against Mr.<hi>Petyt.</hi> p. 176.</note> what a ridiculous thing was it,
for the Prior of <hi>Coventry</hi> to plead in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of eight parts of ten, that eight
parts were out of his <hi>Possession?</hi> But
his Plea is, that he was not liable to so
many as Tenent in <hi>Capite;</hi> but in effect,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48036:104"/>
that indeed he had so many held under
him, who paid their Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by his hands,<note place="margin">See the Record at large, in Mr. <hi>Petyt</hi>'s Appendix, or <hi>inter Communia de Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Sancti</hi> Hill. <hi>Anno</hi> 17. Ed. 3.</note> as Collector

there were made a <hi>Council</hi> only for the

still 'twas <hi>ad Curiam pro more.</hi> Not that
the Kingdom used to come of Course,
but then came to that Court which was
ordinary, or of Course.</p>
                              <p>That the Kings great Officers and
Ministers of Justice were there, I have
always yielded; and that 'twas no Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to the Tenants, to have Justice
administred without them at other

my Sense, that these often sat without
the Tenants. Yet, their sitting was not
at stated times, and therefore they were
not <hi>Curia pro more.</hi> Either way, there
was a great Council distinct from the

                              <p>(1.) As to the persons composing the

                              <p>The <hi>Great Council</hi> had the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Justice.</p>
                              <p>(2.) As to the matters treated of;
the one treated of matters of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Justice; the other, but ordinary.</p>
                              <p>(3.) For time, the great <hi>Council</hi> was
summon'd as often as the State of the
Kingdom required it; the other, as a
Court of Tenants and Officers, had times
ascertain'd: not but that as occasion
might offer it self, they might be sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd
according to King <hi>John</hi>'s Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Nay, may be after that, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
met, but upon Summons; the lesser
Court of Officers and Ministers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
met oftner than either, but not
of Course.</p>
                              <p>And, thus have I answered his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter, by
which, he labours to prove, That Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
in <hi>Chief</hi> only, composed the <hi>Great
Council,</hi> or were all the <hi>Nobility</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and have given a clear Account
of that unintelligible piece, as he is
pleased to represent it, leaving out what
I offer'd upon the Question of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
Voting in <hi>Capital Cases,</hi> since he
had no other way of answering it, than
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48036:110"/>
by calling it <hi>impertinent Rhapsody.</hi> Tho
if 'tis no better to be answer'd, 'tis not
<hi>Rhapsody</hi> and <hi>fancyful Stuff:</hi> and, if the
first ground from our Laws to dispute
their Right, mentions it in relation to
the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> 'twas not surely <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent</hi>
to consider their Right; the <hi>Curia</hi>
from whence 'twas excluded, being so
directly to my purpose.</p>
                              <p>There are other things incidentally
coming in, which I divide not into
Heads, being they serve but to explain
those which I have rais'd. To which,
may be added, That our Author, by the

                                 <hi>that they should
give way to, or establish such Laws, as
would undoe and destroy their own Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
in Power? Wherefore, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is strong, that till then the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
                                 <pb n="172" facs="tcp:48036:110"/>
came in their own Person; but
that then the <hi>Great men,</hi> having the
Power in their hands, clip'd their
Wings. But let us see his weighty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
against my sense of this Charter.</p>
                              <p>In Answer to my third Head, he puts
me off with the Fallibility of a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;</hi>
but, if moral Certainty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Infallibility,</hi> will not satisfie him in
matters of the greatest Concern, we
may know what he would be at. But
forsooth, this was not a full Court of
Tenants, because, as was usual, only
some few attested the Fact.</p>
                              <p>In Opposition to my Fifth,<note place="margin">p. 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.</note> he tells
us, that even voluntary Gifts to the
Crown, are called <hi>auxilia;</hi> nay, even
such as were more than Advances upon
Services. But, what proof is there, that
such were here meant, when not only
Services, because of Tenure, with the
Advances upon them, but what came
from more than Tenants, are called
<hi>Auxilia</hi> too.</p>
                              <p>As general Objections against my
Sense.</p>
                              <p>(1.) If Tenants in <hi>Capite</hi> were a great
Council of the Kingdom,<note place="margin">p. 12.</note> for Aids and
Escuage only, which is hardly reconcileable
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48036:111"/>
to Sense? (<hi>Why so, good Dr.? May there
not be a great</hi> Council, <hi>especially a</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council,
<hi>to a particular Purpose?
Nay, you your self confine it's Power to
the raising of Taxes.</hi> Why was the Cause of
Summons to be declared? <hi>Because of the
occasion requiring greater or less</hi> Aid.</p>
                              <p>(2.) <hi>Lastly,</hi> If all Free-men, or, as our

were Members of the Great and General
Council of the Nation?<note place="margin">p. 13.</note> 'Tis strange there
should not have been the same Care taken,
that they might be summoned as well as the

that they would leave their Ploughs
and Country Business, to travel from one
remote part of <hi>England</hi> to another, to these
great Councils, which seldome continued
above three or four days, if they had had
Right so to do.</p>
                              <p>This is as <hi>trifling</hi> as the rest, for, if

there was no need of special Provision

which is so in my <hi>own Judgment:</hi> But,
if I prove, and that out of himself
too, that there came more to the King's
<hi>Great Councils,</hi> than his Tenants in

it lies upon him to shew that at any
one <hi>Council,</hi> where more than Tenants
were charged, Tenants only were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
And I affirm, that he neither has
nor can produce one Authority, which
upon Examination, can signifie any
thing.</p>
                              <p>And to retort his last Charge, <hi>as he
deals with Sir</hi> Henry Spelman, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon him his own, or his Friends
Sense, <hi>So he doth</hi> shuffle over <hi>Records,
which are directly against him,</hi> and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plants
them by <hi>History</hi> seemingly for
him: And if the last <hi>contain any thing
which in his own Judgment makes for him,
the Council there</hi> spoken of, <hi>is a Great
and General Council</hi> of Tenants in <hi>Chief</hi>
only, to <hi>be sure,</hi> though the <hi>Record</hi>
mention more.</p>

                                 <hi>Our Author says of the</hi> Curia, <hi>which
I contend to have been</hi> pro more, <hi>or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,</hi>
If he can make the Court holden
<hi>coram Rege &amp; Consilio,</hi> before the King
and Councel, which he hath made his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
for his ordinary Court, and be the
same with the <hi>Common Council</hi> of the
Kingdom establish'd by that Charter, <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
King</hi> John'<hi>s,</hi> he gains the point; but,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48036:112"/>
if it cannot be done, he may very well blush
at his own Confidence, to say no more.</p>
                              <p>Truely, I should rather blush at the
want of Sense in that Paragraph, if it
were mine; for, I cannot well answer
for making the Court, <hi>and be the same.</hi>
But, since he has informed me where
the point lies, I can easily gain it, by
proving that the Court holden <hi>coram
Rege &amp; Consilio,</hi> became the Court of
which our Dispute is; as it had the
same Power, whether held by the same
persons, or at the same times, is not
material, so that it be the Kings <hi>Curia,</hi>
or <hi>Magnum Concilium,</hi> as the Court held
<hi>pro more</hi> was.</p>
                              <p>In Order to the clearing this, he may
please to understand that the King's
Court had the only Cognizance of the

that the King would do him Remedy and

                              <p>This is received before the King and
his Counsel in Parliament: and because
there was need of a Certificate to be
made in the Case, 'tis referred to the
next Parliament, that is, when it relates
to any Judgment to be given, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
then to sit. But, the Business, as I
find many of the like kind, upon the
Parliament Rolls, was properly brought
before the Kings <hi>Counsel</hi> in Parliament,
who,<note place="margin">Jani An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies nova. <hi>p.</hi> 190.</note> as I before observed, succeeded
into the places of the Tenants in the
<hi>Curia;</hi> and indeed, I see not what other
Account can be given of the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.
As this Counsel acted in
Parliament with the same Power which
the Tenants had exercised before, so
we find them sometimes acting like the
Tenants in the <hi>Curia,</hi> in the Intervals
of Parliament, as in the 33. of <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. after
the <hi>Parliament</hi> was dissolved, and all

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48036:114"/>
we often find, that, when Matters
of Publick Concern, or which, as they
say, concern'd the <hi>Treaty,</hi> came before
them, they never undertook to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
upon them, but left them to the

                              <p>But there is yet a farther Evidence,
in that, as the same Matters were hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the one and the other, sometimes
in conjunction with the great Council,
sometimes separate from it; so 'twas in
the same manner. And thus <hi>Thomas de

                                 <note place="margin">p. 26.</note> Notwithstanding he sayes it is
agreed on all hands, the ordinary Curia
was held thrice a year, I never heard of
any one of his opinion but himself; He
would make the great Court held at these
times he mentions, and the great Confluence
of Nobility then to the Kings Court, to
be the King's ordinary Court, for this
Dispatch of ordinary Business, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
between the King and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
or between man and man. I will
not deny, but often Petitions might be put
up, and Complaints made to them about
private matters, such as alwayes have been
to the House of Lords, and many more of
antient times, than have been for a Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or two of years. And that they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
and pass Judgment in those Cases.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48036:115"/>
But, that they were therefore the King's
Ordinary Court, I think no body will say,
but such as never read antient History or
Lawyers, or, at least, never intend to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
them.</p>
                              <p>Truly, he has an excellent Faculty to
bring men's Arguments into the shape
of his own; and then 'tis easie, even
for him, to expose them. He would
have it, that, according to my Notion,
the House of Lords is the King's <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Court,</hi> because of determining in
matters of <hi>ordinary Justice;</hi> whereas, I
make the Notion of <hi>Ordinary,</hi> not to
consist in that onely, unless it be at
<hi>ordinary,</hi> or stated times. Nor do I say
that the House of Lords is an <hi>Ordinary
Court,</hi> but succeeded into the Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the <hi>ordinary.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But he does well to serve my <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,</hi>
in making the Comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
these two Courts. The one of
which, as I before observed, succeeded
to, and gives an <hi>Idea</hi> of the other,
though it agree not in every particular.
And, as the House of <hi>Lords,</hi> divided
from the <hi>Commons,</hi> never could make
Laws; so neither could the <hi>ordinary
Curia,</hi> unless when joyned to the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:</hi>
though, both the House of Lords,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48036:115"/>
and the <hi>Curia</hi> before, were the Supreme
Courts of Judicature. And, if the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
was held thrice a year, and confin'd
to Matters of <hi>ordinary Justice,</hi> which,
I think, I have proved, in shewing that
the Legislative Power was vested in
more than the King, and his Tenants
and Officers; then I find not that our

any thing against what I say.</p>

                                 <note place="margin">Communia placita non sequantur Curiam nostram.</note> And not observing that there
was the same Clause in King <hi>John's</hi>

before: And truly, I shall not quarrel

                                 <hi>that, after the granting of this
Charter by King John, there were many
general and great Councils or Colloquiums

                              <p>But, how well do's he understand
what I say? I make but part of the

<hi>Aid</hi> and <hi>Escuage,</hi> which onely is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

whenever the Court which granted

have been either by the pleasure of the

would agree with them? The Lay

                           <p>But with his good Leave, he is not clear,
whether 'twas Service because of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which all men were to perform in

or because of <hi>Tenure.</hi>

                           <p>Indeed, he by no means seems to incline

which same Writs, must have different ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects

make <hi>three obscure Paragraphs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. This explains that part of the
Charter,<note place="margin">He adds <hi>such</hi> to Cases, to render it obscure. <hi>Jani,</hi> &amp;c. p. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>Simili modo fiat de Civitate
London,</hi> that is as in all Cases besides
those excepted Escuage or Tallage should
not be raised but by a Common-Council
of the Kingdom, that is of all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
concerned to pay; so for the City
of <hi>London,</hi> unless the Aid was ordered
in Common-Council, wherein they and
all other Tenants in chief were assembled,
none should be laid upon any Citizens but
by the consent of their own Common-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,<note place="margin">Na. So if a sum in gross were laid upon them.</note>
and if the Ordinance were only in
general Terms, that all the Kings De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measns
should be talliated, the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
payable there should be agreed by
the Common-Council of the City.</p>
                  <p>This consists of two parts; First,
That where there was not the consent
of a <hi>Common-Council</hi> of all the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
in chief, the Citizens might of
themselves give a <hi>Tallage,</hi> which is
not in dispute between us, but is with
admirable ingenuity turned into an
assertion,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>that Cities and Burroughs
were not taxed or assessed towards any
payments, but by their own Common-Councils,</hi>
(which is not to be inferred
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48036:155"/>
from the priviledge of one City, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it were so for <hi>London,</hi> nor can be
gathered from my words, which yield
that even <hi>London</hi> might be <hi>Taxt or
Assessed by the consent</hi> of the <hi>Common-Council</hi>
of Tenents) <hi>or that they,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Against <hi>Jani,</hi> &amp;c. p. 113.</note> 
                     <hi>as
part of the Common-Council of the
Land taxed themselves,</hi> which is true;
but no man of sense can understand that
to be the meaning of this part of the
<hi>Obscure Paragraph,</hi> but that something
farther was intended.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>The second I need not explain
since he understands, for all his affected
ignorance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Indeed he would take in more places.</note> that after a Tax was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the City of <hi>London</hi> the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<hi>(or those who composed its
Council)</hi> met to proportion it, so as it
might be paid with as much equality as
could be.<note place="margin">Na. the King did perhaps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a certain sum after a general Ordinance made by the Council of Tenents for a <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionabile auxilium.</hi> Jani, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 26.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This he yields to my hand, that <hi>they
always did if they would,</hi> it seems con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by that Record, which shews
that when the Council of the City
would not agree to the Sum demanded
by the King, 'twas <hi>de voluntate omnium
Baronum nostrorum Civitatis ejusdem,</hi>
that the King talliated his Tenents <hi>per
se,</hi> or <hi>per Capita,</hi> so much upon every
head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48036:155"/>
3. This clears the last <hi>Paragraph</hi>
which I need not recite, it having no
meaning differing from the Record, but
if my Record give not sufficient light
and strength he, I thank him, according
to his usual Curtesie cites one clear
enough.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Et cum praedicti Cives noluissent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare

praedicti Thes. &amp; alii voluerint
assidere illud Tal. per Capita.</p>
                  <p>So that till the Citizens refused the
the Sum in gross, the King did not
Talliate each man in particular.</p>
                  <p>But I am told that <hi>this is nothing</hi> to
my <hi>purpose,</hi> 'tis strange that he who
blames me in other places for not quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more than is <hi>for</hi> my <hi>purpose,</hi> when
nothing behind makes against me,
should now tax me for not skipping
over any part of that Clause which
'twas needful to take and explain entire.</p>
                  <p>To clear up his understanding if
possible, though I thought to have left
this Task, I will obviate an objection
which such as our Answerer may make,
that 'tis <hi>obscure</hi> how the Record of the
Common-Council of <hi>London</hi>'s concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its self about the Charge laid upon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48036:156"/>
the City should explain that part of
the Charter which sayes <hi>Simili modo
fiat de Civitate London,</hi> but surely pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
is a good Interpreter of a Law,
and there is this further evidence that
here is provision for the power of the
<hi>Common-Council</hi> of the City, because
that holding <hi>in Capite,</hi> and being men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
distinct from all the other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
there named in general, it must
be for something else, besides that for
which 'tis joyned with the other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Excedimus tenebris in crepuscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi>
from this <hi>obscurity</hi> and <hi>darkness</hi>

                     <hi>Provisum

that he should talliate his Demeasns,
though this was after King <hi>John</hi>'s
Charter, which was <hi>intended to restrain
the King from levying publick Taxes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
publick consent;</hi> yet <hi>it seems to
be plain by the Record that the King
by the advice of his Privy Council
taxed the City of</hi> London, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the consent of the Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of his immediate Tenents, whom
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48036:156"/>
he makes the Common-Council for all
manner of <hi>Aid</hi> and <hi>Escuage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it may be said, a Tallage was
no publick Tax, though the Tax here
spoke of, is made no more publick than
the consent required to charge it;
Which consent according to him, was
from immediate Tenents only, so that
<hi>Tallage</hi> might be a <hi>publick Tax</hi> as well
as any other. And to be sure <hi>Scutagium</hi>

and the Cases in which the King reserv'd
to himself power of taxing without

only to them; the <hi>Tax</hi> because of <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure</hi>

                  <p>Nay, he owns expresly, that <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Law in King</hi> John'<hi>s Charter,</hi>
London <hi>and other Cities and Burghs
were to be Assessed and Taxed by the
Common-Council of the Kingdom.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>p.</hi> 117. &amp; 118.</note>
And he makes a reason of that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to be the usage in the time of
<hi>H.</hi> 2. for the King to <hi>Talliate,</hi> or Tax
them without such a Council.</p>
                  <p>The Doctor has doubtless the most
particular convincing way of reasoning
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48036:157"/>
of any man, he says <hi>that Law in King</hi>
John'<hi>s Charter intended to restrain the
King from levying of publick Taxes
without publick consent:</hi> And <hi>the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of this Artice in King</hi> John'<hi>s Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is Argument sufficient to prove it:
for,</hi> mark the weighty reason, <hi>H.</hi> the
Third after this was granted, and
<hi>Edw. 1st.</hi> taxed their Demeasns through
<hi>England,</hi> though not the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
by Advice and Consent of their
Privy-Councils only until the <hi>Stat' de
Tallagio non concedendo,</hi> That is (as
<hi>Tallage</hi> is confest to be, a <hi>Publick Tax)</hi>
because some of King <hi>John</hi>'s Successors
Tax't their Demeans without publick
consent. Therefore 'twas provided in
King <hi>John</hi>'s time, by way of Prophesy,
that no publick Tax, Aid, or Escuage
should be raised without publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
                  <p>So that what was done after, was a
moral cause, or occasion of what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded.</p>
                  <p>'Twill be said, that the thing that
the Doctor went to prove was, that the
Common-Council mentioned in the
Charter was the Great and Common-Council
of the Kingdom, to all intents
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48036:157"/>
and purposes. Not that the King was
restrained from levying a publick Tax
without the consent of the <hi>Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</hi>
But surely when he goes to give
the reason why the Charter must be
taken in such a sense, we are to expect
the proof of that, not of something
else, quitting the thing to be proved.</p>
                  <p>If I can understand his dark mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he was proving that <hi>Nullum Scu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagium,
&amp;c.</hi> intended to restrain the
King from levying publick Taxes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
publick Consent. That is (to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
what he very obscurely drives at,)
the restraint was only from Taxing the
whole Kingdom; not from Taxing his
Tenants in <hi>Chief.</hi> And the reason of
this Article,<note place="margin">p. 118.</note> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> as taken in this sense,
is, that several times after this Charter
was granted, <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. and <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. Taxed
their Demeasns through <hi>England,</hi>
though not the whole Kingdom, by
Advice and Consent of their Privy-Councils
only, until the Statute <hi>De
tallagio non concedendo</hi> was made 34 <hi>E.
1.</hi> And both <hi>Richard</hi> the First and King
<hi>John</hi> had Taxed the whole Kingdom
without common Assent, before the
grant of <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> And when
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48036:158"/>
he has made good the Premises in this
Argument for the meaning of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
which will be <hi>ad graecas Calendas,</hi>
then, he may conclude that this Article
intended to restrain the King;<note place="margin">Na. he should have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>only.</hi> Nullum Scutagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> only
from levying of publick Taxes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
publick Consent, not to provide
about <hi>Escuage,</hi> or <hi>Tallage,</hi> which none
but his immediate Tenants were liable
to. And from hence when prov'd, we
might with some more colour and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
raise the Consequence that the
Common-Council <hi>mentioned</hi> in King
<hi>John</hi>'s Charter was the Great and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council
of the Kingdom to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
and purposes. But how that
should appear from the mention of <hi>Aid,</hi>
and <hi>Escuage</hi> only, will be a Question.</p>
                  <p>'<hi>Tis by him observ'd of</hi> Richard <hi>the
First,</hi> Accepit de unaquâque carucatâ
terrae totius Angliae sex solidos.</p>
                  <p>But what proof is there from the
word <hi>accepit,</hi> or the collecting of a
Tax, <hi>ex praecepto Regis,</hi> that he took
it without publick consent?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bracton</hi> Lib. 1. cap. 16.</note> I am sure
<hi>Bracton,</hi> as good an Author as the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian

But if the King in his Privy-Council
might Tax the Kingdom its self, till

                  </p>
                  <p>We are taught that in the 6 of King
<hi>John</hi> Tenents in <hi>Capite</hi> only,<note place="margin">Against <hi>Jani,</hi> &amp;c. p. 125, 126, 127.</note> provided
that every nine Knights should find a
tenth for the defence of the Kingdom,
and that they who were to find them
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48036:159"/>
were all Tenents in Military Service.
Though the Record shews, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the <hi>Miles vel Serviens, Alius
terram tenens</hi> was Charged with this.
And he vouchsafes not to take notice of
my Argument, that every Knight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bound by his tenure to find a man;
if this had not extended to all that
had to the value of a Knights Fee,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jani,</hi> &amp;c. p. 225.</note>
though not held by Knights Service, it
would have been an abatement of the
Services due, and a weakning of the
Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Besides, admit that Tenents in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite</hi>
only laid this Charge, and only
Tenents by Knights Service were bound
by it, here is such a <hi>Commune Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilium</hi>
of Tenents, as I say King <hi>John</hi>'s
Charter Exhibits, and no Charge laid
by them upon others. Whereas he
should have prov'd that they did oblige
others without their consent.</p>
                  <p>But suppose Tenents only were
Charged, why might not the Charge
have been laid by <hi>Omnes fideles</hi> in my
sense, as we find <hi>Omnes de Regno,</hi> taxing
Knights Fees only?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Doctor in his Margin gives us

                  <p>But that such Confirmation as to the

                     <note place="margin">ib. p. 140.</note> Which he thinks worthy of great

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48036:166"/>
                     <hi>Commons</hi> did not think that they ought

                  </p>
                  <p>And if the Commons were then an

of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>(8.) For demonstration that <hi>libere
tenentes</hi> came to the Great Councils
in their own Persons, and as Members;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48036:167"/>
King <hi>John</hi> before the passing of his

(the last of which takes in all the
<hi>libere tenentes)</hi> and tells them that <hi>if
it might have been done he would have
sent Letters to every one of them;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these Members whose right is here
acknowledged were single, individual
persons; for they could not have been
summoned to come by Representation
in the case of such particular Writs, or
Letters, unless the Representation were
setled before the Summons, which is
not to be supposed. These Arguments
all but the last, which the Doctor has
supplied me with, arise out of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Treatise, and I take it that this
which the Doctor has occasioned, will
yield a few more without pressing.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>V.</hi> Domes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Besides (according to the terms first agreed on) he received the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors Laws about this Folcmote. Confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 33.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>(9.) Since <hi>William</hi> the First was no
Conqueror, it follows that the <hi>Great
Folcmote,</hi> or <hi>General Council</hi> in the <hi>Saxon</hi>
times, where to be sure all Proprietors
of Land were to be <hi>Members,</hi> could not
have been turn'd into an Assembly of
the Kings Tenents upon the old legal
Title, (and without a Conquest there
was no other.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:48036:167"/>
And as there must have been a vast
number of the Proprietors whom the
Kings immediate Tenents could not
oblige; so they must have been <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
of those <hi>Councils</hi> which laid any
general Charge, and that with the same
priviledges the Tenents <hi>in Capite,</hi> who
came in Person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had.</p>
                  <p>(10.) Though demonstration it self
will not satisfie unreasonable men, yet
not to mention more I shall urge the
Authority of the Legier Book of <hi>Ely</hi>
before cited,<note place="margin">Jani, p. 41.</note> (the great Antiquity of
the hand writing of which is beyond
all exception) to persuade the Doctor
that my Notion is far from being <hi>preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;</hi>
Since that <hi>M. S.</hi> shews that King

                  <p>Perhaps 'twill be said I injure this
<hi>good man</hi> in imputing to him a <hi>design</hi>
in relation to the present Government;
Since he owns that the <hi>most excellent

                     <note place="margin">Against Mr. <hi>Petyt. p.</hi> 229.</note> (and goes to prove it

must be meant of such <hi>its Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi>
as his Book allows, and he
would make <hi>evident,</hi> but what is that?
That Lords should, to the time of his
<hi>excellent discoveries,</hi> be Summon'd to
Parliament,<note place="margin">ib. p. 227. <hi>&amp;</hi> 228.</note> or past by, at the Kings

he might Summon <hi>one Knight for a

                     <hi>one Citizen for a City, one Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gess
for a Burgh, and those nam'd to

                  </p>
                  <p>And this <hi>design</hi> will be very <hi>evident</hi>
if we observe his <hi>aery ambuscade,</hi> to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48036:174"/>
return his own phrase, and meer juggle
in joyning <hi>the Kings Authority and
time</hi> together; we think we have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but by an Hocus Pocus Trick
'tis gone; for admit that <hi>its Perfection</hi>
were such as we say it has at this day,
<hi>viz.</hi> for Lords to come of Right in
their own Persons, and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
should send Representatives of
their free Choice. Yet let us see what
setlement he gives this <hi>Great Council,</hi>
for which purpose we must divide the
two Authorities, which sometimes may
differ.</p>
                  <p>And (1.) Suppose that though time
would preserve that power which the
<hi>Great Council</hi> exercises, a King would
hereafter take it all to himself, and
make Laws by a Council of his own
chusing, or without any. If the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
allows this power, doubtless the
next Parliament will thank him.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Suppose that without, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Kings Authority, <hi>time</hi> only
would establish this Great Council, can
this be done? He that affirms it surely
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48036:174" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will be no great friend to Prerogative,
nor understands he that Maxim,</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Nullum tempus occurrit Regi.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>And one of these must be clos'd with.</p>
                  <p>'Twill be objected that I am as inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to Prerogative in arguing that
some Lords may have a Right of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
to come to the Upper-House.</p>
                  <p>But I think no sober man will deny
that there is a right either from Writs
alone, or from Writs as prescribed to,
and 'tis strange that it should not be
against Prerogative to urge a right from
one Royal Concession, and yet it should
be to urge it from many; but farther,
if they who had no right to come in
Person, or be Represented in Parliament,
should by colour of Prescription put
themselves upon the King for Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
this were derogatory to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative.
But if there be a natural right
for <hi>Proprietors</hi> of Land (with whom
some say is the ballance of power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this Nation) to be interested in the
Legislature, which I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> not affirm.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48036:175"/>
Or if there be such a positive right, not
only from the Laws for frequent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which suppose such to be <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
as had been, but more particularly
from the Law received in the <hi>4th.</hi> of
<hi>William</hi> the First,<note place="margin">Rex debet omnia rite facere in Regno &amp; per judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerum Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gni.</note> and by positive Law
or Custom the King us'd to send special
Writs for some, general for others;
the Prescribing to special Writs, which
is not of Substance as to the Legislative
Interest, is no diminution of Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
because no more in effect is out
of the King than was before, which is,
that this man should one way or other
have a share in the Legislature.</p>
                  <p>If this Solution of mine will not pass
I cannot help it, I am sure the Law for
a right grounded upon one or more Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Writs of Summons, stands fast,
though the reason of it should be above
my reach.</p>
