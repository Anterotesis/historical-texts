            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>MY Text begins, where eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good man should end; that is, in <hi>Blessing.</hi> Not an <hi>Esau</hi>; but he cryes, when the <hi>Blessing</hi> is gone, Genes. 27.<note place="margin">Gen. 27.34.</note> This Psalme is a <hi>Thankesgiuing</hi> for <hi>Dauid</hi>; for the <hi>King.</hi> In <hi>Thankesgiuing,</hi> two <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings</hi>: One, in which God <hi>blesseth</hi> vs; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> for that wee giue thankes: The other, by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which we <hi>blesse</hi> God: For he that praiseth him, and giues him thanks, is said to <hi>blesse</hi> him. Exod. 18.<note place="margin">Exod. 18.10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:2042:3"/>Now wee can no sooner meet <hi>Blessing</hi> in the Text, but we presently find two Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of it, <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King</hi>: For there is <hi>God Blessing</hi> the King; and the <hi>King Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> the people. And a King is euery way in the Text: For Dauid the King set the Psalme for the People; and the People, they sing the Psalme reioycing for the King. And all this is, <hi>that the King may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in thy strength, O Lord, v.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Verse 1.</note> And when this Psalme is sung in Harmonie, between the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>People,</hi> then there is <hi>Blessing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Psalme was sung in <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; But the Musicke of it is as good in the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> as in their <hi>Temple.</hi> Nor did the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prophecie in <hi>Dauid,</hi> so fit this Psalme to him, as that it should <hi>Honour</hi> none but himselfe:<note place="margin">S. Hieron. S. August. Iansen. Calu. Lorin. ibid.</note> No; For in this the learned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; That the <hi>letter</hi> of the Psalme, reads <hi>Dauid</hi>; that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Psalme, eyes <hi>Christ</hi>: that the <hi>Analogie</hi> in the Psalme is for euery <hi>good King,</hi> that makes <hi>Dauid</hi> his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and <hi>Christ</hi> his God.</p>
            <p>The Psalme in generall is a <hi>Thankesgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing</hi>


               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:2042:3"/>
for the happy estate of the King. In particular, it is thought a fit Psalme to be recited when the King hath recouered health; or when a gracious King begins his Reigne: Because these times are <hi>Times of blessing</hi> from the King: And these are, or ought to be, <hi>times of Thankesgiuing</hi> from the people. My Text then is in part for the day: For I hoped well it would haue been <hi>Tempus restaurationis,</hi> a time of perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing for the Kings health, and thankes were due for that: And it is <hi>Dies creationis,</hi> the Anniuersary day of his Crowne; and thankes is due for that. And there is great reason, if you will receiue the <hi>Blessing,</hi> that you giue the <hi>Thankes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Text it selfe is a reason of that which is found v. 5.<note place="margin">Verse 5.</note> There it is said, that <hi>God hath layd great dignitie and honour vpon the King.</hi> And here is the <hi>Meanes</hi> by which, and the <hi>Reason</hi> why hee hath layd it there. So three parts wil diuide the Text, and giue vs order in proceeding. The first is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               <hi>Meanes,</hi> by which God layes honour vpon the King. Not honour onely, which they


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2042:4"/>
all haue as Kings: but that great honour in his saluation, which attends good and gracious Kings. And the <hi>Meanes</hi> are two-fold <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in the Text: <hi>Dando &amp; Laetificando,</hi> By Giuing, and by Ioying. By giuing the <hi>King</hi> as a <hi>Blessing</hi> to the people; <hi>Thou hast giuen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> him, or set him as Blessings for euer.</hi> And by Ioying the King for <hi>blessing</hi> the people: <hi>Thou hast made him glad with the ioy of thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Countenance.</hi> The second is the <hi>Reason</hi> both of the Honour and the Meanes of laying it vpon the King: And that is, <hi>Quia sperat</hi>; Because the King puts his trust in the Lord. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third is the <hi>Successe,</hi> which his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour shall haue by his Hope, <hi>That in the mercy of the most High he shall not bee mooued, he shall not miscarie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I beginne at the first: The <hi>Meanes</hi> by which God adds <hi>Honour</hi> euen to the <hi>Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of Princes.</hi> And because that doubles in the Text, I will take the first in order, which is, <hi>Dando</hi>: Thou layest great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour vpon the King, <hi>by giuing or setting him, as Blessings for euer.</hi> In which Meanes of laying Honour, the circumstances are three.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:2042:4"/>And the first of the three tells vs what a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               <hi>King</hi> is; and that's worth the knowing: And marke the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> how he begins. He describes not a King by any of his <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane infirmities,</hi> such as all men haue: And no meane ones are registred of <hi>Dauid,</hi> the particular King spoken of: No, that had beene the way to dishonour the King; which is no part of Gods intention. But hee begins at that which crownes the Crowne it selfe. He is <hi>Benedictio,</hi> a <hi>Blessing,</hi> and no lesse, to the people. And therefore in all things, and by all men, is to bee spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, and vsed as a <hi>Blessing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it is one thing for a <hi>King</hi> to bee <hi>blessed</hi> in himselfe, and another thing to be <hi>giuen</hi> or <hi>set vp,</hi> as a <hi>Publike Blessing</hi> to other men. <hi>Dauid</hi> was both, and he speakes of both. A King then is a <hi>Blessing</hi> to, or in himselfe (as the <hi>Septuagint</hi> and <hi>Tremellius</hi> giue the words: <hi>Dedisti illi benedictiones</hi>; Thou hast giuen <hi>blessings</hi> to him) when by Gods grace hee is <hi>Particeps sanctificationis,</hi> Partaker of Gods hallowing Spirit. For no man, <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Subiect,</hi> can be <hi>blessed</hi> in


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2042:5"/>
his soule without <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Holinesse.</hi> And if these bee counterfeites, such also is his <hi>Blessednesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But a King is giuen as a <hi>Blessing</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when in the riches of Gods grace vpon him, he is made <hi>Diuinae Bonitatis fons medius,</hi> A mediate fountaine of Gods goodnesse and bounty streaming to the people; When he turnes the graces which God hath giuen him, to the benefite of them which are committed to him. For marke the <hi>Heauens,</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi> will learne. God did not place the <hi>Sunne</hi> in the heauens onely for heighth, but that it might haue power to <hi>Blesse</hi> the inferiour world, with <hi>Beames,</hi> &amp; <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Warmth,</hi> and <hi>Motion. Dauid</hi> was thus, and thus was <hi>Christ,</hi> and such is euery <hi>King</hi> in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, that sets vp these for his example. It is not easie to match <hi>Dauid</hi>; but a better example then <hi>Christ</hi> cannot be found. And therefore when <hi>Clem. Alex.</hi> had described a King indeed,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. stro.</note> One that is <hi>Beatus &amp; Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicens,</hi> a blessed and a blessing King; Or, if you will, as it is here in the <hi>Abstract, Ipsa be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictio,


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2042:5"/>
Blessing</hi> it selfe, He is <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t <hi>Cumsmodi est Dominus</hi>: Such as is Christ. There, the perfect example of <hi>Blessing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now while the King is said to bee a <hi>Blessing,</hi> let me put you in mind that there is a double <hi>Benediction. Descendens vna; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera ascendens,</hi> One descending, and another ascending. That which Descends, is the <hi>Blessing of Benefit</hi>; That is the <hi>Kings bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</hi> He aboue, and this drops from him. In this, like God, whose immediate Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent he is. For <hi>Gods Blessings</hi> also are said to come downe and descend.<note place="margin">Iaco. 1.17.</note> 
               <hi>S. Iacob</hi> 1. The <hi>Blessing</hi> which Ascends, is that of <hi>Praise,</hi> and <hi>Thankes,</hi> and <hi>faire interpretation of Princes Actions</hi>: And this is the peoples <hi>Blessing.</hi> And they are both in Scripture together.<note place="margin">3. Reg. 8.</note> 3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 8. For there,<note place="margin">Vers. 55.</note> ver. 55. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons blessing</hi> comes downe vpon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;<note place="margin">Vers. 66.</note> and ver. 66. the peoples <hi>blessing</hi> goes vp backe againe, to <hi>Solomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Betweene these two is the happy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce that a Prince hath with his people: when they striue to <hi>out-blesse</hi> one another. When the King labours the Peoples good:


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2042:6"/>
that is his <hi>blessing</hi> descending vpon them. And the people labour his honour: that is their <hi>blessing</hi> reaching vp to him. And in this sence also as well as the former, a King is said, <hi>Poni in benedictionem,</hi> to be set vp as a <hi>Blessing,</hi> that is, for one whom the people ought to blesse. For Gods ordinance, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.17.</note> 1. <hi>S. Pet.</hi> 2. doth as much, if not more, require the people to <hi>blesse,</hi> that is, to <hi>honour</hi> the King, then it doth the King to <hi>blesse,</hi> that is, to <hi>doe good</hi> to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And there is no good diuision be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a King and his people, but this one; That in parting of this <hi>great good</hi> of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious gouernement; The Kings part be the <hi>Honour</hi>: The peoples part may be the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi>: and both meete againe in the <hi>Blessing.</hi> And it is so in my Text; For, <hi>Ar.

            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Dauid</hi> is obseru'd, to haue <hi>Blessed</hi> the people vnder him three wayes; and to these three generals, all the <hi>Blessings</hi> of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> King are reducible.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For if hee mainteine not true <hi>Religion</hi> among them, then his <hi>Blessings</hi> are not <hi>for Euer,</hi> but end in the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Plenty of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this life.</hi> If he preserue them not from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine violence; then his <hi>Blessings</hi> reach not so farre as to the <hi>Euer</hi> of this life, but are hewen downe by the sword of the <hi>Enemie.</hi> If hee doe keepe out forraine force, yet if <hi>Iustice and Iudgement,</hi> bee not in life and in blood at home, his best <hi>Blessings</hi> will bee

            </p>
            <p>Now this <hi>In perpetuum, for euer,</hi> was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute in <hi>Christ</hi>: but in <hi>Dauid</hi> and other <hi>Kings,</hi> bee they neuer so eminent in their times, it is but <hi>respectiuely for euer.</hi> That is, not for the <hi>Euer</hi> of <hi>eternity</hi>: no nor for the <hi>Euer</hi> of <hi>time</hi>: But onely for the <hi>Euer of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of their owne Reigne, in their allotted time.</hi> And this is a large <hi>for euer.</hi> For you can haue no longer Blessings from the best King, then God giues him time to blesse in: for hee is constant in Blessing, that giues it not ouer but with life, and this was <hi>Iosiahs</hi> honour. 4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 23.<note place="margin">4.

            <p>And yet I may not forget, that some times this <hi>for euer</hi> extends the blessings of Kings beyond their life.

               </gap> and that implyes <hi>Succession</hi>: So it is a <hi>Present,</hi> and an <hi>after blessing.</hi> A bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in <hi>himselfe,</hi> and a blessing in his <hi>feede.</hi> In his <hi>person,</hi> and in his <hi>posterity</hi> a <hi>Blessing.</hi> And the Text fitted <hi>Dauid</hi> home.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly then, the <hi>King</hi> is a <hi>Blessing</hi> to his people, and that <hi>for euer</hi>: but who makes him so? yea, now wee are come to <hi>the great Father of blessings God himselfe</hi>: for if you marke, the Text begins at <hi>Tu de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disti,</hi> or <hi>Tu posuisti</hi>; Thou Lord hast giuen him, thou hast set him for blessings: And God as in other, so in this particular, very gracious: for no people can merit this at Gods hand, that <hi>their King</hi> should bee a <hi>Blessing</hi> to them, &amp; continue so. No, you see <hi>Tu dedisti,</hi> thou hast giuen him, makes him <hi>Donum,</hi> a meere gift, no purchase.</p>
            <p>Againe, no King can promise and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this out of his owne strength, that he will bee a <hi>Blessing</hi> to his people, and that for <hi>euer.</hi> No, you see <hi>Tu posuisti,</hi> thou


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2042:9"/>
hast set him, keepes him at his disposing, leaues him not to his owne. And indeed in this, a <hi>Kings</hi> felicitie is borne as <hi>Christs</hi> was, by an ouershadowing power. And you cannot, no not with a curious eye, search all the Reasons, how hee is set for Blessings: because God in disposing it, hath hid <hi>Lumen intra vmbram,</hi> and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the vaile that is drawne ouer it.</p>
            <p>There is much, I confesse, in the <hi>King,</hi> to compasse the Affections of his People: and there is much in the people, not to distaste the heart of their <hi>King</hi> for trifles, not to vrge him with indignities. But when all is done, and the <hi>blessing</hi> stands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>People,</hi> ready to <hi>descend</hi> from the One to the other; yet you must goe to <hi>Tu dabis,</hi> Thou Lord shalt giue it: For if he giue it not, it will not be had: There will be a rub where it is not looked for, and a stop in the Blessing. For is there conquest ouer enemies, or rest from them? why that is <hi>Tua gratia,</hi> Gods fauour. So S. <hi>Basil.</hi>
               <note place="margin">

            <p>There is a <hi>great Errour</hi> in the world, I pray God it bee not as <hi>Common</hi> as <hi>Great</hi>: And it is, to thinke that this <hi>blessing</hi> can be brought about by <hi>Policie onely.

And it must needes be so: For all <hi>Policie</hi> is but a piece of Gods gift, a branch of Gods wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: Therfore not so great as the whole.

            <p>With this <hi>Politicke errour,</hi> went another of <hi>Destinie.</hi> The former leaues <hi>Gods Altar,</hi> and the sacrifice is to their <hi>owne net.

            <p>But these blinde men had <hi>Blessings,</hi> and knew not whence they came, vnlesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they vnderstood <hi>Prouidence</hi> by <hi>Fate</hi>: (And <hi>Minut.

therefore vpon <hi>The Author of Blessings.</hi> And where it is, <hi>Tu dedisti,</hi> Thou hast gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him as <hi>Blessings</hi> (as it is with vs) there know, it is worth <hi>Thanks</hi> both from Prince and people.

            </p>
            <p>And as it is, <hi>Tu dedisti,</hi> Thou hast giuen; So that is not all, but, <hi>Tu dedisti priùs,</hi> Thou hast giuen first.

               <hi>Blessings</hi> that hee is to his people. Next I finde, <hi>Pij loquuntur</hi>; they are the faithfull that speake it: Not a religious and a good subiect, but hee is at <hi>Tu dabis,</hi> that God would blesse his King, and make him a Blessing for euer.</p>
            <p>And therefore when God giues, and the King <hi>blesses,</hi> and the people take no notice of it, it is grosse <hi>ingratitude</hi>: when they haue a <hi>blessing</hi> and know it not, it is a dangerous <hi>slumber</hi>: when they may haue a <hi>blessing</hi> and will not, it is a sullen pet, and shewes they haue no minde to bee thankefull, either to God or the King for Blessing them.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And first, God layes Honour vpon the King, <hi>Laetificando,</hi> by ioying him, while he blesses the people: And the <hi>Ioy</hi> which God giues cannot but be great; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Septuagint</hi> expresses it by two words, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. Thou shalt Ioy him with Ioy: that is, <hi>thou shalt make him excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding glad</hi>: and it is requisit a King should haue <hi>Ioy,</hi> great <hi>Ioy,</hi> for he cannot sit at the stearne, without a great deale of <hi>Care</hi>: And therefore it is fit hee should bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with a great deale of <hi>Ioy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if a King will not faile of this <hi>Ioy,</hi> he must goe to the right <hi>Owner</hi> of it, God himselfe, that both hath and giues aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly. If hee seeke it in <hi>Himselfe,</hi> if in the

very <hi>People which he blesses</hi>; it will not euer there bee found. For when a King <hi>Blesses</hi> his people, if the <hi>blessing</hi> bee as <hi>discreetly</hi> taken, as it is <hi>graciously</hi> ment; then there is <hi>Ioy, great Ioy,</hi> of al hands.

            <p>And this consider'd, it is no great matter how you reade my Text; <hi>A,</hi> or <hi>Cum,</hi> or <hi>Iuxta,</hi> or <hi>Apud vultum</hi>: For the King needs all, and God giues all.

            <p>Thirdly, this ioy begins at the King,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
               <hi>Laetificasti eum</hi>; Thou hast made him glad. He must haue the greatest care, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Ioy</hi> must bee first or chiefest in him: and if you will take a view of my Text, you will find <hi>Him</hi> excellently seated for the purpose: for I find <hi>Eum,</hi> that is <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> that is the <hi>King,</hi> standing betweene <hi>Laetificasti</hi> and <hi>Gaudium,</hi> as if <hi>God</hi> would haue the <hi>Kings</hi> place knowne, by <hi>Ioy</hi> on the right hand, and <hi>Ioy</hi> on the left, heere God places the King: this is his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to season his cares: therefore if any <hi>attempt</hi> to displace him, to <hi>plunge</hi> him into griefe, <hi>to make him struggle</hi> with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; it is a kinde of <hi>Deposing</hi> him.

            </p>
            <p>And it is fit for the people, especially the <hi>greater,</hi> in their <hi>families,</hi> to looke to this, that <hi>Dauid</hi> may keepe <hi>Inter Laetificasti &amp;

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And now I am come to the second ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the Text, the <hi>Reason</hi> both of the <hi>Thing,</hi> and the <hi>Meanes</hi>: of the <hi>Honour,</hi> and the <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> laying it vpon Kings. And the Reason is, <hi>Quia sperat,</hi> because the King puts his trust in the Lord: In which, may it please you to obserue three circumstances.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:2042:16"/>The first of these is the <hi>Vertue</hi> it selfe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which <hi>God</hi> first gaue the Prophet, and for which hee after gaue him a Blessing to the People, and Ioy in himselfe. The Vertue is <hi>Hope</hi>; That Hope, <hi>in the Lord.</hi> Now Hope followes the nature of Faith: And such as the Faith is, such is the <hi>Hope</hi>: Both must bee <hi>in Domino,</hi> in the Lord, or neither can bee true.</p>
            <p>And it is in a sort, with the deniall of Hope in any Creature, That the Hope which is founded vpon God alone (I say alone as the prime Author) may be firme, and not diuided. <hi>Nulli hominum fidens,</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting vpon no man, is <hi>Theodoret.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Theodor. ib.</note> 
               <hi>Not in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor in riches, nor in any strength of man,</hi> is <hi>Euthymius.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Euthym. ib.</note> Not <hi>in sword, nor speare, nor shield, but in the Name of the Lord of hostes, is Dauid himselfe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Reg. 17.45.</note> 1. Reg. 17. And <hi>Dauid</hi> could not lay better hold any where. For since before, all lies vpon God, <hi>Tu dedisti,</hi> and, <hi>Tu laetificasti,</hi> Thou hast giuen, and, Thou hast made glad: where could any man fasten better? And indeed the words


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2042:17"/>
are a reciprocall proofe, either to other: For because <hi>God</hi> giues, <hi>Dauid</hi> hopes: And because <hi>Dauid</hi> hopes, <hi>God</hi> giues more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, <hi>Honour, Blessing,</hi> and <hi>Ioy.</hi> It is in the Text, <hi>Quia sperat,</hi> euen because hee trusts.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Is trust then, and relying vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, a matter of such consequence, that it alone stands as a cause of these? Yes, <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Trust</hi> rightly layde vpon God, haue euer beene in his children, <hi>Loco me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riti,</hi> in stead of merit. And what euer may bee thought of this <hi>Hope,</hi> it is a <hi>Kings ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> in this place.<note place="margin">Lib. 2. de E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rudit. prin. cap. 6.</note> And <hi>Thomas</hi> prooues it; That <hi>Hope</hi> is necessary for all men, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially for <hi>Princes.</hi> And the more trust in God, <hi>Honoratior Princeps,</hi> the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour hath the King, as <hi>Apollinarius</hi> obserues it.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> And therefore <hi>Hope</hi> is not here a naked expectation of somewhat to come: But it is <hi>Hope,</hi> and the ground of <hi>Hope, Faith,</hi> as some <hi>later Diuines</hi> thinke not amisse.<note place="margin">Calu. Musc. Tremell. Moller. ibid.</note> And <hi>Faith</hi> embraces the <hi>Veritie</hi> of God, as well as the <hi>Promises</hi> made vpon it: And


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2042:17"/>
this was right: For so <hi>God</hi> promised, and so <hi>Dauid</hi> beleeu'd, he would performe, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 7.29.<note place="margin">2. Reg. 7.29.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And since wee haue found <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> in this action of <hi>Trusting God</hi> (as our English well expresses it) let vs neuer seeke to shut out <hi>Charity</hi>; And if <hi>Faith, Hope</hi> and <hi>Charitie</hi> bee together, as they loue to goe, then you may vnderstand the Text, <hi>Quia sperat,</hi> because he <hi>Hopes, De toto cultu,</hi> of the entire worship of <hi>God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 8. Orig. cap. 2.</note> For (as S. <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidor</hi> obserues) <hi>in all inward worship, which is the heart of Religion, are these three, Faith, Hope, and Charitie.</hi> And in the most vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all phrase of Scripture, (though not euer) scarce one of these is named but all are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to be present: and if so, then, because he trusts, is as much as <hi>Quia colit,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he worships. So at last we are come to the cause indeed, why <hi>God</hi> set <hi>Dauid</hi> for such a <hi>Blessing</hi> to his people: why he fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him with such <hi>ioy of his countenance.</hi> And all was, <hi>Quia culto<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> because he was such a religious worshipper.</p>
            <p>It is in the Text then, that a Kings Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2042:18"/>
is a great cause of his happinesse. The greatest <hi>Politicians</hi> that are, haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed thus farre: that some <hi>Religion</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, to make a King a <hi>Blessing</hi> to his People, and a common-wealth happy: But the matter is not great with them, whether it bee a true, or a false <hi>Religion,</hi> so it be one. But they are heere in a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable error: for since they suppose a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> necessary (as they must) my Text will turne all the rest vpon them; that <hi>true Religion</hi> is most apt, and most able, to <hi>Blesse</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For first, <hi>Trueth</hi> is stronger then false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and will so prooue it selfe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it is not preuented or abused: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and therefore it is more able. Next, <hi>true Religion</hi> breeds euer true <hi>Faith,</hi> and true <hi>Hope</hi> in God; which no false Religion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> can: therefore it is more apt. Then, true Hope and Faith haue heere the <hi>promise of God,</hi> for the Kings <hi>Ioy,</hi> &amp; the Peoples <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi> euen <hi>Quia sperat,</hi> because he trusts: whereas the rest haue onely his <hi>permission.</hi> Therefore it is both: both more <hi>apt,</hi> and


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2042:18"/>
more <hi>able,</hi> to blesse King and Common-wealth, then any <hi>false Religion,</hi> or <hi>supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is, or can be.</p>
            <p>It was but a scoffe of <hi>Lucian,</hi> to describe Christians, simple and easie to be abused:<note place="margin">In morte Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regri.</note> or if any in his time were such, the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the men, must not be charged vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <hi>Religion</hi>: for <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe the <hi>founder of Religion,</hi> though he did vnsting the Serpent in all his charge to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, yet he left his vertue vncheck'd: nay he commanded that. <hi>Be innocent, but yet as wise as Serpents.

So that till Christians forsake Christs rule, <hi>Lucians</hi> scoffe takes no hold of them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Since <hi>Quia sperat,</hi> the Faith and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Religion of a King, is that which brings God to giue him as a Blessing; It must not be forgotten, that <hi>Trust in God,</hi> is <hi>inter fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damenta Regum,</hi> amidst the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Kings. And <hi>spes</hi> is <hi>quasi pes,</hi> Hope (sayth <hi>Isidore</hi>) is the foot,<note place="margin">Lib. 8. Orig. cap. 2.</note> and the resting place. Now no building can stand, if the

Take away the trueth of this <hi>Hope, Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and I cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise the Blessings to stand: For then there is neuer another <hi>Quia,</hi> or <hi>cause</hi> in the Text, to mooue God to giue. But if the cause stand (as <hi>Theodor.</hi> and <hi>Euthym.</hi> here make it) all is well.<note place="margin">Theodor. &amp; Euthym. ib.</note>

            <p>And here it were sacriledge for me, and no lesse, to passe by his <hi>Maiestie,</hi> without thankes both to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Him.</hi> To <hi>Him,</hi> for, <hi>Quia sperat,</hi> because hee trusteth: For no Prince hath euer kept more firme to Religion.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And so I come to the last part of my Text, which is the happy <hi>Successe</hi> which <hi>Dauid</hi> shall haue for trusting in the <hi>Lord.</hi>


               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:2042:19"/>
It is a <hi>Reward,</hi> and <hi>Rewards</hi> come last. And it is, That in this trust, he shall not sli<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e, he shall not miscarry. And here (to make all parts euen) are three circumstances too.</p>
            <p>The first of these, is the <hi>Successe</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it selfe: And it is a great one: <hi>Non commouebitur,</hi> He shall not be <hi>mooued</hi>; or at least not remooued, not <hi>miscarry.</hi> And this is a great <hi>Successe,</hi> To haue to doe with the greatest mooueables in the world, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and not <hi>miscarry.</hi> So that trust in the Lord, makes a King in the midst of a mightie people, <hi>Petram in mari turbido,</hi> A Rocke in a working Sea: Ebbe, and flow, and swell, yet insolent waues dash them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in pieces of all sides the Rocke, and the King is at <hi>Non commouebitur,</hi> Hee shall not be <hi>mooued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, This great <hi>Successe</hi> doeth not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> attend on Kings, for either their wisdome, or their power, or any thing else that is simply theirs? No, wee must fall backe to <hi>spes in Domino,</hi> their trust in the Lord: yea and this trust too, is not simply vpon the Lord; but vpon his <hi>Mercy.</hi> And indeed to


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2042:20"/>
speake properly, Man hath no ground of his Hope but <hi>Mercy;</hi> no stay vpon the slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, but <hi>Mercy.</hi> For if he looke vpon God, and consider him in Iustice; If hee looke vpon himselfe, and weigh his soule by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; it is impossible for a man to Hope, or in Hope not to <hi>miscarry.</hi> And therefore the Prophet heere, though hee promise <hi>Non commouebitur,</hi> that the King shall not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary; yet he dares promise it no where els then <hi>In misericordia,</hi> in <hi>Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, I wil not omit the Expression, whose <hi>Mercy</hi> it is that giues successe to Princes; and that is <hi>Altissimi,</hi> the mercie of the most high, which is one of Gods vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Names in Scripture. Now <hi>Sperat &amp; non commouebitur</hi>; The Kings Hope and his Successe, doe both meete in the <hi>Highest mercie.</hi> It is true, Hope stands below, and out of sight: For, Hope that is seene is no hope,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.24.</note> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. yet as lowe as it stands it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates God <hi>qua Altissimus,</hi> as hee is at highest. And this shewes the strength of this vertue of Hope: For as Hope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in <hi>nature</hi> is in men that are warme


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2042:20"/>
and spirited, so is it also considered as a <hi>vertue.</hi> And therefore giue it but due foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which is vpon <hi>Mercy,</hi> and in the strength of that, it will clime to God, were it possible hee should bee <hi>Higher</hi> then hee is.</p>
            <p>The footing of Hope is lowe: therefore it seekes mercie: And the Kings hope keepes the foote of the hill; <hi>Rex humili corde sperat</hi>:<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> (so <hi>S.

            <p>Now in this Mercie-seate it is obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, three Grandies are met together; <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, Ioy,</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi>; and yet there is no strife for precedencie: For <hi>Blessing</hi> goes first; <hi>Ioy</hi> comes after, for no man so ioyfull as hee that is <hi>blessed</hi>; and then <hi>Hope,</hi> to supplie the defects of both, because nor <hi>Blessings</hi> nor <hi>Ioy,</hi> can be perfect in this life.</p>
            <p>And they haue chosen to themselues an

For, his constancie in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is knowen to the world: And the freedome of his life, argues his trust in the Lord: And the assurance of his Hope shall not vanish. For, let him keepe to the mercy of the Highest, and there hee shall not miscarry.</p>
            <p>And giue mee leaue to speake a little out of my <hi>Spes in Domino,</hi> my trust in the Lord;


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2042:22"/>
mee thinkes I see, <hi>Non commouebitur,</hi> Hee shall not miscarrie, three wayes doubling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> vpon him. First, for his <hi>Priuate</hi>; I haue two great inducements among many in another Kingdome, to thinke that hee is so firme in the mercies of God, that hee cannot miscarry. The one is as old as <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uemb.</hi> 5. 1605. The powder was ready then, but the <hi>Fire</hi> could not kindle. The other is as young as <hi>Ianuary last, the</hi> 9. The <hi>water</hi> was too ready then, and hee fell into it. Neither of these <hi>Elements</hi> haue any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: but the mercy of the Highest was His Acquittance from both. In the first, hee learned, that when desperate men haue sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramented themselues to destroy, God can preuent and deliuer, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.<note place="margin">Act. 24. 12 Psal. 33.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Next, me thinkes, I haue a <hi>Non commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uebitur,</hi>

most <hi>High</hi> there is no <hi>miscarrying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you haue seene the Kings <hi>blessing,</hi> the Kings <hi>Ioy,</hi> the Kings <hi>Hope,</hi> and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Kings <hi>Assurance.</hi> In the first you haue seene, that the King is a <hi>Blessing</hi> to his People: that a gracious King (such as God hath giuen vs) is a Blessing <hi>for Euer.</hi> That he is so, <hi>Quia tu dedisti,</hi> because God hath giuen, and set him to bee so: from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Blessing <hi>to Ioy.</hi> And there you haue seene, that the Ioy which followes a Blessed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment, is a great Ioy, a true and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Ioy, a Ioy that is either first, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> chiefest in the King. Now Blessing and Ioy, are both grounded vpon <hi>Hope</hi>: this <hi>Hope</hi> in the Lord, this <hi>Hope</hi> includes, Faith, and Religion, and so this <hi>Hope</hi> stands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the foundations of Kings. The <hi>Successe</hi> assured vnto him is <hi>Non commoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur,</hi> hee shall not miscary, not so long as hee rests on Mercie; that Mercie of the <hi>Highest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Non commouebitur</hi>: driue wind and tide, he shall not miscarry. Shall not? what? is it absolute then, for <hi>Dauid,</hi> or for any King?


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2042:23"/>
No, I say not so neither. There is a double condition in the Text, if <hi>Dauid</hi> will not miscary: the one is <hi>Ex parte Dauidis,</hi> on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               <hi>Dauids</hi> side: and that is at <hi>Sperat,</hi> a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart to God that cannot but trust in him. The other is <hi>Ex parte Dei,</hi> on Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> side, and that is at <hi>Misericordia,</hi> a mercifull prouidence ouer the King, which knowes not how to forsake, till it be forsaken, if it doe then. Let vs call in the Prophet for witnesse,<note place="margin">Psal. 94.18.</note> 
               <hi>Psal.</hi> 94. <hi>When I said, My foot hath slipped, thy mercie, O Lord, held mee vp.</hi> Now the foote of a man slips from the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the trust, (as <hi>Cassian</hi> obserues) <hi>Mobilitate Arbitrij,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Collat. 3. c. 12.</note> by the changings of the will, which is too free to sinne, and breach of trust: the Holder vp in the slip is <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> therefore it is safest relying vpon the condition which is on Gods side, that is Mercy, for that holds firme, when men breake.</p>
            <p>And marke my Text, Hope goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and <hi>Non commouebitur,</hi> hee shall not miscary, followes after: but yet it followes not, till the Mercy of the <hi>Highest</hi> bee come


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2042:24"/>
in betweene. And indeed to speake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, all those things which the Scripture attributes to the Faith and Hope of man, are due onely <hi>Misericordiae Altissimi,</hi> to the Mercy of the <hi>Highest,</hi> which both giues and rewards them.</p>
            <p>And yet for all this, the Hope of the Beleeuer, and the mercie of God in whom hee trust's, are happily ioyned in my Text. Because the Hope of Faith can obtaine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without the Mercie of the Highest: And that Mercie &amp; goodnes will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit any man, that doth not beleeue &amp; trust in it. And Hope, and Mercie are not better fitted to secure <hi>Dauid,</hi> then Mercie and the Highest are, to make him apprehensiue of his assurance. For Goodnesse and Mercie are inualid without Power: Now that is supplied by <hi>Altissimus</hi> the Highest. And power is full of terrour when it stands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from goodnesse: and that is supplied by <hi>Mercie</hi>: When both meete, the Hope of man is full. So <hi>Dauid</hi> cannot but see all firme on Gods side; And sure hee is not to miscarry, if hee looke to performance


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2042:24"/>
of his owne. And though it be safeste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying vpon God, yet it is neuer safe to disioyne them whom God hath put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: And therefore as hee is mercifull, so man must bee faithfull; Hee must trust.</p>
            <p>And now to end at home <hi>Dauid</hi> is gone long since to his <hi>Hope,</hi> the <hi>Mercy of the Highest</hi>: But a King, a gracious King, is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ouer vs in Peace, and Happinesse, as our eyes see this day.</p>
            <p>I know Hee remembers why God set Him ouer this great and numerous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: that is, <hi>in Benedictionem,</hi> euen to <hi>blesse</hi> them: And that he hath beene a <hi>Blessing</hi> vnto them, malice it selfe cannot deny. And I make no question, but hee will goe on with the Text, and be <hi>Blessings</hi> to them <hi>for euer: For euer</hi> through his whole time: and <hi>for euer</hi> in his generous Posteritie. <hi>Tu dedisti,</hi> Gods gift is through all this; and I will euer pray, that it may neuer faile.</p>
            <p>He hath giuen this people all His time, the <hi>Blessing of Peace</hi>: And the sweete Peace of the people,<note place="margin">Cassiod. lib. 5. epist. 39.</note> is <hi>Praeconium Regnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi>


               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:2042:25"/>
the Glory of Kings. And Gods gift is in this too: For though it be the King that <hi>Blesses,</hi> yet it is God that giues <hi>Blessing</hi> to Blessing it selfe. And suppose <hi>Peace</hi> end in <hi>Warre, Tu dedisti;</hi> Gods gift reaches thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too:<note place="margin">1. Reg. 17.47.</note> For <hi>the Battell is the Lords.</hi> 1. Reg. 17. The Battell, yes, and the Victory. For (sayth <hi>S. Basil</hi>) <hi>Dextera victrix,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Basil. ib.</note> Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be the Enemie, the right hand that conquers him is the Lords.</p>
            <p>Now for his <hi>Blessing,</hi> it is fit hee should receiue <hi>Ioy</hi>: But if hee will haue that true and permanent, (and no other is worth the hauing) he must looke it <hi>in vultu Dei,</hi> in Gods countenance. If hee looke it any where else, especially where the Ioy of his countenance shines not, there will be but false representations of Ioy that is not.</p>
            <p>This day, the <hi>Anniuersarie of his Crowne,</hi> is to all his louing Subiects, <hi>Dies Gaudij,</hi> and <hi>Dies Spei,</hi> A day of Ioy, and a day of Hope. <hi>A day of Ioy</hi>: For what can be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then to see a Iust, and a gracious King multiplying his yeres?
