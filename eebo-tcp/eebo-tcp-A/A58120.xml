            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>VEry unfortunate this Play has bin;</l>
            <l> A slippery trick was play'd as by <hi>Scapin.</hi>
            </l>
            <l> Whilst here our Actors made along delay,</l>
            <l> When some were idle, others ran away,</l>
            <l> The City House comes out with half our Play.</l>
            <l> We fear, that having heard of this so long,</l>
            <l> Your expectation now will do it wrong.</l>
            <l> The Poet does a dang'rous trial make,</l>
            <l> And all the common Roads of Plays forsake.</l>
            <l> Vpon the Actors it depends too much,</l>
            <l> And who can hope ever to see two such</l>
            <l> As the Fam'd <hi>Harlequin &amp; Scaramouch.</hi>
            </l>
            <l> This well he knew.—</l>
            <l>Yet rather chose in new attempts to fail,</l>
            <l> Than in the old indifferently prevail.</l>
            <l> Great Wits refrain this writing, 'cause 'tis low,</l>
            <l> They oftner write to please themselves than you.</l>
            <l> Like but the Play, let others have the name,</l>
            <l> Let both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> share the fame,</l>
            <l> But if't be bad, let them too bear the blame.</l>

Is this the reward of my care to give thee breeding? Is this the best return you make me, this the respect due to a Father? Is this your duty and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience? Go ungratious wretch as thou art, hadst thou the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the impudence, to engage your self without my consent and approbation, to marry without my leave or knowledg, answer me, answer me, you that sneak so, what have you to say for your self?

            <sp>
               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>Yes truly but—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Panc.</speaker>
               <p>A Son to marry without the consent of his Father.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>Something may be said as to that indeed, but I know you are a man of that Wisdom not to be too much concern'd at what cann't be help't.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Panc.</speaker>
               <p>Not to be concern'd, yes I will be concern'd, don't you think, that I have all reason immaginable to be angry?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plant.</speaker>
               <p>Yes truly you have so, I was angry my self when I first heard on't, I was so much concern'd for your sake, that I school'd your Son soundly, ask him there what a Lecture I read him for his want of respect to a Father, to whose least commands he ought to show obedience, no man cou'd have said more, not your self. But I have since considered things according to Reason, and find (now my Passion is gone) that they are not so bad as may be imagin'd,</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Panc.</speaker>
               <p>How? What can be worse, then for a Son to run head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and Marry no body knows who?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>Oh, I grant it was not well done, but what? our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons depend not altogether on us, the Stars have a powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. In sine, it was his Fate.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Panc.</speaker>
               <p>That's a fine Reason indeed, by that means a man may Cheat, Rob, Murder, and say for excuse, 'Twas his Fate so to do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>But Sir, you take my words in too strict a Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal a sense, yet Fate is hard to be resisted, and the influence of the Stars, concur much to the Operations of our Minds.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Panc.</speaker>
               <p>But does not wisdom controul the Stars, and the Fate you: talk of? <hi>Sapiens Dominabitur Astris</hi>—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true, Wisdom corrects but cannot quite alter the course of the Stars—But what, you don't expect to see your Son at these years as wise as your self?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Harl.</speaker>
               <p>As for example, young Mr. <hi>Octavio,</hi> notwithstanding all my good Counsels, daily Advice, Remonstrances, Cautions and Caveats, has yet play'd a more foolish trick then Signior <hi>Cynthio.</hi>

               <p>I wou'd fain know if you were not young once your self, and had not your Devices and Vigaries like others? I have heard say that you were heretofore very brisk upon the Ladies, a great Gallant, and kept Company with all the Ladies of the times.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Panc.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis confest, but I had still a regard to my self, I never did what he has done.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>And what has he done? He saw a young Lady whom he loved, he had that from you to have a kindness for all pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Women. He found her very charming, made her visits, look'd languishingly on her, sigh'd and talk'd passionately, and declared his love in all the gallantries of Courtship. She makes a return, he is weak, the temptation strong, his Stars conspire, Fate helps, Opportunity presents, he makes use of the Critical minute, the Parents surprise him, force him to marry her, he gives her his Hand, and makes the best of a bad Market, and yet you'l be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry.</p>

               <speaker>Spitt.</speaker>
               <p>Be cover'd I beseech you, 'tis concerning a matter of great importance, but it is not good to proceed in matters of this nature without the counsel and advice of Friends.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>I take it as a particular honour, Signior <hi>Spittzaferro,</hi> that you make choice of me. Well Sir, acquaint me with the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Spitt.</speaker>
               <p>But first I desire you not to flatter me, but really and truly to tell me your thoughts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>Well, since you desire it, I will.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Spitt.</speaker>
               <p>There's nothing I should sooner find fault with, than a friend that won't freely tell me his mind.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>You are in the right.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Spitt.</speaker>
               <p>In this Age 'tis very hard to find a sincere friend.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>Very true.</p>

               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>By our friendship, as I hope to live. Now tell me what ist?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Spitt.</speaker>
               <p>I wou'd know whether you think it convenient for me to marry or not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>For you to marry?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Spitt.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I my self in Person, what wou'd you counsel me?</p>

               <p>I tell you plainly, that 'twill be very indiscreetly done of you to marry, for marriage is a thing that even young people ought to consider of before they do it, and if marriage at the best be counted the greatest of follies, what can be worse than to be guilty of this folly, at an Age when we shou'd be more discreet. In short Sir, I tell you my opinion, I wou'd not counsel you to marry, and you'l be thought the indiscreetest man in the world, having liv'd free to these years, if you shou'd now thrust your neck into the yoak.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Spitt.</speaker>
               <p>And I tell you Signior <hi>Plautino,</hi> that I'm resolv'd to marry, come what will, and that no body will count me a fool for marrying the Gentlewoman I pretend to, when once they see what manner of person she is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>O! that alters the Case, you did not tell me that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Spitt.</speaker>
               <p>She's one that's very pritty, and one that I love very well.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>You love her very well?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Spitt.</speaker>
               <p>With all my heart, and I have her Fathers consent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>Oh, you have her Fathers consent too?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Spitt.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and I have promis'd to be marri'd to morrow.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>O Marry, Marry, I have no more to say.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Spitt.</speaker>
               <p>I was formerly against marrying, but now I consider if I continue as I am, the race of the <hi>Spittzaferro</hi>'s will be at an end, and in marrying I shall live after I am dead, in my issue.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore you'l do very well to marry.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Spitt.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, what a pleasure I shall take to see a Company of little Creatures, to whom I gave life and motion, and are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny small Figures of my self, there shall I see my self drawn to the life in little. O how these little images will be hopping and jumping about me, and calling me Pa pa, talking and prattling, and telling me a company of pritty little foolish tales, O the dear pritty little Poppets, what can be more delightful.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing in the world, therefore marry the first thing you do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Spitt.</speaker>
               <p>Very good, you give me that Counsel.</p>

               <p>I counsel you, you can't do better.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Spitt.</speaker>
               <p>Truly I am very well pleased to find you counsel me so like a friend.</p>

               <p>We'l never be medling, nor thwarting one another; I'l not concern my self at what you do: As I hope, on the other side, you'l not be contradicting, or telling me what I shall do.</p>

               <p>As for my part, I think there ought to be a mutual compliance, and that people ought not to marry to be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to one another. In fine, when we are married we'l live like two that understand one anothers humour; no jealousy nor suspitious shall trouble your head, but it shall be sufficient that you have an assurance of my fidelity; as I shall have a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of yours.

You know that Dreams are as they were Glasses, that represent to us things that shall happen. I dreamt that I

But as for consultation about your Marriage, hear a couple of very learn'd Philosophers, your Neighbours, Signior <hi>Scaramouch,</hi> and Signior Doctor <hi>Pancracio,</hi> one a bold <hi>Aristotelian,</hi> and the other a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Academick; with them you may debate about every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of your Marriage, they being of different Sects, you may hear their several opinions, and from both judg what's best for you to do; for my part, I'm satisfi'd with what I said to you before: And so your Servant.</p>

               <p>Go, 'tis ready for you. So, now you have assum'd the Robes of a Philosopher, 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite your mind shou'd be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested too with the habits of a Philosopher.</p>

               <p>The habits then requisite for the mind are these.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Harl.</speaker>
               <p>By the way, one word, I pray, Signior <hi>Scaramouch;</hi> are the habits of the mind for a Philosopher, made of the same stuff as the habits of his body? Methinks this shou'd be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle too coarse for the in-side.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Scar.</speaker>
               <p>A habit is a certain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> facility added to our power, and helping it to act.—As for example,—a—</p>

               <p>Eh! As for example, a Rope-dancer, who by often practising to dance upon a Rope, grows at last expert, and does it with ease.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Harl.</speaker>
               <p>So I, by often wearing my new Shooes—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Scar.</speaker>
               <p>What?</p>

               <speaker>Harl.</speaker>
               <p>Signior <hi>Scaramouch,</hi> hear me now: A habit is a certain facility added to our power, and helping it to act. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, a Rope-dancer, who by often dancing upon the Rope, at last breaks his neck with case<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <speaker>Scar.</speaker>
               <p>O stupidity! the principal vertues requisite in a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher, are Patience, Temperance, Sobriety and Chastity; the first is Patience, he must not be provoked to anger.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Harl.</speaker>
               <p>If I am struck by any one, may I not strike agen?</p>

               <p>O ho! then if any one strike me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I may strike agen, if I think I can beat him. Cud-so! I find there's reason in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Scar.</speaker>
               <p>The next is Temperance; a Philosopher must be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, he must not eat much.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Harl.</speaker>

            <sp>

               <p>The next is Sobriety; a Philosopher must not be drunk, nor given to drink.</p>

               <p>O, I'm of your opinion, Signior; I find I shall soon be a Philosopher, because I come of the kind; my Mother was a Philosopher; for the knew what was good for her; she always kept the best for her self.</p>

               <p>I'l tell you, Mr. <hi>Plautino,</hi> nothing but this cou'd have mov'd me:—This is a thing;—Well, I'm just going to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel about it, to know how to remedy it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>Pray hearken to me, Signior <hi>Pancrace;</hi> try some other way to adjust the business, you are not ignorant that Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires much sawce, and you will hang your self upon dangerous Tenters.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Panc.</speaker>
               <p>You are in the right; but pray what is that other way?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>I went and found out the Brother of this young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man your Son has marri'd; he is by profession a <hi>Bravo,</hi> one that lives by cutting of throats; he never speaks without an Oath in's mouth, and makes no more scruple to kill a man, than to blow out the snuff of a Candle. I discours'd him upon the Marriage, and found him reasonably inclin'd to accommodate the business for a certain Sum of Money; and provided he may have it, he's contented to suffer a Divorce.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Panc.</speaker>
               <p>What is't he demands?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Panc.</speaker>
               <p>But what?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>Extravagant things.</p>

               <p>Well, let me hear?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing under 5 or 600 Pistols.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Panc.</speaker>
               <p>Five or 600 l evors and Quartan-Agues seize him! he does it to jeer us.</p>

               <speaker>Plaut.</speaker>
               <p>So I told him I wou'd not give ear to such a Proposition, and said that you was not a man of that easy temper to be whistled out of your Money: After a long debate, the result

was this;—I am, says he, in a short time, to go to the Army in <hi>Flanders;</hi> I must be well accoutred, and have need of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which makes me consent to what otherwise I shou'd not hearken to: I want a good serviceable Horse for the Wars, which will not cost less than threescore Pistols.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Panc.</speaker>
               <p>Well, threescore Pistols shall break no squares.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>You must spend a world of Money in Law; you must give the Clerks Expedition-Money, pay for Writing, Drawing, Engrossing, Copying, Sealing, Endorsing, and all several Charges. Then for Fees in Court, Judges Fees, King's Duties. Then, Sir, what's most requisite of all, Bribing of Judges: your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary too does the like. So that after all, 'tis but Cross and Pile who gets the better. O! Signior <hi>Pancrace,</hi> Law-expences are numberless; give this Fellow his Money, and there's an end; 'tis easier to satisfy one Rogue than a thousand.</p>

               <p>Yes, and be a gainer by't. I've cast up what a Suit of Law amounts to; and I find, that giving him 200 Pistols, will save you five; not reckoning your trouble, pains, vexations, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, waiting, sending, fetching and carrying, and following a company of busy Coxcombs, who will but laugh at you when you ha' done.

               <p>Is it not a most horrible thing, a thing that cries to Heaven for vengeance, that it shou'd be suffer'd, for a man pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to cry the form of a Hat?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Panc.</speaker>
               <p>I maintain that a man ought to say the figure of a Hat, and not the form; yes, not <hi>forma,</hi> but <hi>figura;</hi> for there is this difference betwixt form and figure, that the form is the external disposition of animate Bodies; the figure is the external dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of Bodies inanimate: It ought to be said, the figure of a Hat, and not the form. Go-to, Dunce as thou art, this is the truth of the thing, these are the express terms of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in his Chapter of Quality.</p>

Ouff, a Sot, a Blockhead, to dispute against a Learn'd Doctor that can both write and read,—So now the business is over, I desire you'd give me your attention; I come to consult with you about a business which very much puzzles me, I have thoughts of Marrying, to have a Companion in the business of the World; the person is handsome, and I like her very well: she thinks her self a happy Woman to have me for a Husband; her Father and I are agreed: But I'm a little startled at a thing that you may guess—of a blow that a man never feels when 'tis given him.

               <p>Signior <hi>Spittzaferro;</hi> pray alter your positive manner of speaking. Our Philosophy teaches us not to speak any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisive Proposition, but to discourse of every thing with uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, to suspend always one judgment. And for this reason you ought not to say, I am come, but—I think I am come;—or,—it seems to me I am come.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Scar.</speaker>
               <p>That is no good consequence; for that may seem, or appear to a man, which in reality is not.</p>

               <p>The Gentlewomans Brother that Signior <hi>Cynthio</hi> has marri'd, believes that the design which you have to make a Match between him and your Daughter, is the main reason why the breaking off of the Marriage is so much endeavour'd; and he's resolv'd to kill you, to be reveng'd. All his acquaintance of Indigent Officers and Bravoes are enquiring after you, to be the death of you; at least half a score have enquir'd of me for you already.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
               <p>Excuse me, my Sister thinks very well of you, and I
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60147:41"/>
doubt not but she'l be happy in you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Spitt.</speaker>
               <p>No, she won't; I have sometimes strange melancholy Fits, and whilst they last, I am very extravagant; and I'm sure 'twill be too much for her to bear with me in those humours.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
               <p>My Sister is of a very good disposition, and as merry, she'l sing and laugh, and play a thousand tricks to divert you; she'l be the fittest Wife alive for you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Spitt.</speaker>
               <p>Then Signior I have some infirmities of Body too, which will disgust her.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
               <p>That's nothing Signior, a vertuous Wife is never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusted with her Husband.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Spitt.</speaker>
               <p>In short Signior, give me leave to tell you, I wou'd not have your Father by any means to let me marry her.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
               <p>O Signior, my Father was always a punctual man, and do you think upon his death-bed he'l be worse than his word!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Spitt.</speaker>
               <p>Tell him Signior, I dispence with his promise, and I—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
               <p>For never so much, he has said it, and you shall have her, let what will be the matter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Spitt.</speaker>

               <p>See then Signior <hi>Spittzaferro,</hi> what a particular esteem and liking my Father has for you; he told the company that the thoughts of this day revived him, and said, if a Duke shou'd now demand my Sister, he shou'd go without her for your sake.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Spitt.</speaker>
               <p>Signior <hi>Alberto,</hi> I'm extreamly obliged to your Father, for the honour he does me, but I assure you, I am resolv'd not to marry.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
               <p>Your reason?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Spitt.</speaker>
               <p>The reason is, because marriage is inconvenient for me; Ile imitate my Father and all my Ancestors, who could never be perswaded to marry.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cynt.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, nay Signior, you have your liberty, no body as I know will force you against your inclinations. But since tis so, pray go and acquaint my Father with it your self; I have done my message, and am engaged to go ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. Do ye hear Signior, you need not doubt your release; he's one won't impose her on you. <hi>Adieu.</hi>

            <lg>
               <l>THose that were Iudges forty years ago,</l>
               <l>Would nothing but strict Comedy allow,</l>
               <l>And humours drawn exactly to the life.</l>
               <l>The Poet here, with nature is at strife.</l>
               <l>We show'd to day only what's strange and new,</l>
               <l>Where tho the Picture was not drawn so true,</l>
               <l>Yet th'oddness of the piece may pleasure give,</l>
               <l>As that alone makes the <hi>Dutch</hi> painting thrive.</l>
               <l>We in this age, which is so much for change,</l>
               <l>Have leapt the Hedg, and now with freedom range.</l>
               <l>What's naturally witty will not do,</l>
               <l>Unless there's something yet more strange than you.</l>
               <l>If like your selves an airy Fop we show,</l>
               <l>You cry, <hi>Dam-me Jack,</hi> that was stole from you.</l>
               <l>No humor on the Stage will pass for Wit,</l>
               <l>Cause ev'ry day you act your selves i'the Pit.</l>
               <l>In Coffee-House but half the Fool y'expose,</l>
               <l>With talk impertinent, and silly Oaths,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Mall</hi> the Fop at full proportion shows.</l>
               <l>To have you here then were dull Repetition,</l>
               <l>'Twould be at least the fourth and worst Edition.</l>
               <l>Nor can we now any new humor meet,</l>
               <l>In all <hi>Cheap-side, Cornhill,</hi> and <hi>Lumbard-street,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Upon the change, they're formal, dull, precise,</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> most gravely telling Lies;</l>
               <l>Foretelling the success of Foreign War,</l>
               <l>What may portend the <hi>Whale</hi> and <hi>Blazing-Star.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Since they're so gravely dull, aud you so light,</l>
               <l>Our Play we hope may've done you both some right.</l>
               <l>Even in this Play will be some natural touches,</l>
               <l>Whilst you're such <hi>Harlequins,</hi> they <hi>Scaramouches.</hi>
