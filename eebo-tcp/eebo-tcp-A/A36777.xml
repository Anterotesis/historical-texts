            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <q>But what is my Crime, that muſt deſerve ſo hard a Cenſure?</q>
            <p>It is alleged in your Order, <hi>That many Complaints have been frequently from time to time made to the Maſter and Wardens of the Company, and to the Court, by the parents and friends of the young Scholars, of the neglect of the chief-Maſter's dutie in that School, and of the breach of the Companie's Orders and Ordinances thereof.</hi>

               <head>Two things are here objected:</head>

               <item>2. Breach of the Companie's Orders.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. To the firſt I anſwer, That it is very ſtrange to mee, that ſo many Complaints ſhould be made by the Parents of the Scholars, and I never hear of any, nor ever call'd to anſwer one complaint in ſeventeen years ſpace. <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:32523:3"/>But I may ſay as innocently as <hi>David, Pſalm.</hi> 35.11. <hi>They laid to my charge things that I knew not.</hi> I have been in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion 33 years, and in all places wherever I came, I have had ample Teſtimonials of my faithfulneſs and diligence, and my Scholar's proficiency. Religion hath taught mee better than to be an eye-Servant. Beſides, experience of my painfulneſs and diligence, eaſily confute's this allegation: for I have kept the School in as flouriſhing a condition, as in any ſeventeen years from the foundation: and might do ſo ſtill, if I might be permitted to have the ordering of it.</p>
            <p>Formerly I have had many thanks from the Company for my care and diligence, and no encouragement they thought too much for mee: I am the ſame man ſtill: yet ſuch is my unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, that I cannot give ſom men content, do what I can.</p>
            <q>—Tempora mutantur.—</q>
            <p>It is alleged in the Order, as an Aggravation of my Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and as an iſſue and conſequence thereof, <hi>That the School muſt Decay, and that the Decay thereof will tend to the prejudice of the Common wealth in general, and to the great diſhonor and diſgrace of the Company in particular, if the ſame be not timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer,
1. THat, if the premiſſes were true, that indeed would be the Conſequence: but the premiſſes can never be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and therefore that Concluſion cannot follow.</p>
            <p>2. It is to be conſidered what is to be underſtood by the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay</hi> of the School, which muſt thus tend to the prejudice of the Common wealth in general, and the diſhonor and diſgrace of the Company in Particular.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Decay</hi> of a School (in common underſtanding) is, when Scholars ceaſe to reſort to it: which may proceed from diverſe cauſes: <hi>viz.</hi> either for negligence of the Maſter, unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in his teaching, or exorbitancy in his life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the decay of a ſhop is, when Cuſtomers forſake it for want of good wares; or of an handicrafts-man for want of skill; or ill husbandry,

            <p>I have no Scholar now in the School, but what I have warrant for according to your Order.

            <p>True it is, that an hundred years ago, when it was an hard matter to get a Scholar to read <hi>Greek</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there was ſuch an Order made, That no Scholar ſhould be taught in the School, unleſs firſt admitted by the Company. But afterward there was found a neceſſity to diſpenſe with that Order; and ſo it was with my Predeceſſors; which I can prove for above threeſcore years by-gone: They (and my ſelf too from them, untill the laſt year) had ſuch an Indulgence, that did not limit nor reſtrain them to admit quarteridg-Scholars, who did not immediately depend on the Charity of the Company: and the Motto engraven on the School ſpeak's as much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

'Tis ſaid of ſom penal Statutes, that they are like Statute—lace, make a fair ſhow afarr off, but look near up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they are but <hi>cruel.</hi> In point of Divinity, if God ſhould mark what we do amiſs, who could abide?

            <p>I know nothing by my ſelf (I thank God) but, for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, I have been a faithfull Servant, and obſerved your Orders.

            <p>My Comfort is,
That I have faithfully diſcharged my conſcience in my place: That I have mainteined the School in honor and credit for my time, notwithſtanding the ſiniſter prejudice of ſome men: That I have as really and truly honoured the Company as ever any man did in the place: That I have not onely beſtowed pains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but coſt in a Scholaſtick way, the better to furniſh my ſelf for my employment: That I have don that for the School in ſom particulars, that few men in <hi>England</hi> could have don beſides, whereof I ſhall leave laſting monuments behinde me, and I know there be not many that can follow mee, even in that, which ſom men count negligence. And I hope I have don God good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in training up many that are now excellent and eminent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of God's glory both in Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>Howbeit I count it ſom unhappineſs, that, after ſeventeen years ſervice to ſuch a noble Company, I ſhould be condemn'd

for negligence, that I was never guilty off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to have ſo hard meaſure, as to be diſcharged from my place and livelyhood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctâ cauſâ,</hi> and not to be ſuffered to anſwer for my ſelf.</p>
            <p>Yet I muſt lay my hand upon my mouth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and look up unto God, without whoſe providence <hi>an hair fall's not from our heads, nor a Sparrow to the ground,</hi> and conclude; That, If I cannot longer with love and encouragement ſerve the Company<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I muſt humbly take my leave and pray for them; and wiſh that my Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor (whatever he be that is deſign'd to my place) may be more painfull, more diligent, and do more for the honor of the Company than I have don.</p>
            <p>My former experience of God's mercifull providence aſſure's me, that whatever befall's me in my pilgrimage here is for my eternal good. That he can turn the emnitie of men to my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; that ſtill he will accept of my ſervice, in my generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, having fitted me in ſome ſort for my calling: and I doubt not with God's bleſſing ſtill to be, as formerly, a ſucceſsfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in training up of Youth, to his glory, both for Church and Common-wealth.</p>
