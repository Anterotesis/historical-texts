            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>To this Letter I received a large <hi>impertinent anſwer,</hi> dated the 6. of <hi>December,</hi> giving no account of the <hi>cauſe</hi> or <hi>justice</hi> of my <hi>Reſtraints,</hi> but proffering me a <hi>meeting</hi> at Mr. <hi>Ellys</hi> his chamber in. <hi>Grayes Inne</hi> the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday following, about 8. of the clock in the morning, <hi>freely to debate the buſineſſe in a friendly manner, without prejudice to either ſide:</hi> Where I meeting Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> accordingly, he ſeriouſly proteſted to me, <hi>That he neither knew nor remembred the Informers names, nor any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular informations given in against me, whereupon I was thus impriſoned, reſtrained; but he would peruſe all his own papers, and the Books at</hi> Whitehall <hi>with all poſſible ſpeed; and if he could finde any particulars relating to my commitment in them, he would give me a ſpeedy account thereof.</hi> After
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115506:61"/>
which he ſaid, That he had ſundry things in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to alleadge for himſelf in relation to the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt me, which did quiet his conſcience: the ſum whereof (which he amplified with many words) was this alone.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he and the Councell at <hi>Whitehall</hi> (as he ſtyled them) had their authority derived to them from a true and unqueſtionable Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That this Parliament gave them particular inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to purſue, for the preſervation of the Peace and ſafety of their new Common-wealth; which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly purſued according to their judgments and conſciences, without malice or partiality.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That there were many deſperate plots and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies ſet on foot againſt this <hi>poor infant Common-wealth</hi> by the enemies thereof, threatning utter ruin thereunto, had they not been carefully prevented, about and during the time of my commitment, which enforced them to extraordinary proceedings.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That though he knew not the particular grounds or cauſe of my reſtraints, yet he was perſwaded, that it was done in order only to publick ſafety, and not out of any malice, but rather out of a tender reſpect of the Councell towards me; and that he did nought therein but only by the Councels command, which he was bound to obey.</p>
            <p>To which I preſently returned him this anſwer, That I much wondered with what face or confidence he could condemn the late King for a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and yet ſoon after become more arbitrary, unrighteous, and Tyrannicall himſelf in his proceeding againſt me, (his late ſpeciall friend) then ever the King or his Councell were.</p>
            <p>For firſt of all, they only ſommoned me in the day time to appear before them by a ſingle ſworn Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the next day, without any attachment of my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: But he at the very firſt attached me neer mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115506:61"/>
in my own houſe, by a party of horſe, without any ſworn legall Officer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They ſummoned me to appear before them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſuch things as ſhould be objected againſt me: but he attached and ſent me as far off from him as poſſible, to remoteſt Caſtles, without bringing me ever before him; as being afraid or aſhamed to ſee my face.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They when I appeared before them, objected a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular book to my charge, as ſcandalous and offenſive and heard me concerning it before they committed me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But he at firſt objected no particular crime or Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, nor would he afterwards during my long reſtraints, ſignifie any ſpeciall cauſe of my <hi>cloſe impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ent,</hi> though oft importuned by my Letters; which he would have done for his own reputation, and my own or the worlds ſatisfaction, had there been any. And now at laſt he proteſts, <hi>That be neither knows, nor remembers any particular informations given in againſt me for which I was ſo long committed; my papers, records, writings ſeized, and my very pockets, as well as my Houſe, ſtudies, and Priſon-chamber ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacked;</hi> But he will ſeek if he can find out any particulars, which would have been found out long ere this, had there been any ſuch, even ſince my firſt Letter to him in <hi>November laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. They committed me only a priſoner at large, as firſt to the <hi>Tower of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> London,</hi> their uſuall Priſon, neer my friends and place of reſidence; without any reſtraints of <hi>Letters</hi> or conference with any. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t he ſent me to three remote <hi>Caſtles</hi> one after another, every one worſe then another, the laſt near 150 miles diſtant from my houſe and friends; and there kept me under the ſtricteſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints and armed gards; contrary to ſundry <hi>expreſſe Statutes,</hi> and the <hi>Votes of both Houſes of Parliament in my former caſe;</hi> debarring me for a long time <hi>the liberty of Gods publick Ordinances;</hi> which I enjoyed under them. In all which reſpects, after the Parliaments cenſures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the old <hi>Councell-table, Prelates, Canterbury, and his own ſentence againſt the King;</hi> he had manifeſted himſelf a

               <hi>worſer Tyrant then they,</hi> and might therefore juſtly expect as heavy, or a far worſe <hi>cenſure</hi> as any of them ſuſtained, in caſe he repented not of, and gave not ſatisfaction for theſe <hi>tranſcendent injuries.</hi> As for the generall grounds he alleadged, to excuſe or juſtifie his exorbitant proceedings againſt me; I told him, they were <hi>frivolous,</hi> and would rather <hi>aggravate</hi> then <hi>mitigate</hi> his offence before any <hi>Legall Tribunall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the firſt of them I then immediately anſwered, that I much admired, how any man who profeſſed himſelf a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> or ware a <hi>Gown upon his back,</hi> durſt affirme, That about 50 or 60 members only of the late Commons houſe, confederating with the Army-officers to deſtroy, <note place="margin">(a) Modus Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendi Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum.

That to injure and oppreſſe me, who had written, acted, and ſuffered ſo much for the publick ſafety hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was the high way to occaſion, haſten, not prevent their publick damages, and muſt certainly favour of much private cauſeleſſe malice of ſome men towards me, rather then of publick ſafety, or their private reſpects towards me. That I was ſo conſcious of my own <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,</hi> that I neither feared nor declined, but oft deſired a <hi>publick legall Tryall</hi> for any thing he or <hi>his aſſociates could object againſt me;</hi> which I could not attain; and to ſay now at laſt, <hi>that all they did was only out of tender reſpects and favour-towards me;</hi> was a very abſurd and pitifull excuſe; eſpecially ſeeing he profeſſed, he <hi>knew no ground nor reaſon for it.</hi> That <hi>Canterbury</hi> and the Prelates, might have made the ſame abſurd allegation for my former cloſe reſtraints as well as he, and that if himſelf ſhould be ſo long cloſe impriſoned in three remote Caſtles, under ſuch armed guards, and unchriſtian reſtraints as I ſuſtained under him, by me or any other his pretended friends, without any legall cauſe, hearing, tryall; I doubted not, but he would interpret it, as an act of higheſt malice, Tyranny, and injuſtice, not as a ſpeciall favour and tender reſpect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. That himſelf well knew, in the caſes of many late Delinquents, illegall commands and commiſſions too from the King, Councell, or any others, had been frequently reſolved in Parliament, and elſewhere, to <hi>be no excuſe, nor juſtification at all for thoſe who obeyed or executed them;</hi> and therefore his pretended counſels, illegall commands to him, in relation to me, could <hi>neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate nor juſtifie his illegall warrants and reſtraints, in the leaſt degree.</hi> That he was ſorry to hear ſuch poor excuſes from a <hi>Lawyer;</hi> and that he ſhould be ſo far overſeen, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf alone to anſwer and ſatisfie all the <hi>illegall actions,</hi> and exorbitant Warrants he iſſued by their unjuſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
