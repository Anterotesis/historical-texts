         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
Proceedings
In Relation to the TRYAL
OF
EDWARD FITZ-HARRIS,
At the Kings-Bench-Bar in Weſtminſter-Hall,
Who ſtands INDICTED
FOR
High-TREASON,
Which Proceedings were on Wedneſday the 4th. and
Saturday the 7th of this Inſtant May, 1681.</head>
            <head type="sub">For that he by ſeveral Helliſh and
Diabolick Practices, endeavoured to compaſs
the Death of His moſt Sacred Majeſty, and to Subvert
the Government.</head>
            <head type="sub">With the Account of the Subſtance of his Plea, and
the moſt Remarkable Circumſtances that happened,
during the Debates on either ſide.</head>
            <p>ON the <hi>4th</hi> of this Inſtant, about 9 in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Edward Fitz-Harris</hi> was brought from the
<hi>Tower</hi> by Water, ſtrongly Guarded to the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi>-Barr
in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall;</hi> where being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
what he would plead, he delivered his Plea which
was ready drawn up in Writing to the Court, and prayed
that it might be Read, which was Granted; but before the
Reading of it, one of the Counſel for the Priſoner ſtood up,
and deſired that he might be heard a few words, which were
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56969:2"/>
to this purpoſe, <hi>That they had endeavoured what in them lay to
draw up their Plea to concurr with the Law in all points:</hi> And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>That they had taken a view of the Jornals of the Lords houſe,
and the Entrys of the Houſe of Commons, to incert from them what
was material in the behalf of the Priſoner,</hi> and hoped the Plea
was ſuch, as could not be refuſed, and therefore prayed that
it might be Read and Accepted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter which, the Plea was audibly Read, the ſubſtance
of which was, That</hi> Edward Fitz-Harris the Priſoner at the
Bar, haveing been Arraigned at the Bar of a Superior Court, (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi>) and there put in jeopardy of his Life,
he did humbly conceive that he could not be twice Arraigned for one
and the ſame <hi>Treaſon,</hi> nor Tryed in any Court than that where he
was firſt Arraigned, <hi>&amp;c. referring the reſt to a Record that was
pretended to be in the Lords Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Reading of his Plea, Mr. <hi>Attorney-General</hi> refus'd
to accept of it, alledging it was not only nought, but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
frivolous, being drawn up on purpoſe to Queſtion the
Juriſdiction and power of the Court as to the Tryal of the
Priſoner, and to gain time by delay: And farther, That he
had not had ſuch time to conſider of the ſaid Plea as he
ought, by reaſon he did not receive it before 10 of the clock
the Night before, To the laſt it was anſwered, <hi>That ſome of
the People that looked to the</hi> Lords Houſe <hi>were out of Town, ſo
that they could not without much difficulty procure ſuch Papers as
were Material in the behalf of the Priſoner, and therefore hoped that
that would not any ways be prejudicial to their Plea,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>When one of the Counſel for the King ſtanding up, made
anſwer, That the Plea was altogether frivolous, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
for delay to gain ſome advantage on the behalf of the
Priſoner, for at that time they rather ought to have pleaded
to the Matter of Fact, than at all to queſtion the Juriſdiction
of the Court. As to the Tryal of the priſoner, when all
the Judges had unanimouſly declared, That it was in their
power to Try him, notwithſtanding his being Impeached
by the Commons; And farther, That the Plea mentioned
only Treaſon in general, but named no particular Treaſon,
which they ought to have done, that they might the better
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56969:2"/>
have known how to have given their anſwer and ſtated their
Objections accordingly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the which by reaſon of the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Treaſon in general, they could not do, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whether the Treaſon to be mentioned in the Indictment
was the ſame for which he ſtands Impeached by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and if not, then the Debate as to Law muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ceaſe, and they muſt come to Matter of Fact.</p>
            <p>As to a Record ſaid to be in the Houſe of Lords, it was
not mentioned what Record, the which had it been, the Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
would be produced that there was no ſuch Record rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the priſoner.</p>
            <p>After theſe and ſeveral other learned objections againſt
the Plea, Mr. <hi>Attorney General</hi> thought fit to demurr to it,
which with the conſent of the Kings Counſel, he did, and
deſired that the other ſide would joyn in demurrer, which
they accordingly did, but prayed a conſiderable time might
be granted to make preparation for Anſwer, conſidering the
Life of a Man was concerned in it, but that was ſtrongly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by the Kings Council, who pleaded that in this Caſe
delays were dangerous, and that they had had Four Days al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
to conſider on it, and that it was ſo foul a Treaſon, that
if the priſoner was Guilty of it, he onght to have no favour or
mercy ſhew'd him, and that his Life ought to be deſtroyed,
ſeeing he endeavoured to take away the Life of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The Counſel for the priſoner laboured to prove that it was
uſual to give time in ſuch Caſes, and cited two Preſidents, but
were over-ruled in both: by Reaſon they were only Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for Miſdemeanours, and the priſoner for the Capitalleſt
Crime that the Law makes mention of: Then they objected
that <hi>Pluncket</hi> had time given him till the next Term, out in
that likewiſe they were over-ruled. My Lord Chief Juſtice
informed them, that he was Indicted for Treaſon in another
Kingdom, and that his Witneſſes being there, he could not
poſſibly get them over before the Term would be expired;
So that in concluſion, the priſoner had till <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning
allowed him to prepare for his Tryal; when about 8 of the
Clock he was brought to the Bar.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56969:3"/>
When Mr. <hi>Attorney General</hi> gave the Court an account what
more he had obſerved touching the Inſufficiency of the Plea, and that
it was drawn up on purpoſe to endeavour to leſſen the Juriſdiction
of the Court, which ought not to have been attempted: That the
power of that Court was unqueſtionable as to the Tryal of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
notwithſtanding any Impeachment lodged in the Houſe of
Commons, nor could it hinder the Tryal as to matter of Fact; to
which the Counſel aſſigned for the priſoner, pleaded that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
being Impeached by the Commons of <hi>England</hi> in the names of
themſelves, and in the names of all the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> No
Inferiour Court ought to undertake the Tryal, that is, to take it out
of he hands of the higheſt Court of this Kingdom, the which the
Lords and Commons Aſſembled in <hi>Parliament</hi> are declaring, that
ſuch things had been formerly done but that they proved of Fatal
Conſequence to thoſe Judges who gave Judgement in ſuch caſes, for
that it was a Breach of the Rights and priviledges of <hi>Parliaments,</hi>
which ought not to be Infringed, nor did it conſiſt with the Granduer
of the Nation, that ſuch Infringement ſhould be made at this time,
but did confeſs that there was no Record in the Houſe of Lords as had
been formerly ſuggeſted, Inferring that an Impeachment was much
of the nature of an <hi>Appeal,</hi> where the Son and the Wife of any mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
perſon might bring their <hi>Appeal,</hi> and notwithſtanding the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer
had been Tryed and acquitted or after <hi>Condemnation pardoned.</hi>
And that an <hi>Impeachment</hi> is not at the Suit of the King but at the Suit of the
People, and that all the people of <hi>England, viz.</hi> the <hi>Commons,</hi> are his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers,
and therefore the Jury and Judges upon the Bench being Commons
of <hi>England,</hi> they could not ſee how they could undertake to Try him, but
that he ought to be Tryed before the Lords in Parliament, they being the
Rightful Judges to determine any matter at the ſuit of the people; that is,
i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>ſe of an <hi>Impeachment:</hi> In Order to confirm which, many Preſidents and
Antient Records were Cited, eſpecially the Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi>
who being Committed by Parliament for High Miſdemeanour, he moved at
the <hi>Kings Bench-Barr,</hi> that he might be brought thither by <hi>Habaes Corpus</hi> and
Bailed, but it was refuſed him by the Judges then Sitting, declaring they
would not meddle in that Caſe, by reaſon he was Committed by Parliament
during the pleaſure of the King and Houſe of Lords.</p>
            <p>To theſe and many more, the Kings Counſel very learnedly replyed, and
ſtated their Objections to each particular point, ſaying, That no Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
lodged in the Houſe of Commons could hinder the proceeding of an
Inferiour Court, for if ſo, the Juſtice of all Inferiour Courts be incroached
upon, and in time be much beſtraightned and confined within narrow limits;
and notwithſtanding all the Priſoners Counſel had ſaid It was abſolutely in
their Power to Try him; and that the nature of an Appeal was different
from that of an Impeachment: And farther, Since they had allowed, That
the Commons are the Grand Inqueſt of the Nation, whether or no they had
not made this Preſentment for the King? and if ſo, the Priſoner without
any more ado might be Tryed at the Kings Suit, and therefore prayed the
Court that the Plea might be over-ruled.</p>
            <p>To which the Court was pleaſed to Anſwer, That notwithſtanding all
that Counſel had ſaid, they were fully ſatisfied that they had power to Try
the Priſoner as to Matter of Fact, notwithſtanding the Impeachment of the
Commons, that they intended to preceed according to Law, and had not any
thing to do with Matters in Parliament, but this Treaſon being committed
out of Parliament, and the Criminal brought before them, they ought to do
Juſtice, but would not be haſty on them, but would give them yet longer
time, by reaſon it was a matter of weight and moment; and therefore order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Lieutenants Deputy to carry back his Priſoner.</p>
