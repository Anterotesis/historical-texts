         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE to the CHILDREN of the REFORMATION.</head>
            <p>BE not concerned to know whoſe hand it is which holds the Link, but follow the light it gives: Reach your hand to receive this Treatiſe, which marks the ſhore, where the <hi>Ark</hi> of our Reformation, ſhatter'd by a deluge of troubles, may rest; which is a Holy liberty to all and each Perſon to believe or not believe, act or not act as he pleaſes, with a ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, according to the Principles of our Reformation. We generally lament the convulſions which ſhake our Church and State, through the diverſity of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, profeſſed by our ſeveral Congregations; ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies have been applied to bring us to Peace and Conformity; but all have proved ineffectual; ſome of our Doctors judge nothing can cure our diſeaſe, but a General Council or Supream Authority, to whoſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence we ſhould all ſubmit; but this, beſides that it is Popiſh, to grant any human Power for to oblige our Conſciences againſt our judgments in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is but an imaginary Remedy for a real Evil: For, it's not in the Reformation as in Popery; in this there is a ſupream Authority for to convene the Paſtors of divers Kingdoms to a general Council, in our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation there is none; Popery believes it's Councils and Popes <hi>infallible;</hi> and therefore they cannot but acquieſce, becauſe an infallible Sentence leaves no doubt of the Truth; but in the Reformation, all Councils and human Authority are <hi>fallible;</hi> and conſequently
<pb facs="tcp:57062:3"/>
their Deciſions may be doubted of, and we are never certain of the Truth.</p>
            <p>Others judge, the Remedy of our diſeaſe can be no other, but Pills of Perſecution penal Laws, Acts of Parliament, Ordinances of Synods, forcing Men to Conformity; but this has proved not only deſtructive to the peace of the Church but has ſhockt the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our Reformation: for if we muſt believe under ſevere penalties what the State and Eccleſiaſtical Authority will have us believe; then Scripture muſt be no more our Rule of Faith, but the State and Church; which tells me what I muſt believe; and we muſt be deprived of the right and power of Interpreting Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and believing it in the ſenſe we think to be true; and yet our whole Reformation is cemented and was firſt raiſed upon this Holy Liberty; that every one ſhould read Scripture, interpret it; and believe whatever he thought was the true ſenſe of it; without any compulſion or conſtraint for to believe either Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> State, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity, or Doctors, if we did not judge by Scripture his Doctrine was true.</p>
            <p>If Prudence had as great a ſhare in our Conduct, as Paſſion, we ſhould regulate our future by the effects of our past actions; and if we will caſt an eye back to the tranſactions of later Years, we ſhall find this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of Mens Conſciences has produced but confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in our Church, and fatal diſturbances in our State; contrarywiſe, never did our Reformation enjoy more peace, ſhin'd with more luſtre, and held its courſe with more happineſs, than when none was moleſted for
<pb facs="tcp:57062:3"/>
his Profeſſion, but every one had liberty to believe and teach, what Dectrine and Senſe each one thought to be the moſt conformable to Scripture. Conſider the infancy of the Reformation, when God raiſed <hi>Luther</hi> to repair the ruines of the Church; how of a ſudden it ſpred it ſelf in <hi>Germany, France, Holland, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and by what means? Was it not by taking away all conſtraint of Mens Conſciences (uſed then only in the Popiſh Church,) our bleſſed Reformers taking to themſelves and giving to others a Holy Liberty for to teach and believe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they judged to be the Doctrine and true Senſe of Scripture, tho it ſhould be againſt the received opinion of the Councils, Church, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities and Doctors? Look into the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>VI.</hi> then did our Reformation flouriſh in <hi>England;</hi> and was miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly propagated by the Liberty of <hi>Martin, Bucer, Cranmer, Ochinus, Peter Martyr,</hi> and others in teaching <hi>Calviniſm, Lutheraniſm, Zuinglianiſm,</hi> by Scripture as every one underſtood it: Deſcend to the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> then the light of the Goſpel was ecclipſed, becauſe the flock was again Popiſhly compelled to believe, not what they judged by Scripture to be true; but what the Pope and Church judged was ſuch: Come down a ſtep lower to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, then the flock recovering that Holy Liberty for to believe what each one thought was the Doctrine of Scripture, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation gained ground; our ſeveral Congregations lived peaceably; for tho Proteſtancy was eſtabliſht the Religion of the Land, others were not oppreſſed;
<pb facs="tcp:57062:4"/>
nor their Liberty conſtrained by compulſions: Step down a degree lower to King <hi>James</hi> his time; the Reformation held its courſe as proſperouſly as in Queen <hi>Eliſabeth's</hi> time, becauſe Mens Conſciences were not oppreſſed; all Reformed Brethren had full Liberty to believe as they pleaſed; the <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> was the Religion of the King: Look down a ſtop lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt's Reign; his Majeſty carried with a Godly Zeal of reſtraining the diverſity of Opinions, begot by the Liberty enjoyed in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors times, would by new Laws and Ordinances force the flock to an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity of Doctrine; but our zealous Brethren the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> impatient of any conſtraint in affairs of Religion, and pleading for the Evangelical Liberty of our Reformation, for to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing, nor uſe any Rites or Ceremonies, but as each one judged by Scripture to be convenient; they covenanted against his Majeſty and Biſhops; and the Storm grew to that height, that both Church and State were drown'd almoſt in the Blood of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Brethren: laſtly, look upon our Realm as it is at preſent, the ſymptoms of diſatisfactions which you may read and hear in <hi>Coffee-Houſes,</hi> in publick and private Converſations; the ſparkles of Jealouſies, which appear in our Land; the Cabals against our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the animoſity of divided Parties; the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur and complaints of all; what's all this but the ſmoke of that hidden fire of Zeal, wherewith <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> would force <hi>Presbyterians</hi> by penal Laws, to Profeſs their Tenets, <hi>Presbyterians</hi> exclaim againſt
<pb facs="tcp:57062:4"/>
               <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> as againſt <hi>Popery; Quakers</hi> judge both to be limbs of Satan; <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> look on all three, as Children of Perdition; and no Congregation would give Liberty for to Profeſs any Tenets but its own; in ſo much that if you conſider all well, each of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, are as ſevere Tyrants over our judgments and Conſciences, as <hi>Popery</hi> was, and our Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on comes to be in effect but an exchange of one <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Pope,</hi> for many <hi>Engliſh</hi> ones: For as in <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> we muſt ſubmit our Judgments to the <hi>Pope and Church of Rome,</hi> or be eſteemed putrid rotten Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and be ſhut out of Heavens Gates; and ſuffer <hi>Inquiſitions, Perſecutions, Excommunications,</hi> and what not, ſo among us, you muſt believe Scripture as Interpreted by the <hi>Church of England,</hi> or you are condemned by them, you muſt believe Scripture as Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> or you are accurſed by them you muſt believe as <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> do, or you are damn'd by them; and not one Congregation among us, but would Root all the others out of the World, if it could; and we do not fear that danger whereof <hi>St. Paul, Gal. 5.15.</hi> warns us, <hi>If we bite and devour one another, let's take heed, we be not conſumed one of another;</hi> giving us likewiſe a wholſom ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the ſame place, how to prevent this Evil; <hi>Stand faſt in the Liberty, wherewith Chriſt has made us free, and be not intangled again with the Yoke of Bondage:</hi> The World did groan under this heavy Yoke in <hi>Popery;</hi> wherein our Rule of Faith, was Scripture as Interpreted by the <hi>Pope and
<pb facs="tcp:57062:5"/>
Church</hi>: Scripture was kept from the hand of the flock: No man permitted to give or believe any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation or Senſe of it, but what the <hi>Pope, Church,</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> did approve: Our Reaſon, our Judgments, our Conſciences were Slaves under this Yoke, until that God raiſed our glorious and bleſſed Reformers <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Calvin, Zuinglius, Beza</hi> and others: who took a Holy Liberty, and gave us all Liberty for to Read and Interpret Scripture: to believe no Doctrine, but what we judged to be true Scripture: To believe any Senſe of it, which we judged to be true, tho contrary to all the World: They took for their Rule of Faith Scripture, and nothing elſe but Scripture, as each one of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it; this ſame Rule of Faith they left to us, and a Holy Freedom and Liberty of our Judgments and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that any man of ſound Judgment may hold and believe whatever Senſe of it, he thinks to be true.</p>
            <p>This therefore is the ſcope and end of my following Treatiſe; that, whereas our Rule of Faith, as I will prove by the unanimous Conſent of our whole reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church, is Scripture or Gods Written Word, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by each Perſon of ſound Judgment; that whereas by the Principles of our Reformation, no Man is to be conſtrained to believe any Doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Judgment and Conſcience: (otherwiſe why were not we left in <hi>Popery)</hi> it is impious, tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and quite againſt the Spirit of the Reformation, to force us by Acts of Parliament, Decrees of Synods, Invectives, and Perſecutions of indiſcreet Brethren, to embrace this or that Religion; that every one ought
<pb facs="tcp:57062:5"/>
to be permitted to believe what he pleaſes; if you think Bigamy to be the Doctrine of Scripture: If you think by Scripture there is one Nature, and four Perſons in God; if you think <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> to be true; if you judge by God's Words there's neither Purgatory nor Hell; finally whatever you think to be the true Senſe of Scripture, you are bound as a true Reformed Child, to believe it; that it is quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Spirit of Reformation to Cenſure, oppoſe or blame the Doctrine or Tenets of any Congregation, or of any Doctor of the Reformed Church; becauſe that any Doctrine profeſſed by any Chriſtian-Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, whatever (the <hi>Popiſh</hi> excepted) or that ever was delivered by any Man of good Judgment of the Reformation, ſince the beginning of it, until this Day, is as truly and really the Doctrine of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as the Figurative Preſence or Kings Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is. Conſequently <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are deſervedly to be check'd for Perſecuting <hi>Quakers; Quakers,</hi> for murmuring againſt <hi>Presbyterians:</hi> theſe for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives againſt <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Socinians:</hi> All are very good; and you may lawfully, according to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Reformation, believe them, or deny them.</p>
            <p>This Evangelical Liberty of believing any thing, which we judg to be the Senſe of Scripture, though all the reſt of the World ſhould Judge it to be a Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, is the moſt diſtinctive ſign of the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Popery: for <hi>Papiſts</hi> are the Children of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> the Slave; they live in Bondage and Conſtraint to believe any Doctrine, which the Pope and Church
<pb facs="tcp:57062:6"/>
propoſes to them; and if a Learned Man, or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity ſhould judge it to be contrary to Scripture, he muſt ſubmit his Judgment to that of the <hi>Pope,</hi> or be condemn'd as an Heretick: In our Reformation we are the Children of <hi>Sarah</hi> the free; our Rule of Faith is Scripture as each Perſon of ſound Judgment in the Church underſtands; if we do not like the Doctrine of the Pope, Church or Council, we may gainſay them all, and hold our own Senſe of Scripture: We enjoy the Prerogative of Rational Creatures we are lead by our own Reaſon, which God has given us for our Conduct, and are not like Beaſts, conſtrained to follow that of others. We follow the Rule given us by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. <hi>14. He who Eats, let him not deſpiſe him who does not Eat; and who does not Eat, let him not deſpiſe him who does Eat; for God hath received him:</hi> That's to ſay, he who believes, let him not check him who does not believe, as he does: And he who does not Believe, let him not blame him who does believe: But let each one believe, or not belive as he thinks beſt in the Lord: This holy Liberty and freedom is the Spirit of God, for, <hi>where the Spirit of God is, there is Liberty, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>3.</hi> Says the great Apoſtle: The Lord inſpire to our Parliament, that now ſits upon a perfect and new ſettlement of Government and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to follow the Footſteps of our firſt renowned Reformers: To enact that there may be no other Rule of Faith, but that which we received from our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and which is laid down for us in the <hi>39,

Articles</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi>: That is, Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as each one beſt underſtands it, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the Judgment, Senſe, or interpretation of any but the pure <hi>Word of God,</hi> as we understand it: And to enact Penal Laws againſt any ſo bold and uncharitable as to cenſure or blame the Tenets of any Congregation, be it <hi>Lutheraniſm, Presbytery, Arianiſm, Judaiſm,</hi> or <hi>Paganiſm:</hi> Or any Doctrine whatever, that any Man of ſound Judgment thinks in his Conſcience to be the Senſe and Doctrine of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
            <p>Three things make me hope, that this Treatiſe will be welcome to the well inclined and pious Reader of our Reformed Church: Firſt, that there is not one Author quoted in this Book, but our own Doctors, Learned and Godly Children of the Reformation; and this I obſerve, that my Reader may know there's not a jot of any Doctrine here but what is of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mati<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n; and alſo advertiſe our Writers and School-Men, how much they diſcredit our Reform'd Church, by making ſo much uſe of Popiſh Doctors and Books in their Writings; as if we had not great and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men of our own; if we look into our Biſhops and Ministers Libraries, we ſhall meet with Books either of confeſſedly Papiſts, or ſtrongly ſuſpected of Popery; and you ſhall hardly meet in any of them, the works of <hi>Luther, Calvin, Beza,</hi> or any of our own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, if you do not meet ſome Comedies, or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances: If you read our modern Writers, you ſhall find their Books to be ſtuft with Arguments ſtolen
<pb facs="tcp:57062:7"/>
from <hi>Strapleton, Peron, Bellarmin,</hi> and other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Doctors, whereas they ought to take their Doctrine from <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and our other firſt Reformers, Apoſtles raiſed by Gods Heavenly Spirit: Oracles by whoſe Mouths and Pens he delivered the pure and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Doctrine of the Goſpel; Heavenly Fountains, from which we ought to drink the Doctrine of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: Therefore, I have made a particular Study, for the Comfort of my Reader, not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane this Treatiſe with any quotation of any Popiſh Writers, none but our own Doctors.</p>
            <p>Secondly my Reader will be pleaſed with this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, becauſe I do not oblige him to believe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of it: if he miſlikes any Doctrine couched in this Book, let him not believe it; what <hi>I</hi> pretend is, to maintain his Liberty for to believe, or not believe what he pleaſes, and that none can ſay black is his Eye, for believing whatever he judges to be the Sence of Scripture; let all others think of it what they will; for our Rule of Faith, as I will prove, being Scripture as each Perſon underſtands it, who can be ſo bold as to check you for teaching and believing what you underſtand Scripture to ſay? ſome Doctrines there are in this Book delivered by <hi>Luther, Calvin, Zuinglius, Beza,</hi> and others; which our Church of <hi>England,</hi> and ſome others do call Blaſphemies, and ſcandalous Tenets; and their irreverence and arrogance it run ſo far, as to condemn thoſe Bleſſed Men, for teaching ſuch Tenets, and ſay, that they ſwerved from the Truth; and had their frailties, inſomuch,
<pb facs="tcp:57062:7"/>
that many of us are aſhamed to own thoſe great Men to have been our Reformers and Leaders: This is an impiety altogether inſupportable, it cannot be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with Patience, that ſuch Apoſtolical Men, who were undeniably our firſt Maſters of the Reformation, ſhould be ſo vilified and abuſed: Therefore I do prove, that there's no Doctrine delivered by them, but is to be eſteemed and called the Doctrine of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And can be according to the Principles of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church, believed and taught by any Reformed Child: For what is our <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, but Scripture, as each Perſon of ſound Judgment underſtands it? Conſequently what is the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Reformation, but what any Perſon of ſound Judgment underſtands to be of Scripture? Whatever Doctrine therefore <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers judged to be of Scripture, How can you deny it to be the Doctrine of the Reformation, or blame them for teaching and believing it? If you do not like; The moſt, you can in Juſtice do, is not to believe it: But you cannot juſtly ſay it's not the Doctrine of the Reformation, becauſe it's Scripture as underſtood by Perſons of good Judgment: Nor can you in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice blame them, or any other for believing it, if they like it: For muſt not we believe, what we judge in our Conſciences to be the Doctrine of Scripture?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, my Reader will be pleaſed with the ſincerity and plain dealing of this Treatiſe: As much as we are all offended by the diſſimulation and double deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Modern Writers, whoſe aim and ſcope in
<pb facs="tcp:57062:8"/>
the Books they give out, ſeem to be nothing elſe but to ſay ſomewhat, whereby they may be thought to be no <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and nothing is leſs found in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, than the pure and Orthodox Doctrine of the Reformation: And what is to be bemoaned, that you'll hardly ſee in the Houſes or Hands of the Flock the Works of <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> or our other firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, they are hid from us, to keep us in ignorance of the true Reformed Doctrine, and we ſee but <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall, Tillotſon, Taylor, Stillingfleet, Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike,</hi> and ſuch others, whoſe Doctrine is neither Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, nor of the Reformation, but a new compound of both; they do ſo mangle the Queſtions controverted with their Scholaſtical ſubtilities and diſtinctions, as if they were aſhamed to own openly our Tenets, and did endeavour to get the Opinion of moderate ſober Men with the Papiſts, by drawing as near as their Intereſt can permit them to their Doctrine. Ask them if we be obliged to believe the Doctrine and Senſe of Scripture, delivered by a general Council; Our firſt Reformers reſolved roundly that we are not: Nay <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſays expreſly we are bound to gainſay, and work againſt the Decrees of any Council: But our modern Doctors anſwer with a pretty Diſtinction, <hi>There's a a civil obligation,</hi> quoth one, <hi>but no Obligation in Conſcience.

in Fundamental Points,</hi> ſays another, <hi>but not in inferior Truths.</hi> Another will come yet, and ſay they are abſolutely infallible in all Articles, and thus by little and little the Papiſts gain Ground againſt us, and the lustre of our Reformation is clouded by the Cowardlineſs, or Inſincerity, or Hypocriſie of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Teachers. <hi>1</hi> Kings <hi>18. How long halt ye between two Opinions? If the Lord be God, follow him: But if</hi> Baal, <hi>then follow him.</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Calvin, Beza, and our other firſt Reformers were raiſed by God to teach us the purity of the Goſpel: Let us not be aſhamed to follow their Doctrine: To ſpeak, Preach, and Believe as they did: Therefore, I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Doctrine in this Treatiſe in its native Colours, that if you like it, you may believe it, and if any be ſo bold as to ſay, you believe falſe or ſcandalous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, you muſt anſwer; It's the Doctrine of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, becauſe it's Scripture as underſtood by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Judgment, and the greateſt Oracles we had: And if you do not like it, you may deny it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware never to blame or check any other for believing it: This is the Holy Liberty of the <hi>GOSPEL</hi> and of our Primitive <hi>REFORMATION.</hi>

                  <p>The Lord forbid I ſhould think or ſpeak otherwiſe than as becometh a true Child of the Reformation: If you will oblige me to believe Scripture as interpreted by the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Church (the like I ſay of any other Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) and deny the Tenets of all others, what difference betwixt me and a Papiſt in the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Religion? For the Papiſts Religion muſt be no other, but Scripture as Interpreted by the Pope and Councils; my Religion muſt be Scripture as interpreted by the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Church, and no other; my Judgment and Conſcience therefore is as much conſtrained as that of the Papiſt and our Separation from Popery will come to be but an Exchange of
<pb n="1" facs="tcp:57062:9"/>
one Slavery for another; in <hi>that,</hi> our Judgments and Counſciences were Slaves to the Pope and Councils; in <hi>this,</hi> we are Slaves to the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> Church: We became a Reformation by ſhaking off the Yoke of Popery from our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and leaving them free for to believe Scripture as with the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, each one beſt underſtands it; and if we will continue a Reformation, we muſt not ſubmit again our Judgments to any other, but retain that bleſſed Liberty we recovered for to believe the Tenets of any Congregation. I confeſs this Liberty is not allowed by any one particular Congregation, as you obſerve; out you muſt alſo grant me, That it's allowed and taken by the whole Body of the Reformation, for in this whole Body, as it comprehends <hi>Proteſtants, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans, Presbyterians,</hi> &amp;c. One Congregation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves what the other denies, and in any of them a Man may live with a ſafe Conſcience (which you will not deny;) therefore any Man has full Liberty for to believe or deny with a ſafe Conſcience the Tenets of any Congregation: Hence it follows, (and to my Grief I ſpeak it,) that no particular Congregation, be it of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, France</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> has the true Spirit of the Reformation, in doting ſo much upon their particular Tenets, as to think they cannot be as well denied, as believed; and in looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them with ſo paſſionate Eyes, as to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57062:10"/>
check and force others to believe them: You ſhall ſee by this diſcourſe, that the true Spirit of the Reformation is not in any one particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation ſeparately taken from the reſt; for each particular Congregation conſtrains as much as it can, all People to believe its own Tenets: Proteſtancy would have us all to be Proteſtants, and would root <hi>Lutherans</hi> out of the World as well as <hi>Popery; Lutherans</hi> would, if they could, draw all to their own Net; <hi>Presbytery</hi> eſteems it ſelf to be the beſt of all, and would cruſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy if it could: This then is the Spirit of each particular Congregation, a <hi>limiting, confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Spirit to ſome particular Tenets, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of all others; but look on the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Reformation, as it includes all Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Congregations diſtinct from Popery; there is a Holy extenſion of Spirit and Liberty for to be either <hi>Lutherans, Presbyterians, Proteſtants,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing but <hi>Popery</hi>; and whatever any Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation may ſay of another, but all unanimouſly agree that the Spirit of the Lord is in the whole Body of the Reformation; ſince therefore that in this whole Body, there is a Latitude and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for to Profeſs divers and oppoſite Tenets, and that each Tenet is believed by one, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by others; we muſt grant that this Holy Liberty for to believe or deny any Tenets we pleaſe, is the true Spirit of our Holy Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>Sir, you may well perceive by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of my diſcourſe, that I am Piouſly and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably jealous with each particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that my drift is to ſhew that each of them, none excepted, ſwerves from and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes againſt the true Spirit and ſolid Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Reformation, as will further appear in this diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>It's unconteſtedly true that the Rule of Faith of the Reformation is Scripture, as the humble of Heart, aſſiſted with the Spirit of the Lord, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it; for <hi>Lutherans</hi> will never admit their Rule of Faith to be Scripture, as Interpreted by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but as Interpreted by themſelves; nor will <hi>England</hi> admit Scripture to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57062:11"/>
be the Rule of Faith, as it is Interpreted by the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi> but as Interpreted by the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>: ſo that the Doctrine of each Congregation is but Scripture, as interpreted by them, and whereas all theſe Congregations joyntly compoſe the whole Body of the Reformation, and each Congregation is truly a member of the Reformation the Doctrine of the Reformation comes to be Scripture, as each Congregation, and Perſon of ſound Judgment in the Reformation, (ſays the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her 39 Articles) Interprets it. This being an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled truth, what Man of ever ſo ſound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but may Read to day Scripture, as Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Church, and Judge in his Conſcience that Interpretation and Doctrine to be true; conſequently he may with a ſafe Conſcience Profeſs that Religion: Soon after he may meet <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Books, and charm'd with the admirable ſtrength of his reaſons and gloſſes upon Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, he may Judge in his Conſcience, he is to be preferr'd before <hi>Luther,</hi> and ſo may lawfully forſake <hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> for <hi>Calviniſm</hi>; then again he hits upon Scripture as Interpreted by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Doctrine raviſhes him with that decency of Ceremonies, that Majeſty of her Liturgy, that Harmony of her Hierarchy, he is convinc'd it's better than <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it: Then again, he reads the Works of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and convinc'd by the energy of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Texts of Scripture produced by him,

It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore evident that according to the Doctrine and Principles of the Reformation, he may with a ſafe Conſcience change Religions, and be to day of one, to morrow of another, until he runs all over.

as Learned Doctors, who without any ſcruple, changed ſeveral times their Religions: nor in the Principles of our Reformation ought they to be blamed: For whereas our Rule of Faith is Scripture as with the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit we underſtand it, who doubts but we may to day Judge ſincerely <hi>Luther</hi>'s ſenſe of it to be true, to morrow we may read with more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Judge <hi>Arius</hi> his ſenſe to be true; next day that of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and ſo of the reſt: I do not think but that we have in <hi>England</hi> many Abettors of this Doctrine: Alas! how many Biſhops, Deans and rich Parſons do we know, and have we known who were zealous Presbyterians, and declared Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Proteſtancy in our Gracious Soveraign's Exile; and no ſooner was he reſtored, and had Biſhopricks and Eccleſiaſtical Dignities to be given, but they became ſtiff <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>

                  <p>Obſerve the difference betwixt the Papiſts and us, if of a Papiſt you become of any other Congregation, the Popiſh Church Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates you, thou art lookt upon as an <hi>Heretick,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtate</hi>; a <hi>ſtray'd Sheep</hi>; they will not admit you to their Communion, or Liturgy; nay, could they well avoid you, they would never admit you to their Company; and why? Becauſe they are fondly perſwaded their own is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true Religion, and all others to be Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues of Satan; and if any of us will become a Papiſt, he muſt firſt abjure his former Profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion:

But if of a Proteſtant, you ſhould become a Presbyterian, a Lutheran, Quaker, or of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other of our Societies, you are never looked upon to be a jot the worſe for it; we are not a whit ſcandalized at ſuch changes, which we daily ſee; and it is an unſpeakable Bleſſing, with what Accord, Unity and Charity, you may ſee at our Liturgy and Communion, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, Presbyterian, Anabaptiſt, Socinian and Hugonot, all praiſing the Lord in one Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in our Church, none bid out of the Church, none Excommunicated, no previous abjuration required of their former Tenets; and there's nothing more frequent among us than to go to the Proteſtant Liturgy in the Morning, in the Evening to the Prebyterian, eſpecially if our Intereſt or Convenience requires it: Can there be a more convincing Proof that we eſteem it all alike what Religion and Tenets we profeſs? Let a <hi>Lutheran</hi> go to <hi>France</hi>; Alas!

the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and her Epiſcopacy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the others could never defend himſelf by Scripture alone, and plac'd his main Strength againſt them in Tradition, Primitive Councils, and ancient Fathers, all which the other rejected and reproached the Proteſtant with Popery, for making uſe of that Weapon; that if they would ſtick to thoſe Principles as their Rule of Faith, they muſt admit many Tenets of Popery, which they diſavow, that nothing but Scripture is a ſufficient Warrant and Rule of Faith: And I find by all I could ever well underſtand, that's the General apprehenſion, and belief of all the Reformation, that Scripture abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all we are obliged to believe; and is our ſole and only Rule of Faith; and that our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Tradition, Councils, Fathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are but ſhifts of ſome of our Doctors, who being <hi>Non-pluſt</hi> in their particular Engagements, and Sophiſtries, patch the incoherency of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes with theſe rags of Popery.</p>

                  <p>It's not ſo abſurd, as it's true; I'll prove by the Principles of our Reformed Church, by the teſtimonies of our moſt learned and beſt Doctors and Reformers, and by reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that the Doctrine of any particular Doctor among us, has as much right to be called and eſteemed the Doctrine of the Reformation, as <hi>Proteſtancy, Presbytery,</hi> or <hi>Lutheraniſm,</hi> for what is <hi>Lutheraniſm,</hi> but the Judgment of <hi>Luther</hi> a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Doctor againſt the whole Church of <hi>Rome</hi>?

They muſt believe Scripture as Interpreted by the Pope and Councils; have ever ſo much light from God, be ever ſo wiſe and witty, you muſt depoſe your own Judgment, and ſubmit to that of the Pope, Council, and Popiſh Church: To this paſs we are come alſo; we muſt believe the Kings Supremacy, Epiſcopacy, Figurative Preſence, tho perhaps we do not Judge by Scripture it to be true Doctrine; we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by Penal Laws, and and Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to believe them, as <hi>Papiſts</hi> by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition; and why?

                  <p>And now let me anſwer to an Objection you made againſt this Principle in our entrance to this diſcourſe: You objected that many Popiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> delivered ſcandalous and baſe Doctrines, which the Papiſts will not admit to be the Doctrin of their Church, tho' delivered by popiſh Doctors; and thence you pretended,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57062:23"/>
that the particular ſentiments of private Doctors of the Reformation are not to be called the Doctrin of our Church. But be pleaſed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the difference betwixt <hi>Popery</hi> and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation the Rule of, Faith in <hi>Popery</hi> is Scripture, as Interpreted by the <hi>Pope</hi> and Council, or their Church; they will admit no other; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no Doctrin is to be called <hi>Popery,</hi> but what is Judged by the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Church, or Council, to be the ſenſe of Scripture; and if any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor or Univerſity holds any ſenſe contrary to theirs, it is to be called the Doctrin of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon and not the Doctrin of the popiſh Church, becauſe their Rule of Faith is not Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as Interpreted by their <hi>Pope</hi> and Council. But whereas our Rule of Faith in the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Scripture, as each perſon of ſound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Interprets it; whatever Doctrin, or Senſe, is ſaid by any Man to be of Scripture, is juſtly to be called the Doctrine of the Reformation: For example, <hi>Melancthon,</hi> a Man of ſound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, great Learning, and of an upright Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Taught <hi>Bigamy</hi> to be the Doctrine of Scripture; <hi>Beza</hi> Taught the Lords Supper might be adminiſter'd a in any kind of Victuals, as well as in Bread and Wine: <hi>Calvin</hi> Taught that Chriſt deſpaired on the Croſs, and ſuffer'd the pains of Hell after his Death: Why then, let all the Biſhops and Univerſities of <hi>England</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn this Doctrine; let all the Synods of <hi>France</hi>

                  <p>You may believe, Biſhops and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are very needful for the Service of the Church; for they being commonly learned wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Men, and having Wives, they come to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their Wives ſo well, that the good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men come in a ſhort time to be as learned as their Husbands, and as nimble and quick in the Eccleſiaſtical Miniſteries, as they if they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to exerciſe them; as ſome Authors of Credit relate unto us, that a Gentleman of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> writ to his Friend in a Village, (about three Leagues Diſtant from that City,) whoſe Inhabitants were for the moſt part of our <hi>Lutheran</hi> Reformation; the good Paſtor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted his Flock to prepare for Eaſter Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that none ſhould preſume to come to the Holy Table, but ſhould firſt confeſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive abſolution of his ſins: Eaſter Holy days being come, ſuch a multitude flock'd to confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Paſtor could not ſatisfie the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo great a croud; he called his Wife to help him, for to hear Confeſſions, and give Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, in which Miniſtery the good Lady did Labour with great ſatisfaction of the Penitents; but neither the Paſtor, nor his vertuous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort being able to diſpatch ſo great a multitude,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57062:26"/>
he called his Maid Servant, who did work in the Holy Miniſtery with as much expedition as her Maſter. But for all this, the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, France,</hi> and all <hi>England (Proteſtants</hi> excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,) will tell you that Biſhops and Miniſters are not needful, nay that they are very prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>State</hi>; To the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> becauſe this Hierarchy with the Biſhops Court, Surplices, Corner Caps, and other Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries, puts the Flock in mind of <hi>Popery,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it's a perfect Reſemblance; and whilſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſee our change from them, comes to be almoſt no more but to ſubſtitute new Prieſts and Biſhops in their own place for to manage more conſcienciouſly the Rents and Revenues which they profanely abuſed, and that thoſe Rents and Revenues are ſtill in the Hands of an Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Hierarchy, they live in Hopes of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them ſome day, when our Biſhops and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters will come to be as bad Stewards of them as they were, and that the Flock will be weary of them and call back the Antient Poſſeſſors: It's therefore perhaps the Emiſſaries of the Pope do inceſſantly blow in our Ears, how ill our Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Revenues are beſtowed, for to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Wives and Children, Pomp and Vanity of Biſhops and Miniſters, no leſs than in Popery.

Common-wealth, that the King ſhould have thoſe Revenues for to maintain his Fleet and Army, and eaſe thereby the Subjects of Subſidies and Taxes, than that a handful of Biſhops and Miniſters ſhould have them?

How can we live in peace and tranquility in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if our Rule of Faith be Scripture as each one underſtands it. I remember a diſcourſe ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Houſe of Lords, not many Years ago, by his Grace the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know, what it was to be a <hi>Proteſtant</hi>; wherein did <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> properly conſiſt? The Biſhops, who were preſent looked one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and whether they feared the difficulty of the Queſtion, or that for modeſty's ſake each ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to hear another ſpeak firſt, they ſtood ſilent for a while; at laſt the Ice was broken by one, others followed, but hardly any two agreed; and all that the Duke could gather out of their ſeveral anſwers, was, That our Rule of Faith, was Scripture as each one underſtood it, and <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> nothing but Scripture, as Interpreted by the Parliament and Church of <hi>England</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whereupon he concluded, We have been theſe hundred Years very buſie for to ſettle Religion, and for ought I perceive, we are as unſettled n<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The reaſon of our unſettlement hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and at preſent, is the violent efforts, what by Perſecutions, Acts of Parliaments, and other Oppreſſions: what by Invectives, Intrigues, and Cabals of the Church of <hi>Engand,</hi> to draw all to be <hi>Proteſtants</hi>; of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> to make us deny Epiſcopacy; and of each other Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to force us to their reſpective Tenets: And whilſt this conſtraint and ſeverity is uſed againſt Mens Conſciences, it's in vain to expect peace or ſettlement in our Reformed Church: But let us follow the Rule of Faith, let each one believe as in his Conſcience he beſt underſtands Scripture: let us all believe what we pleaſe, and be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo to do, and we ſhall without doubt enjoy perfect Peace and Tranquillity: Believe you <hi>Figurative Preſence,</hi> if you will; let the <hi>Lutheran</hi> believe his <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> if he likes it, and let me believe <hi>no Preſence</hi> at all, if I judge there's none? why will not you permit me to follow that Rule of Faith, which the whole Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even the Church of <hi>England</hi> gives me in her 39 Articles, <hi>Scripture as each perſon of ſound Judgment underſtands it</hi>?

ſame Rule of Faith with our Reformation; for ours is Scripture, as each perſon of ſound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment underſtands it, without any obligation of holding the Senſe of it delivered by <hi>Pope,</hi> Church, Councils, or any other; therefore our firſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Reformers did not care what Senſe of it the Church or <hi>Pope</hi> did hold, when they began to Preach the purity of the Goſpel, but each of them Interpreted it as he thought ſit in the Lord, and ſo purged the Church of many Errours: This is the very ſelf ſame Rule of Faith, which <hi>Arians, Pelagians, Neſtorians,</hi> and others, peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily condemned by <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>Hereticks,</hi> did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and walk by: Each of them Read and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted Scripture, Preached and Believed what Senſe of it they thought to be true, tho' they knew it was againſt the Doctrine of the Church, looking on Scripture alone as their Rule of Faith, without any regard of the <hi>Pope,</hi> Church, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils or Fathers: The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> proud and impatient of any Oppoſition, condemned them as <hi>Hereticks</hi> for not ſubmitting their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to her; for taking Scripture as they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it, and not as the Church and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils underſtood it, for their R<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">

What Tenet have you related of all thoſe which you call blaſphemies and ſcandals, but has been judged by thoſe eminent Doctors of our Reformation to be expreſs Scripture, or confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to Scripture; and ſince our Rule of Faith is Scripture, as each perſon of ſound Judgment underſtands it, and ſince the Doctrine of our Reformation is but whatever any ſuch perſon of ſound Judgment, judges to be expreſſed in, or proved by Scripture, it's evident that all thoſe Tenets are undeniably the Doctrine of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: I ſay then, and will ſay, without any offence to my Chriſtianity, or blemiſh to our Reformed Church, that thoſe Tenets are the Doctrin of the Reformation and may be as ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57062:33"/>
believed by any Child of it, as Figurative Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, Supremacy, or Two Sacraments: and let not any <hi>Bigot</hi> pretend to frighten me from this Doctrine by calling it <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> and <hi>Impiety</hi>; No, it's Scripture, as interpreted by our renowned Reformed Doctors, therefore it's no Blaſphemy: Let any man convince me, that our Rule of Faith muſt not be Scripture, as each perſon of ſound Judgment underſtands it; and he will convince that this cannot be juſtly called the Doctrine of the Reformation; but whilſt that Principle and Rule of Faith ſtands unſhaken, nothing that is taught by any Perſon of Judgment to be the Doctrine of Scripture, but it is to be called our Doctrine, and may be ſafely believed.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, that whoever has any Love for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, will hate the Reformation and its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, if they give Liberty for to believe ſuch Blaſphemies: But, can any Mother be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent to her Child, than the Reformation is to us? ſuch as think thoſe Tenets to be Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, the Reformation gives them leave not to believe them: and if any judges by Scripture, that they are not Blaſphemies, but pure Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and others did, they have Liberty for to believe them. He who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies them, cannot in Charity check them who believe them, nor can they who believe them, check thoſe who deny them, whereas each follow the Rule of Faith, and believe what they judge

by Scripture to be true. And if you or your Church of <hi>England</hi> cry out <hi>Blaſphemy, Blaſphemy,</hi> againſt all that you judge to be falſe, why do not you cry Blaſphemy againſt <hi>Presbyterians, Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> and other Congregations, from whom you diſſent?

                  <p>You wrong the Reformation very much, in ſaying it had not its full perfection in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, it's rather to be thought, that that poliſhing and refining of it in enſuing Years with new perfections, and correcting the firſt draught of it by our firſt Reformers, has been a corruption of it with ſome mixture of Popiſh Errors and Superſtitions: For all Religious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and Pretenders to Piety, are at the firſt beginning in the height of their perfection, and in Progreſs of Years they decline and decay from their primitive Spirit into errors and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of manners: Religious Congregations are not like <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> which by time and experience receive new perfections; but like Chimnies, which grow daily blacker by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſmoke and fire: Witneſs the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church and Law in its beginning, flouriſhing and holy, but corrupted in progreſs of time,

nor any Myſtery of the Trinity of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in one Nature, as <hi>Calvin</hi> believed, with what Juſtice can the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſay a Man does not believe, and live as becometh a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Child, or that his Doctrine and Life is ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous; whereas he lives and believes as he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands by Scripture, he may or ought to do, which is the Rule of Faith of the Reformation, even of the Church of <hi>England</hi>? The Church of <hi>England</hi> ſays, the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctrin of the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> is not the Doctrin of Scripture; that the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Doctrin againſt Epiſcopacy, is not the Doctrin of Scripture; that the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> Doctrin againſt Infants Baptiſm, is not of Scripture; and yet you permit them all to live in <hi>Peace</hi>; you Confeſs they are true Children of the Reformation, though <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from you; why?

                  <p>I will give you no other inſtruction nor anſwer but the pure Doctrin of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which when you have heard, you may determine as you like beſt, what Religion to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace; but know this, that after you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd with your ſelf to believe this or that, you may with a very ſafe Conſcience alter that reſolution next day after, and believe the quite contrary to what you reſolve to believe, if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on better conſideration you think the contrary to be true; this is the liberty of the Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, as I proved in my firſt Dialogue.</p>
                  <p>As to your preſent doubt I anſwer, it's the Doctrin of the Reformation, that it was Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God who eſtabliſht the Church, you may believe it therefore: It's alſo the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the Reformation, that it was not Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God who eſtabliſht the Church: that this is the Doctrin of our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation it's apparent, for it's Scripture as Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by <hi>Ochinus</hi> a man of ſound Judgment, <hi>whom all</hi> Italy <hi>could not match,</hi> ſays Calvin; <hi>In whoſe preſence</hi> England <hi>was happy, and unhappy in his abſence,</hi> ſays B.

                     <hi>Conſidering how the Church was eſtabliſht by Chriſt and waſht with his Blood; and conſidering again how it was utterly overthrown by Papacy; I concluded that he who eſtabliſht it, could not be Chriſt the Son of God, becauſe he wanted providence</hi>; and upon this reflection, he renounced Chriſt and became a Jew. And no man can ſay but that he acted and behaved himſelf like a true Child of the Reformation in ſo doing, for he followed Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as he underſtood it; and as he was a true Reformed Child in forſaking Popery, becauſe he underſtood by Scripture, that the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was better; ſo ſince he underſtood by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scripture more, that <hi>Judaiſm</hi> was better than the Reformation, he acted like a good Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, in chuſing that which he underſtood by Scripture to be the beſt; this is the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Rule of Faith; do you, if you pleaſe, as he did, and you'll be as good a Reformed as he.</p>
                  <p>And if you chuſe to believe that there is a Church eſtabliſht on earth by Chriſt, you muſt beware never to believe or perſwade your ſelf that we are bound to believe her Doctrin, or live in her, if you do not judge by Scripture that ſhe teaches the Doctrin of Chriſt: This is the moſt eſſential point of Popery, an obligation of ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our judgments to the Church, and believing her Doctrin without any more examining, and in this the Church of <hi>England</hi> is much like the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57062:43"/>
Popiſh Church, which by Acts of Parliaments and other ſeverities would oblige all men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve her Doctrin, Rites and Ceremonies: No, God has given us Scripture for our Rule of Faith, as we forſook the Popiſh Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we diſcovered by Scripture her many Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in Doctrin; ſo we are not bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Doctrin of any other Church, but as we find by Scripture her Doctrin is true.

                  <p>It's the Doctrine of the Reformation, that Faith alone, without any good Works, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all Sins you are Guilty of, doth juſtifie you: This is Scripture, as Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Luther,</hi> who ſays, nothing can damn you but Incredulity, as nothing but Faith can ſave you; of <hi>Whitaker, Wotton, Fulk,</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> whoſe words I related in our precedent Dialogue which I believe you remember, and I need not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat.</p>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57062:51"/>
both Kinds, and ſuch other inferiour Truths controverted among Chriſtians; and that each Congregation may in ſuch Articles, believe as it underſtands by Scripture to be true, may paſs, and it's practiſed in our Reformed Churches; But that we ſhould run ſo far, as to have Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by our Rule of Faith to believe or deny the Fundamental and Chief Articles of Chriſtianity, as the Trinity, Incarnation, Divinity of Chriſt, <hi>amp;c.</hi> That Liberty ought not to be given: Our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation very wiſely and piouſly permits the <hi>Lutherans</hi> to believe one thing, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> another, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> another, and ſo of the reſt: And all are true Reformed Children, becauſe each of them believes as they Judge by Scripture to be true: But the Reformation has never given, nor never will give Liberty to interpret Scripture againſt the fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Chriſtianity: We muſt be moderate, and keep our rambling Fancies within Compaſs, and if any ſhould judge and interpret Scripture in favour of any ſcandalous and abominable Tenets againſt Chriſtianity and good Manners, he muſt be checked and not commended.

                  <p>I perceive a great deal of Popiſh Blood to run in your Veins, and that if you and your Church of <hi>England,</hi> were in Power at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our Reformation, we ſhould never have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57062:51"/>
had a <hi>Luther, Calvin, Beza,</hi> or ſuch other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and renowned Reformers. By what I gather from your diſcourſe, I do not ſee the breadth of an Inch's difference betwixt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and you and your Church of <hi>England,</hi> for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not ſtick to grant, that Gods Word alone is her Rule of Faith, but ſo that none muſt believe <hi>any ſenſe</hi> of it, but as ſhe believes it, nor Interpret <hi>any Text,</hi> but receive her Interpretation of it. The Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> has Scripture for her Rule of Faith, and gives us Liberty for to Interpret, Underſtand, and Believe <hi>ſome Text</hi> of it, as each one thinks beſt; and ſo permits <hi>Presbyterians</hi> to deny Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, <hi>Lutherans</hi> to deny Figurative Preſence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and confeſſes they are all her Brethren of the Reformation, but ſhe will give no Liberty at all for to Interpret <hi>other Texts,</hi> but all muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them as ſhe does, or all muſt Hereticks and damn'd Men? No, that Text <hi>My Father, and I are one,</hi> muſt be Interpreted to ſignifie the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty In Nature of the Father and Son, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> believes, none muſt Interpret it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: So that the difference betwixt the Popiſh Church and that of <hi>England,</hi> is, the firſt gives us no Liberty at all, the ſecond gives us ſome Liberty, the firſt robs us of all; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond but the one half. The Rule of Faith in <hi>Popery</hi> is Scripture as Interpreted by the Pope and Councils; the Rule of Faith in <hi>England</hi>; as to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57062:52"/>
                     <hi>ſome Articles</hi> is Scripture as Interpreted by the Church of <hi>England</hi>; and as to <hi>other Articles,</hi> Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as each perſon of ſound Judgment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands it, And thus <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are but half <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and half Reformed, and both theſe ingredients will never make a good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.</p>
                  <p>Let any unbyaſs'd and impartial Man Judge if the Church of <hi>England</hi> proceeds juſtly in this: For if our Rule of Faith be Scripture, as each Perſon of ſound Judgment underſtands it, as ſhe mentions in her 39. Articles; and as the whole Reformation believes, if we are not to be conſtrained, to believe any Church, Council, or Mans ſenſe of Scripture, if we do not Judge by the Word of God it's true, by what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Rule or Reaſon, can the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> give me Liberty to underſtand and believe <hi>ſome Texts</hi> as I pleaſe, and deny me Liberty for to underſtand and believe <hi>others,</hi> as I Judge by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture they ought to be underſtood? I pray ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve well this Diſcourſe; here are <hi>Luther, Calvin, Beza, Zuinglius,</hi> and our other firſt Reformers; they Interpret ſome Texts againſt the Doctrine of <hi>Rome,</hi> and others againſt the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> They are praiſed for the firſt, and eſteemed Apoſtolical Reformers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without any regard of what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſaid, they freely taught and believed what they Judged by Scripture to be true; why
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57062:52"/>
muſt not they be praiſed and eſteemed true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers alſo, for not regarding what the Church of <hi>England</hi> or any other ſays, but teach the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of Gods Commandments, the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of Faith alone, and all thoſe other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets which you ſo much miſlike, ſince they Judge by Scripture that to be the true Doctrine?

                  <p>But you wrong the Reformation in calling ſuch Tenets blaſphemies and ſcandals: For ſince our Rule of Faith is Scripture, as each Perſon of ſound Judgment underſtands it; if this Rule of Faith be good and ſound, if it be Religious and Holy, any Doctrin that is conformable to this
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57062:64"/>
Rule, muſt be good, ſound, religious and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; this being our Rule of Faith and Manners, it's clearer than day light, that all and each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tenet which I rehearſed in all my former diſcourſes, are conformable to our Rule of Faith; for our Rule is <hi>Scripture as each Man of ſound Judgment underſtands it.</hi> Our Doctrin therefore muſt be, <hi>what any Perſon of ſound Judgment under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands to be the Doctrin of Scripture</hi>: This is an evident ſequel out of that Principle, and whereas there is not one Tenet of all thoſe which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed, whether they concern Doctrin or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; but was Judged by the Doctors, which I cited for it, to be the Doctrine of Scripture; it follows unavoidably, that there is not one Tenet of them but is the Doctrin of the Reformation: Therefore you muſt be forced to either of theſe two; either to ſay that our Rule of Faith, by which ſuch Doctrines are warranted, is naught, wicked and ſcandalous, and leads to a proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Conſciences and Manners; or that all thoſe Tenets, are good, ſound, pious, and no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution or corruption of our Conſciences: For, pick and chuſe out the Doctrin which you think to be the moſt wicked and ſcandalous of all thoſe I rehearſed; you cannot deny, but that it was taught by the Author I quoted for it and Judged by him, to be the Doctrin of Scripture. And if no Doctor hitherto had believed it, you or I, or ſome other Perſon of ſound Judgment, may
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57062:64"/>
Judge it to be the Doctrine of Scripture; Either of both, then you muſt be conſtrained to grant. Or that the Doctrin of the Reformation, is not what each perſon of ſound Judgment underſtands to be the Doctrin and Senſe of Scripture, which is as much as to ſay, that our Rule of Faith muſt not be Scripture as we underſtand it, but that we muſt believe againſt our own Judgment and Conſcience, what others ſay is the Doctrin and Senſe of Scripture: Or you muſt grant that all and each of thoſe Tenets I rehearſed, is the Doctrin of the Reformation, tho you, or this or that Man may Judge them to be blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies and ſcandals.</p>

                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:57062:71"/>If therefore the <hi>Pagans</hi> adored the true God under the name of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and the other Gods but as inferior Deities, as the Papiſts do their Saints; was it not unjuſtly done by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers and Teachers of Chriſtianity to have impoſed upon the World, and made us believe the Pagans adored but Devils and Evil Spirits?
