            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Epistle Dedicatory,
TO
All the sincere Lovers of Sion.</head>
            <p>THE Apostle hath an Observation, that <hi>they which sleep,
sleep in the Night:</hi> and the dreadful frame is suited
to the state of ignorant and benighted Souls; but that
they <hi>who are of the Day,</hi> (though they <hi>do not sleep
as do others</hi>) should slumber in the Light, is justly wonderful.
The Spouse saith, <hi>she slept, but her Heart waked:</hi> but the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our case is, that our Hearts are asleep. <hi>When the Son of
Man comes,</hi> indeed, <hi>shall he find Faith on the Earth?</hi> As the
People of God by Persecution have been at their <hi>Wits-end;</hi> so by
the long delay of Deliverance, they are almost at their <hi>Faiths-end:</hi>
and they that have obtained Faith in the <hi>Cross,</hi> find it difficult to
attain to Faith in the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> It is worth a serious Enquiry,
why the Doctrine of <hi>Christ's Kingdom</hi> hath met with so cold a
Reception, especially when as the <hi>time of the End</hi> draws near,
<hi>many have ran to and fro, (i.e.</hi> by comparing Scripture with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
for which the following Discourse is so highly valuable) <hi>and
Knowledg</hi> in these things <hi>is much increased.</hi> Our Blindness, I
conceive, is but too much caused by the Dust that hath been raised
by some who have driven furiously in by-paths; amongst whom I
reckon those most blame-worthy, who have advanced Phancy so far
above Faith, as to run into carnal Notions of sensual Enjoyments,
more suited to a Turkish Paradise, than the Kingdom of Christ:
their Carnality hath made this Doctrine to grate in a Christian's
Ears, to whom one Hour's Communion with God, is preferred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all the Pleasures that the World can afford. The next to these
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59312:3"/>
are they who have drawn, or wire-drawn, strang Consequences from
this Doctrine, to establish seditious Principle and Practices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Powers that be:</hi> whereby some hae gone beyond <hi>the
filthy Dreamers, who despised Dominions and spake evil of
Dignities.</hi> To these we may adjoin some grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and good Men, of
whose Works many have complained, that thy have darkned (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of enlightning) their Eyes; when they have too considently
asserted the personal Presence of Christ on Earth for a thousand
Years: whereas it is not said that <hi>Christ</hi> shall reign with the <hi>Saints,</hi>
but that <hi>they shall reign with him</hi> then, even <hi>as they suffer with
him</hi> now: but especially, when they have retended to determine
<hi>Day and Hour;</hi> and so by their frequent Mistakes and Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments,
have exposed Themselves and heir Labours to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
Let us then take the Doctrine as refined from all this
Dross, and it will appear pure Gold. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nly doubt is, whether
the asserting the <hi>Nearness</hi> of this bright Day, be not equivalent to a
fixing the Day and Hour, and on the same Account dangerous. I
humbly conceive that the Scripture doth ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ndantly make the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
in which we are not only forbidden to pry into Secrets,
<hi>which the Father has in his own Power;</hi> but we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to go by Scripture-Signs: that as <hi>no Man knows</hi> the one, <hi>viz.
the Day and Hour;</hi> so when <hi>we see such and such things come
to pass, all may know</hi> the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Nearness</hi> of it. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be ashamed of my own Darkness and Vileness, that I have
not attained to that Evidence and Perswasion of our being <hi>now
come to the time of the End,</hi> that I know some of the dear
People of God have arrived unto: But I bless God for what I
have seen, and I could wish I had words to declare it to the World,
that they who live in the daily Expectation of the coming of Christ,
are the most lively zealous Christians, that ever I have known or
heard of in these latter Days; the wonderful Impressions which they
have upon their Spirits about it, are soul-ravishing, inflaming their
Hearts with Love to him: They are Soul-replenishing, that they
even overflow and run over in all their Discourse, with the most
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59312:3"/>
affectionate speaking of Christ, and for him; whereby they are
rendred some of the most useful Saints upon Earth: and whereas
all Enthusiastical Opinions are wont to puff up, these Impressions
have tended to make them the most humble and lowly Christians
that ever I came near. As the Generality of Christians are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
these Expectations, so by woful Experience we know how cold
we are in our Hearts and Lives, in our Converse and Families: We
stand in need of the Notes of some <hi>Boanerges,</hi> some such awakening
Discourse as is here presented to you. Though we come behind
other Christians, as to the <hi>Plerophory</hi> they are raised up to; yet
by Grace we are assured, <hi>that the Lord is not slack, as some
count Slackness.</hi> We abhor the Malignity of the Scoffers, that
say, <hi>Where is the Promise of his Coming?</hi> We fully know, <hi>that
he that shall come, will come</hi> (in his own time) <hi>and will not
tarry.</hi> This is enough to rouse us from our Security, and to make
us prize a Discourse that is more than ordinarily suited to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening
of a drousy World: This is enough to make
us more fervent when we pray with the Church,<note place="margin">Form of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the Monthly Fast. A. D. 1690.</note> 
               <hi>THAT
THE KINGDOM OF THY DEAR SON MAY COME
QUICKLY; AND THAT ALL HIS ENEMIES BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING
MADE HIS FOOTSTOOL, HE WHO IS THE
LORD OF LORDS, AND KING OF KINGS, MAY REIGN TO
ALL THE ENDS OF THE EARTH.</hi> Though I am engaged by
Promise to say nothing of the Author, (which indeed is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in any place where his Name is known) yet I take it to be a
point of Justice to him, and to the World, to say thus much of his
Work; that this Sermon was preached in a Country-Church (I am
perswaded) without the least Design of being made Publick, and
that the Copy was written out and sent to the Press (though not
without the leave, yet) in the Absence of the Author: so that the
Judicious will easily believe, with what Advantage it would have
come forth, if it had been on purpose prepared for publick view,
and the Copy had been corrected by the Author's own Hand. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole, seeing the Author has withdrawn his Name; you
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59312:4"/>
must ascribe all the Praise to the Grace and Assistance of our
<hi>coming Saviour,</hi> and all the Faults to the poor <hi>Publisher,</hi> who
having nothing of his own worth offering, is glad that he has credit
enough to borrow such a Piece, to cast into the Treasury: and does
only beg this great Bounty, That when any Souls are raised into
a lively frame by this Sermon, and are blessing God for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
they would also put up one Prayer or Groan for the quickning
of him, who was instrumental of conveying it unto them.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>On St. MAT. 25. 1, 2, to 13.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>Then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened to ten Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
which took their Lamps, and went forth to meet the
Bridegroom.</p>
                  <p>And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.</p>
                  <p>They that were foolish, took their Lamps, and took no Oil
with them.</p>
                  <p>But the wise took Oil in their Vessels, with their Lamps.</p>
                  <p>While the Bridegroom tarried, they all slumber'd and slept.</p>
                  <p>And at Midnight there was a Cry made, Behold, the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
cometh, go you out to meet him.</p>
                  <p>Then all those Virgins arose, and trimmed their Lamps.</p>
                  <p>And the foolish said unto the Wise, Give us of your Oil,
for our Lamps are gone out.</p>
                  <p>But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not
enough for us and you; but go you rather to them that sell,
and buy for your selves.</p>
                  <p>And whilst they went to buy, the Bridegroom came; and they
that were ready, went in with him to the Marriage, and the
Door was shut.</p>
                  <p>Afterward came also the other Virgins, saying, Lord, Lord,
open to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59312:5"/>
But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know
you not.</p>
                  <p>Watch therefore, for ye know neither the Day nor the Hour
wherein the Son of Man cometh.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>HERE is an awful Parable, and it is Christ's Parable;
and surely you should very much desire, that none
of you, nor yours, should be of these <hi>foolish Virgins.
The Door is shut,</hi> some shut in, and some shut out;
either you will be shut in or out. It mightily concerns us all:
And if we would know the meaning, we must have our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Key, Ver. 13. <hi>Watch therefore, for you know neither the
Day nor the Hour when the Son of Man cometh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> The great Question is, What is meant by the <hi>coming
of the Son of Man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. 1.</hi> In the first place, when any one dieth, <hi>the Son of Man
cometh</hi> to that Man. The Body's <hi>Dying-day,</hi> is the Soul's <hi>Dooms-day.</hi>
There is a particular Judgment, and then the Soul is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shut into Heaven, or shut out of Heaven. The Parable
may be applied to this; and this agrees with other Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And the Doctrine raised from it, is,</p>
            <p>That Death to a Saint, is the Soul's Marriage to Christ; and to
a Sinner, is the Soul's everlasting Divorce from Christ.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Son of Man cometh</hi> to judg the Quick and the Dead.
It is an Article of our Belief, that we must adhere to. There
will be a Separation; the Sheep aud the Goats parted: <hi>These
shall go away into everlasting Punishment,</hi> (cry to God, that it
may not be your Portion, nor the Portion of your Children)
<hi>but the Righteous into Life Eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>But the proper immediate Sense is seen by the Context. You
often read of the</hi> Coming of the Son of Man, <hi>in the foregoing
Chapter and the Discourse is continued in this Chapter, St.</hi> Mat.
24, 27.—So shall the Coming of the Son of Man be. <hi>Ver.</hi> 30.—
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59312:5"/>
They shall see the Son of Man come in the Clouds.—<hi>Ver. 37. 39. You
have the same words. Ver. 42, 44.</hi> You know not what Hour the Son
of Man cometh.—<hi>Still the Question is, What the meaning of this
should be? These things are spoken in the Answer to the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Question, Ver.</hi> 3.—Tell us, when shall these things be? and
what shall be the Sign of thy Coming, and of the End of the World?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here are three Questions:</hi> 1. When shall these things be? <hi>viz.</hi>
When there shall not be left one Stone upon another, <hi>in the Temple?</hi>
2. What is the Sign of thy Coming? <hi>What is the Sign</hi> of the End
of the World?</p>
            <p>Our Saviour answers to these three Questions distinctly.</p>
            <p>He speaks to the Destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> from <hi>ver. 4,</hi> to <hi>v. 27.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then to the Signs of his Coming, <hi>ver. 27.</hi> this is carried on
throughout that Chapter, and a great way into this <hi>25th,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
as far as this Parable goes: For in the Application, <hi>ver. 13.</hi>
he is upon the same Subject, <hi>viz. The Coming of the Son of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then in the Conclusion he speaks to the End of the World.</p>
            <p>But of what sort of <hi>Coming of the Son of Man</hi> is it? You must
compare Text with Text, and Place with Place. Turn to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel
7.</hi> there you read of the <hi>Coming of the Son of Man;</hi> (and
I remember not whether the Phrase be used in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
before this place). Ver. 13. <hi>I saw in the Night-Visions,
one like the Son of Man came in the Clouds of Heaven.</hi>—He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to <hi>Daniel,</hi> as <hi>the Son of Man:</hi> and he appeared <hi>coming
in the Clouds of Heaven.</hi> Compare this with <hi>Mat. 24. 30.—And
they shall see the Son of Man coming in the Clouds of Heaven.</hi>—Now
go on in <hi>Daniel,—He came to the Ancient of Days, (i.e.</hi>
to God the Father)—<hi>And there was given him Dominion and
Glory, and a Kingdom, that all People, Nations and Languages
should serve him: His Dominion is an Everlasting Dominion,
which shall not pass away.</hi>—Here is one like the Son of Man
that receives a Kingdom—This must be in this World: for in
the <hi>End</hi> of the World, <hi>the Son gives up the Kingdom to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
1 Cor. 15. 24. Christ has a Kingdom in this World, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59312:6"/>
               <hi>all People, Nations and Languages serve him:</hi> That as <hi>all People,
Nations and Languages</hi> serv'd <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> &amp;c. so now the
People of several Countries shall serve Christ. <hi>His Dominion is
an Everlasting Dominion,—his Dominion such as shall never pass
away,</hi> i.e. not as other Kingdoms have done before. He had
shewn how the <hi>Babylonian, Persian,</hi> &amp;c. Kingdoms <hi>past away,</hi>
but this Kingdom doth not pass away. Now see <hi>Rev. 11. 15.
The seventh Angel sounded, and there were great Voices in Heaven,
saying, The Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdoms of
the Lord, and of his Christ.</hi>—The Kingdoms of the World, are
not in this special sense the Kingdoms of Christ now; but they
become so, when <hi>the seventh Angel sound,</hi> i.e. When <hi>the Times
of the Gentiles shall be fulfilled,</hi> Christ will have a Kingdom in
this World: As the Lord liveth, he will reign here upon the
Earth, and his <hi>Enemies shall be slain before him:</hi> He will cut his
way through to his Kingdom, by slaying Millions of Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
Swearers, Sabbath-breakers, <hi>&amp;c. Here are Thunders and
Ligtnings, and a great Earthquake, such as was not since Men were
upon the Earth; so mighty an Earthquake, and so great,</hi> Rev. 16.
18. Such a Change as never was before. If thou art a Swearer,
a Drunkard, a Devil against the Power of Godliness, repent
quickly, or thou art in Hell quickly; for Christ is coming, the
Earthquake is begun. This <hi>18th</hi> Verse, with what follows,
seems to be an <hi>Appendix</hi> to the fifth Vial, [on the Seat of the
Beast] as appears, by comparing <hi>ver. 21,</hi> with <hi>ver. 11.</hi> therein
<hi>Great</hi> Babylon (<hi>i.e.</hi> Rome) <hi>came into remembrance before God:</hi>
But before this, <hi>ver. 19. The great City was divided into three
parts, and the Cities of the Nations fell,</hi> &amp;c. The great City is
distinct from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and so must mean the Roman Territory.
This <hi>great City</hi> must <hi>be divided into three parts;</hi> this is done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your Eyes: The <hi>German</hi> Faction, the <hi>French</hi> Faction, and
the <hi>Italian</hi> or Papal Faction: And <hi>the Cities of the Nations fall;
Spire, Worms, Openheim,</hi> &amp;c. So the Earthquake is begun;
that issues in the Ruin of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and on the Ashes of <hi>Babylon</hi>
is Christ's Kingdom erected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59312:6"/>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But will it be a Personal Reign?</p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>There was given him Dominion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Dan. 7. and</hi> ver.
22.—<hi>Judgment was given to the Saints of the most High; and
the time came that the Saints possessed the Kingdom.</hi> And, <hi>ver. 27.
The Kingdom and Dominion, and the Greatness of the Kingdom
under the whole Heaven</hi> (mind, this is not Heaven, but under
the Heaven) <hi>shall be given to the Saints,</hi> &amp;c. So that the Affairs
of Christ's Kingdom will be visibly managed by his <hi>Saints,</hi> by
his special Inspiration: And Christ will do that, which no
other Kings have been able to accomplish: They endeavoured
to bring all their Subjects to their <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Perswasion:</hi> But Christ
will sway a Scepter in the <hi>Consciences</hi> of his People. There will
be <hi>Vnity</hi> without <hi>Division, Verity</hi> without <hi>Error, Spirituality</hi>
without <hi>Formality, Hypocrisy</hi> or <hi>Censure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I beseech you to submit your selves to the Word: <hi>Daniel</hi> saith,
Christ comes <hi>in the Clouds</hi> to take <hi>a Kingdom.</hi> Our <hi>Saviour</hi>
saith the same, <hi>Mat. 24.—He will come in the Clouds,</hi> and then
<hi>the Tribes of the Earth shall mourn; i.e.</hi> The Jews shall penitent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mourn, and then Christ enters upon his Kingdom. A little
to prove this, see <hi>Rev. 1. 7. Behold, he cometh with Clouds;
and every Eye shall see him, and they [even they] which pierced
him: and all the Kindreds of the Earth shall wail because of him.
They which pierced him,</hi> i.e. the Jews that have pierced him
with their Blasphemies, as their Fathers did on the Cross. Christ
appears in the Clouds, and the first thing done, is the Call of the
Jews. Christ will appear, (I do not say, He will dwell upon
the Earth, but He will appear in the sight of the Jews;) <hi>Every
Eye shall see him.</hi> It may be you think this is meant of the Day
of Judgment: No; compare this with <hi>Zech. 12. 10. I will pour
on the House of</hi> David, <hi>and on the Inhabitants of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>the
Spirit of Grace and Supplications; and they shall look on me whom
they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him,</hi> &amp;c. Compare
these two Texts together. In one place you read, <hi>The Kindreds
of the Earth;</hi> In the other, <hi>The House of</hi> David, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59312:7"/>
the same. In one place, <hi>They shall look up to him;</hi> in the other,
<hi>They shall see him.</hi> In one place, <hi>They shall mourn;</hi> in the other,
<hi>They shall wail,</hi> &amp;c. Now <hi>Zechary</hi> saith, This is the Effect of
the Spirit of Grace and Supplications. This <hi>wailing</hi> is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the howling of Cast-a-ways, but the penitent wailing of
poor Souls, through the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Daniel <hi>saith, Christ</hi> comes in the Clouds: <hi>So saith Christ,</hi> Mat.
24.—<hi>And that</hi> the Tribes of the Earth shall mourn. <hi>So saith
S.</hi> John, <hi>Rev. 1. This</hi> Zechary <hi>saith, is the penitent Mourning
or Conversion of the Jews, and this is immediately upon the
Destruction of</hi> Babylon. <hi>St.</hi> Mat. 24. 29, 30. Immediately after
the Tribulation of those days, the Sun shall be darkened, and the
Moon shall not give her Light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then shall appear the Sign
of the Son of Man in Heaven, and all the Tribes of the Earth shall
mourn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here you find,</p>
            <p>1. That there will be a <hi>Tribulation.</hi> This goes before the
Destruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> it comes on the Protestant Churches.
Repent quickly.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Immediately after this, the Sun is darkned,</hi> &amp;c. This is an
Overthrow of an Empire, which is of the fourth Great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
[the Papal Empire, the Pope's having the Fag-end of the
Roman Empire.] Compare this with <hi>Isaiah 13. 10. The Stars
of Heaven, and the Constellations thereof shall not give their Light,</hi>
&amp;c. Which signifies the Destruction of <hi>Literal Babylon;</hi> and
here are the same Expressions, meaning the Destruction of
<hi>Mystical Babylon.</hi> Mr. <hi>Broughton,</hi> discoursing with a Jew, asked
him the meaning of the <hi>darkening of the Sun,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Rabbi</hi>
told him, it always meaneth <hi>the Overthrow of a State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Then comes the Conversion of the Jews: the</hi> appearance
of the Son of Man, the Tribes mourning, <hi>&amp;c. Now when the
Son of Man is come, we find,</hi> ver. 40. <hi>that</hi> then shall two be in the
Field, the one shall be taken, and the other left. <hi>Beg, that you,
your Friends, and Children, may be taken, and not left. Here
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59312:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will be a World of People destroyed:</hi> Who shall live when
God does this? Who may abide the Day of his coming? <hi>These
things are at the Door. For further Satisfaction, That Christ's
Coming is to set up his Kingdom, turn to St.</hi> Luke 21. (<hi>I speak
not these things to amuse you, but for the Good of your
Souls, and Honour of our Redeemer) Ver. 24.</hi> They shall fall
by the edge of the Sword, and shall be led away Captive into all
Nations; <hi>i.e. The Jews shall be scattered,</hi> and Jerusalem shall
be trodden down of the Gentiles; i.e. <hi>first by the Romans, and
now by Turks,</hi> until the Times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. <hi>Ver.
25.</hi> And then shall be Signs in the Sun, and in the Moon, and
in the Stars, Distress of Nations, <hi>&amp;c. Ver. 27.</hi> And then shall
they see the Son of Man coming in the Clouds, <hi>&amp;c. Ver.</hi> 28.—Then
lift up your Heads, for your Redemption draws nigh. <hi>Before,</hi>
ver. 24. <hi>he speaks of the Jews</hi> being led Captive. <hi>Now,</hi> ver. 28.
<hi>he speaks of</hi> Redemption drawing nigh; viz. <hi>of the Captive
Jews. Now it follows,</hi> ver. 29, 30, 31. Learn a Parable of the
Figtree, and all Trees; when they shoot forth, you see that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is nigh; so when you see these things come to pass, know ye that
the Kingdom of God is nigh at hand. So that the Redemption of
the Jews is the Kingdom of God. <hi>I should be loth to speak what
is a little abstruse, but who can hold his Peace?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Christ's Coming is to set up his Kingdom amongst Jews and
Gentiles, which will be a glorious time; but dreadful Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
make way for it; which in part is come to pass, as to what
is come upon the Turks. There is a course of Tribulations,
and they run swift: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Surely I come quickly:</hi>
The Lord will be here in a short time; and <hi>every Eye shall see him.</hi>
Happy they that can say, <hi>This is our God, we have waited for him.</hi>
A little before this, all will be sensible of it; there will be a
<hi>loud Cry at Midnight; Behold, he comes:</hi> This will be no Notion
then: <hi>Watch therefore, for you know neither the Day nor the Hour
when the Son of Man cometh. Watch</hi> in a way of Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in a way Preparation, that he may come to you as a
<hi>Friend</hi> in the Day, not <hi>as a Thief in the Night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59312:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Having said this, let us go to the Parable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened to Ten Virgins,</hi>
&amp;c. Here is a manifest Allusion to a <hi>Wedding.</hi> When Christ
comes to set up his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> the first thing is the Conversion
of the Jews, which is called a Marriage in several places. Here
is a Representation of a Slaughter of Christ's Enemies, which is
not usual at a <hi>Wedding;</hi> but at the Entrance of a <hi>King</hi> into a
<hi>Kingdom</hi> it is. They go together: He comes as a <hi>King,</hi> and as
a <hi>Bridegroom.</hi> The Jews <hi>Weddings</hi> were kept in the Night;
the <hi>Bride</hi> stays at home; the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> goes to fetch the <hi>Bride;</hi>
then the <hi>Bride-maids</hi> go forth to meet him; and it being in the
Night, they have lighted Lamps in their Hands; and so go in
with him to the Marriage-Feast. The <hi>Bridegroom</hi> is Jesus
Christ; the <hi>Bride</hi> is the Church of God: What is that? Why,
you'l say, all the true-hearted People of God. It is true, all
God's People are the Church: But if you make this to be the
<hi>Bride,</hi> who are the <hi>wise Virgins?</hi> Are not they the People of
God too? For this and other reasons, I conceive, that tho the
whole Church is Christ's Spouse, yet here is meant a particular
Church: by the <hi>Bride</hi> therefore we understand the Church of
the Jews. There is a great deal Scripture for this, in <hi>Psal. 45.</hi>
in the Book of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Song; especially <hi>Rev. 19. 7, 8, 9. Let
us be glad and rejoice, for the Marriage of the Lamb is come, and
his Wife hath made her self ready,</hi> &amp;c. In this Chapter we read
of the <hi>judging the great Whore;</hi> there is <hi>Hallelujah</hi> for that; then
another <hi>Hallelujah, that the Lord reigns: His Marriage is come,</hi>
which is the Conversion of the Jews: <hi>His Wife hath made her
self ready.</hi> How could she make her self ready? Why, <hi>ver. 8.
To her it was granted, that she should be arrayed in fine Linnen
clean and white.</hi>—The Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> is a Book of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
that sets down things that happen orderly one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
When <hi>Rome</hi> is fallen, then Christ appears for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of the Jews: They put on the <hi>fine Linnen clean and
white; for the fine Linnen is the Righteousness of Saints; i.e.</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59312:8"/>
the Righteousness of Christ put on by the Saints. But why is
this understood of the Jews? For this, see <hi>Rev. 21. 9, 10.—
Come hither, and I will shew thee the Bride, the Lamb's Wife. And
—he shewed me the New</hi> Jerusalem <hi>descending out of Heaven
from God.</hi> This is not Heaven, but something <hi>descending out
of Heaven.</hi> And observe what was written on the Gates, <hi>ver.
12. The Names written thereon, are the Names of the twelve
Tribes of the Children of</hi> Israel; as a Man's Name is written on
his Gate; Ver. 14. <hi>And the Wall had twelve Foundations, and
in them the Names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.</hi> Now the
<hi>Jews</hi> are grounded on the Doctrine of the <hi>Apostles;</hi> so they are
the Bride; Now, <hi>chap. 19. 9.—Blessed are they which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the Marriage Supper of the Lamb,—i.e.</hi> the <hi>Bride-maids.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Parable the <hi>Bride</hi> doth not appear; for therein is
represented the State of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and something that will
happen to them before the Conversion of the <hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi>
are now in their Synagogues blaspheming: but the Lord is
coming to call them; and here is an Alarm to awaken the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins;
The Lord is coming.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Who are these Virgins?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. They are <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. They are Christian Gentiles, <hi>They go forth to meet the
Bridegroom;</hi> they have respect to Christ; so they must be either
Protestants (taking the Word in a large Sense) or Papists.
Now,</p>
            <p>3. These are Protestant Gentiles. Compare this with <hi>Rev.
14. 4. These were not defiled with Women, for they are Virgins;</hi> It
was spoken of the 144000 redeemed from Popery. Now see
<hi>Rev. 17. 5.—Mother of Harlots.—Rome</hi> is the Mother of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots;
Popish Churches are Harlots, and Protestant Churches
are Virgins.</p>
            <p>Now these are of two sorts:
<list>
                  <item>1. Carnal graceless Protestants.</item>
                  <item>2. Spiritual gracious Protestants.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:59312:9"/>
These make up the wise and foolish Virgins: some have only
a Lamp of Profession; some Oil of Grace: These <hi>go forth to
meet the Bridegroom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was, I suppose, when Protestancy became the Religion
of Kings and Nations, and was visible in the World: Rev. 14.
12. <hi>Here is the Patience of the Saints; here are they that keep the
Commandments of God, and the Faith of Jesus, i.e.</hi> the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants:
a People that cleave to the Scriptures of the Old and
New Testament, (called <hi>the Commandments of God, and Faith
of Jesus.</hi>) Now here is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Expectation <hi>of the Saints;
i.e.</hi> the time of their going forth to meet the Bridegroom.</p>
            <p>These Protestants fall asleep; <hi>While the Bridegroom tarried,
they all slumbred and slept:</hi> There they lie slumbering and sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
till there came a <hi>loud Cry at Midnight;</hi> and then they look
for their Lamps, and happy they that have Oil: This speaks to
us all.</p>
            <p>Two things I take notice of:
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Their slumbering:</hi> The Virgins are asleep.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>The loud Cry that is then made:</hi> They that are under the
Midnight-Slumber, will be awakened with the Midnight-Cry.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>The Virgins are asleep:</hi> It were well if it were not so,
but it is so; go where you will, and you will find it so: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
Towns, Villages, particular Persons, they are all
asleep: People should be watching and praying, and they are
asleep. You'll say, we are not asleep. Ay, but your Hearts
are asleep; and 'tis a Midnight-Sleep, which is the fastest; the
World is in a deep Sleep. These Days are compared by Christ
himself to the Days of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> Luke 17.—<hi>They ate, they
drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded.</hi>—Why,
is there any hurt in these things? No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they minded these
things and nothing else: People are <hi>eating and drinking,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i.e.</hi>
carnally secure; they mind their worldly Business, but where is
the Sabbath-keeping, and Sense of a God? They pay respect
to others, but where is their respect to God and his Worship?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:59312:9"/>
O what a dead Sleep is on the Hearts of poor Creatures! We
are got to the Lees of the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> Rev. 3. 1. <hi>To the
Angel of the Church of</hi> Sardis, <hi>Write—Thou hast a Name, that
thou livest, and art dead;</hi> this means us: Not our Fore-fathers,
nor them that come after us, but us that stand here before God:
It's spoken of <hi>England</hi> and this Country, and this Town and
Congregation. This is a prophetical Book, and these are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
Epistles. The Epistle before is to <hi>Thyatria, i.e.</hi> the
Church under Popery: Then comes in the Reformation, and
that is in the Epistle to <hi>Sardis:</hi> Then comes <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> when
the Jews are converted. Now I speak to them that are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
wise: Can here be an apter Character of us, <hi>Thou hast a
Name to live?</hi> Oh! we are of the Church, and for the Church;
<hi>but thou art dead;</hi> they hear, but they are dead; pray, but are
dead; receive Sacraments, but are dead: Dreadful! but true;
there is no Life left: They that have a little Life are sensible of
it. Three things are spoken of <hi>Sardis: Thou hast a Name to
live, and art dead.—Remember therefore how thou hast received,</hi>
(they have forgotten the Doctrines received in the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
<hi>and repent:</hi> noting the Corruptions in manners. <hi>They are
dead in Worship, decayed in Doctrine, defective in Manners.</hi> There
was Life; but what a formal People are we become? Here
has been sound Doctrine, but how has Arminianism overspread
the Land? And for Corruptions in Manners; <hi>O that my Head
were Waters, and mine Eyes Fountains of Tears,</hi> to bewail the
Debauchery of the Land! And since the <hi>Hand of God has been
lifted up</hi> amongst us, People have had <hi>seven Spirits in them worse</hi>
than before; more of Malignity and <hi>Envy at the People of God</hi>
than ever: What will this come to? <hi>ver. 4. I will come on thee
as a Thief, and thou shalt not know what Hour I will come upon
thee.</hi> As the Lord liveth, it will be so: Yea, the wise Virgins
cannot excuse themselves. How canst thou say, thou art not
dead? <hi>Jer. 2. 23.</hi> You'll say, it is our Grief we are so dead.
It is well it is your Grief, then it shall not be your Ruin. How
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59312:10"/>
dead are many with respect to Christ's Kingdom! There are
many Christians that scarce think of it. Others allow that such
a State will be; but if you speak of it in its Noon-tide Glory,
the wonderful and abiding Presence of God, the Immunities
and Priviledges of the Saints, they cannot believe it will rise so

be no more <hi>Death,</hi> (Death being put for Pestilence or Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution)
nor <hi>Sorrow,</hi> nor <hi>Crying,</hi> nor <hi>Pain,</hi> for so saith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<hi>Rev. 21. 4.</hi> tell them of the high frame that the People
of God will be in, when <hi>God himself is the Temple;</hi> you cannot
perswade them of it: and tell them, that all this is near: who
thinks of it? Christ is about it, and he protests he <hi>is coming
quickly;</hi> yet the precious People of God do not think of this.
It is a dead sleepy time. If the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
what will become of <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> It is Midnight-Sleep. If
there be a great Noise in a Room on one side, and on the other,
and a Man asleep in the middle, you'll say, it is a Midnight-Sleep
indeed. How did our Fathers weep over the <hi>Palatinate,</hi>
when it was but a light stroke? But we have had Thundrings
and Lightnings, and we are slumbering. What a Noise is there
in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and we in <hi>England</hi> between them
are asleep <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Ministers come with a Call, to repent, to humble
your selves, (you must be serious, or you'll never be saved);
Call upon Call, and there is no Answer: It is a sign you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep;
put this amongst the Signs that Christ is near. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
say, Christ comes this Night, or Next: <hi>The Day and Hour
knoweth no Man;</hi> but it is hear, when you see such things come
to pass:—</p>
            <p>Such a Blow given the Turks. (<hi>Rev. 11. 14.</hi>)</p>
            <p>Such an Earthquake and Division of the Papal World.
(<hi>Rev. 16. 18.</hi>)</p>
            <p>Such a Conspiracy of two Popish Kings, to give up their
Kingdom to the Beast again. (<hi>Rev. 17. 17.</hi>)</p>
            <p>Such a Tribulation on the People of God, (<hi>Mat. 24. 29.</hi>)
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59312:10"/>
then the Lord will be here wonderful quickly; he comes with
infinite speed; as he lives, he loves; as he loves, he comes;

that he comes wonderful quickly.</p>

            </list>
            <p>And they say, It will be a great while first: but they <hi>slander
the Footsteps of God's Anointed:</hi> He saith, <hi>Surely I come quickly;</hi>
and it was his parting Word. Do you not perceive that the
Lord is about his Work? the World is in that posture, that it
was to be in just before the Appearance of Christ. You'll say,
Why then do not People believe it? Why, they are asleep, and
it is a Midnight-Sleep. But here will be a loud Cry.</p>
            <p>Doct. 2. <hi>They that are under the Midnight-Slumber, shall be
awakened by a Midnight-Cry.</hi> Here will be a Midnight-Cry in
the Land. I beseech you observe it: The Virgins are Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
and Protestants slumbering and sleeping; this is before
the Downfal of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that they are awakened: This thing
will be thundered into the Consciences of drouzy Protestants;
and <hi>they that will not see, shall see.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But what is this Midnight-Cry? See</hi> Exod. 12. 29, 30. It
came to pass, that at Midnight the Lord smote all the First-born of
<hi>Egypt.</hi>—And there was a great CRY in <hi>Egypt,—Here</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59312:11"/>
is a <hi>Cry,</hi> and a great <hi>Cry,</hi> and an awakening <hi>Cry;</hi> and they lie
in their Beds till this great Cry; but then they are called up;
<hi>Pharaoh arose in the Night, He and all his Servants, and all the
Egyptians.</hi> Why did they go to Bed? Because they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
secure, God had told them of it before, <hi>Chap. 11. 4, 5, 6.—About
Midnight I will go out into the midst of</hi> Egypt,—<hi>and
there shall be a Cry,</hi> &amp;c. God speaks this to the Protestant
Lands: There will be a <hi>Midnight-Cry,</hi> and all will be awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
So it will be in <hi>England. Rev. 3. 3. Sardis</hi> represents the
Protestant Churches, and particularly this:—<hi>I will come on
thee like a Thief,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will</hi> come: Who shall stop him then?
It will certainly be so. His Coming will be like that of a <hi>Thief,
sudden, certain, formidable, surprizing. The Thief cometh not but
for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy.</hi> This is, you'll say, <hi>if
they do not watch.</hi> Ay, who watcheth? And mind, <hi>Thou hast
a few Names even in</hi> Sardis, there are but few that escape.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Midnight-Cry</hi> doth signify a terrible Judgment on the
<hi>Protestants,</hi> a great Tribulation, which will be by the <hi>Papists.</hi>
Rev. 11. 2. <hi>The outer Court is given to the Gentiles,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</hi>
You believe that <hi>Babylon</hi> will fall, and you pray for
it. But how will it fall? Why, upon a Provocation that she
will give: Rev. 18. 6. <hi>Reward her as she hath rewarded you, and
double unto her double.—In the Cup which she hath filled, fill to
her double.</hi> Out of this Land will go forth the <hi>Faithful, Called</hi>
and <hi>Chosen,</hi> together with the People of God in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and they will fill to <hi>Babylon double</hi> in <hi>the Cup</hi> she shall <hi>fill
to them:</hi> She will put a <hi>Cup</hi> into the Protestants Hands, and
will be made to pledg it <hi>double.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Cup will awaken the sleepy Protestants. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
saith, <hi>Equity cannot enter,</hi> Isa. 59. 41. therefore an Enemy
shall. Nothing but the Spirit of God can defend the People
of God; for the Slaughter will be grievous. <hi>Isa. 24.</hi> there
you read of a <hi>Desolation,</hi> (no body thinks of it hardly, but)
<hi>God hath spoken the Word.</hi> Ver. 3. <hi>The Land shall be utterly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59312:11"/>
spoiled.</hi> Ver. 6. <hi>The Inhabitants of the Earth are burned, and few
Men left:—and abundance more then.</hi> Ver. 10. <hi>The City of
Confusion (Heb.</hi> Vanity) <hi>is broken down,</hi> &amp;c. Ver. 23. <hi>Then
the Moon shall be confounded, and the Sun ashamed, when the Lord
of Hosts shall reign in Mount Zion,</hi> &amp;c. This is the Key that
opens the whole Chapter.</p>
            <p>The Tribulation goes before the Destruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and
the glorious State.</p>
            <p>Then the next Chapter is <hi>a Song of Praise</hi> for this; Chap. 25.
2, 3, 4. <hi>Thou hast made of a City an Heap,</hi> (this is the Praise of the
whole Church of God) <hi>A Palace of Strangers to be no City.—Therefore
shall the strong People glorify Thee, the City of the terrible
Nations shall fear Thee, for thou hast been a Strength to the Poor.—Thou
shalt bring down the Noise of Strangers, the Branch of the terrible
Ones shall be brought low. Observe,</hi> Here is a <hi>City</hi> called a <hi>Palace of
Strangers</hi> that is ruin'd; the Church doth in a holy manner
triumph over it. What City must this be? There is no City
that is such an universal Enemy to the Church of God, a
Stumbling-block to the Jews, and Plague to the Protestants, as
<hi>Rome</hi> is. Now in <hi>Songs of Praise,</hi> the Church sings to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God, his Attributes and Works; how he carries them on
before they are compleated: So here, the Prophet reflects on
the downfall of this <hi>City;</hi> Ver. 3.—<hi>The City of the terrible Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
shall fear Thee:</hi> It shall strike a Terrour into the terrible
Nations. Now observe, <hi>Ver. 4.</hi> which comes to our Case, <hi>Thou
hast been a Strength to the Poor, a Strength to the Needy in his
Distress, a Refuge from the Storm, a Shadow from the Heat, when
the blast of the terrible Ones is as a Storm against the Wall.</hi> Then
Ver. 5.—<hi>The Branch of the terrible Ones is brought low.</hi> Here
are the terrible Ones that are terrify'd themselves; therefore
before this they shew themselves so terrible. The Tribulation
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59312:12"/>
is compared to a <hi>Storm</hi> and to a <hi>Heat;</hi> then God is a Refuge to
the Poor, and Strength to the Needy: <hi>Miserum est cum ventum
est ad Deos.</hi> We say of such a one, He is ruin'd, if God does
not help him. The Storm is exceeding great on them that have
not a God to save them; such a <hi>Storm</hi> that nothing but a God
can <hi>shelter</hi> a Man from it; such a <hi>Heat</hi> as will burn them to
Ashes, if God be not their <hi>Shadow.</hi> But <hi>God is a Strength to
the Poor;</hi> God's People are called <hi>poor,</hi> especially at this time.
Here will be a <hi>Storm</hi> on the Land, and it will be by the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Ones, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Papists,</hi> and terrible <hi>Papists:</hi> One would
think by such a <hi>Branch</hi> as hath been so terrible to others. There
will be a <hi>Storm</hi> and <hi>Heat,</hi> and the poor People of God are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Refuge. Nothing will keep you but God: See that you
have a God, an Interest in Christ. Compare this with <hi>Isa. 26.
5, 6.</hi> there is another <hi>Song</hi> for these glorious things: <hi>He bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
down them that dwell on high, the lofty City he layeth it low.—The
Foot shall tread it down, even the Feet of the Poor, and the
Steps of the Needy.</hi> Why, were not they all destroyed by the
Storm before? No, God <hi>preserved</hi> them, and <hi>reserved</hi> them to
be his Instruments in the Destruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> a precious
People, that have been trodden under foot, <hi>Called, Chosen,</hi> and
<hi>Faithful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, how comes this to concern us here in <hi>England?</hi> Why,
yes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No Nation more than this. Rev. 17. 16. <hi>The ten Horns
which thou surest upon the Beast, these shall hate the Whore.</hi>—The
Instruments are out of <hi>England;</hi> for <hi>England</hi> is one of
the Horns, as all agree. Here will arise a People out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
hated for Christ's Sake, that are made use of: they are
called <hi>Poor and Needy;</hi> and are miraculously <hi>preserved</hi> by a
God that <hi>shad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ws</hi> them, or else they had been destroyed too.
Here is a <hi>Storm</hi> and <hi>Heat</hi> that destroys a world of People.
How come the People of God then to escape more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59312:12"/>
Why, St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>The Lord knows how to deliver his
People:</hi>—and, he has given his Royal Word for it. See that
you are in Christ, look to it. Here will be a Storm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this
is to be expected every day. This is the <hi>Midnight Cry,</hi> or the
occasion of the <hi>Midnight Cry:</hi> And this <hi>Storm</hi> and <hi>Tribulation</hi>
Alarms the <hi>drowsy Virgins;</hi> they that are <hi>sleeping</hi> at <hi>Midnight,</hi>
(as most are) are <hi>awakened.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>It will be a</hi> general <hi>awakening.</hi> Vers. 7. Then all those
Virgins arose.—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> (Which is miraculous) they will so <hi>awake</hi> as never
to <hi>sleep</hi> more; this would even pierce ones Heart. Some are
kept <hi>awake</hi> by <hi>Terror;</hi> some by <hi>Joy.</hi> We had a <hi>Midnight-Cry</hi> a
Year and half ago, but People are <hi>asleep</hi> again. That was <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi>
but this is <hi>Rumour</hi> and <hi>Violence.</hi> Jer. 51. 46.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> At this <hi>Cry,</hi> All will come to be of one Mind, as
to these things following.</p>
            <p>1. That the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> is coming: That none is glorious
but Christ, and they that are Christ's. They are all sensible
of it now; we did not think it would ever be so, but now we
see it.</p>
            <p>2. They are <hi>all</hi> searching their <hi>Lamps</hi> for <hi>Oyl:</hi> One searcheth
and finds no Oil, or little Oil in the Lamp, but in the Vessels
there is some: but the other looks into the Lamp, and there
is no Oil; into the Vessels, and there is none neither: There
is great searching of Conscience then.</p>
            <p>3. They are <hi>all trimming their Lamps;</hi> this is the scouring
the Lamp: not pouring in <hi>Oil,</hi> for the <hi>foolish Virgins</hi> had no
<hi>Oil;</hi> but scouring the <hi>outside</hi> of the <hi>Lamp;</hi> and this they are
all at work at. It is some outward performance of Duty, that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59312:13"/>
they all agree in. <hi>Gentlemen</hi> leave their Hawks and Hounds;
<hi>Country-Men</hi> their Grounds, and <hi>Tradesmen</hi> their Shops, and
run to their <hi>Prayer-Books,</hi> and <hi>Practice of-Piety,</hi> and all the
Nation is in a wonderful Religious Posture.</p>
            <p>4. They <hi>all</hi> have an high esteem for <hi>Oil;</hi> All the World for
a little <hi>Oil!</hi> Gold and Silver is nothing. We have provided
for such a Child, and laid up snch an Estate: worldly Projects
took up our Thoughts; these kept out Christ and the Spirit:
now these are all cut off, <hi>Lands,</hi> and <hi>Stocks,</hi> and <hi>Flocks,</hi> there
is an end of all these. Oh! A thousand Worlds for <hi>Oil;</hi> Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with Christ, Communion with Christ: Oh! for Christ and
Grace.</p>
            <p>5. They <hi>all</hi> agree that a <hi>Lamp</hi> will not do without <hi>Oil.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they thought a <hi>Lamp</hi> was enough. <hi>We are for the Church;
we'll live and die in the Church.</hi> This is but a <hi>Lamp:</hi> There
must be the inward Spirit and Grace. Thou hast been bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
outwardly, but hast thou been baptized inwardly? Thou
hast been called by the <hi>Minister:</hi> dost know what it is to be
inwardly called? It must be something within that must stick
by you. An Image was made to go<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and do great things by
Springs and Wheels; but one looking in, said, <hi>Deest aliquid
intus, there wants something within.</hi> People content themselves
with Lamps, but what is there within? <hi>I adjure you by the Lord,</hi>
tell me what God has done for your Souls? Tell your selves;
Are you converted? are you justify'd and sanctify'd? are you
not yet in your Sins? You please your selves with coming to
Church, but you must not rest in the outward Work, it will
not do without Oil within.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Of Terrour to the <hi>foolish Virgins.</hi> Are there any
<hi>unjustify'd, unsanctify'd</hi> ones here, <hi>Swearers, Sabbath breakers,
Drunkards, Enemies</hi> to the <hi>Spirit, Prayerless, Graceless?</hi> You
are in a miserable condition: Repent quickly, or you'l perish
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59312:13"/>
quickly. You'l say, <hi>I am young, I may live-many Years:</hi> I tell
you, you have but a little time to be out of Hell, if you do
not repent. Go home, you vain and light Persons, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
else if you <hi>are weighed in God's Ballance,</hi> you will be
<hi>found wanting:</hi> You are a little <hi>Civil,</hi> and you think you are
safe, but you must be <hi>Spiritual:</hi> The Lord is coming to reckon
with the Nation, and with you. These foolish Virgins, what
a Condition were they in?</p>
            <p>1. They are under a great <hi>Conviction,</hi> that they have not
<hi>Oil; Give us of your Oil, for our Lamps are gone out.</hi> Their
Case was bad at first, but they were not sensible of it: they
had no Oil before, but now they cry out, when the <hi>loud Cry</hi>
comes; then they make a heavy ado, that they have no Grace:
why, it is too late, you should have taken notice of it before.</p>
            <p>2. Then their Confidence is dashed; <hi>Our Lamps is gone out.</hi>
Why, cannot you say your Prayers as you used to do? Alas!
that will not do now; for mark, God is angry, and <hi>these are
the Days of Vengeance;</hi> and Conscience cries, <hi>Thou hatest such a
Minister and Christian for his Holiness, and Strictness in his Life
and Family. You had Calls, but you slighted them; Sabbaths,
but you trifled them away:</hi> and now they have no Heart to
pray; their Hearts will be dead in them like a Stone; there
will be a heavy Cry. Conscience is now gagg'd, but then it
will roar; they that were in presumption, are now in Despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
Sinners, will you sell your Souls? have you a mind to
be damned?</p>
            <p>3. Now they would hang upon the <hi>Skirts of the Saints;
Give us of your Oil.</hi> Now <hi>send for</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>in haste:</hi>
Exod. 12. 31. They cared not for them before. I knew a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Man, poor, but good; his Wife was a carnal Creature:
when he lay a dying: Ah, said she, that <hi>I might die with thee!</hi>
Why so, said her Husband; why then said she, <hi>I would hang
on thy Skirts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59312:14"/>
4. All the Creatures cannot help them; <hi>the Wise</hi> have little
enough for themselves.</p>
            <p>5. They <hi>cry,</hi> but it is <hi>too late, Esau</hi>'s Tears: <hi>The Door</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
<hi>is shut,</hi> and they are howling with <hi>Dogs without. Rev.
22. 15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I speak not uncharitably of you, for I know you not: but I am
afraid that there are many here that are but <hi>foolish Virgins;</hi>
you must be changed or damned: Here comes a <hi>Storm</hi> that is
to be expected every Day, and you see what becomes of the
<hi>foolish Virgins:</hi> Oh! cry Day and Night for Oil; for the <hi>Blood
of Sprinkling,</hi> the <hi>Spirit of Sanctification.</hi> Your Time is short,
and your Work great.</p>
            <p>But you'll say, Shall we have no time when the Cry comes?
we'll stay a little, and see how times go; and shall we have no
time afterward?</p>
            <p>I answer, Yes, a little time, but not enough; The old
World stayed to see what would come of it: and they had a
little time it may be, to get upon a House, upon a Hill or Tree;
but it rain'd forty days, <hi>and the Flood came and destroyed them
all.</hi> The <hi>foolish Virgins</hi> had a little time, they went to the
Shops; <hi>but while they went to buy, the Bridegroom came.</hi> Oh
my Friends out of Christ, I wish you in Christ; you have
been desired to get into Christ, but you have not minded
these things; nothing but the <hi>Lamp;</hi> I tell you again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
that will not do; stay till the loud Cry comes, and you
are ruined for ever: There may be a little time, but like a Man
in a <hi>Storm, you'll reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken Man;</hi>
and what, work for your Souls when you are at your <hi>Wits<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end?</hi>
And one thing more: <hi>Rev. 22. 10. 11, 12.—The time is
at hand: He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59312:14"/>
is filthy, let him be filthy still.</hi>—The saddest Words in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
It is a prophetical Book, and now <hi>the time is at hand:</hi> The
providential <hi>Tokens</hi> concur with the Scripture, so that especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in this <hi>loud Cry,</hi> this takes place; <hi>He that is unjust, let him
be unjust still,</hi> &amp;c. I have done with you, your Lease is out,
your Day of Grace is expir'd, you are undone for ever. As
you love your Souls, your Lives, your little ones, <hi>repent;</hi> you
Masters, repent; you Servants, repent; Sons and Daughters,
repent: Do not stand it out till the last: Lie down in the
Dust, and cry for Mercy; I beseech you do, or you are ruined
for ever: you lose all if you stay a little while longer: Get a
<hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Oil:</hi> Husbands, pray for your Wives; Wives, pray
for your Husbands: try what a praying Life will do. You'll
say, I cannot pray. Why, do as well as you can, that God
would save your Life, and the Life of your little ones, before
it be too late.</p>
            <p>To my precious Friends <hi>in Christ:</hi> You are a happy People,
you have <hi>Oil;</hi> blessed be God, you have Grace, <hi>the Spirit of
Grace;</hi> but I fear it is <hi>Oil</hi> in the Glass, not in the Lamp: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
I see when the <hi>Cry</hi> comes, what a <hi>pouring of Oil</hi> there
will be out of <hi>the Vessel</hi> into <hi>the Lamp;</hi> what a lively frame
Christians will be in: <hi>Oil</hi> in the <hi>Vessel</hi> is <hi>Grace</hi> in <hi>Habit, Oil</hi> in
the <hi>Lamp</hi> is <hi>Grace</hi> in <hi>Exercise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. See that you have <hi>Oil,</hi> that you have not your Evidences
to seek.</p>
            <p>2. See that you have <hi>Oil in the Lamp, i. e.</hi> Grace in Act; <hi>If
you live in the Spirit, walk in the Spirit;</hi> if you have <hi>Faith,</hi> use
it; if you have Love, use it: as <hi>Luther</hi> said, <hi>Let them pray that
can pray.</hi> Many a poor Creature cannot pray, they have
hard Hearts, and cannot pray: But you do pray; ay, but not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59312:15"/>
enough. When we expect a dear Friend, we would have
something extraordinary: why, here is Christ a coming; What,
nothing extraordinary! nothing but what is for the Family!
Get your Hearts into a more lively Frame; you have spoken to
one another, now <hi>speak often one to another:</hi> whereas you <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
before, double the File. Do it seven times more, and
<hi>watch; What I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch.</hi> It is but a
little time, cannot you <hi>watch?</hi> as Christ said to <hi>Peter, Cannot
you watch with me one Hour? q. d.</hi> Did I ever desire so much of
you before? I was wont to let you sleep when I was praying
for you, and you slept the better for it; but <hi>this one Hour!
Could you not watch with me this one Hour?</hi> Be less in the World;
your Hearts out of the World, and your Hands less in it: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
your Business; do <hi>not regard the Stuff</hi> so much: Did we
ever say so much to you before? You'l say, when our Lord
spake those Words, the Enemies were coming. Why, so they
are now; it is an extraordinary time. <hi>Luke 21. 36. Watch you
therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to
escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before
the Son of Man.</hi>
