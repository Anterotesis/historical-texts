            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE first time was in the
first Creation, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God made things
there could be no time;
time being a deriuing of
things to such ends,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8990:7"/>
whereto in Gods decree they are directed.
For whatsoeuer is earthly,<note place="margin">What Time is.</note> euen man and the
number of his trauells, with their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
are bound by God to a necessity of
time, beyound which all the power of earth
cannot reach. Their opinion then is both
foolish and wicked, who imagine all things
to happen by fortune, and that there is a
speciall power in the Orbs and Elements
(which they call Nature) by which, both
heauen and earth and euery worke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is directed. And this opinion of Atheisme
is grounded vpon this doubt, that whereas
wee define God to bee the beginner of all
things. It is by them demanded, where that
God had his beginning, and from what hee
discended. By which forme of reasoning
they conclude against their owne vnbeleefe,
their doubting what should begin, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
a beginning, the which beginning is
God, not that God himselfe had beginning,
but that all things had their essence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuation
from him: hee himselfe being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
and without time. For as in the figure of
a Circle, is not to bee found any limit or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8990:7"/>
terme of beginning, or ending: So God
within whose Circle all things bee that are;
in whom we liue, moue, and haue our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is infinite in time, and infinite in all his
attributes.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.</note> This diuine Truth is confirmed
by the sentence of the best Phylosophers,
who (with their eyes of Nature) could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
and distinguish this Truth. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I write to a Christian Prince I will not
therfore strengthen my selfe with prophane
authors, but much rather content mee with
the testimonie of God, whose words hath
sufficient Maiesty to answer all opposition.
By this word I know that God in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 1.</note>
created the world of nothing, there
being no preexistent matter whereof to
make it: and then of the dust of the Earth
made he Man, a most noble Creature, of a
matter most base, and breathed into his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strills
the breath of Life,<note place="margin">The Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Man.</note> a soule so pure and
spiritual as nothing but God could be more,
being the sacred breath which hee himselfe
inspired, whereby our soules (euen after our
fall) yet relish of that diuinity, and whereby
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8990:8"/>
we yet reach our meditation and spirituall
exercise to God who did inspire them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, And to this Man thus made, did
God giue,<note place="margin">All things gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to Man.</note> the heauen, the earth, and all the
beauty of them; For hee himselfe in whom
was the fulnesse of all things needed not
ought that was made, but gaue them to his
seruant Man; to whom hee had made all
things seruants, reseruing Man to his owne
seruice onely. And for this end hath God
giuen Man a Law, which limits him with
strict obedience, and bindes him to the due
execution of such seruices, as may direct him
to his end, which is Gods Glory. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruance
of which Law is called Religion,
the not obseruing it a Rebellion against
God; because thereby wee oppose against
that power that made vs.<note place="margin">The world diuided by Religion.</note> This obseruance
of the Law of God which wee call Religon,
is that which hath deuided the world into
so many disagreements, the which like fire
that deuideth the metttle and drosse, doth
cull out the most approued of Mankinde,
vpon whom Gods decree hath set the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of mercie, and doth marke such for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8990:8"/>
the inheritance of eternall life. Among all
which differences the maintainers of euery
seuerall call it their Religion to which they
chiefly adheare disclayming all diuersitie.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Yet as there is but one God,<note place="margin">One God one Truth.</note> so
of necessity there can be but one Truth, and
but one manner of true seruing that onely
God, and such for me must that seruice haue
as may please the liberty of the Master, and
not the base condition of seruants to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.<note place="margin">The reason of Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions.</note>
And from hence doth arise the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity
of Religions, that men interpose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
God and his seruice, and so denie the
most able and absolute God, both power
and wisedome in the ordering of his owne
affaires. And therefore doe men forme Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
not only diuers, but aduerse to God,
and to his own prescriptions. These wrongs
doth God suffer in his creatures, not by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
but at pleasure, and for the finishing of
such determinations, (as but to himselfe)
are most secret neither ought these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
to distresse any mans Christian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe,
or make him doubt the certainty of
Religion, because of many vncertaine Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8990:9"/>
For Christ Iesus who is the truth and
wisedome of his Father, saith, that he came
not to bring peace (though the Gospell of
peace) but the sword and difference, that
through the firie trial the Saints might passe
to the glory of eternall happinesse.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">The first schisme.</note> The first difference in Religion,
was in the first family, in <hi>Adams</hi> house the
first Man, and that betweene two Brethren,
<hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Habell.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Habell</hi> brought for his
offering to God the first fruits of his Sheepe,
and the fat of them, the which Sacrifice God
accepted. But <hi>Caine</hi> would not offer a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of that value or nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but presents God
with fruit and trash, which God would not
accept. And this conceiued in <hi>Caine,</hi> an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious
emulation against his brother <hi>Habell,</hi>
which wanting grace to moderate, grew to
the highest degree of Enuie, whose nature is
to feede on blood, for so did enuious <hi>Caine</hi>
vpon the blood of vertuous <hi>Habell.</hi> This
<hi>Caine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 8. Caine the Father of Scisme.</note> this first man of blood, is a Father to
all them that loue difference, especially in
Religion, and their Religion (of all others)
is neerest <hi>Caines</hi> that staine their profession
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8990:9"/>
and themselues with blood, especially with
the blood of righteous <hi>Habells.</hi> For God is
the God of mercie and not of misery, and
his delight is in the good, and not in the
blood of the righteous.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">The first al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of Time.</note> In this generation of <hi>Adam</hi> was
the first alteration of Time. For God created
all things good, and in purity hee formed
them; but Man made them euill, and by sin
deformed them. For when sinne en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>red our
Natures, then Man and the Creatures God
had giuen him indured alteration, and lost
that name of Goodnesse, God gaue them in
their Creation. So that nothing is now (in
his owne Nature,) Good, but onely by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
and Gods act, because by sin Man
hath spread corruption (like Leprosie) ouer
all the generations of Earth, and hath made
an alteration of times, and a difference in
the Natures of things, which had not beene,
but for the curse of sinne, which hath alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their propertie, and made them subiect
to euil change, which otherwise should haue
had perpetuity of happinesse.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, And as Riuers the longer they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8990:10"/>
runne, the larger they spread themselues, so
sinne and the euill thereof,<note place="margin">Time the worse for time.</note> for the times that
are, are much worse, then the times that
were: as may appeare; if we compare times,
and descend from these beginnings to a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
processe. In the beginning, among three
men two were good, and then the greater
number were the better, but in the time
of <hi>Noah,</hi> among a world of people, God
found not a righteous man, but onely one
<hi>Noah;</hi> and then the better number was by
much the lesse. At this time God looked
downe from heauen, and beheld the earth
how it was deformed with sinne, therefore
he resolues to wash iniquity from the face of
the earth,<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 13.</note> and to bring a generall destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vpon all flesh. In which Iudgement his
mercy saued <hi>Noah</hi> onely and his Family. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Flood, when God had thus clensed
the earth, yet found he in Mans nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence
and a pronenesse to euill, the
which grew vp with time to a maruellous
strength; for as the generation of men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large,
the generation of sinne doth much
more inlarge, spreading it selfe ouer all the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8990:10"/>
earth, and begetting in this new generation
of men, new and vnknowne inuentions of
euill, whereby they exceeded their euill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors
both in the number, and quallity
of their euills. For at this time popularity
and greatnesse began to be affected, and the
desire of Empire,<note place="margin">The first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</note> in ambi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ious and proud
spirits made men so audaciously proud, that
they durst dare heauen and giue God the
challenge. And at this time and not before,
was there vse of Pollicie, to contriue this or
that euill, to steale, murther, waste, vsurpe
and depopulate whole Kingdomes.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, This alteration of manners,
occasioned a strange alteration in the state
of things, for these differences did reach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
particular quarrells, euen to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
of whole states; whereby it came to
passe, that one kingdome deuoured ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and one people did subiugate many. As
the <hi>Assyrians</hi> first,<note place="margin">The foure Monarchies.</note> who erected the first Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie
vnder <hi>Ninus</hi> and <hi>Simeramis,</hi> the
<hi>Parsians</hi> vnder <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the <hi>Macedonians</hi> vnder
<hi>Alexander,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> vnder the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
&amp; Conquests of <hi>Iulius Caes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r.</hi> yet
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8990:11"/>
all these haue had their alterations and haue
indured the misery of Conquest, euen by
such whom they reputed for barbarous and
base people.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, The generall care that was had
of these worldly occasions, was the cause
that Religion was scarce knowne, &amp; not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded:
&amp; therfore the Church then,<note place="margin">The state of the Church in the old world.</note> excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not the number of some few families,
being translated from one holy Man to anot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
such as were <hi>Abraham, Lot,</hi> and <hi>Iob;</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the time of the twelue <hi>Patriakes,</hi> when
it began to spread into a holy generation;
and after the afflictions of Egypt and the
wildernesse it came to a flourishing and
princely state, especially in the times of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
and <hi>Salomon</hi> Kings of Israell; but not
long after in <hi>Reobohams</hi> time, tenne parts of
twelue fell backe from Religion, and became
Apostates; yea, and many times that little
<hi>Iuda,</hi> that handfull of Gods people, being
drunke with ease and prosperity, would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
God their mighty deliuerer, forget his
Sabbath and his Sanctuary, and giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to Idolatrous pleasures, with such ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8990:11"/>
appetite, as if God had giuen them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
for wickednesse, no apparance or
marke of Religion in <hi>Iuda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tenthly,<note place="margin">Gods Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doe correct and not destroy.</note> The mercifull God willing to
cure the infirmity of those times, commeth
with his Iudgements, Famine, Sword and
Pestilence, (not as in the old world to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy)
but to correct the disobedience of his
people; who no sooner relish the sweetnesse
of his mercy, but wantonly returne to their
former remisnesse, and sinne with greater
appetite then before: yet for all this doth
not God forget to be mercifull, but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
himselfe in his owne nature a God most
mercifull, and most compassionate; who to
demonstrate the infinite degree of his loue
to his seruant Man, taketh from him the
burthen some condition of the Law, which
hee could not keepe, and giueth him a new
couenant, the couenant of Grace the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell

               <p>Eleuenthly,<note place="margin">The happie alteration of time.</note> Heere was the greatest alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that euer was in the witnesse of time,
for before this we were commanded, to doe
and liue, else to die: but now to beleeue one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and liue. Neuer was there a more large
demonstration of Gods fauour; nor a like
time, wherein Grace was so freely offered, or
the gates of heauen so wide set open; as if
God should reach his hand of mercy to
earth,<note place="margin">How God doth inuite men to their Saluation.</note> to inuite vs to his eternal inheritance,
and (with the fayrest promises of Loue) to
allure vs to a state of most absolute blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
yet notwithstanding all this Grace,
and all these faire inuitements, so constant
were the men of those times in their euills,
that they refuse to indent with God, be the
condition neuer so easie, or his promise ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so absolute: but they combine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
with all indeauour to resist the Grace
of God; they will not haue Grace though
God giue it freely; they are all <hi>Moses</hi> no
<hi>Christ,</hi> all <hi>Law</hi> no <hi>Gospell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> so powerfull were
they in their owne opinions, as if the Law
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8990:12"/>
had beene an easie performance; And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did they despise the work of Grace, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying
the Lord of Life, that brought it, and
that bought it with the value of his life; a
price inestimable, killing also the <hi>Apostles</hi> his
faithfull witnesses, and persecuting the
<hi>Saints,</hi> to whom God gaue Grace to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
this Mistery.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, Heere may a Christian man
spend his holy meditations in considering
the deprauednesse of Man, the grosse dulnes
of his Nature, and how inclinable hee is to
all euill. Contrariwise the infinite measure
of Gods mercie; who notwithstanding our
disobedience, will not vtterly destroy vs his
creatures, but in a wonderfull degree of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
yeelds himselfe to the weakenesse of
our flesh, knowing that our nature hath a
pronenesse to euill onely: And therefore
hath he giuen free passage to the Gospell,
making it fruitfully prosper in the blood of
holy Martyrs, shed in the persecuting times
of Tyrants and wicked-Emperors.</p>
               <p>13. And in this passage of blood did Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
march vntill the time of <hi>Constantine</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:8990:13"/>
the Great,<note place="margin">Religion did liue in death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> who intertaining the Christian
Faith with good affection gaue it warrant for

the knowne world with such admirable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
as God onely could giue to a cause
so heauenly.<note place="margin">The cause of scisme in Christian Religion.</note> And yet in the height of this
prosperity, (according to the Nature of our
flesh) the state of Christendome grew
proud, with good successe, and wanting the
opposition of heathen enemies, deuided
themselues into heresies and factions, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
insewed the greatest calamitie that could
be in a Christian state, euery faction recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
authority and greatnesse, according as
they were fauoured or not by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
               <p>14. And this diuersity of fortune con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in Christendome for many yeares,
yet so as Christianity might be well said to
flourish, vntil the time that the <hi>Popes</hi> did ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
to their seate supremacy and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
power (or as the History of Florence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
it) vntill the time of <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Pip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin</hi>
Kings of France,<note place="margin">The Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the French.</note> who in pollicie to secure
to them and theirs the possession of the west

Empire, bound the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> (whose
authority might helpe that practise) by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
and friendly entertainements to their
faction. And therefore did the French pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
this sentence. That the <hi>Pope</hi> being
the <hi>Vicar</hi> of Christ, ought not to bee iudged
by men, but to Iudge all men and to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
euery difference. This sentence (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the <hi>Popes</hi> themselues, or by their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourites,
the French Kings,) was assuredly
the Ladder for the <hi>Popes</hi> ambition, and the
cause whereof hath ensued so much euill to
the state of the Catholike Church, as that
Christendome yet is full of the markes of
that misery.</p>
               <p>15. Now the power of God that seeth the
most secret practice on Earth, whose proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
cannot bee preuented with pollicie,
suffers the measure of this euill time to fill
and ouerrunne with iniquity; so that a true
Christian might haue thought of himselfe,
as <hi>Elias,</hi> when he thought he was onely left
of Gods people: yet in that height of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
there wanted not many <hi>Obediahs,</hi> who
hid the faithfull from the stroake of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8990:14"/>
neither wanted there some euen in this
darkenesse of Time, who willingly offered
their faith to the tryall of fire, and sealed the
testimonie of their Religion, with the witnes
of their blood.</p>

                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Pollitique.</note> Here hence also we may note
the instability of earthly things; and how
that Soueraignty, and Empire (the polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
ends and the extremities of mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours)
are built vpon vncertainties, and
most vnconstant turnings, the which false
foundation, hath suddenly cast downe, what
many yeares, much studie, and many mens
labours had erected. Therefore is that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Pollicie, not altogether without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that <hi>Authority and Greatnesse of State re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth
strength by discords and Faction.</hi> For it is
both the nature of things and the trauell of
men to indeauour alterations, and to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
things from the present condition
wherein they are, for from this cause all Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires
haue had their beginning strength,
and death.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Morall.</note> It is a Morall respect, that in our
constructions we Iudge not properties by
externall euidence only, for vertue and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8990:15"/>
is not giuen by Suffrage, because it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
included in the farre inferior number,
and is often banished to pouerty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
fortune.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, For as it is no proofe of truth to
produce multiplicitie of witnesses, where
there is a necessary relation to fauour. So
vertues and morall deserts, are not Iudged
by common examples or opinions, because
both the one and other are not free and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,
but forced on vs by the grosse and
palpable flatteries of our infirmities.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, It is also a morall institution that
men should somewhat disgrace themselues
in their owne dignities, not that their actions
may indure disgrace, but that their owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
exceede not in their owne estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which error doth often make the most
fortunate most wretched; For if kingdomes,
Empires, and the Catholike Church haue
indured bad alterations. Let no man dare to
secure himselfe in their vncertainties.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST, there is not in this last
age of the world any thing
more admirable, or that better
doth merit the memorie of
writing, then the reformation of Christian
Religion, reducing it to that purity of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
wherein it was first deliuered. And
this in a double respect deserueth euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
memorie. First, the worthinesse of the
act it selfe, being the restoring of Religion
to the purity of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> whereby so much
good doth redound to the state of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8990:16"/>
as that greater cannot. Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the key that doth open the passage to
happinesse, and the Ladder by which wee
ascend the presence of God and holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
whereby we are interessed into Gods
fauour, and without which it is impossible
to please God. It is admirable also in respect
of the manner and meanes, whereby this
worke was wrought, being directed by the
speciall power of Gods prouidence, to the
admiration of al them that truly consider it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Religion.</note> For the <hi>Act</hi> it selfe, all the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the world are in controuersie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(thereby) Religion was deformed, or
reformed. To both which opinions many

and onely tie my selfe to relate the
manner how Christian Religion was refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:<note place="margin">How Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note>
and (in speciall) how by the Crowne

(in the highest degrees of honour and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation)

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The first oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the alteration of Religion.</note> The first occasion hereof was in
the time of <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> who by his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in preaching and writing had got
great estimation in <hi>Germany,</hi> especially with
the <hi>Duke of Saxonie,</hi> because in his teaching
he opposed the vsurped authority of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and for detesting those grosse heresies,
which by long continuance in the Church,
had gotten a generall allowance,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luthers</hi> Booke de Captiuitate Babyl.</note> among
(almost all men.) This <hi>Luther</hi> writ a booke,
entituled, <hi>de captiuitate Babylonica</hi> so offensiue
to the state of <hi>Papacie,</hi> as the <hi>Pope</hi> and all his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8990:17"/>
speciall fauourites, were therewith very
much displeased. Whereupon King <hi>Henery</hi>
the Eighth (whether of his owne accord,<note place="margin">K. <hi>Henery</hi> the Eighth against <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  </note> or
by the perswasion of others, I know not) writ
against <hi>Luther,</hi> and in speciall against that
booke of his <hi>de Capt. Babil.</hi> in defence
of the <hi>Popes Supremacie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The purpose of the Kings Booke.</note> The purpose of the
Kings booke, beeing specially to conclude
the doctrine of Pardons. Secondly, of the
<hi>Popes</hi> Supremacie. Thirdly, of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Church: whether this was the
Kings owne labour, or that he onely Fathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it to giue it authority, is not certainely
knowne, and diuersly beleeued. Many
thinke it was not, and that his Fathering of
it was onely a pollicie of state, both to gaine
himselfe a reputation in learning, and that
by this speciall demonstration, the <hi>Pope</hi>
might be tyed to the Kings fauour, and assist
him in his Warres against the French King:
and they haue these reasons of likely-hood,
that vpon the instant publishing the said
<hi>Book,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> did not only fauour the Kings
enterprise, but also gaue him many other
witnesses of thankes, and among many this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8990:17"/>
aboue all, that (to his other titles of honour)
he added this aboue all, that in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the Kings princely care for the
State of the Catholike Religion, hee and his
Successors for euer should be stiled <hi>Defendors
of the most Catholike Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">The greatnes of the Pope at those times.</note> And herein appeared the
greatnes of the <hi>Pope</hi> at that time, that the
greatest Princes of Christendome, thought
themselues highly rewarded, for their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
trauells, if the <hi>Pope</hi> should but giue them,
the allowance of his fauour, or demonstrate
himselfe in any particular kindnesse (how
small soeuer.) And this was a matter very
considerable, in that pollitique Religion, to
gaine such opinion of holines as made him
reuerenced of the greatest <hi>Potentates.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Popes pollicie.</note> For by
this he often made exchange, with great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage,
giuing them words for things, and
receiuing the seruices of men, for thankes,
indulgences, and pardons, which nothing
benefited the Receiuers,<note place="margin">The Popes secret pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the K. Defendour of the Faith.</note> but much inlarged
his own priuate ends. Such reward had King
<hi>Henery</hi> for writing against <hi>Luther,</hi> in which
may be vnderstood the <hi>Popes</hi> secret practise,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8990:18"/>
for in giuing this honour to King <hi>Henry</hi> to
be stiled <hi>Defendor of the Faith,</hi> hee thereby
had a farther end then to honour the King,
which was to binde him to his perpetuall
seruice, which he thought he could not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
doe then by this obligation of honour,
which indeed is the greatest that can be to a
princely minde. The <hi>Pope</hi> knoweth that the
King by accepting of this stile <hi>Defendor of the
Faith,</hi> was bound in the tearmes of honour
to defend that whereof hee had taken the
protection, and so by consequence was hee
bound to all the <hi>Popes</hi> occasions; he being in
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world the vniuersal
head of that faith, which the Kings Title did
binde him to defend. And this (howsoeuer
the successe did not answer to the purpose,)
yet was it great pollicie in the <hi>Pope,</hi> especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
considering the danger of the times, and
that many eyes began with dislike to prie
into the deformities of the Church.</p>
               <p>Fifthly But who can contriue against God
with successe, for the <hi>Pope</hi> in this case shot
his euill arrow against heauen, which in a
perpendiculer line, fell vpon his owne pate.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8990:18"/>
God retorting the euil against him that sent
it, making him fast in his own snare &amp; to fall
in that pit which he had digged for another.
This is Gods doing &amp; it is wonderfull in our
eyes.<note place="margin">The Popes purpose dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed by prouidence.</note> For this K. whom the <hi>Pope</hi> had thought
to haue made the instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his greatnes,
did God make the instrument of his fall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
<hi>Pope</hi> gaue him the name of Defendor; But
God made the King to defend the Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Pope</hi> the enemie of Faith. For pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
cannot preuent piety; and God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds
the wisedome of men, and can make
their subtill practises many times hitt that
marke they neuer aymed at; as in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
the Pope making particular choice of
the King for his Champion, whom God (the
contrary party) would imploy for the <hi>Popes</hi>
destruction, giuing him inuincible spirit, to
be the first Christian K<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that durst put to his
Princely hand to Ruine the walls of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, And if the Kings nature, and the
circumstance of time were rightly conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,<note place="margin">God moueth the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his naturall disposition.</note>
it will appeare so admirable as God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
could worke that alteration in the Kings
minde, the King himselfe being so stiffe and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8990:19"/>
resolute, as none of his predecessors (I think)
in this did equall him; especially in the
tearme of honour and reputation: and then
considering the King had written and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
his protestation to defend the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the Religion then
profest: it may seeme the greatest obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that could be to binde his princely Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to continue his defence of that which
before he had defended, especially in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of that consequence, the rather hauing
declared himselfe to the witnesse of all men.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, Againe, if wee consider that
Reply of <hi>Luthers</hi> to the Kings <hi>Booke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luthers</hi> bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter writing.</note> so full
of heate and bitternesse, as that euery <hi>page</hi>
(almost) hath prouocations, rather to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate
the Kings heart, and to incense him
to a more resolute obstinacie, then any
waies to quallifie or reforme him: <hi>Luther</hi>
scoffingly answering the Kings arguments,
with words of such disgrace, as ill fitted the
grauity of <hi>Luther</hi> to giue, or the Maiesty of
so great a Prince (with any patience) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.<note place="margin">Luthers <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiuing.</hi>
                  </note>
And doubtlesse this in <hi>Luther</hi> was a
great ouersight and a misconceiuing, to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8990:19"/>
thinke to helpe his cause by traducing the
Kings person; For the resolutions of great
men are not moued by power, but by the
perswasions of inferiours. And <hi>Luther</hi> in
writing this booke against <hi>King Henery,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luthers</hi> zeale with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out discretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>
doth rather expresse his zeale then his discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
For <hi>in all Controuerfies, the heate of words
(especially in the grauer) is a want of that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and Iudgement, which onely giueth seeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
and good forme to all our actions:</hi> yet
notwithstanding all these backe occasions,
which (in mans Iudgement) might seeme
to hinder, this gracious worke, did God
effect it, and that by his instrument, <hi>King He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery,</hi>
whom both the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> had
rather fitted for the contrary.</p>

                  <p>FIRST,<note place="margin">Diuine.</note> God doth often interrupt and
destroy the violence of wicked men, and
their practise, by a contemptible, and
vnthought of meanes: for so was <hi>Luther</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:8990:20"/>
thought, in respect of the great and generall
authority, which then <hi>Antichrist</hi> had: the
reason is this, that where God doth place
his omnipotent Spirit, that strength is then
inuincible, but able to conuince all resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
For God (onely) can contract in the
person of one man, Valour and victory to
order and reforme the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Politique.</note> The Politique practise here is
obserued in the <hi>Pope,</hi> who with demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Loue without charge, could binde
the seruice of Princes and great States vnto
him. For as it is most needfull that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of great Authorities should haue strong
and able supporters. So it is necessary in the
wisedome of state, to gaine and continue
that correspondencie, and indifferencie,
which may support our estimation. In which
care this politique forme is very necessary,
that in disposing our gifts of fauour we giue
least gifts to greatest men, but with most
large circumstance: because that where
there is any neerenesse of equality of state,
it is not possible to make gifts valuable, but
with Ceremonies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:8990:20"/>
Thirdly, In <hi>Luther</hi> may bee noted a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous
defect of pollicie, to labour a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
cause with such vntempered heate. For
if <hi>Luthers</hi> spirit had had moderation, and
that pollitique wisedome which was but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in his Religion and high attempts,
he would haue made a difference betweene
a principall and a second, the <hi>Pope</hi> and the
King, and not haue prosecuted against
them both with like seuerity. For <hi>Luther</hi>
could not bee ignorant, that the onely
meanes to finish the reformation he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
was by the fauour and assistance of
Christian Princes, which care in the cause
and person of <hi>King Henry, Luther</hi> did not
obserue.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Morall.</note> It is a precept worthy of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
practise, that in all societies, men should
be Communicable, and translate their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of loue from one to another. For gifts
and retributions, howsoeuer they are lesse
worthy then our affections, yet are they our
best witnesses, and doe the better, and more
often remember vs: because they are more
open, and euident to sense.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:8990:21"/>
Fifthly, Againe, moderation of spirit
which is our indifferent esteeming of our
selues with others, doth comprehend the
very excellence of all humanity, being the
most noble degree in our nature, and the
very next to the dignity of <hi>Grace.</hi> Neither
is there any morall vertue, which doth more
commend men to generall estimation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it giueth desert to euery man that
hath it, and doth often giue (from it selfe)
dignities to such as want them.</p>

and then such as did not fauour the
faction of the <hi>Pope,</hi> (for so I may call it)
tooke the aduantage of time, and grew bold

                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:8990:22"/>
Thirdly, Those occasions so moue the

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST, If we consider the trauells
of men on earth, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
passage of all their actions,
we shall finde that euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
man of Spirit, or that hath but more then
common vnderstanding directeth himselfe
and his whole trauell to one of these two
ends;<note place="margin">Goodness and greatnes the two ends whereto all men intend.</note> eyther to be <hi>Good,</hi> or to be <hi>Great,</hi> and
according to his choice of these, hee doth
frame the practise of his life, as if to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
then is his care good, and hee doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
those good meanes, that may leade
him to his good end. For there is no way to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:8990:26"/>
attaine good end, but by good meanes. But
he that aymeth at greatnesse, the care of his
life is much different, for to him there is no
direct way of lawfulnesse or honestie to
runne in, for he breaketh these limits, and
trauells in euery by passage how vnlawfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer:
and therefore they of this nature
allow, onely of this one principall, that
whatsoeuer may direct them to their end, be
it sinne, or shame they giue it allowance.
Such was the resolution of that Tyrant,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Richard</hi> the Third of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</note> who
making Empire his desired end, cared not
to trauell thither in the steppes of his neerest
blood, so deepe as (perhaps) to damne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
And like vnto him are all such whose
desires leade them to vnlawfull ends, who
resoluing to obtaine their desires, resolue
likewise vpon the practise of all vngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And this practise of euill men
is in common construction called <hi>Pollicie,</hi>
whereby the name of <hi>Pollicie</hi> doth receiue
much wrong by their grosse and sencelesse
vnderstanding it, for <hi>Pollicie</hi> may bee either
good or bad according to the end whereto

                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:8990:27"/>
out of these considerations. First, the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that was recouered in the person of the
Prince, he resuming that absolute autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to himselfe, which before was giuen to
a stranger his enemy, whereby the King did
adde to his owne greatnesse, and diminish
the power of him that loued him not. And
how important this is to the prosperity of a
State, let the Iudgement of any sence iudge
it. Againe, there is no State or Kingdome,
vnder the awe of Popish Supremacie that
can be said (truly) to be a free State, or the
King thereof an absolute Prince, because
that Kingdome is subiugate, and that King
Subordinate to the power of another;<note place="margin">The gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchiall the best.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the gouernement <hi>Monarchiall</hi> (which of
all others is most excellent) cannot bee said
to bee in that State, where the authority of
the Prince is deuided, or rather tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
into the person of another, as in
the case of <hi>Popish Supremacie</hi> is most
euident.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Againe, to inherit by succession
of blood, (which is of very speciall conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration)
is by this forraigne Supremacie
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8990:27"/>
much indangered: because where this
power is granted<note place="margin">An inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie.</note> there is also giuen to the
<hi>Pope</hi> the power to alter, and dispose of Kings
and Kingdomes at his pleasure, and to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate
the inheritance of States according as
hee shall please to fauour or dis-fauour the
true owners, whereof many times hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
much misery, and many calamities; So
that I verily thinke there is no part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,
that hath not had a wofull expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
in this great misery. That were the
Prince or the cause neuer so Iust, and holy,
or the <hi>Pope</hi> and his wicked life neuer so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly
euill, yet by this vniuersall power,
hee had power giuen him to alter the State,
and to translate Succession at his pleasure:
pretending a Religious good,<note place="margin">Pretend and intend.</note> but intending
eyther the aduancement of his base kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
or else some other enuious and euill
end. And how dangerous this may bee to
a Kingdome let any Iudgement determine.
Lastly, this inconuenience doth follow of
<hi>Popish Supremacie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The practise of many Treas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

the sufficiencie of other mens writings to
this purpose: This onely Argument, that
whereas by the testimonie of holy Scripture
wee are taught to know that man of sinne,
whom the spirit of God calleth <hi>Antichrist</hi> by
this speciall sensible signe of pride,<note place="margin">Pride the most sensible signe of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist.</note> in that he
being but man, shall presume to exalt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
aboue all that is called God. Now that
Kings and Princes of the Earth, are (by the
sentence of Scripture) called Gods, it is most
euident, in that place where he saith, <hi>I haue
said yee are Gods:</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Psalme.</note> neerest to my selfe
in your dignitie of place, representing my
power and my Maiesty, in the highest degree
vpon Earth. Then whosoeuer shall exalt
himselfe aboue these degrees of Maiesty,
must of necessity be he whom the Spirit of
God calleth that man of sinne that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi>
because his sinne is like the sinne of
the <hi>Diuels</hi> in the Creation;<note place="margin">The sinne of the Diuels in the Creation <hi>Nymrods</hi> sinne Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie.</note> for as they did,
so doth he contend for the highest <hi>Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:</hi>
and (Nymrod-like) he buildeth himselfe
aloft aboue the reach of Earth, reaching his

euen aboue all that is called God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:8990:28"/>
Eighthly, And therefore great reason
had the King, and so haue all the Kings of
the Earth, to cast off all friendly intertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with him, that would exalt himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all flesh, nay, aboue all that is called
God: and I am verily perswaded, that this
one respect of pride is that marke where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
shee is best knowne to bee that <hi>Babylon,</hi>
with whose Fornications the whole Earth
hath bene poysoned, yet in these latter times
hath shee got more vgly visors to maske in
<hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Treason;</hi> two such deformities, as
would be very apparant in the face of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
And God no doubt hath set these
markes in her fore-head (as he marked <hi>Cain)</hi>
that all his beloued in the world, might
know her at the first blush, and auoide the
filth of her Fornications. For where those e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills

vp, sometimes downe, according as

And from this mouing cause is deriued that

call <hi>Fortune,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The variety of Fortunes.</note> the often change whereof
to a Christian Iudgement is not strange, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he considereth the power that God
hath ouer all his creatures, and how inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
they be to alteration.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And for particular instances:
Though Religion before these times had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
an euill change, changing the truth
for many superstitious Ceremonies, yet so
venerable was the name of Religion to the
people of those times, as (notwithstanding
their misconceiuing the truth thereof) they
gaue such large demonstrations of loue and
zeale to that profession, and the Professors
as no people at any time did euer exceed
them;<note place="margin">The regard that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Pop: Church.</note> inriching the state of Religion, both

then might rather seeme a Triumphant, then
a Church Militant; So high was it exalted in
the degrees of worldly prosperity: yet for
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8990:30"/>
all this flourish, God commeth with his rod
of correction, and (finding euill in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
thereof) he alters their present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that as they had forsaken the truth
of his seruice, So hee would bereaue them
their earthly honour, wherewith the true
name of their false Religion was gorgeously
decked.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The first cause of alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> The first cause then of this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
was God himselfe, who, when hee
seeth the vessell of mens iniquity full, he fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
his violl with wrath, to reforme and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
what euill men had before deformed,
and being most Iealous of his honour,<note place="margin">God most iealous of his honour.</note> hee
commeth with more then common corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
to reforme the truth of his seruice.
For so did God at this time, his angry hand
reaching destruction, beyond the liues of
those euill men, euen to their lands, houses
and possessions, making <hi>King Henry</hi> vtterly
extirpe these abused Monasteries, as the
<hi>Israelites</hi> did the <hi>Cananites,</hi> for their mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
and heathenish sinnes. And therefore
no doubt did God make particular choise
of <hi>King Henry</hi> for his instrument, fitting him
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:8990:30"/>
with extraordinary spirit,<note place="margin">The King well fitted for this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> that he might the

               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">What might moue the K. in respect of himselfe.</note> But what might moue the King

writeth this Storie at large, yet in that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

the estates of so many (at that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted)
Religious and Godly men. Others
thinke the King did this out of Stomacke,
the <hi>Pope</hi> being then in full opposition with
the King, for taking Supremacie from him in

yet I verily thinke the King would not
for any pollitique regard, haue brought a

then was held Religious.<note place="margin">The cause mouing the King to the subersion of the Abbeye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

that their large allowance of wealth

they imployed the large beneuolence of
their Benefactors. They vsing (onely) the

this then, was an Act in the King very

both states, whereby he gaue proofe, that

of him and his Successors, to defend the
most True, Ancient, and Apostolike
Faith.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">A doubt.</note> Yet here it may be doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King did better in the vtter extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of these men, their order, and houses,

or if he had reformed onely the abuse, and
left their places and possessions to others of
better life, and professing the truth of holy
Religion, whereby the euil might haue bene
taken away onely, leauing their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to be imployed in holy and Religious

the <hi>Protestants</hi> Religion is the want of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
whereby many well deseruing
Schollers liue in the penurie of life vnsup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
which by this meanes might abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
haue bene supplied.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly,<note place="margin">Answer 1.</note> To this doubt many in their
seuerall opinions diuersly answer, some that
the standing still of their houses in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
condition of a corporation was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
least vpon euery alteration of the
Prince, the dispossessed might againe reen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whereby the latter condition, might
proue worse then the former. And this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
were good, if there might not haue bene
assurance to haue secured them, from all
danger of repossessing, (the which no doubt)
might haue bene done, if the prouidence of
the State had regarded it.</p>

Eighthly, Others thinke the King,<note place="margin">2.</note> too
seuere in this his manner of correction, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it had beene enough for him to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect

desire of vniuersality of Empire,
with vniuersall neglect and hatred.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Vngodly practise hath not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
euill successe, if we respect the present
but if wee respect euents further of, they
are euer euill and certaine in their destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Pollitique.</note> to dissemble our intents, with
faire pretence is a principle in <hi>pollicie,</hi> which
I commend not, but remember onely.
For though no man bee bound at all times
and in euery cause to declare himselfe
in direct euidence; yet doth it much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
the honour of a Prince to be square
in all, without difference or dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In a generall cause, it is necessary
to be generally respectiue, and not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
that vpon one, which (with satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
may be giuen to manie. Therefore was
it good <hi>Pollicie</hi> in the King to distribute the
possessions of the Abbeyes he supprest, to
many of principall authority in the State:
For it is wisedome to satisfie their offence
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8990:33"/>
that haue authority, rather then such as
want it.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">Morall.</note> It was the wisedome of the best

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST, there is nothing in the
Earth more certaine then the
vncertainty of al earthly things.
For Man (one of the best of
Gods Creatures, in respect of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of his reasonable soule) doth so often
times change the condition of his life, as if
he were not of that excellencie, nor had not
that power of Iudgement and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
which he hath. And this is Gods worke
in the depth of his wisedome, to whom one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all things are certaine, and with whom
there is no shadow of change. God reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
to himselfe the secrets of those things
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:8990:34"/>
whereof his will is we shall be ignorant, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
onely so much to vs his creatures,
as may serue for the worke of his seruice,
he himselfe still guiding vs by his hand of
prouidence, to those ends, whereto his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
hath ordained vs. And by this doth
God giue vs a demonstration of his power,
and our weakenesse, of his power in being
most certaine in all those things, which to vs
are casuall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of our weakenesse, because
we are like the ayre, we breath carryed whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersoeuer
it shall please the winde to moue
vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The truth of this may appeare
(in the Kings particular) who notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the greatnes of his spirit, and the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
attempt he had made in the cause of
Religion, whereby he had runne himselfe so
farre in the trauells of that businesse, as that
he could not well retyre, without dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
shame, the expectation of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
seeming to depend much vpon the
Kings continuance in that course: yet euen
then did the King surcease from that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
worke, which with so much honorable
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:8990:35"/>
successe he had begun. Where it may seeme
strange, that a Prince of his greatnesse,
hauing the aduise of an honorable and wise
councell,<note place="margin">The weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Kings reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</note> should lay vpon his name the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of weakenesse, not to goe forward
with that whereto his honour was so much
ingaged.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, But if we consider the time, and
the difference of opinions in those great
men,<note place="margin">The King ruled by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion and not by Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> to whom the King did shew himselfe
most gracious, it will then appeare, the
businesse went forward, or not, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the affection of the Kings Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourites.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As in the time of <hi>Cardinall
VVolsey,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cardinall Wolsey.</note> a man so great in the fauour of his
Prince, as that our <hi>English Chronicles</hi> cannot
match him, who in the time of his prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
did so possesse the King, as that the
King may be said to saile with no winde but
the Cardinalls, the king being but the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to his soule, he mouing it according to
the pleasure of his owne appetite, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at this time was the king all <hi>Cardinall,</hi>
putting himselfe in Print to defend the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8990:35"/>
of <hi>Popes.</hi> But this time did end
with the Cardinals fortunes, who being puft
vp and high swolne with the spirit of ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
runne himselfe into strange contempts,
against the Maiesty of his Prince: who fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him so Cardinallike in pride, and
vaine glory stript him of those honours
which before he so lauishly had giuen him,
translating his fauour vpon <hi>Thomas Cranmer</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Thomas Cranmer.</note>
Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> whom the king
finding Religious, honest, and learned, gaue
his opinion good authority.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, And at this time the Protestants
Religion, began to haue the fauour of the
Kings protection: yet by reason of the
peaceable Nature of this Man,<note place="margin">D. Cranmer.</note> and because
of many other important considerations of
inconuenience; the cause of Religion went
not with that prosperity forward, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it might. For howsoeuer we may iustly
conceiue of this learned man, that he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
neither spirit nor power, to trauell in the
most important affaires of State, the which
hee hath well declared by his resolute and
learned proceedings, in the Kings diuorse:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:8990:36"/>
yet considering in what termes the State
then stood, and the particular condition of
his State, it will appeare that a necessary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
of his own security, did inforce him
to a violent patience, and to silence and
suppresse his zealous spirit, which otherwise
would haue ventured vpon much more ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, For at this time <hi>Cranmer</hi> contrarie
to the lawes then inforce, was married, and
did liue with his wife to the great hazard of
his life: and this was one respect why hee
suffered so much the practise of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
keeping good correspondence, and
indifferent fauour, least his Mariage should
be called in question, whereby both his state
and life had beene exposed, into a danger
most eminent.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, And if any man obiect that
these regards of <hi>Cranmer</hi> proceeded from his
feare of temporall losse, and that he fainted
in the maine execution of his Christian
Office. I answer, that no feare but a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
prouidence was the cause of this wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
For he might well know, that if hee
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:8990:36"/>
proceeded in the difference of Religion by
violent and forcible meanes; he should then
haue had the whole power of the contrary
faction bent against him: and being (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his marriage) within the danger of
law, it could not be auoided but the seueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the law should haue proceeded against
him.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Yet notwithstanding when the
necessarie care of Religion did require him,
there was no respect could binde him from
his earnest indeauours, as may wel appeare,
by this most resolute opposing against the
Statute of the sixe Articles. So that <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
(in true estimation) hath well deserued,
and worthily acquitted himselfe of all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;
yet by reason of these occasions,
hee could not doe that, which the
opportunity of the Kings fauour did offer
him.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Vpon this aduantage <hi>Stephen
Gardiner</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Stephen Gardiner.</note> builds his strength, who by obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance,
and cunning insinuation, shifting
himselfe into the Kings fauour, got great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in the State, and according to the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:8990:37"/>
nature of his working spirit, troubles the
waters of peace of fish for Romish Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whereto in his heart he was much incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
And this man,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gardiner</hi> a great Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</note> (not like <hi>Cranmer</hi> but
<hi>Matchiuellike)</hi> grounded in the secrets of <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie,</hi>
seemes what he is not, and is content to
proportion himselfe to the fashions of the
time, with purpose to alter that fashion. And
this howsoeuer it were a thing very disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
especially in the office of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> yet
was it a very pollitique Regard, and that
miste whereby he wrought all his inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for by his obseruance hee continued
in the Kings fauour, and by that fauour, he
erected the whole frame of his <hi>Policies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tenthly,<note place="margin">The sixe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</note> And from this cause had the
sixe Articles beginning. <hi>Articles</hi> so bloodie,
as the letters in them, cannot number the
blood which was shed in <hi>England</hi> for them,
whereby may appeare the greatnesse of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen
Gardiners</hi> wit, that could make the King
sayle with a contrary winde, and destroy that
cause which before he had protected: and
this was, notwithstanding <hi>Cranmer</hi> his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
had then great fauour with the king, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:8990:37"/>
the highest authority and place in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>Eleuenthly, Another of the Kings Fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
in those times of difference, was Sir
<hi>Thomas More</hi> then Lord Chancellor of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Thomas Moore.</note>
A gentleman (in respect of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ornaments) worthy of much honour, for
besides the beauty of his learning, which in
great personages is very deseruing; he had
so good a moderation and temper in all his
actions,<note place="margin">The excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ornaments in Nature in Sir <hi>Thomas Moore.</hi>
                  </note> as no aduersity could deiect him,
neither any prosperity make him lesse in the
vse of regard, and ciuill humanity. And
notwithstanding hee was diuers from me in
that profession which I hold for truth, yet
because I write the truth of Historie, it were
very vnworthy in me to obscure, the deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings
of any man,<note place="margin">The error of such as write Historie.</note> into which error many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and especially such as haue recorded
the passage of those times, haue vnaduisedly
falne, traducing the persons of men for their
opinions sake, and making them altogether
euill, that in many commendable things
were excellent. And because that all good
things are from God, (who giueth them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:8990:38"/>
to the pleasure of his will) it were
therefore much iniury to obscure the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God, wheresoeuer it shall please
him to place it, and this I write in fauour of
truth,<note place="margin">Truth the life of all History.</note> which may be well said to be the life,
and true mouing soule of all Historie.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, This Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
he was an enemy to the truth of the
Gospell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Moore</hi> an euemie to the Protestant Religion.</note> yet if we compare him with <hi>Stephen
Gardiner,</hi> the comparison will make Sir
<hi>Thomas Moore</hi> lesse euill, the other being so
monstrous in his wicked practises; for the
one made conscience to equiuocate and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
himselfe, of which the other made
no reckoning. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> vtterly refusing
the oath of <hi>Supremacie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The vnequal comparison betweene <hi>Moore</hi> and <hi>Gardiner.</hi>
                  </note> because in conscience
he thought he might not take it; <hi>Gardiner</hi>
had the like witnesse of his conscience yet
did take it, and therefore <hi>Stephen</hi> by dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
saued his life, which the other (by
plaine expressing himselfe lost. So that both
these, though they conspire one end, yet in
themselues are they very diuerse, the one
with a manly resolution, and with the witnes
of his blood profest himselfe and his resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:8990:38"/>
the other by swearing and for swearing
to banne and disclaime that, which (in his
purpose) was the marke whereto hee shot
himselfe and his euill pollicies: the one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all opposition in his owne voluntary
death: the other by subtilty continuing his
euill life, that life being the death of many
the deare Children of God.</p>
               <p>13. Another highly in the Kings fauour,
and most worthy of high fauour, was the
<hi>Lord Cromwell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lord</hi> Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</note> a man so resolute in the worke
he had begunne, as neuer any did pursue a
holy businesse with better Spirit, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the greatnesse of his enemies,
who after the fashion of all Courts, enuie
such most, vnto whom the Prince is most
gratious, and then most, when the degrees
of honour are deriued vpon any of meane
beginning:<note place="margin">In modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> yet so could this man rule the
prosperity of his fortunes, as neither in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
opinion, was he thought proudly to
delight them, nor yet not to vnderstand
what those honours were, which the Kings
fauour had giuen him. So aduised was he
in the passage of his honourable life, as that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8990:39"/>
use (which seeth the least aduantage) could
neuer finde iust occasion (though occasions
were sought) to scandalize his reputation,
in the generall opinion of good men. And
howsoeuer God did suffer the euill of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
to preuaile ouer his life, yet neuer to
the death of his honourable remembrance,
to whose Godly care, all the louers of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in Christendome are beholding,<note place="margin">England be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to the labours of the Lord <hi>Cromwell.</hi>
                  </note> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the English Nation, he being a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
instrument, whereby the King was
moued to reforme Religion.</p>
               <p>14. In this mans time the Religious then
liuing had great hope of prosperity in their
holy cause,<note place="margin">In this time Religion did proceed well.</note> aswell in respect of his diligence
to that end directed, as also of the Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
nature, which did seeme to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with the honourable desires of the
<hi>Lord Cromwell,</hi> intertaining him in all fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
regard, giuing him names, and places
of high honour, whereby his godly cares
went the better forward hauing the strength
of the Kings authority, which he applyed to
no other end, but that God might receiue
honour, in restoring the truth of his seruice,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8990:39"/>
and that the king might not receiue disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>doning the protection of faith,
whereof God by the sentence of his enemie
had made him defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dor.<note place="margin">His constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in one course.</note> And this good cause,
did this good man prosecute, with the best
stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of his indeauor, not regarding his life
more then God that gaue it, nor the honours
of his life, more then the honors of his king,
from whose bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty his honors were deriued.</p>
               <p>15. Thus we see the diuersity in the king,
whereby he grew remisse in following this
holy care,<note place="margin">Diuersity of opinions cause of the Kings vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancie.</note> which was because of the diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of opinions in those men, whom the king
most trusted in the state, he suffering himself
to be driuen against the currant of his owne
streames, by the violence of other mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions.</p>
               <p>16. And here is offered a large conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Kings Nature, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his great spirit, and his many other
honourable deseruings, he had this infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
That he would be induced to doe those
things,<note place="margin">The Kings infirmitie.</note> which were much disagreeing in
themselues, and to goe forward and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in one course, and suffer himselfe to be

moued, whether the violence of other mens
affections would carrie him, sometime for,
sometimes against Religion: and by this he
gaue an open demonstration of the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his nature For there is no alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in a State that is not dangerous,<note place="margin">Euery alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in a state is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</note> and then
is the danger most, when the greate ones
(great in authority and neere in the fauour
of the Prince) deuide themselues. For dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
if it be not compounded by the aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Maiesty of the Prince, it will growe to
faction, &amp; by consequence to open breach.
And though the Prince so gouerne, that
they dare not come to open difference, yet
will they worke by conspiracie, and secret
practise the confusion of each other. For
where faction is, there can be no assurance,
&amp; men wil seek to assure themselues though
it be by the fall of others; And this euill is
best preuented by the prouidence of the
Prince; who when hee seeth deformity in
the body of the State, and that of necessity
there must bee alteration, to make such
choice of instruments, as best loue the cure,
least otherwise in steade of physicke they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister

               <p>17. And this was the Kings error<note place="margin">The Kings error.</note> (who
though his purpose to reforme was good,
yet the course he tooke was not good, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

being Protestants, some Papists; so that the
King may bee said to build with one hand,
and to cast downe with another, to reforme

therefore this aduice I dare giue the best

is to obserue, and iudge the difference, and
to distinguish them to such seruice in the
State, as may make them emulous to
exceede, and not enuious to extirpe the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8990:42"/>
prosperities of one another.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It hath beene thought good
<hi>Pollicie,</hi> that in a Senate or Counsell of State,
it were good to haue men of opposite Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
because it doth prouoke both facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
from exact declaration of their best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours.
This, in a state meerely pollitique
may haue pretence, but in a Religious State
it hath none; because it is impossible to goe
to one God, in one truth, by contrarie
steppes.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, It were dishonourable and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
for a Prince, that hath his state free,
and in quiet to dissemble or to deuide
himselfe to contrarieties, because hee
that doth not declare himselfe certaine
to one, doth remaine suspected of all, and
doth giue a generall hope to generall
varieties.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">Morall.</note> The errour and vice is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in retyring from vertuous procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
then the vertue is to vndertake
them. For wee are tempted by all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to vndertake them, but by none to
leaue them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:8990:43"/>
Seuenthly, Hee that composeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
of contrarieties, doth weare a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Shape; for humanitie and ciuill So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie
is bound to the Rules of vertue,

this euill was pretended<note place="margin">The cause pretended of the sixe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</note> to be
a remedy, against the many
Sects of Religion, which then
began to multiply, when Religion was in
restoring; the State whereof being vnset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
gaue occasion that many busie Spirits,
according to their seuerall Iudgements,
would diuersly determine, what was the true
forme of Gods Seruice, and what was not,
whereof it came to passe, that many idle and
grosse opinions,<note place="margin">The cause of manie grosse and sencelesse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.</note> had many that would stifly
adheare to this or that, according as their
blinde iudgements did direct them. For it
hath euer beene and euer will be, the nature
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:8990:44"/>
of the worst vnderstanding people, to desire
innouation, and euer to affect that most,
which hath most singularity,<note place="margin">The nature of the Vulgar</note> euer opposing

of lawfull authority; and this is a naturall
<hi>Antipathy</hi> betweene the base and the Noble,
the foolish and the wise, the bad and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sort of people.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To cure<note place="margin">An euil cure</note> this disease in the State
of England, was very needfull, but the care
they applyed was both vnlawfull, and very
preiudiciall, laying such salue to the soare,
as made the wound wider, and the griefe
much more sensible. For if wee remember
the whole storie of <hi>King Henries</hi> Life, there is
not any other Act that euer passed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of a Parliament, so dishonourable to the
King, and of like offence to the <hi>Catholike
Faith,</hi> as was this of the sixe Articles,<note place="margin">Sixe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
then when the King had set his Princely
hand to the worke of reformation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he did (in a manner) disclaiming his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
proceedings, pulling downe the holy
frame, which with so much labour hee had
formerly erected.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:8990:44"/>
Thirdly, Yet so strong is the power of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,<note place="margin">The power of perswasion.</note>
especially in them wee trust, as that
oftentimes wee suffer our selues to be led to
those ends, that greatly disaduantage vs.
And this is well seene in this Act of the
Kings, which in truth did altogether tend to
the pleasure of euill men about him, and
not to his honour, nor the good of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes;
he being thus perswaded by <hi>Stephen
Gardiner</hi> pretending thereby a prouident
good, but intending fire, blood, and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the cause of Religion, and to the
holy Professors thereof.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, For these Articles (whereto the
King did inioyne his Subiects to confirme
them) were all of them contrary to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Faith</hi> of the <hi>Protestants Religion,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no better then the Ladders whereby the
<hi>Bishops of Rome,</hi> haue ascended the stepps of
reputation, and worldly greatnesse; some of
them being for his gaine, others for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
all of them the limmes of <hi>Pollicie,</hi> and
none of them proportionable to the rule of
the <hi>Catholike Religion.</hi> And therefore was
<hi>Stephen Gardiner</hi> much deceiued, when hee
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:8990:45"/>
thought to square out Truth, by false Rules;
making these Articles<note place="margin">The sixe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles what they were.</note> to iudge who was in
the <hi>Catholike Faith,</hi> yet these themselues not
<hi>Catholike,</hi> but rather worldly inuentions and
trickes of <hi>Pollicie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The first, auowing Transubstantiation, a
doctrine as new as the name, and but of late
yeares inuented.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second, denied the Sacrament to be
exhibited in both kinds to Lay-men, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
both to the commandement of Christ at
the first institution, as also contrary to the
practise of the <hi>Primitiue Church</hi> for many
hundreds of yeares.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third, that Priests ought not to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
contrary to <hi>Saint Paules</hi> opinion, the

of holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth, that vowes ought to be kept,
and this hath onely a respect to a pollitique
end, being that foundation whereupon is
builded their monasteries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the wicked
rabble of lazie Fryers, and Nunnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The fifth, that priuate Masses were neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie,
and agreeable to Gods Word: an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:8990:45"/>
to get money onely, and ridiculous
to the iudgement of all learning.</p>
               <p>The sixth, of the necessity of auriculer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
confession. A <hi>Pollitique</hi> deuise whereby the
<hi>Pope</hi> hath vnderstanding in all states, making
his Priests intelligences, and binding the
consciences of Christians, to that slauerie,
from which God hath made them free.
And these were those Articles, which were
made the Tryers of Christian Religion,
whereto euery man was to giue his consent,
or else to haue the iudgement of law as fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons,
being adiudged (by the sentence of
the Church) <hi>Heretickes,</hi> cast out from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of God, and from the society of the
<hi>Catholike Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, By this then may appeare the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
that redounds to a state when the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of a Prince is deuided,<note place="margin">The euil that redounds to a State when the Counsell are diuided.</note> not conspiring

the Prince puts off the power of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
and suffers himselfe to be led by the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
perswasions of them neere him by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.
For if the King had had as much
the spirit of Diuinitie, as he had of Maiestie,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:8990:46"/>
he would neuer haue had both a <hi>Cranmer,
and a Garidiner,</hi> a <hi>Cromwell</hi> and a <hi>Moore,</hi> to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him in the affaires of his Church and
kingdome. But according as he had bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
in <hi>Religion</hi> he would only haue made
choice of such for his counsell, as had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
one and the same end with him their
Soueraigne, neither is it good in the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

that worke to bring vs to a course against
our purpose, giuing vs the reines onely so
farre as may leade vs to their desired ends.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, If this man and his euil practise
had not preuailed more with the King then
the better perswasion of the Lord <hi>Cranmer</hi>
and <hi>Cromwell,</hi> the reformation<note place="margin">

had not beene letted in so hopefull a procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
neither had the King and Parlyament
passed any such Act so bloodie, as was this
of the sixe Articles: whereby the King did
blurre the honour of that reputation he had
formerly gotten, and retyred himselfe in the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:8990:46"/>
pursuite of that enterprize, which worthily
had made him very famous. And this doth
proue the greatnesse of his euill wit,<note place="margin">Gardiners <hi>wit.</hi>
                  </note> that
made this alteration in the Kings Nature,
and doubtlesse if God had giuen this man
grace to haue loued honestie and truth; he
had many other quallities of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
which would haue bene most
flourishing in a man of holy life,<note place="margin">Gardiners <hi>gifts.</hi>
                  </note> as his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
wit, and spirit, whereby he was well fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to trauell in State businesse, but misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
those to vngodly ends, they were the
defects and blemishes in the person that so
had them, and very pestilent to the State
where such men haue authority.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, And if we remember the time
of these sixe Articles, we shall finde it plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the Records of <hi>Holy Martyrs,</hi> that shed
their blood in opposition of that false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
neither wanted they some likewise
at that time that suffered death in defence
of the <hi>Popes Supremacie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at this time in England, was neither the Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nor the Papist</note> So that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
then profest in England, was neither
that of the <hi>Protestant,</hi> nor this of the <hi>Papist,</hi>
for at that time one and the same Law, did
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:8990:47"/>
denounce Iudgement against the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of both kindes, condemning the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi>
for not subscribing to the sixe Articles,
and the <hi>Papist</hi> for not allowing the Kings
<hi>Supremacie.</hi> And therefore good cause had
he of admiration, who seeing at this time in
England three <hi>Protestants</hi> and three <hi>Papists</hi>
to die at one time, and in one place, and by
the sentence of one Law, for their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,<note place="margin">Three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants and three Papists die at one time and in one place for their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note>

                  <hi>for there hangs the Papist, and
heere burnes the Protestant for Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eighthly, And this came to passe because
the Kings counsell, were deuided into parts,
one halfe <hi>Protestants,</hi> the other <hi>Papists.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Kings Counsell, the one halfe Protestants the other Papists.</note> The

punishment, onely such were free and
vnder protection, who either did dissemble,
or conforme them to the fashion of the
time. And this had not bene if the Prince
and his Lords had conspired one end, for
take vnity away, you take <hi>Truth</hi> with it,<note place="margin">Tolle vnum, tolle verum.</note> and
disagreements doe most assuredly presage
losse if not destruction.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, But God who denied to his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

And this Prince did God ordaine to
restore the truth of his seruice. King <hi>Henrie</hi>
his Father (as did <hi>Salomons</hi> Father) preparing
onely matter for this heauenly worke, which
his Princely Sonne and not himselfe was to
finish.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, And howsoeuer King <hi>Henry</hi> did
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:8990:48"/>
not go forward to this worke with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie,
as the worthinesse of the cause de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued:
being letted by the enuie of euill
Ministers, yet hath he well deserued honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

him euer did. And if wee consider the
kings Nature (being most resolute and stiffe
in any businesse he vndertooke) there neuer
was any of his <hi>Predecessors</hi> better fitted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into such a businesse of stomacke as hee
was, neither can it be said truely of the king
that he failed in this enterprise, for he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
all he vndertooke, and would haue
done more if either his own opinion, or the
counsell of his friend, had further directed
him. And therefore hath he done honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
in doing more than before was done,
and in doing all he had vndertaken, wherein
he exceeded the expectation<note place="margin">The King exceeded ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</note> that all men
had of him, it being a matter thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
to preuaile (in this) against the
<hi>Pope,</hi> at this time a power so absolute, as that
both kings and Emperours, had before fai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led
in the like attempt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:8990:48"/>
Eleuenthly, And therefore I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
that God by his extraordinary power
was with <hi>King Henrie,</hi> making him (in this)
inuincible and powerfull to preuaile in iust
opposition, he looking downe with his eyes
of iudgement, vpon the pride and open wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
of Papacie, and hating that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his seruice should be so corrupted, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
and assists the king,<note place="margin">God assisted the King.</note> to reforme what
the iniquity of others had deformed, so
grosse and sencelesse was the Liturgie of the
Church in those blacke daies of ignorance
and blinde superstition, as would grieue any

shame the better sort of <hi>Papists</hi> themselues to
remember. And therefore it is reason we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
our dutifull thankes to God for

doth argue against <hi>Pietie</hi> and the <hi>Truth</hi>
of Religion, where there is seuerity in

most mercifull; So all Ecclesiasticall prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
must haue temper, and indifferent
mixture.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Calamities, Death, and persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
cannot effect that in the Catholike
Church, which they commonly effect in
<hi>Pollitique States;</hi> to the one they are a cause
of decay and ruine; to the other of inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for there is difference in the forme of

care of his Church.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To ordaine or decree <hi>Articles,
Canons, or Statutes</hi> to iudge and binde the

spirituall instruction. For though authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be in euery Prince, yet iudgement is not.</p>

                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:8990:49"/>
Fourthly, It is dangerous for a <hi>Prince</hi> to
commit the forming of spirituall constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to disagreeing mindes; for diuersity of
opinions (when it goeth by suffrage) doth
vtterly destroy the sincerity of al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusions.</p>

practise of the Romane State, to support the

the daily fall and lessening, of that antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Empire.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Tolleration of Religion, is (in
some States) reputed a necessarie pollicie,
but a Religious <hi>Prince</hi> that doth loue God
more then State, can neuer tollerate that
pollicie, for God doth hate all conniuencie,
and hee is lame in truth, that halteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
two opinions.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, It is necessary wisedome for a
<hi>Prince,</hi> to make difference betweene obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and disobedient subiects, in the case of
Religion, yet is there a great difference to be
had in punishing disobedient opinions, and
disobedient facts.</p>

                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:8990:50"/>
Eighthly, It doth much respect a mans

and not easily to bee drawne from the

haue a liking of our selues, and a dislike of

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST, the importance of this
difference betweene the King of
England and the <hi>Pope,</hi> was such
as that all Christendome, had
earnest expectation what would be the issue
of so strange an opposition; it being thought
very dangerous in the King,<note place="margin">The difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the Kings at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</note> to oppose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
against a power so generall, as the <hi>Pope</hi>
then was, and in a quarrell wherein no
Prince in Christendome would assist him.
And doubtlesse in respect of State practise,
the attempt was very hazerdous, and of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
hope to bring it to that honourable end,
as (by the fauour of God) hee did wherein
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:8990:51"/>
the King did exceede the expectation of all
men saue himself, and erected the Trophyes
of his honour higher, then any one before
him durst reach. And therefore this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
(but honourable attempt, was not
by the prouidence of State, or by any earthly
wisedome but by the power of heauen,<note place="margin">This opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the power of God.</note> God
leading him thorough many dangers, and
vnlikelihoods, to an end most holy and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
whereby God would seeme to
make the worke his owne, and to denie to
<hi>Pollicie,</hi> and the vaine contriuements of men,
the honour thereof, who (commonly) proud
themselues to much in their owne opinion
of wisedome,<note place="margin">The wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnesse with God.</note> which with God is found ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
than vanitie and follie it selfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the Kings particular, it may
appeare how much hee did hazard the
peace, and fortunes of his kingdome, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
aduantage to them that loued him not,<note place="margin">The King gaue aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to his enemies.</note>
to combine with his great enemie the <hi>Pope,</hi>
who with all diligence sought to make the
King odious to all other Princes, sowing the
seedes of enuie in the hearts of all men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this practise of the Kings, cursing him
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:8990:51"/>
from the fauour of God,<note place="margin">The Popes Curses vpon King <hi>Henry</hi>
                  </note> and traducing him
with all dishonor, his euill practise could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise.
And this in those times was great disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage;
because the greater parte of the
Kings Subiects thought they were in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
bound,<note place="margin">The power of the Popes censure.</note> to obey the <hi>Popes</hi> Censure,
whereby the Kings strength (being deuided
in it selfe) became weake, &amp; by this meanes
was the kingdome made fit for forraigne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uasion.
For this is generall in the practise
of all states, that where wee purpose Warre,
there we must haue faction,<note place="margin">Faction the first part of Conquest.</note> for faction is the
first part of Conquest; because there is no
opposition more resolute, then that which is
neerest to it selfe; and therefore of all Warre
the ciuill is most dangerous, being led by
the greatest furie of hate, and the continuall
offer of occasions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">A second Reason.</note> Againe the seuerall Kingdomes
of Christendome at this time were come to
that equality of power, as made them enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
regard one another; not as in the
time of the Romane Emperors, subordinate
to one absolute <hi>Prince</hi> of all, neither as in the
time before them, when as that which is
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:8990:52"/>
now but one,<note place="margin">The equall partage of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Princes.</note> was many seuerall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.
So equall was the partage to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Princes at this time, and euery State
had need to feare the greatnes of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and to take the least aduantage to
lesson him in his reputation and strength,
especially then, when the power of any one,
became extraordinarie; or their reputation
in Armes so fortunate, as might threaten
their Neighbour Nations.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">The care of those times</note> This was the care of those
times, and in particular a matter most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
betweene those two famous king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> which Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(what by reason of the King of <hi>Englands</hi>
claime to the Crowne of France,<note place="margin">England and France in continuall faction.</note> as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both of them prouoked with enuious
honour, to exceede each other in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
of armes;) there hath often bene emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and difference, betweene these
neighbour Nations, neuer (almost) conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
peace, but for <hi>pollicie,</hi> sometimes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Sessation from Warre, that they might
againe beginne with greater violence:<note place="margin">A pollitique regard.</note> and
therefore would they euer combine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:8990:52"/>
with such, when the enemies had
most reason to feare,<note place="margin">England with Spaine, France with Scotland co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates.</note> as <hi>England</hi> would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
with <hi>Spaine,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> with <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the neighbours of each other, being
most enuious one of another. The wisedome
of State trusting them best, who liue furthest
from vs,<note place="margin">The aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage the French had of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish quarrell.</note> because they are least able to hurt vs.
The King then may be thought by making
the <hi>Pope</hi> his enemie, not onely to giue great
aduantage to his enemie the <hi>French,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to deuide himselfe from the loue of all
Christian Princes, the <hi>Spanyards</hi> and all other
his confederates, for all these were deuided
from him by his diuision, no Prince daring
to support him against the sentence of the
<hi>Pope.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">God and not pollicie orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the king.</note> And therefore the King was ruled by
a greater power then that of <hi>Pollicie,</hi> by the
power of God, which made him both vsefull
and very excellently fit to finish this holy
businesse.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in respect of the Pope.</note> Againe, in respect of the Pope,
this businesse is very considerable, as that
which for the length of many yeares, did
most importune him, being the first steppe
of his discent, from the honour of his vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:8990:53"/>
power, which to himselfe he had appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate.
For he could not but foresee the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,<note place="margin">The Pope degraded of authority.</note>
whereinto he fell, if the Kings attempt
succeeded, who sought to degrade him
from his vsurped authority: and hee might
thinke that other Princes hauing this presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
might happily attempt as much as
King <hi>Henry</hi> had done,<note place="margin">The Kings example da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for the Pope.</note> especially considering
the controuersie was for regallity, which of
all earthly things is most desired, especially
by them who haue loftie place, and whose
spirits are most free and generous. And this
needed speciall preuention in the <hi>Pope,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Pope en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note>
considering the enuie his greatnesse had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
him, and the generall dislike was had
of his too much authority, which hee vsed
not for the peace of the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> but
vnto many vngodly ends, whereto the
<hi>Popes</hi> many times aspired.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, And therefore did it much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the <hi>Pope,</hi> to make vp the breach King
<hi>Henrie</hi> had made, and to calme those trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Seas, that threaten wracke and desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his highest authorities.<note place="margin">The Popes diligence.</note> to And surely
there wanted not any diligence the <hi>Pope</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:8990:53"/>
could vse, make vp this Rent the king
had made, yet was it done with such respect
to the <hi>Popes</hi> greatnes, as that the king should
rather in his obedience seeke it, then the
<hi>Pope</hi> out of any demonstration of feare offer
it,<note place="margin">The respect the Pope had to the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable yeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> so respectfull was this man of earthly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty,
and honour, as hee forgot the vse
of piety and humblenesse, quallities that (of
necessity) are tyed to the persons of all that
truly be Religious.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly,<note place="margin">How it did import the Pope to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the King.</note> In these respects it did much
respect the <hi>Pope</hi> to continue a friendly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement
with <hi>England,</hi> and not to loose a
Member whereof the whole bodie had such
vse, which had supported him many times
against the power of his greatest enemies,
especially in the time of such a Prince, who
had published his loue in print, not onely to
defend the <hi>Pope,</hi> but also the lawfullnesse of
his vniuersall power, which vniuersally was
disliked. King <hi>Henrie</hi> offering himselfe with
his two friends <hi>Mars</hi> &amp; <hi>Mercurie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Pope lost the King by his too much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect &amp; pride.</note> the Word,
and the sword, to defend him against all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
And therefore the <hi>Pope</hi> to loose
such a friend, such a king, and such a defence,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:8990:54"/>
by his too much neglect, and scorne to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the trouble of that Kings Conscience,
may be thought in his iudgement foolish, in
his life wicked, and in his downefale worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
punished, and that God willed it, the king
wrought it, and the <hi>Pope</hi> in despight suffered
it, to the Glory of God, the kings honour,
and the confusion of Antichrist.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, From this ouersight of the <hi>Popes,</hi>
this may be obserued:<note place="margin">Authority in an euill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son ruines it selfe.</note> that authority and
greatnesse in an euill person, ruines it selfe
with his owne weight; neither can the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of power stand safe, where it is not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by the strength of iustice, and honest
proceeding,<note place="margin">A saying of <hi>Byas.</hi>
                  </note> And that (as <hi>Byas</hi> saith) <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
declare best what a man is.</hi> So it is true,
that where authority is so absolute, that
there is liberty without checke. Then doe
men giue best demonstrations of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and most apparently discouer their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,<note place="margin">How to iudge men.</note>
and to what ends they are most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined.
For by the worke we may iudge the
workeman, by the fruit of the Tree, and by
the life, the truth, and holy faith of euerie
man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:8990:54"/>
Ninthly, Againe, vpon this proud and
ambitious Bishop, may bee obserued, how
God confounds him in his owne practise,<note place="margin">God confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Popes pollicie</note> he
contriueth to make the King of <hi>England</hi> his
fast friend, &amp; his prop, wherupon to support
his vnspeakeable pride; but God he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
otherwise of that King; and leades
him to a worke more holy, honest, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.
The <hi>Pope</hi> in pollicie intitles him
<hi>Defendor of the Catholike Faith,</hi> because hee
writ in defence of his vsurped <hi>Supremacie,</hi>
But God maketh him and his (in deeds) to
defend the true faith, and to denie that <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">God and the Pope vtterly disagree.</note>
So that what the <hi>Pope</hi> would haue,
God will not haue, hee commandeth, God
countermandeth, he deuiseth, God dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
and maketh the King shoote right,
whom the <hi>Pope</hi> made to leuell wrong. But
before all may bee obserued the <hi>Popes</hi> false
vnderstanding iudgement, in this case (in
respect of <hi>Piety</hi> and conscience) how much
he was led from the truth of Religion, and
from the witnesse of Truth (Gods Word)
to maintaine his vniuersall power,<note place="margin">Papall supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie gotten by state practise</note> which his
predecessors had by state practise gotten.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:8990:55"/>
For it cannot be but in this, their iudgements
were exceedingly blinded, they hauing no
example of any Church at any time for their
imitation. When the Law was giuen, God
gaue it <hi>Moses,</hi> to giue <hi>Aaron</hi> &amp; the people, &amp;
not <hi>Aron</hi> to giue <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; the people, &amp; in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
cause both of state &amp; Religion <hi>Aron</hi> the
Priest was obedient to <hi>Moses</hi> the Prince, hee
receiuing the dignity of his office from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
vnto whom God gaue power to giue it.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, The like order was in the Iewish
Church, where the Prince might iudge the
Priest, and not the Priest the Prince; and so
in the practise of all times, and in all places,
vntill that CHARLES the Great,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Charles</hi> the Great father of the Popes ambition.</note> breathed
the spirit of Ambition where it is, and where
it hath for many yeares disturbed the peace
of Christendome: yet with such euidence
was this error laid open, to the vniuersall eye
of the world, by the diligence of <hi>Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
and others,<note place="margin">Luther.</note> as the <hi>Pope</hi> could not but
vnderstand it: yet against the witnesse of his
owne conscience,<note place="margin">Areason of the Popes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacie.</note> did he still stifly defend it,
and this was a pollitique regard, least the
world vnderstanding him to faile in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:8990:55"/>
so important, might thereupon call in
question the truth of that opinion, (which
in truth) is the state and strength of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.<note place="margin">A principall of Papistrie.</note>
                  <hi>That in precept and doctrine the Pope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
erre,</hi> if then he had yeelded to haue er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in this, he denied the truth of his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
without which his greatnesse cannot
stand.</p>
               <p>Eleuenthly,<note place="margin">The fashion of antient Heretickes.</note> And therefore (after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
of antient heretickes) he would not
yeeld to the perswasion of truth, because he
would not haue his iudgement contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and shamed (by recantation to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
himselfe to haue done amisse:)
And this is onely the pride and Stomacke of
the too much authority of these Bishops,<note place="margin">The pride of the Pope.</note>
that respect greatnesse more then goodnes,
the world more then God, falshood than
truth, desiring darkenesse to obscure the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
deformities, wherewith they haue defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the name of Christian Religion.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly,<note place="margin">To know how to distinguish good and euil by their ends</note> By this wee may learne to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
the good and euill, the holy and
prophane by their end, whereto they princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
aspire; for good men make goodnesse
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:8990:56"/>
their onely end whereto they reach, but euil
men make it onely their pretence, and like
the Lapwing, flie most where there Nest is
not, and such hath bene the care of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Church,<note place="margin">The Pope in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of Gods seruants but insulteth ouer Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</note> intituling their Bishops, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of Gods seruants, yet arrogate princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallity
ouer the highest of Gods Creatures;
They professe humility and Christian obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
but practise a tyrannie vnsupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
They call Christian Princes their belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
sonnes, but make them slaues, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
to their vngodly wills. And from them
hath the world learned dissimulation &amp; cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
practise;<note place="margin">Dissimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commonly in.</note> for wee see that many men
forme themselues very precisely, in the habit
of all Christian duties outwardly to gaine
a reputation, and the honour of high place,
which (when they haue obtained) they cast
off that face of holines, and discouer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in their true inuentions, such was (and
still is) the practise of <hi>Popes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Popes greatnesse like <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzars</hi> Tree couered the whole Earth.</note> who by the
formes of holinesse, haue got a reputation
in the world, which at length came to the
growth, that it became like <hi>Nabuchadnezzars</hi>
Tree, to couer the whole earth, and to spread
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:8990:56"/>
it ouer all principality; &amp; then in the height
of that prosperity,<note place="margin">When great dissemblers dare discouer themselues.</note> they cast off their vizard,
and discouer themselues to be but <hi>Pope,</hi> and
not Pastors, casting from them the Word,
that they may with more dexterity vse the
sword, with which (like Theeues) they Rob
Christian Princes of that Regality, which
God gaue them.</p>
               <p>13. And therefore King <hi>Henries</hi> procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
were very considerable,<note place="margin">The Kings proceedings very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</note> whereof it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed
the <hi>Pope</hi> to be verie regardfull, as did
threaten the ruine of that frame, which the
pride and pollicie of his predecessors had
erected: &amp; the rather because the king began
at the top of his dignities,<note place="margin">The Kings orderly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</note> to throw downe
his Supremacie, which had ouertopped the
most soueraigne of al Christian power what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer.
And herein the King may seeme to
vnderstand well what he had to doe, for by
striking the roote he was sure to perish the
branches;<note place="margin">The bodie of Popery must needs fall when Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie the head was cut off.</note> and the best way to ruine a house,

               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:8990:57"/>
17. For these respects the Christian world
stood mute at the Kings businesse,<note place="margin">The Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes stood mute at the Kings businesse.</note> no man
daring to set to his helping hand, so much
danger their iudgements could see in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
it, as that all could bee content to
be spectators, but no actor like King <hi>Henry,</hi>
euery man hauing earnest expectation, what
would be the issue of so strange and hazer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
an enterprize.</p>
               <p>18. It is also very considerable,<note place="margin">The French had at this time aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the English by reason of the Pope.</note> that the
French King had at this time aduantage
offered him, against the King of England.
The King being now in the heate of so great
a businesse, deuided from his confederate
the <hi>Pope,</hi> vnassisted by any forraigne state,
and in the danger of domesticke troubles,
whereby he was vnfurnished of a great part
of his former strength: And considering al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the honour the Kings of England had
got, by the conquest of France, &amp; the strong
emulation of those two Neighbour Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;<note place="margin">England and France en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious of one anothers glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

being both of them enuious of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers
reputation, and greatnesse: the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
being euer fortunate in those French
quarrells, and the <hi>French</hi> most desirous to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:8990:57"/>
suppresse the growing reputation of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish.</hi>
And therefore it may seeme, at this
time was offered an occasion to the <hi>French,</hi>
to recouer their reputation in Armes, and to
repossesse those places, which the <hi>English</hi>
then held in France; yet for all these occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
so fortunate was the King and his
people,<note place="margin">The King fortunate.</note> as no mis-fortune at that time did
disaduantage our Nation. God protecting
it against the euill, and beyond the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all men.</p>
               <p>19. And lastly, the King sending his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
to all Christian Princes,<note place="margin">The Kings care to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome.</note> to giue
them satisfaction; for that he had done, was
a care very Princely and Christian, for by
this he preuented, the many slanderous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
that otherwise would haue censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him; he himselfe by his Embassadours,
declaring the true purpose of his enterprize.<note place="margin">The reason thereof.</note>
And this was a demonstration, that the king
reputed such whom he desired to satisfie as
his kingly Brethren, and that all of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
powers, immediately vnder God, in
their owne Christian Kingdomes, it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
he should giue them a Christian satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:8990:58"/>
that he proceeded not in these diff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
without the perswasion of Learned,
and Religious iudgement,<note place="margin">A pollitique discretion.</note> neither was it euill
order in the King to haue first effected what
he ment, and then to satisfie opinion. For if
hee had sent for their aduise before hee had
attempted it, he had then lost the honour of

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST, it may seeme strange
to him that shall reade this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie,
to consider the state of
Religion, in this last time of
King <hi>Henries</hi> Reigne: Religion lying then
as it were in equall ballance, inclinable to be
sweighed, according as shall please the next
succeding Prince to fauour it. For as yet Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
was not reformed, but onely a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
made for reformation;<note place="margin">Religion at this time but in reforming</note> the King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
taken from the <hi>Pope</hi> his Supremacie,
and his vniuersall authority, but not the
number of his idle ceremonies, insomuch as
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:8990:59"/>
the Pope may be said to haue his head then
broken,<note place="margin">The Pope had his head broken.</note> in loosing his authority, but his taile
yet vnperisht, reteining still the number of
his fabulous obseruances. And if I were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
what was the Religion then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
in England, I could not giue it name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no better then a Farrago, or a Religion
compounded of many diuers; the State be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
yet vnsetled, and but mouing to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
for both that of the <hi>Papist</hi> and
this of the <hi>Protestant</hi> indured like extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And the reason was, because
the lawes then in force, were occasioned by
men diuers in opinion,<note place="margin">Diuers law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers lawes.</note> yet neere in the
greatnesse of place, either part persecuting
or prosecuting according to their seuerall
affections. So that men zealous in any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Religion, were in danger of
Law, and such (onely) secure that made
their conscience yeeld to generall practise,
and opinion, whereby the best and most
conscionable, had least fauour in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of those lawes,<note place="margin">The euill gouernement of the state at this time.</note> &amp; whereby the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth
did often lose her most vsefull
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:8990:59"/>
members, to the detriment of State, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all aduice both of pollicie and pietie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, For that the King was of himselfe
otherwise inclined,<note place="margin">The King himselfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined.</note> may appeare both by
the testimonie of them, neere his person, as
also by the witnesse of his owne words, as in
particuler to <hi>Bruno,</hi> Embassadour from <hi>Iohn
Fredericke Duke of Saxonie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">D. of Saxony</note> to whom implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

that if the quarrell betweene him,
and the Emperor,<note place="margin">Master <hi>Fox</hi> Act. and Mon. pag. 1478.</note> were onely for Religion,
he should then stand to it stoutly, and hee
would in that quarrell take his part.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It may appeare also by the kings
dislike of such men as had withheld his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse
to reforme,<note place="margin">The Kings dislike of <hi>Gardiner</hi>
                  </note> as in speciall <hi>Stephen
Gardiner,</hi> whom the king now found to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triue
against him, and to haue haled him
on to those ends he most disliked. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the King (before his death) did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
his fauour from him. And howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
he forgaue him the forfeit of his life, yet
did hee for euer after discountenance him,
causing his name to bee rased out of the
number of <hi>Executors,</hi> to whose trust hee had
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:8990:60"/>
commend the execution of his last will.<note place="margin">The repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance &amp; sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the King made for the Lord <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
                  </note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the repentance and sorrow, the King
made for the Lord <hi>Cromwells</hi> death, whom
he had found so faithfull and fit for this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
as neuer any Prince was better furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed:
the King finding the want of so choice
an instrument, would often (in griefe of
words) say, hee wanted his <hi>Cromwell</hi> in so
needfull a businesse as he had vndertaken.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, And therefore assuredly the king
had good affection to reforme the enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
abuses of the Church,<note place="margin">The Kings affection.</note> and to haue pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it from all Idolatrous seruice. But God
reseruing that for the honour of Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
the next Defendor, accepted of the
Kings good purpose. And that God who
gaue him will to desire well, and his sonne
the honour to finish well, gaue them both
(we trust) his grace to die well, &amp; to breath
their soules into his hands of mercie. And in
these tearmes did the king leaue the state to
the next Defendor his Princely Sonne,<note place="margin">How the K. left the state.</note> a
state full of storme and great businesse, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
entred so farre into an honourable
passage, as that the Prince, who was to inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:8990:60"/>
his Fathers cares, could not in the termes
of honour but second the most honourable
attempt of his Father.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">Whether the King defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the faith or not.</note> It may bee demanded now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
King <hi>Henrie</hi> (according to his new stile)
did defend the Catholike Faith or not, and
in what particulars he best defended it. For it
may be obiected,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> that the King not hauing
reformed Religion, but only in some few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
hath not merited the honour of his
stile, because the Catholike Faith was not so
defended in his time, and in his kingdome,
but it indured much affliction. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that howsoeuer the king did faile in the
maine execution of his office, yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering
the greatnes of his attempt, he hath wel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
euerlasting memorie, &amp; to be recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the first Christian king <hi>Defendor of the
Faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King the first Christian King Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of the Faith.</note> &amp; the first that with honour &amp; victory,
dated to oppose himself against the spiritual
power of the <hi>Popes,</hi> &amp; if we consider the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of his attempt, we shall finde it an act of
great spirit &amp; consequence, and such as may
worthily compare with the deeds of antient
<hi>Romanes,</hi> which were of most admiration and
wonder.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:8990:61"/>
Seuenthly,<note place="margin">The King defended the Faith in two particulars.</note> And in these two particulars
hath he principally defended the Catholike
Faith. First, in taking from the enemie of
Faith, authority and greatnes (by the act of
Supremacie) for this (as I haue said) was the
first step to the <hi>Popes</hi> downefall; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by disinabling the enemie of Faith hee
did wel defend it. Secondly, in dissoluing the
wicked assemblies of euill men professing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the Fryers &amp; Monkes, he therein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the dutie of his Christian office, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these men did not onely by their euill
life, disgrace the Christian profession, but
like drones idle themselues, yet prodigally
spending the fatte of other mens labours: a
double inconuenience to a Christian state.<note place="margin">A double in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience to a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an state.</note>
First, in maintaining such numbers of vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
men. Secondly, in the euill wasting
of that which might wel haue serued, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of many profitable vses.</p>
               <p>Eigthly, And therefore though king <hi>Henrie</hi>
went forward in this holy busines but slowly,
yet laid he the passage open for his son,<note place="margin">The King made way for his Sonne.</note> and
disarmed the enemie of his greatest strength
whereby the next <hi>Defendor</hi> K. <hi>Edward</hi> might
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:8990:61"/>
the better take from this Thiefe the spoyles
of Christian Princes, wherewith he had made
himselfe appeare most glorious.<note place="margin">King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> finished what his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted.</note> And so did
that princely <hi>Edward,</hi> to the glory of his
God, and the perpetuall honor of his prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
name.</p>
               <p>Ninthly,<note place="margin">A compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son betweene King <hi>Henry</hi> and King <hi>Edward.</hi>
                  </note> Now if I should compare these
two Defendors, the Father K. <hi>Henrie,</hi> and the
Son K. <hi>Edward</hi> together, and determine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them hath better merited, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of their new stile, I shall rather giue the
palme to K. <hi>Edward,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">To finish a good is more then to begin it.</note> because to finish a good,
is more &amp; more deseruing then to begin it.
For though king <hi>Henrie</hi> did deserue well in
acting his princely part of great Maiesty, yet
did king <hi>Edward</hi> deserue better, continuing
the Sceane to the last period, euer acting one
and the same part, and not diuers as did king
<hi>Henrie</hi> his Father.</p>
               <p>Tenthly,<note place="margin">In respect of greatnes K. <hi>Henry</hi> was more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse King <hi>Edward.</hi>
                  </note> Againe, if wee respect greatnesse
in their actions, the Father hath the greater
preheminence; but if goodnes, the son hath
the greater; the Father exceeding his Son, in
respect of Maiesty, and bold attempting; but
the Son his Father, in zealous prosecuting a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:8990:62"/>
holy cause begun. So that betweene these
two, the Father and the Son, was shared both
greatnes &amp; goodnes; both of them hauing,
both these in reasonable proportion, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
exceeding other in his particular. King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Father he taketh from the <hi>Pope</hi> the
Idol of false religion,<note place="margin">King <hi>Henry</hi> did wound Idolatry, but King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed it.</note> authority &amp; wealth, by
denying his Supremacie, and by suppressing
of Monasteries, these being his two legges,
whereupon he did support the body of his
greatnes. The <hi>Pope</hi> wanting these supporters
(Idol-like) falls to the ground where the king
there leaueth him. But king <hi>Edward</hi> with
better zeale entring Gods House, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this Idol bodie, and idle body in the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> casteth out that body
from the Church, which his Father left woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Church, cleansing the holy San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,
which by false seruice had bene long
prophaned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This holy <hi>Edward</hi> (in respect of
his youth and great place) admirable for his
wisedome &amp; holy life. And therfore did king
<hi>Henry</hi> deserue well, and somewhat defended
the <hi>Catholike Faith.</hi> But king <hi>Edward</hi> deserued
better and defended it best.</p>

this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>K.</hi> Edward.</note> wee haue King <hi>Edward;</hi> to consider, a
Prince composed all of goodnesse, hauing

abundant was Gods grace in this Prince,<note place="margin">K. <hi>Edward</hi> fit to finish the worke of Reformation</note> as

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:8990:67"/>

God, who inspired him with this abundance
of grace. And thus farre onely wee honor
the King as Gods instrument, whereby it
did please him to worke; and that we admire
the gifts of Gods spirit in him, whereby hee
was made to exceede all other Princes then
liuing: hauing receiued from God the
sword of the spirit, and the Shield of Faith,
whereby hee was well able to defend the
Catholike Faith; and to retorte all the fierie
darts of the <hi>Diuell.</hi> And therefore the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
glory be to God,<note place="margin">God had the greatest part in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> who hath the greatest
part in this businesse; and let the King haue
honour too, whom God did please to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
as his choice instrument.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Such was this most noble Prince,
and princely <hi>Defendor</hi> King <hi>Edward,</hi> as the
King his Father may be said to haue defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Catholike Faith in nothing more,
then in leauing the succession of his cares, to
such a sonne, such a Prince, and such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor:
who (notwithstanding his youth
and the many combrances of State at that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:8990:68"/>
time,) went forward in reforming with such
spirit, and successe, as was admirable; his
zeale effecting, that his Fathers coldnesse
had left vndone.<note place="margin">The King beloued of God.</note> So that God may seeme
to haue loued him as he did <hi>Moses,</hi> giuing so
much of his spirit, as sufficiently would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
many others.<note place="margin">The King the best of all Christian Princes then liuing.</note> For let him be compared
with all other Princes in the world then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
and he shall bee found in true iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to exceed them all; hauing dedicate
himselfe (wholly) to the faithfull executing
of Gods will, manifesting his holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
by his continuall cares to that end di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.<note place="margin">The Nation happie in K. <hi>Edward</hi> to defend the Faith.</note>
And therefore happie was K. <hi>Henrie,</hi>
and happie was this Nation, in hauing this
Sonne of Grace to second him, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
his religious cares whom God had
found like holy <hi>Dauid,</hi> answerable to his
owne heart; whose honourable name liueth
with those names of most honour; whose
faithfull seruice to God and Religion, doth

               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:8990:68"/>
Fourthly, This most gratious and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Prince, as he was deriued the Defendor
of the <hi>Faith,</hi> and did by naturall discent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
his fathers titles: so as his neerest and
principall care, did he entertaine the cause,
and like as he was Gods Lieftenant, hee did
maintaine those spirituall warres his Father
had vndertaken; and did proceed with such
spirit and successe, as all those quarrells haue,
that haue Christ Iesus for their generall, and
Antichrist for an enemie: so diuine was the
heauenly composition of his Nature, and so
well ordered was his education, as if both
heauen and earth had desire to make him
excellent, and to make his <hi>Character</hi> an exact
demonstration, able to instruct the most
excellent Christian Prince, how to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
betweene the power of Maiesty, and
the dutie of conscience. For if State would
iudge his <hi>Zeale,</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> his <hi>State,</hi> he shall
be found to deserue this high praise I giue
him, and both <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>State</hi> would
iudge him to be worthie and fit to gouerne
a Religious State.</p>
               <p>Fifthly This happie Prince (in the little
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:8990:69"/>
time of his gouernement) gaue a large testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of his worth,<note place="margin">The praise of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
                  </note> and did both exceed the
expectation was had of him, and inlarge
their expectations that did hope well, who
though he was but young when hee entred
his gouernement, yet at his very entrance
did he better the State, labouring (with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
care and constance) in the better
reforming of Religion, and for the safe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the <hi>Catholike Faith,</hi> which <hi>Truth,</hi>

shall appeare most euident.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, And most Gratious Prince, to

let me (with reuerence and exception of

extremities that could bee; the examples
whereof are very common in the stories
both of Christian &amp; heathen kings. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will onely produce one of the old

insued emulation and enuie, and at the last
vtter desolation; which happily had not
bene, if <hi>Alexander</hi> had had a Sonne <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
to haue succeeded in his Empire.</p>
               <p>Secondly, An example neerer vs, both in
respect of time and place, is the Kingdome
of <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of France.</note> our Neighbour Nation. A king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
that hath indured the greatest extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
the misery of Warre could lay vpon
it; and this was onely occasioned by want
of succession in blood: the <hi>French</hi> King then
not hauing Issue Male to succeed him in his

being suruiuing heire to <hi>Phillip</hi> sirna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

Law) the Right must needs discend;
which the French vtterly withstand by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the salique Law, which dis-inableth
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:8990:70"/>
women in such inheritance: yet hence hath
proceeded the greatest alteration in that
state that euer was, the kings of England,<note place="margin">Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce much vexed with English warres.</note> by
many notable attempts and victories, defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the beautie of that famous kingdome,
which (for largenesse of Empire, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
earthly blessings) may bee said to bee
the most soueraigne of all Christendome.
And therefore the spoyle of such a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is very lamentable, and the cause of
that spoyle much to be condemned: yea so
great is the misery of that euill cause to that
kingdome, as that they still stand in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of good or euill fortune,<note place="margin">France still in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish warres.</note> expecting a
dangerous warre, whensoeuer the Maiesty
of any English King shall please to make
claime to that kingdome, which both by
succession and conquest is his owne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Within our selues also we haue
notable examples of the misery of state,<note place="margin">English ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</note>
when lawfull succession doth either faile, or
is (by intrusion) interrupted. For vpon
this foundation was builded that most
famous quarrell, betweene the two hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Yorke and Lancaster.</note> a difference
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:8990:71"/>
that made <hi>England</hi> to bleede in euery vaine,
neither could it euer be compounded, vntill
the succession of both those lines met in one
particular, whereby the Canons did know
one vndoubted successor without competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
to whose seruice they might addresse
themselues, whereas before they were diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into parts; some adhering to this, others
to that, as authority and loue could moue
them, whereby they broake their vnity to
make a fraction; and the truth of succession<note place="margin">The cause of the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

being doubtfully vnderstood, was the cause
that men were more easily drawne (by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion)
to the bloody enterprize of Warre,
which happily had not bene (or at the least)
not so violent, if the right of inheritance had
not bene interrupted by intrusion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, But that most Worthie of note, is
the late time of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Queene</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth.</note> Reigne,
a Ladie worthy of best memorie; who being
vnmarried, made her Subiects haue doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
expectation, who should succeed her; the
which then was most dangerous,<note place="margin">The danger that was fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by her want of Issue</note> when the
Queene was past the hope of hauing naturall
issue. And this did not onely breede a Ielou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:8990:71"/>
in the heads of her owne people; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
gaue occasion, that forraigne Princes had
regardfull eye to the vncertaine conditions
of those times; and among them, such espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
as did most enuie the prosperity of our
Nation. For they might then hopefully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,<note place="margin">The danger of the State.</note>
that the Queene leauing the State in
these vncertainties, and (as they thought)
to many Competitors; it could not be, but
needs the glorie thereof would ruine, by ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
discord, and part-taking, and that then
would a time bee offered them, to reuenge
and in rich themselues. And how soeuer God
hath preuented<note place="margin">Gods preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the euill which was (worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
feared, yet certainely euen then was the
danger great, and the euill hopes of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
vpon likely-hood conceiued; neither
is there any that hath vnderstanding in the
affaires of State, but will acknowledge the
eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of these times, did exceed the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">The euent did exceed expectation.</note>
that all men had of them, and that the
Kings Maiesties comming in (that last was,)
was a worke of Gods speciall prouidence,
whereby he did direct those iudgements, the
which at this time did very much threaten
our Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:8990:72"/>
Fifthly, By those examples may bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the danger that redounds to a state,
when succession doth either faile, or is (by
intrusion) interrupted, the euill experience
whereof is not onely to be found in the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of states, but also in the subuersion of
priuate houses.<note place="margin">The subuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of great houses.</note> For a Son is neerer in dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
and consent of Nature, then one fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

such are most fit to succeed in gouernement
that are the seede of Gouernours;<note place="margin">The Sonnes of gouernors are best fitted for gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Nature

of the people; that Prince or heire ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
hath it most assured, whose interest is
beleeued before he inherit; because that
breeds a generall regard in the hearts of all
men, and preuenteth the mischiefe which
otherwise might happen by conspirators.
And in this was our English Nation most
happie, in hauing this Princely Sonne King
<hi>Edward,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> not onely to succeed his Father in

Father had done,<note place="margin">He secondeth his Fathers attempt.</note> in degrading the <hi>Pope</hi> from
his Supremacie, and in scattering the wicked
fraternities of Fryers and Religious men &amp;
women, falsly professing Religion: in which
two particulars onely, K. <hi>Henrie</hi> may seeme
to haue defended the Catholike Faith. And
therefore in giuing allowance to his Fathers
act, he hath well merited to share in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the deede; and this his approuing
what was wel done, may be said to be his first
good deed; and therefore doe I ranke it for
the first holy act of King <hi>Edward,</hi> whereby he
hath deserued to bee stiled <hi>Defendor of the
most Catholike Faith.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His first act of defence to the Faith.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, This honourable beginning of
King <hi>Edward,</hi> was not interrupted by euill
meanes, as was that of King <hi>Henrie</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> was not temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as was King <hi>Henry</hi> by euill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.</note>
neither did he retire himselfe from the
pursuite of an enterprize so honourable, but
with a holy resolution went on, in the
trauell of so needfull a businesse, resoluing
with a Christian purpose to finish what his
Father had so hopefully begunne;<note place="margin">His holy zeale for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note> so strong
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:8990:75"/>
was he in his desire to reforme Religion, as
that all his other indeauours were but ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
to that only end directed, wherein he
vsed such endeauour, as was very admirable
in his yeares, and might well witnesse how
much he was in the fauour of God, who gaue
him such rare induments in so plentifull a
manner; whereby hee was extraordinarily
fitted for the office of his great place,<note place="margin">The King well fitted for this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> and
for the defence of the Catholike Faith,
whereof he was made a patron.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, And this defence the king vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
not as a practise of state, whereby to
inlarge his particular in any earthly regard,
but hee was led thereto onely by his zeale,<note place="margin">The King not moued by any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.</note>
and the perswasion of his conscience, who
finding by that iudgement God had giuen
him, how much the face of Religion was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
deformed, by superstition and grosse
seruice; and being moued by the Spirit of
God to vndertake a reformation, would not
by disobedience resist that power, that both
made him and did mooue him to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
And therefore with the best spirit of
a Christian Prince, he did not onely second
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:8990:75"/>
his Fathers honourable attempting, but far
outstript him in that most honourable
course of Reformation; his whole life being
no other then the practise of his holy care,
regarding nothing that did not regard the
aduancement thereof, and gladly giuing his
assent to whatsoeuer might further it.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, But that wherein he hath princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
defended the Catholike Faith,<note place="margin">Wherein K. <hi>Edward</hi> principally defended the Faith.</note> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
all other Princes in his holy care, was
the vtter extirping of Papacie from his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions;<note place="margin">Popery vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the King.</note>
denying the warrant of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for the publike exercise thereof; exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
falshood for <hi>Truth,</hi> and confusion for
<hi>Order,</hi> reformed Religion, which (by long
custome, and euill practise) was deformed.
And this he did with such orderly assent in
Parliament,<note place="margin">The consent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> they establishing what the kings
Prerogatiue had commanded; the King and
the State ioyntly agreeing vpon an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
order of common prayer,<note place="margin">An vniforme order of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer appointed by the King.</note> inioyning
al obedient Subiects to the exercise thereof,
and denouncing such for disobedient and
rebellious, as should dare to vse the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Ceremonies of Poperie, or any other
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:8990:76"/>
forme diuers, from that which had authority
from the King and Parliament: the king and
the State well vnderstanding, that the verity
of Religion,<note place="margin">Verity could not stand without vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> could not better be continued,
than by vniformity and order.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, And this is that which deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedly
hath made the king worthie of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
name, and most worthie of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to be stiled <hi>Defendor</hi> of the most Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Faith, neuer any Prince before him,
hauing done more, &amp; with greater zeale for
Religion, then this very act king <hi>Edward</hi>
did: being in this comparable with <hi>Iosias</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iosias</hi> of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</note> the
good king of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who with all industry
did trauell in Gods businesse, destroying the
groaues, and high places, where the Idols
had that diuine worship, which (of dutie) is
onely belonging to God. And such were
those phantasticall Ceremonies then vsed,<note place="margin">The ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie like the rites of the Heathen Priests.</note>
more like the exercise of Heathen than of
Christian Priests, and such was the kings
care to reforme and rectefie, as may well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
that of king <hi>Iosias,</hi> and worthily exceed
all his predecessors, the kings of <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him. To recite the particulars of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:8990:76"/>
merit were a trauell infinite, the
passage of his kingly life being nothing but
in exercise of goodnesse, the benefit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
this Nation doth presently enioy, and the
renowne thereof spread ouer all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and therefore I will onely remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
some particulars of neerest considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and such, whose remembrance may
most dignifie the author and contriuer of
them.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, In the yeare 1547,<note place="margin">Anno 1547.</note> and the
first of King <hi>Edwards</hi> Reigne, the King by
act of Parliament, did repeale all former
Statutes concerning Religion;<note place="margin">The repeale of statutes concerning Religion.</note> by which

that of the sixe Articles;<note place="margin">Sixe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> a Statute guilty of
the blood of many the dearest Children of
God, which like an euill soare spread ouer
all the Kingdome, culling out such for the
day of slaughter, whom God had ordained
to inherit eternal life: the euil furie therof set
on fire by the turbulent Spirits of euill men,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:8990:77"/>
then in authority such as were <hi>Stephen Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Winchester, Bonner</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gardiner Bonner.</note> Bishop of
<hi>London</hi> and others who by euill Counsell
and pollice, made the latter time of King
<hi>Henrie,</hi> fill our English Chronicles with the
stories of blood, and persecution.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, And therfore be it famous for the
honour of King <hi>Edward</hi> and most worthie of
his holy title,<note place="margin">The Kings renowne.</note> that his princely care gaue end
to this bloodie euill, and that he for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his God, &amp; for the peace of his saints,
hath put out these destroying fires, and blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that edge of persecution,<note place="margin">The King put out the fires of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> which then did
Tiranize the space of sixe yeares, by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the sixe euill Articles. By this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
did King <hi>Edward</hi> cure the wound his
Father had made<note place="margin">The King did cure the wound his Father made</note> so dangerous in the
Church and State of <hi>England;</hi> reconciling
himselfe, and the authority of his place to

               <p>Tenthly, Againe the Kings<note place="margin">The Kings furtherance.</note> holy care did
not here end, but yet respected a further be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit

himselfe to haue done well, whilst there was
ought left vndone, which either the seruice
of his place, &amp; kingly office, or the necessity
of the present times required. And therfore
when he had cast out the abhominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his
Israell, <hi>(Popish Idolatrie)</hi> and the many errors
of that Ceremonious Seruice; hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth
not himselfe with this good deede,
but proceedeth to a higher degree of merit,
to the true establishment of the truth of
Gods seruice; thinking it vnworthy the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his name, to take off from the church
the ragges it then wore, and so to leaue it
naked, and therefore did he inuest it with
orders and ornaments of decencie,<note place="margin">The orders of the Church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Eleuenthly, And by this meanes the
Liturgie of the Church was brought into
a right square, and proportionable to
the Rule of Gods Word, which ought to
fashion euerie Christian care, but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
the forme of Religion and holy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:8990:78"/>
Twelfthly, Moreouer, the commiseration
he had of the necessities of men,<note place="margin">The King most merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate.</note> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
a worthie remembrance, and to bee
ranked among those holy cares, that haue
made him verie famous. For clemencie and
pitifull regard in a person of such Maiesty, is
that whereby great men neerest resemble
the Nature of God,<note place="margin">In mercie men resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God.</note> who is most mighty, yet
most mercifull. In which heauenly respect,
this good King hath so farre exceeded exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as that I cannot giue him equall compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,
with any earthly creature in those
times liuing: who notwithstanding his
greatnesse of Maiesty, and high place, would
(in his prouident care) discend to the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west
of his Subiects; to the lame, the poore,<note place="margin">His care for poore.</note>

Christian compassion, would he view their
necessities, and accordingly prouide for
them of his owne accord, not led thereto
by the perswasion of any, saue of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which did continually moue him to holy
exercise; the witnesse of which his holy care,
will euer liue in the thankefull prayers of
poore people, who at this day are relieued
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:8990:78"/>
in Hospitalls, by him erected and giuen.<note place="margin">Hospitalls by him erected.</note> And
in this respect hath hee well deserued the

               <p>Secondly, The stories of these times is

(in truth) they conueigh the spirit of
enmitie, and ciuill strife into the states of all
Christian Princes, whereby that Religion
hath got a name of pollicie, but vtterly lost
the renowne of <hi>pietie,</hi> the greatest Professors
thereof, being found the greatest practisers
in State that be. And by these instigators,
were the troubles in the <hi>English</hi> Nation at
that time, (and euer sithence) occasioned, to
the glorie and strength of the cause which
God hath protected, and to their confusion
that thus wickedly conspire.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, But these troubles, as they were
occasioned by the turbulent spirits of men
desiring innouation and change, so were
they happily determined by the prouidence
of the State:<note place="margin">The Duke of Somerset Protector.</note> the Lord <hi>Protector</hi> the <hi>Duke of
Somerset,</hi> approuing himselfe forward and
fortunate in discharge of his high place, to
whose trust both the person of the King, and
the gouernment of his kingdome were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.
And doubtlesse euen in this hath
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:8990:83"/>
the Duke deserued speciall commendation,<note place="margin">His deserts.</note>
and to be thought worthy the honour of his
high place, considering the danger of the
time, and the number of discontented per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in the state;<note place="margin">The refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome into a faction.</note> the reforming of Religion
diuiding the strength of the kingdome into
an enuious faction; whereby the dispossessed
(the <hi>Papists)</hi> vsed all meanes both of power
and pollicie, to reobtaine what by reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Religion they had lost; and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
endeauoring to secure, and continue
what (by the fauour of God) they had law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
gotten. And therefore the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
compounding of these differences doth
conclude the wisedome and faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,<note place="margin">The Dukes care to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound these differences.</note>
of such as then did gouerne the state.
For if the Duke had bene ambitious, and had
aspired the soueraigntie, he would neuer
haue lost the aduantage of this occasion, the
time then seruing best to haue attempted it,
the body of the Rebellious wanting onely
such a head, to haue led them to any despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

howsoeuer his enemies did brand his name
with dishonourable imputations,<note place="margin">The Duke slandered.</note> it is very
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:8990:83"/>
vnlikely the Duke should haue any such dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>loyall
affections, neglecting (as I haue said)
these opportune occasions, and being so
strong in the fauour of the people.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, But that which did most discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
the King and threaten the state,<note place="margin">The vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance between the Lord Protector &amp; the Barrons. Honour and desert beget dangerous enuie.</note> was the
variance betweene the Lord <hi>Protector</hi> and

the mischiefe which thereof insued, and
so he might haue done that in the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of time with ease, which afterwards hee
would most gladly haue done, but could not
with all the authority he had compasse; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the opportunity was past,<note place="margin">Post est occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio Calua.</note> and then he
could not recall occasions, which then flie

it be hooueth him of great place, that would
preuent the danger of enuie, (not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare

but to destroy the first beginnings of enuie, &amp;

and then who so offers to strike,
shall but wound himselfe, and like a bird in
a trap, locke himselfe more strongly in, by
striuing to escape. And this assuredly was
the <hi>Dukes</hi> error to suffer his enemies to grow
to a strength he could not command, and
then being in their danger, he sought by
strong hand to rid himselfe;<note place="margin">This ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight was his death.</note> wherein he
found he was much deceiued, to the losse of
his life, and to the glory of his enemies; now
from what cause this discord had beginning
is diuersly imagined,<note place="margin">The cause of this discord.</note> neither doth our <hi>English</hi>
Chronicles determine it, so that many seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
coniectures diuersly interpret it: some
blame the <hi>Dukes</hi> improuidence,<note place="margin">The Dukes improuide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> and that he
did not regard his owne security, so much as
the danger of his place required; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
suffered his enemies to practise against
him with all aduantage. Others that his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
gouerning the State,<note place="margin">His euill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the State.</note> did so offend the
Lords, as in their honourable care of the
State they sought redresse; and that the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:8990:84"/>
                  <hi>Duke</hi> might either surrender his authority,
or else reforme the disordered course of his
former proceedings; to the more honour of
the King,<note place="margin">Ambition.</note> and the better gouernement of the
Common-Wealth: others thinke that hee
aspired the principality, and thereby runne
himselfe into the highest degree of treason;
which opinion is all malice,<note place="margin">This opinion is all malice, no truth.</note> and no Truth.
For questionlesse, if the <hi>Duke</hi> had bene guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Treason, his enemies would neuer haue
condemned him of Felonie. Lastly, it is
thought the cause was nothing but a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of enuie,<note place="margin">The true cause was a practise of enuie.</note> which his honourable life and
zealous care for Religion had procured him,
who aduancing his indeauour with all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie
for the reforming of Religion, and
trauelling in the state with much prosperity
and honour; hee by these meanes got a
double enemie,<note place="margin">A double e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie.</note> his religious care procured
him the hatred of the discontented persons
in the State (which then were many, and his

               <p>Sixthly, And from this cause was the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
end of the good <hi>Duke,</hi> the Lord
<hi>Protector,</hi> whom his enemies did not destroy
for his euill, but for his honourable and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous

to giue it some reasonable pretence; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

of Somersets death.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST, It is true that at our birth
wee begin to die,<note place="margin">Life is a sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> our life being
no better then a continuall
sicknesse, which (by many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities)
leade vs to our graue, the sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and house of Rest; and therefore the
best men haue least desired it,<note place="margin">The contempt of life.</note> and the holiest
dispised it, and that which doth stay them
from the fruition of eternall happinesse, and
tie them to the bondage of flesh (which of
all other prisons) is most slauish; especially
to a soule of diuine and heauenly contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.
For the holy men of all ages haue
neuer thought it burden some to die, but
haue desired death, to release them from the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:8990:87"/>
miseries of life, neither haue they feared
the Image of death,<note place="margin">Holy men neuer feared the Image of death.</note> when it hath bene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in the most dreadfull forme, that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
and wicked men could deuise: because
such men make their life but seruant to their
death, desiring onely to liue to the glorie of
their God, that so they may die in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour;<note place="margin">Holy death setteth open the gates of life.</note>
for such death setteth open the gates
of eternity, whereas euery houre of this our
transitory life, is subiect to many deaths, and
many hard extremities.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The experience of this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and therefore lesse admirable; neither
is it strange that Christian men should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise
transitorie life, and the vaine glory of
flesh, because they are bound thereto by the
dutie of Christianity; Christ himselfe, the
examples of Christians, both commanding
and commending it. And therefore is this
obedienc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> most worthie in the Children of
Grace,<note place="margin">The Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Grace. The sonnes of nature.</note> but most strange in the sonnes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
such as haue onely a generall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of God, and of his mighty power,
not knowing him in his mercie, nor in the
hope of saluation; who by the naturall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:8990:87"/>
of sence,<note place="margin">The iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sense can iudge miserie of mans life.</note> could iudge the miseries of
mans life, and therefore would preferre
death before a life so vnconstant and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable.
Such were the noble spirits of many
worthy men in former ages; and such were
many of those graue and learned Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,<note place="margin">The antient Romanes and Grecia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note>
who contemned the vaine glorie of
mans life, and triumphed in the hope of
death, being their comfort, and that wich in
their opinion, would conclude their infinite
trauell, and secure them in the pleasure of
perpetuall rest. And such were they who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
the immortality of the soule,
and how the faculties thereof were letted in
their diuine offices, by the indisposition of
their bodies, and the naturall pronenesse
thereof to aduersity and euill, would (by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
death) haue freed their soules from the
prison of their flesh. The which howsoeuer
it was by the rule of Religion,<note place="margin">Against the rule of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> both damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and foolish; yet they not knowing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
nor the duty of conscience, gaue a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
demonstration how much they estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
death,<note place="margin">A notable demonstratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </note> more than a life so full of misery
and change.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:8990:88"/>
Thirdly, Such is the miserable condition
of mans life, as that euery minute thereof is
subiect to euill change, no man hauing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to resist the infinite number of occasions
that daily threaten him: insomuch as if God
withdraw his prouidence, and leaue vs to
our guidance:<note place="margin">Man hath more to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict him than all other Creatures. Because of sinne.</note> we are then the most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of all others, hauing more to afflict vs
than all the other creatures of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because
by our offending the Lord of all, wee haue
made both him and them our enemies. So
that all occasions and euery worke of nature,
watch the aduantage of Gods sufferance, to
reuenge themselues on man, for whose sinne
they haue indured the curse of euill. And
from hence doth issue the infinite number
of grieuances,<note place="margin">The cause of the many grieuances of mans life.</note> which continually threaten
the prosperity of mans life, whereby the
most pleasurable time of mans life, is subiect
to this great misery, that hee cannot secure
any little continuance of those pleasures,
wherin he so delighteth: neither can hee
preuent the sorrowes of his life, nor rid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
from the least of them; neither can he
(as he is naturall) with any patience beare
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:8990:88"/>
them. So that both with them and without
them, he is most miserable, and so for euer
would be, if the mercie of God, did not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
to this weakenesse, and euill condition
of our Nature.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Now to relate some particulars
of these infinite miseries, I first begin with
sicknesse,<note place="margin">Sickenesse.</note> an infirmity that beginneth with
our life,<note place="margin">Sickenesse ordained to subdue the pride of our nature.</note> and endeth in our graue, which
God hath ordained to subdue the pride of
mans nature, least being puft vp with too
much prosperity, we should forget that wee
are mortall and but creatures. And this in a
double respect is very grieuous to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:<note place="margin">A double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect. First, the number of sicknesses.</note>
first in respect of the diuersity of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
which being infinite in number,
seeme like so many enemies to threaten our
tranquillity and quiet.<note place="margin">Secondly, the generality. All men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing subiect at all times to all infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</note> Secondly, in respect
of our selues, all men being at all times, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to all infirmities. And therefore they
that haue heaped the glory and treasure of
this worlde, and seeme to ingrosse the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of this life, are notwithstanding arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
by sicknesse,<note place="margin">Rich men.</note> and that many times with
such violence as they earnestly desire death,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:8990:89"/>
to release them of the miseries of life, neither
is the basest condition of men, exempt from
this generall infirmitie,<note place="margin">The poore &amp; the rich are both alike <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fflicted with sicknesse.</note> the rich &amp; the poore,
the base and the Noble, being in this respect
equalls, all men being alike seruants to the
sorrow of sicknesse, whose generall power
preuailes to the destruction of all flesh.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Pouertie of life.</note> Another maine grieuance is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty
of life, which doth depresse the spirits
of many, which otherwise would rise to those
deseruings, which in the iudgement of the
world are most honourable. And this is both
in it selfe euill and a punishment for sinne, &amp;
also in generall opinion it is most hatefull,<note place="margin">Pouertie hatefull to men.</note>
and that which (almost) all men carefully
shunne, because in the reputation of the
world, men are estimated not according to
their being, what they are; but after their
hauing, how much they are in the fauour of
fortune.<note place="margin">The false o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the world.</note> And such men are onely esteemed
honourable, and best worthy who are most
worth, in vaine and vile possessions; the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sort of men, commonly enioying the
least part of those earthly blessings, which
God hath giuen his creatures; by which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euen
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:8990:89"/>
distribution it commeth to passe, that
many times the honourable man,<note place="margin">The honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and the vile man do o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

vilde place; and the vilde man the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the seruant many times exceeding his
Lord, in the true worth of honesty, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
by whom he is exceeded in vaine glory
and honour. And this must needs be a great
deiection to such as haue spirit to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
themselues for when men liue in a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion
to their worth,<note place="margin">Want d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth the spirits of well deseruing men.</note> it exceedingly
blunteth that alacrity and good spirit, which
(in a better condition of fortune) would be
gracefull.<note place="margin">The griefe of noble spirits.</note> And surely it cannot but grieue
the spirit of vnderstanding men, to see the
blockish and most vnworthie, like idols with
ornaments and trappings to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uested
with dignities, and high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments
that onely know to vse those
dignities to their couetous profit, and
not to any honourable deseruing. And
though pouerty to a good man,<note place="margin">Pouertie to a good man is like the foyle to the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</note> be but like
the foyle to a diamond, to make it appeare
the more beautifull, yet generally to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
it is most hatefull, and that which
is onely indured by necessity, and Christian
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:8990:90"/>
patience,<note place="margin">The despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate effects of pouertie.</note> begetting many times most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
discontentments in them of best ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
and obscuring the gifts of God
and nature, which otherwise would appeare
most glorious.</p>
               <p>Sixthly Againe,<note place="margin">Mutability and change.</note> the variable change of
mans life, whereby he is violently carried to
many disagreeing ends, sometime to the
better sometime to the worse, according to
the seuerall power of occasions: insomuch
as in this respect a man is like a vessell at Sea,<note place="margin">The continu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>all trouble of mans life.</note>
driuen with many contrarie windes, too and
fro, alwaies in the extremities of storme and
wearie passage, neither can any man ariue

his graue,<note place="margin">The graue the resting place.</note> his life being nothing but a breath
of contrarie windes bearing him to indure
the misery of many hard and variable for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
And this euill is most sensible to those
vnto whom Fortune hath bene most grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
who enioying the pleasures of life with
full appetite, and by the change of fortune,
forced to change that state, wherin they

it is in his extremity, for as the soule
exceedeth the body in the excellencie of

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:8990:92"/>
and damnation, I should call it discontent in
his extremitie, because (next the sorrow of
sinne) the liuing part of man his soule, hath
not any thing of like torment and affliction:
and as all other miseries are the seed from
whence doth proceed this Monster <hi>Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi>
So from discontent can be expected no
better then destruction and death.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, The last misery of our life is
<hi>Death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Death.</note> the which at one stroake doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
all the euill of mans life; and this how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
in it selfe it be not euill. yet in mens
generall vnderstanding, it is thought the
worst of all euills, and the most fearefull of
all other miseries. And therefore the very
name of death, hath oftentimes stroake asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
and terror in the hearts of tyrants
and euill men; knowing that death was an
enemy,<note place="margin">Death an enemie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.</note> against whom there was no resista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
hauing preuailed against them of the first
age, though they liued many hundreds of
yeares. For if the honours and pleasures of
this life were infinite, and the enioyers of
them eternall, then were not the life of man
so miserable a condition; but hauing death
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:8990:92"/>
to controule the most glorious among men,<note place="margin">Death doth controule the prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our life.</note>
and to depriue them of their prosperity and
honours; in this respect the best of mans
life, is no better then misery and griefe,
because he foreseeth the end of all his pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity,
the remembrance of death sowring
the greatest part of the pleasures of life, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
man hauing griefe to loose that wherein
he so much delighteth.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, Yet <hi>Death</hi> though his power be
geuerall ouer all flesh, is not therefore a
misery to all men,<note place="margin">Death is not a misery to all men.</note> but to many an end most
happie and desired. For though it be a curse
for sin to be mortall &amp; die, yet is <hi>Death</hi> most
happie to them that die well: God by the
death of his Sonne, hauing reconsiled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to his seruant Man;<note place="margin">Death ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth holy men immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.</note> which by no other
meanes could be made immortall. But this
condition of happinesse, is not in the Nature
of Man;<note place="margin">Good men hope for death and bad men feare it.</note> but in the fauour and grace of
God. And therfore is death that which good
men hope, and bad men feare; the poore
mans comfort and the rich mans terror, and
that which maketh the King and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,<note place="margin">Death and the graue make all things equall</note>
the rich and the poore equall, making
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:8990:93"/>
of euery mans flesh but earth and putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And therefore the life of man euen from
the wombe to the Graue, is nothing but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
and vexation of Sipirit, no naturall man
hauing the pleasures thereof,<note place="margin">No man hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures but with limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> but with such
limitation, as maketh pleasure it selfe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome.</p>
               <p>Eleuenthly, The holy and good men of
the world not otherwise regarding life, then
as a time wherein to exercise their Christian
offices,<note place="margin">To good men there is no miserie.</note> and to such there is no miserie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

for this cause (as was pretended)
that the State might still continue the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

the King was moued by others to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
this iniurie to his neerest blood</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">A doubtfull question re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued.</note> And if the question be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:8990:96"/>
whether in this case it was lawfull for the

I answer, that howsoeuer the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is faire and good, yet was the practise
euill, because wrong was offered; and those
ends are neuer good,<note place="margin">Good ends cannot be compassed by euill meanes.</note> the which are compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by euill meanes; and to translate inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
where it ought not, is to contradict
Gods prouidence, by whose wisedome all
things are ordered. And therfore (no doubt)
this offence of those <hi>Dukes</hi> and their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates,
conspiring with them this vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
end, was the cause that God did suffer
the power of their enemies, to preuaile to

he that men should attempt to alter the

so Religious and holy.<note place="margin">What good men must do.</note> For good men must
vse onely good meanes to reach good ends.
And therefore this practise of these <hi>Dukes</hi> in

notwithstanding in state practise it hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
and may seeme allowable.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, When God by death doth

                  <p>Fifthly, It is a <hi>Pollitique</hi> wisedome in a

she defacing the glorious worke of her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor

that beheld the mercilesse crueltie
of the tormentors, and the Christian pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

               <p>Secondly, And therefore I am not (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
to declare wherein Queene <hi>Marie</hi> hath
defended the Catholike Faith,<note place="margin">The purpose of the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of this Queenes time.</note> because shee

(of the contrarie) how shee did bend the

<hi>Truth</hi> it doth grieue me that I am to write the

which I dare not aberre:<note place="margin">The truth of History must not for any consideration be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> for it were an euill

<hi>Marie,</hi> because of her extraordinary indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Nature. God hauing giuen her so
much Maiesty, and princely spirit, as might
serue to rule the greatest command in the
world; &amp; if to her other gifts, God had giuen
her the knowledge of his <hi>Truth,</hi> she had well

&amp; to haue exceeded all the famous Queenes

world in the honour of true deseruing.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Yet notwithstanding, all these
rare excellencies of nature merit little but
only pittie: for if the best beauty of nature,
haue not the benefit of grace, the greatest or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
therof, are (then) but punishment
to them that so enioy them. And therefore
they that haue not the gifts of grace, haue
nothing of worth though they haue all that
nature can giue them:<note place="margin">Nature without grace doth merit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note> and happie had Q.
<hi>Marie</hi> bene if nature had giuen her lesse, and
grace more;<note place="margin">The least gift of grace is more worth then the whole riches of Nature.</note> because any little breath of
Gods Spirit is more worth than all other

&amp; great spirit is in any one Subiect, not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated
by grace,<note place="margin">The gifts of nature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grace are dangerous in him that hath them.</note> they are then meanes to
make the enioyers of them most dangerous
instruments, because nature cannot moue it
self to good, but naturally to euill; and as the
naturall motion is more easie to the mouer
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:8990:101"/>
than the violent.<note place="margin">The motion of Grace is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

more inclinable to euill than to good ends,
being moued to euill by their owne proper
motion, but to goodnesse by the motion of
grace, which in all naturall things is violent
&amp; against nature. And therfore was the Q.
more dangerous, hauing so much of nature,
because she was therby armed for euill, the

For it is impossible that any <hi>Pollicie</hi> of man
should be able to supplant Gods Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie,
which he hath made prosperous: the
Truth whereof is manifest in the experience
of these persecuting times, when as the death

And in this case was the Queene counselled,
as <hi>Rehoboams</hi> was by his young states men,
to make the yoake of persecution heauie: &amp;
whereas her Father did chastise with rodds,
she should correct with scourges: and this
was the euill counsell wherewith the Queene

               <p>Eightly,<note place="margin">Their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell was wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked pollicie, but no pietie.</note> And therefore this Counsell

the State in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, had vsed
<hi>Gardiner</hi> and <hi>Bonner</hi> with like seuerity, and
had taken from them their euill liues, which
they had iustly forfeited, then had not these

it had bene good for the Christian State,
that the ambitious spirit of <hi>Winchester,</hi> had
either not bene discontented, by his disgrace

haue made him sure from reuengefull pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise;
and if this had thus come to passe, no

Queene <hi>Marie</hi> begin the Tragedie of her
life, fitting her with actors who had well lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their parts of blood &amp; persecution; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding
them of much better merit, whom
shee found in honourable and Reuerend
places established,<note place="margin">D. <hi>Cranmer</hi> and others.</note> as Doctor <hi>Cranmer</hi> Arch-Bishop
of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> the Arch-Bishop of
<hi>Yorke,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>VVinchester</hi> and many
others, giuing their dignities and places to
their greatest enemies; men not compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to them in learning and holy life, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them onely in cruelty and blood: who
hauing gotten the sword of authority (once)
into their hands,<note place="margin">The Papists.</note> would not sheath it, before
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:8990:106"/>
it had bene made drunke with the blood of
Saints, nor before the measure of their sins
were full, whom God (for the pleasure of his
will, and for the glory of his Saints) did suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
and for a time forbeare.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in restoring the Nurseries
of all abominations,<note place="margin">In restoring the Abbeyes.</note> the <hi>Abbeyes</hi> and
<hi>Monasteries</hi> she had in giuing; she did much
offend the Catholike Faith; because those
assemblies were found to abuse the name of
holinesse, making it a cloake to couer the
bodie of their wickednesse: who (like horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeches)
sucke the blood and best mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the Kingdome,<note place="margin">The euill of a bloody life.</note> to support their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie
and most licentious trade of liuing;<note place="margin">In respect of State.</note> and
in this did the Queene not onely offend the
truth of Religion, but also the prosperity of
her State in being so euill a president, and in
giuing so much wealth to idle and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vnprofitable people, and not onely idle
but euill vsers of their riches &amp; large possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;<note place="margin">Idle and euil vsers of wealth.</note>
to the high offending of God, the wrong
to Christian Religion, and the impoueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of the Common-Wealth: all which
respects the Queene ought carefully to
haue regarded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:8990:106"/>
Fifthly, Againe, the <hi>Queene</hi> restoring them
did condemne the gouernement of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">The Queene in her iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned her Father.</note>
by whom they were dissolued, her
making them of such necessity in a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Kingdome, made him an euill doer to
suppresse them, whereby she did dishonour
her Father in that wherein he was most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
he deseruing the honour of his
new stile, in this and in his act of Supremacie
onely; both which she vtterly disclaimeth,
damning the deed,<note place="margin">The Queene erecteth that Idolatrie which her Father had defaced.</note> and the honourable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of her Father, building againe that euill
foundation, which he to his honour had cast
downe. And therefore if he by suppressing
them hath deserued to bee stiled <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
of the Faith:</hi> shee then by supporting
them,<note place="margin">E contrario.</note> may be iudged to haue offended that
Catholike Faith whereof she was made De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendresse.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, But that which is most worthy
of sad remembrance in this Queenes time
was the alteration of Religion:<note place="margin">The worst of the Queenes euills.</note> she reducing
the Church of <hi>England</hi> to their former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Popish Idolatry, which (in the
happie time of King <hi>Edward)</hi> had bene dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:8990:107"/>
she inhibiting al her subiects vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
grieuous paines,<note place="margin">Her establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie.</note> to acknowledge that
profession of Religion, which she found in
the State established, binding them to seuere
lawes, to that Romish obedience which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
they had abiured.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, And in this she did oppose her
selfe with al violence against the Catholike
Faith,<note place="margin">Her full op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Catholike Faith.</note> as if she meant at one blow to bee the
death of faith &amp; true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;<note place="margin">Her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes in punishing.</note> she disclaiming
the good &amp; proclaiming the bad; destroying
Gods holy Temple, to build the groaues &amp;
altars of <hi>Idols,</hi> &amp; this she did with such appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
that her gouernement was scarce begun
before this was finished. So easily is ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
carried by viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; forcible pursuit,<note place="margin">Mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> to
execute the most wicked and vngodly ends.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, And as this alteration of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,<note place="margin">The altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gion is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall to the Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-Wealth.</note>
was greatly to the offence of Catholike
Faith, so was it also very preiudiciall to the
State, the Kingdome hereby loosing the
Lordship of it selfe, which King <hi>Henrie</hi> with
much hazard, &amp; great trauel had recouered.
And assuredly if the Q. conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce could haue
bene perswaded, she would neuer for any
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:8990:107"/>
cause,<note place="margin">The Q<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> haue giuen the <hi>Pope</hi> or any other <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate,</hi>
the supremacie of her own state, and
among all other least of all to the <hi>Pope,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Pope hath not principality proper.</note> who
hath no principality proper, but onely a
gouernement compounded of many thefts;
he hauing taken from euery christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Prince
somwhat of reuenew or dignity to make vp
the measure of his greatnes. And it was great
ouersight in the Q. to commend the trust of
her state to the <hi>Pope,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Q. o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersight.</note> whose ambition &amp; aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,
hath made him euer inclineable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue:
for when the couetous hath the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in keeping, it is hard to make him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest;
&amp; he that hath nothing but by theft, wil
be glad to imbrace oportunity &amp; fit occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
And therefore by thus altering religion,<note place="margin">The English nation disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by the Queene.</note> she
did not only offend the Catholike faith, but
dishonor the <hi>English nation,</hi> binding it againe
in the bonds of forraigne power from which
her brother had redeemed it.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, And from this act of Q. <hi>Maries</hi> did
proceed another equally euill or worse,
whereby she hath got a name of blood and
crueltie, and whereby she hath run her selfe
into the highest degree of euill and this
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:8990:108"/>
was the persecution of holy and faithfull
men;<note place="margin">The Q. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions of holy men.</note> slaughtering Gods Saints, with such

For there is no profession of Christian
Religion in all the world, except the Papisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
that thinke to merit by murder, blood
and persecution: neither is there any that
haue made their names so odious, by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of Christian blood as they, whereby
they haue made themselues the friends or
<hi>Antichrist,</hi> but enemies to God, and to the
truth of his holy Gospell. God hauing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

Martyrs,<note place="margin">The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</note> who in this time of <hi>Queene Mary,</hi>
witnessed the truth of their Christian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
in the burning flames of persecution

               <p>Tenthly, So great was the persecution in
these times,<note place="margin">The vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of this persecution.</note> as that no Sex, no age, nor any

the remembrance of those miseries as
they are recorded,<note place="margin">For his booke of Acts and Monuments</note> then children new borne

holy) Martyrs giuing their liues, as soone as
they had them for the witnesse of their Lord

strange and incomparable crueltie, yet did
the enuie of these times reach further, to the
Sepultures of holy men deceassed,<note place="margin">Strange ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie.</note> where

very admirable, and such as onely the mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of the diuel could deuise.<note place="margin">The graue is euery mans Sanctuary.</note> For the Graue
is euery mans Sanctuarie, from which no

the breach of the Lawes of Nature and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie:
and to persecute and burne mens

is a Iudgement most mercilesse, for the

more then crueltie to reuiue his death and
to make him die againe. And therefore as
<hi>Iob</hi> did blame his vncomfortable friend,<note place="margin">Note.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they did persecute him as God, and
were not content with his flesh. So wee may
lawfully condemne this Popish persecution,<note place="margin">A reuenge like the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels.</note>
because they reuenge like <hi>Diuels,</hi> and are not

                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:8990:109"/>
Eleuenthly, And if we truly consider the
bloody persecution of <hi>Queene Maries</hi> time,
and with what vehemency it was moued, it
will appeare to be of like crueltie with them
of the heathen <hi>Emperours</hi> in the <hi>Primitiue

with <hi>King Philip</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">King Philip of Spaine.</note> may bee said to

and to whom God had purposed, to
giue the inheritance of these kingdomes,
and the office to defend the profession of

remember the most gratious gouernement
of this Ladie,<note place="margin">The gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when she was Q.</note> the time shee was Queene,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:8990:112"/>
and how nobly shee hath defended the

thereby iudge how much euill <hi>Queene Marie</hi>
had done, if the euill practise against her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

euer had so noble a <hi>Patronesse</hi> to support

whose holy faith shee hath victoriously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
against all oppositions, cutting off

               <p>16. In respect of State likewise,<note place="margin">In respect of State.</note> was this

the cause (as I haue said) was onely
the too much trust the Queene gaue to

that can continue prosperity without

(the <hi>Church)</hi> had neuer any such immunity,
but (like all other things, and for the worke
of Gods glorie) she doth often vary her
<hi>State,</hi> and like the Sunne often in clouds, and
sometimes in <hi>Eclipse.</hi> The reason is the will
of God who hath determined to leade vs

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is the Popish Religion, but
no Religion, to destroy and not correct,
to iudge without mercy, and to bee ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
in the prosecuting their persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But our most diuine and sacred Lord
Christ hath said <hi>Blessed are yee when ye suffer
these things.</hi> Surely then cursed are they that
doe them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The iudgements of God haue
relation to mens offence, being the effect
of that cause, and therefore who knoweth
but that God in iudgement to K. <hi>Henrie,</hi> gaue
him this contrariety in his Children, to
condradict and countermand one another

improuidence in the Queene, and so direct

yeeld to conscience (as she deemed it) which
if she had not bene a woman, she would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
haue done, or at the least neuer so done
without all limitation</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Marriage of Queene <hi>Marie</hi>
with <hi>Spaine,</hi> was an oportunity for Spaine
to depresse the glory of this Nation, for if
the Queene had had issue by him, the
principality had bene translated to such a
Prince, as may yet iustly bee feared, to
what extremities his growing Empire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The Queenes error in these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
was to receiue her <hi>State</hi> instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
from such Counsellors as did labour
onely to frame her to their owne designes,

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Queene <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> And this was Q<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Maries</hi> punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who doubtlesse did verie much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:8990:117"/>
her selfe in the remembrance of her
euill fortunes; some whereof I will relate,
not obseruing the order of the time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were occasioned, but ranke them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their degrees in greatnesse, and
as the Queene found them most offensiue.
And as the greatest, I remember first the
trouble of her Conscience,<note place="margin">The trouble of her consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> whereby she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
enemie to her selfe, and hatefull to her
former proceedings,<note place="margin">Her owne iudgement of her owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</note> iudging them much
more viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, then the cause required, or then
might stand with the honour of her name,
and with the discharge of Christian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and this shee vnderstood by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
sense of mercy,<note place="margin">Her Nature.</note> whereto in her Nature
shee was inclinable, and from which shee
was violently moued by the breath of bad
perswasion. For though the Queene was
made to beleeue, that her vehement perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
the <hi>Protestants</hi> Religion,<note place="margin">Protestants.</note> was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
for both states of Church and kingdome:
yet when Christian blood was shed in that
abundance,<note place="margin">The queenes griefe.</note> it much repented her; that shee
(by that meanes) had giuen her name so
bloody a remembrance. And in this case
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:8990:118"/>
might she say of <hi>Gardiner</hi> and <hi>Bonner</hi> (as <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
did of his two Sonns,<note place="margin">Gardiner Bonner. Gen. 34. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Simion</hi> and <hi>Leui)</hi>
that they had made her name odious to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
mans eares, and that therefore they
were Children of <hi>Blood.</hi> And surely the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse
of conscience, for her bloody gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">The Queene veri much in her selfe offended.</note>
did very much afflict the Queenes
minde, whereof shee would oftentimes giue
demonstration, and by words of dislike, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
how much she did distaste the furie of
persecution, and the generall waste those
fires had made in her Kingdomes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Neither need this seeme strange
to any that Q. <hi>Marie</hi> should dislike her selfe
in her owne practise, because wee know that
Princes (though they haue soueraigne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ouer their Subiects;<note place="margin">How the power of Princes is limited.</note> yet hath it such limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as that Princes themselues, somtimes
are not free, nor can compasse those ends,
which most desirously they would; &amp; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
are they forced to that they would not.
The reason is,<note place="margin">The reason.</note> because no prince in the world
can support himselfe, without the assurance
of his Subiects:<note place="margin">Faction.</note> and when the State is in
Faction (as then it was for Religion) it is
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:8990:118"/>
most dangerous for the Prince,<note place="margin">Faction.</note> to <hi>Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi>
them by whom he is principally suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And <hi>Queene Mary</hi> taking vpon her
the protection of the <hi>Romish Religion,</hi> did
then binde her selfe to the heads of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
lest by discontenting them, she should
haue runne her selfe into a generall offence,
and so haue hazzerded the fortunes of her
State.<note place="margin">The torment of an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> And this was to the <hi>Queene</hi> so great
offence, as they onely can conceiue, who
haue endured the torment of an offended
conscience.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Another cause of <hi>Queene Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
discontent was <hi>King Philip</hi> her husband,<note place="margin">King Philip of Spaine.</note>
who either in truth or as she thought, did
not so louingly respect her as the sacred
bonds of marriage required, neither had
shee issue by him according to her owne
hope,<note place="margin">Her want of issue.</note> and the expectation of her Subiects,
and this did very much offend the <hi>Queenes</hi>
patience,<note place="margin">The natures of women.</note> being by the Nature of her Sex
most inclinable to apprehend such discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,
and the rather because of her princely
place,<note place="margin">The Kings not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her.</note> and the great spirit of Maiestie, which
shee wanted not. For the <hi>Kings</hi> not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:8990:119"/>
or his cold regarding her did conclude
that (in his opinion) she wanted of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse
he had formerly imagined, and that
shee did not merit the truth of his loue and
most kind affection,<note place="margin">Her iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of her own merit.</note> whereto his bond of
Marriage did binde him, his not regarding
her, debasing her in worth and estimation,
whereat shee might worthily take offence;
the rather because the <hi>Queene</hi> in her owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,<note place="margin">The queenes deseruing of King Philip.</note>
had preferred him to her loue, and
to the honour of that Marriage before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Princes in Christendome, communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with him the honours of her Crowne
and Dignities, to the hazzard of her life and
State, being contrary to the generall liking
of her Subiects, and for which had bene ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dangerous Rebellion in her kingdome.
And therefore this offence taking of the
<hi>Queene,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The queenes offence in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of King Philip very causefull.</note> was very causefull, and vpon iust
consideration conceiued; shee hauing done
so much for him that deserued so little, and
he not recompensing the merit of her high
deseruing.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">The third cause of her Discontent was the losse of Callis.</note> A third cause of <hi>Queene Maries</hi>
griefe was the losse of <hi>Callis,</hi> a towne of most
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:8990:119"/>
importance for the <hi>English State,</hi> especially
considering the quarrell of those two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> who (besides the
English claime to that Crowne &amp; Dignity)
haue euer had an honourable Contention
to exceed each other in the reputation of
Armes and warlike exercise; neither is it in
reason to bee hoped that these two warlike
Nations shall alwayes conspire peace, and
for euer forget the emulation and glorious
conquests of former times, hauing these
maine prouocations to hinder it,<note place="margin">Note.</note> the neare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of place, the equallity of power, the
difference of Religion, and the claime to the
lawfull inheritance, the least of which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
may serue to incense a forward spirit
with desire of honourable Warre and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.<note place="margin">Prouocations to French warres.</note>
And then considering the importance

               <p>

to discourse at large herein,<note place="margin">The diuers opinions of men in this Argument.</note> but
onely to report my owne Iudgement, and
that which I think is answerable in this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
to Religion and holy reason. For if this

the <hi>Pollitique practise</hi> of time,<note place="margin">This contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie must be iudged by Religion and not by pollicie</note> and not by the

in their seuerall iudgements,<note place="margin">The Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of God the best au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</note> but if men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
onely to satisfie conscience, to such men
the testimonie of God is sufficient, which

ought to square the practises of all degrees
of Christian men, and to determine all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies,
be they neuer so important; But
this tryall hath not alwaies authority in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement

                  <note place="margin">Religion and Pollicie two diuers.</note> are two diuers (or rather in full

because they conspire not one, but

to the worke of holinesse, and iudged

if these respects, had regard in Christian

had that dishonourable imputation, to bee

Conspiracies and Treasons of most
horrible report, and such as neuer were the

               <p>Secondly, And these euill Ministers doe
arrogate to themselues,<note place="margin">The Pope doth chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</note> authority (which

license Rebellion in a Christian State, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

a power which neuer any Christian

they haue principally inriched them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,<note place="margin">How the Pope doth inrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note>
with wealth and dignities, taken at
the spoyle of Christian Princes; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

of his Empire. And this how vnequall it is
with Gods Word, may appeare to any
iudgement,<note place="margin">The Pope no follower of any holy example.</note> there being no example in the
Storie of the Bible for his imitation, where
any <hi>Priest</hi> did euer challenge any such soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
authority.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, And in respect of State practise,<note place="margin">In respect of State pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise.</note>
there was neuer any thing more dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
then for Princes and free States to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

bowels of their wealth, and on the blood of
Saints, and doth glorifie himself in the spoile
of Christian Princes, and thus will doe, vntill
God shall please to destroy him with the
breath of his displeasure.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The example of K. <hi>Dauid</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of King <hi>Dauid.</hi>
                  </note> may
suffice to conclude against this doctrine, who
notwithstanding he had Gods promise to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
the kingdome of <hi>Israel,</hi> being by the
Prophet anointed (by which God did crown
him King) and knowing moreouer, that
God had forsaken his master <hi>Saul,</hi> hauing
taken his good Spirit from him, whereby he
was Anathemate, and interdict by the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of God himselfe;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> would not conspire the death of <hi>Saul</hi> though he were a Reprobate.</note> yet did not <hi>Dauid</hi>
(for all this) conspire against his master <hi>Saul,</hi>
but onely sought to secure his life, by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
him from the kings presence, who
hee assuredly knew did seeke after his life.
And when opportunity was offered him so
fit,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the offer of opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge.</note> as that he at one stroake, might both haue
reuenged the iniuries of his greatest Enemy,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:8990:125"/>
and vpon such an Enemy, as stood betweene
him and a Kingdome, yet would he not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
him being vrged thereto by the earnest
perswasion of his follower, but withstood
both them and opportunity, induring the
trouble of his Conscience, for presuming to
cut off (not his Masters head, but) the lap of
his garment only.</p>
               <p>Fiftly,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 24. v. 5, 6, 7.</note> Another time <hi>Saul</hi> pursuing after
<hi>Dauid</hi> to destroy him was found by <hi>Dauid</hi>
and <hi>Abishai,</hi> sleeping with his speare at his
head, as if occasion should haue led <hi>Dauid</hi> to
an opportunity most fit, and thus haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
him.<note place="margin">Arare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a holy King.</note> See, here is thy enemy sleeping,
and here is a weapon to destroy him; which
aduantage when <hi>Abishai</hi> would most gladly
haue imbraced, he was disswaded by <hi>Dauid,</hi>
with this answere;<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>Destroy him not, for who
can lay his hand vpon the Lords Anointed,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 6. 9</note> and
be guiltlesse:</hi> whereby hee concludeth it to
be impossible for any man whosoeuer, to
conspire the death or dammage of his soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> and the Pope disagree in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>
with the testimonie of good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
And this opinion of King <hi>Dauids,</hi> is
aduerse to the practise of the Romane State,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:8990:126"/>
which hath often laid their hands of blood,
and death vpon the Lords annointed; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
haue they euer done as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
the offer of fit occasion to reuenge,
wherein they are answerable to their <hi>Italian
prouerbe.<note place="margin">An Italian prouerbe Count <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezer.</hi>
                     </note> If thy enemie be vp to his knees in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
reach him thy hand to helpe him: But if hee
stand vp to the Chinne, set thy foot vpon him to
destroy him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, Now if King <hi>Dauids</hi> example and
authority will not serue, because he was but
Man, I will then produce his witnesse, who
was both God and Man the Lord <hi>Iesus;</hi> who
commanded the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Christ.</note> to giue obedience to
<hi>Caesar</hi> in all those duties which respect Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty;
though <hi>Caesar</hi> did not acknowledge
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Religion, but rather did persecute
that profession. Neither did he perswade re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
against the Romane state, though in
his diuine wisedome he did foresee that the
Kingdome of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> (which he so much
loued) should be vtterly wasted by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the <hi>Romanes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">God who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maketh Kings, can onely depose them.</note> whereby hee would teach
vs, that as by God (onely) Kings do Reigne,
so by him onely are they both supported,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:8990:126"/>
(and as he shall onely please,) are they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
and deposed from their dignities.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, It is euident then, by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of them who are most holy and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
(that no earthly man by the authority
of his place) hath or can giue license, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire,
against any Soueraigne power what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer,<note place="margin">No earthly power can giue licensce for Rebellion.</note>
and the reason is, because there is no
power but from God, and the powers that
be are ordained of God: and therefore to
resist that power, is to withstand God and his
ordinance, and to condemne the forme of
Gods gouernement. And such are all they,
who goe about to translate authority, where
God hath not giuen it, and to throw downe
and depose them whom God hath esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
and such are all they who either plot
or practise Rebellion, Conspiracie, or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,<note place="margin">All traytors oppose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Gods prouidence.</note>
or that can giue allowance thereto. Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
they be to God, Traitors to their Prince,
Traitors to their Countrie and to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
Traitors whom God will withstand as
Traitors, and iudge as Enemies.</p>
               <p>Eighthly,<note place="margin">The Pope his Dispensation.</note> And though the <hi>Pope</hi> challenge
to be able, to giue that dispensation, which
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:8990:127"/>
                  <hi>Iehu</hi> had giuen him of God; yet is that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
presumption in the <hi>Pope,</hi> for neither is he
God to giue any such warrant, neither is he
Gods <hi>Prophet,</hi> whose authority we may trust,
neither doth God reueale his will immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to the <hi>Pope,</hi> as he did to his <hi>Prophet
Elisha,</hi> neither haue his <hi>Iehues</hi> euer had
that fortune and prosperous successe, as had
this; God confounding many thousands of
their damned and Rebellious practises, to
the honour of his name and to the shame of
all such euill Ministers, for this is an vnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
argument, that the <hi>Popes</hi> power to
dispence in this kinde is not from God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
many of their practises succeed not,
which if they were from God they must of
necessity prosper. And therefore neither
Prince, Priest, or <hi>Pope,</hi> can giue dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in this kinde. God onely being able to
make that lawfull, which without his speciall
direction is most damnable.</p>

most honourable place among the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of those holy ones, who haue best
fought the Lords quarrell, and best defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the profession of Faith: and as it is said,
the daie and night diuide the yeare like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
partners:<note place="margin">The day and night diuide the yeare.</note> so we may say, that these
two Sisters, <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Queene Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
haue diuided the Renowne of the
world, <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> (like the day) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
got the better part of fame, honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

reduceth to memorie the stories of blood;
and how the Saints of God were slaughte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
whereby shee her selfe is made more

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of good and bad.</note> This difference of good and

of mankinde, and not common to
any other kinde of creature saue Man. For
inuegitable things we see, that from one
roote doe proceede many branches, yet
all of them of one and the same Nature, and
all bearing one and the same fruit: but in
the generations of Man it is otherwise, for
from on Father commonly proceedeth
children of disagreeing quallities,<note place="margin">The differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Natures.</note> as from
one <hi>Adam</hi> was deriued both righteous <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel:</hi>

a <hi>Iacob</hi> and an <hi>Esau,</hi> and so from one <hi>Henrie</hi>
an <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and a <hi>Marie,</hi> a day and a night,
a mercie and a miserie, a blessed protector
and a most bloodie persecutor of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith. And therefore was King <hi>Henrie</hi>
much in Gods sauour, and to vs was hee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:8990:131"/>
in making the greater part of the
Kings Children the better part,<note place="margin">Of King <hi>Henries</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.</note> (which sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to any one man liuing happeneth.
God in his anger gaue our Nation but one
<hi>Marie,</hi> but in his loue he gaue vs both an

will he that hath care ouer all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
suffer the cause hee so deerely loueth
to want protection, but if he giue his Church
a <hi>Marie</hi> to trie it in the fire of persecution, he
will also giue it an <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to restore and
refresh it. Such was our noble <hi>Defendresse,</hi>
whose care did medicine the bodie of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and State,<note place="margin">Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> is helper to cure the wounds her Sister had made in the State.</note> which her Sister had grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously
wounded. And for my owne parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
though there was neuer any Princesse
in the world, whose name I would more
gladly honour than <hi>Queene Elizabeth,</hi> yet
dare I not take vpon me to report her worth
(not for that I feare the face of any man in
that honest performance) but because I am
farre vnable to giue so much of honourable
remembrance as her most princely life hath
well deserued: and by fayling (in reporting
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:8990:131"/>
lesse than truth) I shall wrong the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of her name, which most tenderly I loue,
and whereto I will euer be a seruant. And
therefore let such as desire to know her
worth;<note place="margin">Wherein we may behold the deserts of Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth.</hi>
                  </note> reade the large storie thereof, in the
most honourable deeds of late times, there
being almost no memorable Act in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,
for the space of fortie yeares of
her time, wherein she had not some part of
princely deseruing; Let him view the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous

her merit, let him remember her fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

wise in the gouernement of her state,
iust in the liberty of Lawes, mercifull in
iudgement, and iust in determining, Let him
remember <hi>England, France, Scotland, Ireland,
Spaine, Portingale, Italy and Belgica,</hi> and all
the quarters of Christendome, in euery part
whereof is spread the remembrance of her
merit, let him aske the <hi>Turke,</hi> the <hi>Tartare</hi> and
those Emperours of most distance, and they
can report the honour and name of <hi>Queene
Elizabeth;</hi> Let him inquire at the enuie of
the greatest <hi>Potentates</hi> in Christendome, and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:8990:132"/>
that will declare her worthie of most worthie
praise: if there be any one a stranger in this
<hi>Israell,</hi> and doth not or will not know her
merit, let him consult with these, or with any
of these, and he may receiue satisfaction &amp;
better knowledge: or if this suffice not to
make her enough honourable, let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
how her holy hands put out the
fires of trouble and grieuous persecutions,
loosing the holy Martyrs from the stakes of
of death and (like Gods Angell) binding
the mouth of death,<note place="margin">The highest of her deserts</note> and tribulation which
had wasted a great part of Gods inheritance.
And then how shee restored the Truth of
Gods seruice, vtterly abolishing Idolatrie
&amp; grosse superstition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this is that which
best merited honourable remembrance; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as if I had enuie and coueted to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
her princely deseruing, this her most
godly act, would (in despight of enuie and
me) declare her most worthie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the enuious breach of all them that
dare traduce her.<note place="margin">In respect of greatnesse &amp; goodnesse.</note> And therefore I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say of <hi>Queene Elizabeth,</hi> that in respect
both of greatnesse and goodnesse, she was
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:8990:132"/>
such an Empresse as the world neuer had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
to match her; and for her Sex shee
was such a woman as (worthily) may be said
to haue exceeded all other but that most sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Virgin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">Virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> with whom I neither will nor
dare make comparison.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Now that wherein <hi>Queene Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>
was most absolute,<note place="margin">Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> most excellent in the respects of mercie and Maiesty.</note> was principally
in those heauenly respects of mercie &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
wherein I thinke she was most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and without comparison; the which,
like two hands she applied to euerie good
worke of Church and Common-Wealth;
for by her mercie she approued her self most
Christian, and by her Maiestie a most Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely Soueraigne.
In both which respects,
was this Ladie so singular, as if <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture</hi>
had giuen them for ornaments to make
her most excellent, and as if God would
(by her) demonstrate to the world surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
he can make that Creature vpon whom
he shall cast his heauenly ornaments. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe I thinke it disparagement to any
Prince in the world,<note place="margin">Disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that I report <hi>Queene
Elizabeth</hi> most excellent, both because shee
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:8990:133"/>
was so in true estimation; and also for that
it may suffice (for the honour of any prince)
to come neere <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> in these ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
deseruings, she being matchlesse
for mercie vnlesse in the comparison of K.
<hi>Iames</hi> our Soueraigne,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>King</hi> Iames.</note> and her successor
which with her Kingdomes hath inherited
that most gratious indument. But for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
she was neuer exceeded,<note place="margin">The Queene matchlesse for Maiestie.</note> neither can I
giue that comparison without wrong to
<hi>Queene Elizabeth,</hi> and flatterie to them
whom I should compare her.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, And were I worthie to aduise
in a matter so serious,<note place="margin">An importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t aduise to all Princes.</note> there is no Prince in
the world whom I loue; to whom I doe not
wish this regard of Maiestie, for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more necessarie in the person of a
Prince then <hi>Maiestie,</hi> which when it hath the
moderation of mercie and aduised iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to order it, it is then of most excellent
beauty, and of most speciall vse. Because
where it is thus ordered,<note place="margin">A Reason.</note> it begetteth in
mens hearts an admiration and a Reuerence
to the person of such Maiesty, for common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that which men admire they loue, and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:8990:133"/>
too much familiarity doth oftentimes beget
presumption, and neglect of dutie, neither
is there any thing that doth more incour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
disobedience in Subiects, than remisse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and want of Maiestie in the souereigne.
And this is pretily alluded in the fable of
the frogges,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esop</hi> in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Fables.</note> to whom (dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding a King) <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>
cast into a poole where they were asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
a block which falling with much noise
stroake a terror and a Reuerend feare in the
<hi>Frogges;</hi> but when they perceiued it bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish,
and to want <hi>Maiestie,</hi> leape and insult
ouer it in derision and scorne, hating to giue
their obedience to that which wanted the
Maiestie to command them. And this <hi>Morall</hi>
did <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> well vnderstand, who
most Princelike did euer maintaine the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
of her high place, yet euer with the
wisedome of such moderation,<note place="margin">The queenes moderation.</note> as that her
<hi>Maiestie</hi> was mercifull, and her mercie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesticke,
of these two principalls compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a gouernement most honourable and
vertuous.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Such was this noble <hi>Queene,</hi> and
much more noble than I can report her, who
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:8990:134"/>
before she was <hi>Queene,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Her defence of Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she was Queene.</note> did worthily defend
the profession of the <hi>Catholike Faith,</hi> euen to
the hazard of her princely life. God giuing
her that relish of aduersity, the better to taste
the pleasures of her most happie time which
was to follow. And if the particulars of her
troubles were indifferently considered, she
would be found very constant, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to God-ward; and to haue indured
much for the testimonie of Faith, and to
haue had a glorious Conquest ouer all the
enemies of her religious life.<note place="margin">An euill pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise to disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Queene.</note> First, their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise

Empire the Ladie <hi>Iane,</hi> whereby it was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the inheritance should haue bene conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
another way, and translated into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Succession, which could not haue bene
without apparant danger of her life and her
Sisters; because authority that is vsurped,
cannot bee otherwise secured but by their
death that can make lawfull claime:<note place="margin">Note.</note> yet God
who doth euer protect truth did otherwise
dispose of this great businesse;<note place="margin">Her trouble in her Sisters time.</note> but if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
this with her trouble (in the time of her
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:8990:134"/>
Sisters gouernement) the comparison will
make this little, and that monstrous; she ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
indured so much for the tryall of her
Faith, as may well approue her to bee most
valiant in Christian patience, and to haue
worthily defended the profession of the
<hi>Catholike Faith,</hi> before shee was made De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendresse;

in verse; and therefore in this place I
forbeare to make particular Narration of
that which formerly I haue declared. And
in this I receiue speciall contentment, that
in my knowledge of this Souereigne La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> I dare confidently
report to haue found more (in the trauell

                  <p>Secondly, There is this difference in the
punishments of good and euill men, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and eternall; the good mans temporall
punishment must of necessity end; the euill
mans spirituall punishment hath an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting

all men to taste of both cups, but with

her cares to the vse of mercie and vertuous
deeds, casting vpon the generall face of this
Nation, her heauenly aspect and influence,
which (in the blacke time of her Sisters go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement)
lay in the shadow of darkenesse
and blacke obscurity. And as the neerest to
her Religious heart she beginneth (being of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:8990:136"/>
important consideration) first with Gods
cause <hi>Religion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Her first care for Religion. A loue prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium.</note> laying that for her foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

vnderstood, there was nothing could sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
her in the true estimation of honour
and vertuous liuing but <hi>Religion</hi> without the
exercise whereof, all other things are vitious
and of euill merit. And therefore did she pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
this end with a most stedfast resolution,
daring to doe any thing (were it neuer so
hazerdous) that might aduantage it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing
euery impediment, which any way
might hinder the prosperity of that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
And because she found the bodie of
her State dangerously wounded by disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">The queenes care to cure the diseased State.</note>
and euill gouernement, she therefore
(very carefully, and skilfully) applieth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
remedie, least otherwise the disease

first the generall cause of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth,
before any particular end

               <p>Secondly, The euidence of this her holy
and princely care is most apparant in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
of Religion, to that <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,</hi>

haue for euer banished from the bonds of
great <hi>Brittaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, And in this hath <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi>
very fortunately defended the <hi>Catholike
Faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matched by Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth.</hi>

princely brother K. <hi>Edward,</hi> (who but for her)
may be thought (for his holy care) singular
and without comparison.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To reckon vp the particulars of
<hi>Queene Elizabeths</hi> merit, were a needlesse tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
both because I cannot so report them
as they are worthly, and also because they
are yet visible in the view of the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

wherein (we hope) it will be euer continued
in his hopefull posterity.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This noble beginning of <hi>Queene

of the <hi>Catholike Faith,</hi> that being (by report)
made knowne to the world, was a cause that

from that Doctor, who therefore did applie
her first cares to this principall end, for which
God did succeed her in others; for it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
true, that he that seeketh God,
shall finde all his necessarie things though
he seeke them not.</p>

her resolute purpose how in the

in her selfe Religious, and had this <hi>Pollitique</hi>

hope and feare shift places, for that did
satisfie the expectation of her friends, which
in such case is doubtfull, and preuent the
forward hopes of the contrary faction, which
in all such alterations is ouer-daring.</p>

that their vse and acquaintance, make men
valiant and able to vndergoe all fortunes,
for it is possible to make pleasure of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,

                  <p>Fourthly, It is a commendable pride, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly
to esteeme ourselues in our aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

               <head type="sub">Of certaine considerations, which in

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST, It may seeme strange to
many that their should bee any
consideration able to diswade
from doing well or that any by-respect
should be so respected, as to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
the purpose of one resolued to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cares. And this in truth were strange, if
common experience did not teach vs other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.<note place="margin">Experience.</note>
For it is often times seene that such
men who haue gained fauour in generall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
and are assuredly thought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
and most resolute, in that wherein
they are so reputed, doe notwithstanding
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:8990:139"/>
fall off from this their reputed Constancie,
and yeeld themselues ouercome by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of dishonest and by considerations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And therfore is their iudgement
much deceiued who belieue that any thing
in this world is of that assurednes, &amp; vnuaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie,<note place="margin">Nothing that is earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is free from incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie.</note> as that no time, nor any perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
can altar. For the most excellent men, &amp;
the most excellent vertues of men, are not
supported by their owne power, or by any
earthly assistance, but by the hand of God
only: in so much that when this most absolute
power, shall not supply to any particular, the
strength of such a one is but weakenes, &amp; his
constancie but faintnes;<note place="margin">God the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly supporter of mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.</note> because (without
this heauenly prop) he cannot support the

he and they must incline to bad alteration:
if then the question were demanded, what
should be the condition of all men? I would
answer, to bee constant in their holy purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:<note place="margin">The nature of all men.</note>
but if it be demanded what is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of all men? I answer, that all of all

of best reputation, doe it not by their own<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

power, neither haue they power to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
that state, but naturally cast themselues
from those deseruings whereunto God hath
raised them. Be it therefore the euerlasting
honour of their names, who haue valiantly
resisted the power of those earthen tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and haue had their regardfull eyes to
holy and Religious ends onely. And such
was <hi>Queene Elizabeth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> most constant.</note> who (in respect of her
dangerous fortunes, was assuredly much
tempted to these earthly regards, the which
she nothing regarded in comparison of her
heauenly cares, whereto she was wholly and
assuredly deuoted.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, And therefore I report not
what could, but what would haue diswaded
the <hi>Queene</hi> (in respect of <hi>Policie)</hi> from refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Religion; and I will plainly expresse
my selfe in this particular, because I would
most gladly auoid the euil of misconceiuing
which commonly ariseth from doubtful vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.<note place="margin">To auoid the misco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiuing</note>

neuer fainted in the care shee had vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:8990:140"/>
for Religion, but euer continued her
course in one resolute passage, and euer
trauelled therein with much prosperity
and honour; yet there wanted not many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
of <hi>Policie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Yet much tempted by state conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</note> and state considerations,
which might haue allured her, from her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
constancie, and haue made her more
remisse and colde in the pursuit of her holy
businesse; such as heretofore haue altered
the strongest purposes of other Christian
Princes, and such as would haue altered the
Queene her selfe, had not God (by the
power of his Grace) giuen her extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
supportations. For (as I haue said) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Pollicie respect not alwaies one
end,<note place="margin">Religion &amp; Pollicie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect diuers ends.</note> neither doe they worke by one and
the same meanes. And though in Christian
Common-Wealths it is most needfull that
Religion order state,<note place="margin">Religion ought to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der state.</note> and that Christian
Princes suffer themselues to be directed by
the Law of God, and by the dutie of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;<note place="margin">Religion is peruerted and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wrested to maintaine vnlawfulnes.</note>
yet in the practise of many states it is
otherwise, where the truth of Religion is
peruerted, and the sense of Scripture wre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sted,
to maintaine the vnlawfull vse of such
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:8990:141"/>
state practises, as (in the truth of holy
iudgement) are most damnable.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This truth is euident in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
of such Christan States,<note place="margin">In Popish states.</note> whereby
license, dispensation and pardons, men may
adulterate, lye and Murther, and by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of their lawes, commit such outrage as
(in the iudgement of Gods Law) is death:<note place="margin">Regards of state.</note>
and these are regards of State, which (for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
and profit) tollerate and protect
those things, which (in the stricktnesse of
<hi>Conscience)</hi> are altogether vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>It is euident then both by generall obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
and by speciall instance that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Princes haue many earthly prouocations
to withdraw them from the zealous pursuite
of holy &amp; Religious purposes, and that God
onely is able to support the best, and most
worthie, from dishonourable recusancie; and
from retyring from those diuine seruices,
whereunto they haue with great hope and
much acclamation entred.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, And in this noble deseruing hath
<hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> exceeded many of her prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely
predecessors; and therefore I report
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:8990:141"/>
this as one the chiefe of all her honourable
deeds,<note place="margin">One of the chiefe of Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> honourable deeds.</note> whereby she hath well declared her
selfe beloued of God, constant in her holy
purpose, and best able to defend the holy
quarrell of the <hi>Catholike Faith.</hi> For by this
victorie she had of her selfe,<note place="margin">The victorie she had of her selfe.</note> she hath done
that which all the world could not doe; God
hauing made her inuincible, and not to be
conquered but by her selfe.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, To relate the seuerall conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of state were much trauell &amp; imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to this busines; because the number of
them is great, &amp; for the much diuersity, they
altering according to the variable gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of state, and as the alterations of time
would make them vseful. I wil therfore (on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
report some few which at this time, and
in this state were very considerable.<note place="margin">The first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of State.</note> And first
the alteration the State indured by the Q.
altering <hi>Religion:</hi> for she could not but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that her new forming the order
of Religion in her Kingdomes,<note place="margin">The danger of altering Religion.</note> (was in
the wisedome of State) very hazerdous;<note place="margin">A Reason.</note>
because thereby she must needs discontent
the greater number of her subiects, whereby
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:8990:142"/>
shee became subiect to the displeasure of her
owne people, and lesse able to suppresse the
disobedience of such as should dare to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
against her. For at this time the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion</hi> (to which the Queene was
zealously deuoted) had not equall greatnes
in this Kingdome, with that of the Romish,
the <hi>Papist</hi> exceeding the <hi>Protestant</hi> in
Number and power.<note place="margin">The Queene made choise of the weaker to assist her against the stronger.</note> And therefore the
Queene (in her election) made choise
of the weaker and lesse able part, to support
her against her better prouided enemies.
And this shee would not haue done, if shee
had yeelded to this perswasion of State, or
had regarded the dignity of her temporall
life,<note place="margin">Her holy trust.</note> more than the honour and dignity of
her Christian Name. But she that could not
be ouercome with euill, ouercame this euill
temptation, and resisted the power thereof
by her vertue and godly constancie.</p>
               <p>Eighthly,<note place="margin">The second State consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration was the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in finishing</note> Againe, the Q in thus altering
the State of Religion, did attempt a matter
very difficult, and of no easie performance,
and this she might vnderstand by her iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
in <hi>Philosophie,</hi> &amp; by obseruing the course
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:8990:142"/>
of all naturall things. For we see that those
things which moue themselues,<note place="margin">An argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature</note> in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are carried with lesse veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
then those that are moued by violent &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
meanes. And the body of this kingdome
(at that time of the Q. entering the state) mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
in the fauour of romish religion, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it had formerly moued for many yeares,
could not without much violence and great
difficultie be moued against that customary
motion,<note place="margin">The impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of this consideration</note> nor be forced to retire backe in the
same steps, wherein it had formerly procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
and therfore this difficulty in finishing
was a consideration of state, which (in respect
of state) might haue diswaded the Q. holy
care from the reforming of religion, &amp; which
would haue preuailed with any prince in the
world, who had regarded the felicity of their
temporal life, more than the honour of God
or the prosperity of the <hi>Catholike Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ninthly,<note place="margin">Third con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration. The displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> the discontentment of her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; the displeasure of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of Christian princes, was a speciall
consideration, and such as that nothing but
grace could be able to withstand, for it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:8990:143"/>
&amp; natural in the Natures of Princes,

is most behoofull for the security of their

such forreigne power, as (in the discretion of
state) is thought to be of most conueniency,
both to aduance the glory of their nation, &amp;
to aduantage them against their most feared

doubtlesse haue diswaded her holy cares,
had her cares bene any other than holy.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, But this Noble Defendresse of
the Faith, howsoeuer shee vnderstood as
much in the wisdome of State,<note place="margin">The queenes constancie.</note> as anie other
Prince than liuing. Yet would she not be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by that wisdome, but (like her selfe, a
most Christian Princesse) shee contradicts
<hi>Pollicie with Pietie.</hi> And she whose Religious
Iudgement might and could teach her, that
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:8990:144"/>
God was able to support her Princely State
against all opposition, and to supply to al her
necessities would (not for any State conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration)
distrust the mighty power of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence,
or forsake the safetie of his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for any cause whatsoeuer. For shee
knew well that God was altogether as able
to preuaile with the lesse as with the greater
number, and that he was not like man, to

for without meanes can he effect whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

as <hi>Sampson</hi> strong in God,<note place="margin">Sampson.</note> could with

vanquished not a thousand onely, but
many thousands of Gods enemies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Pollitique.</note> In state reason it may seeme ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
for the <hi>Queene</hi> to alter the State of

heauenly exercise, whereof hee himselfe is
wonderfully contented, gladding his most
sacred diuinity, that in <hi>Mercie</hi> hee doth tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
and that his mercie hath the greatest
part in all his workings.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And as this respect of mercie
hath preheminence in the Nature of God,<note place="margin">Mercie hath prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the nature of God.</note>
so hath it also in the reformed natures of
good men, who desire (principally) to
square themselues to this most holy propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And in this gratious respect of mercie
hath <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> equalled the best
Princes that euer were so rarely was this
Queene composed of <hi>Mercie</hi> and <hi>Maiestie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> very mercifull.</note>
as that in <hi>Maiestie</hi> she may iustly be reputed
most excellent, &amp; yet in <hi>Mercie</hi> more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
than in <hi>Maiestie;</hi> the which she would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
declare (euen) to the enemies of her life
and soule: For often would she reach her
hands of fauour to them whose hands were
euer readie to her destruction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">An admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree of Mercie.</note> This truth
is most euident in the view of her gratious
gouernement, who abhorred their death,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:8990:147"/>
who most traiterously sought hers, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
such peacefully to enioy their euill
consciences, who practised to destroy her
for her zeale, and constancie in the <hi>Catholike
Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, For if the <hi>Papists</hi> in the time of
<hi>Queene Marie,</hi> or if now in such places where
that Religion is profest, were or had bene so
mercifull in the iudgement of their Lawes,<note place="margin">The mercy of Popish lawes and Papists.</note>
as <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> was the time of her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement;
then had not those times bene
stayned with the crying sinnes of <hi>Blood</hi> and
<hi>Persecution,</hi> neither had the bodies of Saints
perished in that abundance at the holy fires
of <hi>Martyrdome.</hi> May it therefore be for euer
recorded for the honour of <hi>Queene Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi>
name;<note place="margin">How much the Queene hath exceeded her Sister in mercie.</note> that her mercie was more to the
bad, then theirs to the better sort of people;
and that in this most gratious indument, she
is most worthie to bee compared with the
most mercifull Prince that euer was.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The first yeares of her gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may sufficiently proue this her merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
disposition, in which time the fauour of
her hardest Lawes, were such as that her
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:8990:147"/>
greatest enemies (the enemies of her life and
Religion) could not but acknowledge them
very mercifull,<note place="margin">The purpose of the queens Lawes.</note> seeking onely to reforme,
&amp; not to destroy the estate or life of any one.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Vpon this aduantage the euill spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of men, practise against her life and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.<note place="margin">No meanes to reclaime the inuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate enuie of men.</note>
For it is not possible that the inuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
enuie of men, can be satisfied, by any
manner of faire perswasion, or suppressed
by any violent meanes, vnlesse seuerity
reach to the verie life of one so enuious: for
mercie to an euill man maketh him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous,
and seuerity maketh him despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;
So that this disease of enuie is not cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vnlesse God please to doe it. For in this
peacefull time of the Q<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when mercy was so
generally conferd,<note place="margin">Proiects de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised by the Pope.</note> did the <hi>Pope</hi> the enemie
of Faith &amp; the great <hi>Polititian</hi> of the world,
deuise dangerous proiects against the Q. and
the state of Religion in <hi>England,</hi> the which
he prosecuted with much instance, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
the forcible meanes he could deuise The
course he tooke was answerable to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of former <hi>Popes,</hi> anathemating &amp; ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Queene from the hope of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Interdictions</note>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:8990:148"/>
interdicting her Kingdomes, and absoluing
her subiects from the dutie of their naturall
obedience, commanding vpon paine of
damnation to doe that, which in the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods Law is damnation to doe.
This instrument <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pope <hi>Pius</hi> Quintus.</note> sent
ouer into <hi>England,</hi> and according to his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
command was it diuulged and spread
before the generall face of this Kingdome;
whereby many of the <hi>Queenes</hi> people in the
North, and in places of least knowledge and
ciuility, reconcile themselues to the <hi>Popes</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,<note place="margin">The euill effect of the Popes Bull.</note>
and like <hi>Calues</hi> ran wilde after the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
of this curst and cursing <hi>Bull,</hi> sent forth
by the impious <hi>Pope Pius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, The <hi>Queene</hi> and <hi>State</hi> apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the danger of these proceedings, and
knowing how hazzardous it might be to her
life and state, to suffer this violence to passe
without resistance;<note place="margin">A Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Call a Parliament, and
there agree vpon such Statutes, as in their
wisedomes were thought most conuenient,
to preuent the mischiefe intended against
the Queenes life, her State, and the <hi>Catholike
Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:8990:148"/>
Seuenthly,<note place="margin">The cause of the statutes against Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusants.</note> The cause then mouing the
<hi>Queene</hi> and <hi>State</hi> to enact those lawes (which
they call seuerity) was themselues, by reason
of their turbulent and euill spirits desiring
innouation; yea, and inuasion (who) if they
could haue bene content with the benefit of
peace, which they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enioyed, &amp; wherewith
the holy men of all ages haue bene most
gladly contented, they had then preuented
those lawes, which they so much condemne;
neither had they runne their names, nor their
cause of <hi>Religion,</hi> into that suspition of the
State, as by these their treasonable designes
they haue most iustly merited.<note place="margin">Exmalis moribus nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur bona leges.</note> But it is anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and true, that from euill manners are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued
good and wholsome lawes, and they
by desire to harme the state, they did
arme it with wholsome and prouident
lawes, whereby it was made the better able
to preuent and resist their harmefull intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And from their euill is this Good oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned,
that by attempting euill, and by
fayling in that attempt, they haue curbed
their owne power and shortned their owne
hornes, wherewith they and their <hi>Bulls</hi> had
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:8990:149"/>
thought to haue pusht the glory of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And therefore was their Iudgement
an effect of their owne cause, and most iustly
inflicted on them. For God doth retort the
euill purposes of men against the contriuers
of them, and they that make snares and
traps to catch men, are oftentimes snared in
their owne deuises.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, But yet those lawes which they
call seuerity,<note place="margin">The mercy of the queens Lawes.</note> were milde and mercifull, and
not proportionable to the greatnesse of their
offence, neither like in crueltie to the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
lawes in the time of <hi>Queene Maries</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement,
against the constant professors
of the <hi>Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Religion;</hi> the purpose of these
Statutes being to secure the <hi>Queene,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The purpose of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</note> and to
continue her subiects in their dutifull obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,

Religion, but might continue himselfe in
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:8990:149"/>
safety vnder the assured protection of the Q.
&amp; her mercifull lawes, it being the purpose
of the Q. and state to reclaime the disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of her subiects (in respect of Religion)
by faire, and not by forcible meanes, and to
effect that by the gratious meanes of mercy,
which the <hi>Pope</hi> &amp; others lesse merciful, haue
attempted by the violent meanes of <hi>Blood,
fire and Persecution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ninthly,<note place="margin">The slanders of euill and malitious men.</note> It is therefore mallice &amp; a verie
slander to the Q. princely name, that Gods
enemies &amp; hers doe report her a persecutor
of Gods Saints, &amp; that her lawes were bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
&amp; tyrannous, &amp; that many of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
whom they call Saints, haue in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
suffered Martyrdome for the witnes
of their conscience onely,<note place="margin">None haue haue suffered in England for their conscience onely.</note> their being no one
particular person (I think) in all the Q time
that can truly be said thus to suffer death, but
either as actors or abettors of Treason, the
lawes hauing no authority to iudge them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise;
For though by the law they were
rebellious, and disobedient Subiects that
would not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme themselues, to the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:8990:150"/>
by the Law they indured some easie punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to make a difference betweene the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull

Law so strict as to giue the sentence of death

was there any law (before this occasion

               <p>Tenthly, And vnles the prouidence of the

               <p>Eleuenthly, It is wonder then, the <hi>Papist</hi>

               <p>13. And this seuerity in them, is assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly

14. The mercie of our English Lawes
then (in matters concerning Religion one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
is an assured demonstration,<note place="margin">The mercy of English Lawes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> that our

are no weake proofes that our Religion is

people were withdrawne from their Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
beliefe, &amp; from the dutie of their naturall
allegiance. And therefore to preuent this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience
was a care most considerable
for the <hi>Church,</hi> and which (directly) ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the aduancement of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There be also many other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
which in these Statutes, directly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the benefit of the <hi>Church,</hi> all which may
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:8990:154"/>
appeare most euident to any iudgement that

               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Nothing can respect the state lawfully that respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion also.</note> And in truth there is nothing in
a true Christian Common-Wealth, that can
onely direct it selfe to the benefit of <hi>State</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but that <hi>Religion</hi> must withall be respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
the care of <hi>State</hi> being but the bye, and
<hi>Religion</hi> the maine of euery Christian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment.
And therefore oftentimes euen
in those things which seeme most properly
to concerne the <hi>State,</hi> is <hi>Religion</hi> in them
most regarded; the care of <hi>State</hi> in respect
of Religion, being like the care of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,<note place="margin">A compariso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

or which holy men care, but so onely,

deuised both to cut off the euill members al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

went; and to infect the whole with the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie

There are these and many other respects,

And among all the sorts of men, these

to support one another in their iust quarrels,

are many things very commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

But where goodnesse and vertuous name is
desired, there men neglect the offer of all
euill occasions, and embrace that onely for

               <p>Thirdly, And in these heauenly respects
of Christian commiseration, we haue good
cause, and so haue many Princes in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,<note place="margin">Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> most compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</note>
to remember <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi>
most mercifull and compassionate; who
did euer entertaine the extremities of distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Christian Princes,<note place="margin">Distressed Christian Princes.</note> and whose hands
were euer armed with valour, and victory, to
support them in their kingly reputations, &amp;
to defend them from the iniuries of their
ambitious &amp; powerful enemies. But because
the number of her princely deseruings in
this kinde were many, and to report them
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:8990:159"/>
would require large circumstance. I will
therefore make choise onely of some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of best memorie, and of most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
such as being knowne may reduce
to memorie the glory and greatnesse of the
<hi>Queenes</hi> actions. And the honour which the
name of <hi>England</hi> hath got in being gouerned
by a Ladie of so matchlesse a reputation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">In respect of Scotland.</note> And as that neerest to vs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of weighty consequence. I remember
<hi>Scotland</hi> first, a kingdome which before her
time, neuer stood assured to the fauour of
<hi>England,</hi> but what by reason of their naturall
discord, and because of the combination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the kingdome of <hi>France</hi> and it; that

we of them; and therefore both of vs haue

and both our Nations haue had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardful
eye to the proceeding of each other:
yet with such wisedome, could those times
order their affaires of <hi>State,</hi> as that these
their disagreements were not hazerdous
to the fortunes of either kingdomes;
but continued for respects of <hi>Pollicie</hi>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:8990:160"/>
insomuch as the Warres of <hi>Scotland</hi> with vs,
were rather emulations than VVarres; and
ours with them were rather for manly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,<note place="margin">Note.</note>
than any desire to subuert or vtterly
ouerthrow the bodie of that <hi>State.</hi> And in
truth it cannot be imagined two Nations so
neere as they are (how euer made friends
by allyance or other friendly entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
could liue without giuing of offence
to one another, nor without many spitefull

of her Christian mercy, could not thus
bound her vertues in the limits of an Iland,
neither could she content her selfe that she
had done well, but delighteth to continue

the greatnesse of her mercifull regard; that
notwithstanding that Nation had bene the

though the <hi>Queene</hi> her selfe was lawfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested
into the title of that Crowne,<note place="margin">A princely regard.</note> yet
would she not take aduantage of these op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,

               <p>Seuenthly,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> And if any one obiect, the

&amp; opposed the prosperity of her owne

deuiseth not how to inlarge her owne king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but how the kingdome of God
might by her be any way aduanced. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that then the <hi>French King</hi> did declare
himselfe to professe the <hi>Protestant Religion.</hi>
she therfore thought it the office of her high

&amp; she a name of honour that wil liue for euer

               </p>
               <p>Eighthly, Another instance of the <hi>Queenes</hi>

               <p>Ninthly, And though this businesse had

God otherwise disposing it, yet doth
not that diminish, the Queenes gratious

because (as I haue said) no Prince

the fortune of the day which is alway

(in iudgement to that people) would not
suffer the <hi>Queenes</hi> good purpose to preuaile,<note place="margin">The doubt of <hi>Anthonies</hi> title.</note>
neither doe all men agree on the lawfulnesse

yet the <hi>Queene</hi> is not to be blamed for taking

himselfe such an enemie to the Queene and

               <p>Tenthly The <hi>Queene</hi> therefore had a

though she failed in finishing, yet was
her purpose good, and doth merit to bee
ranked among her other honourable deeds,<note place="margin">A reason for the Queenes excuse.</note>
&amp; because it was done principally in fauour

of a distressed Christian Prince to relieue

it deserueth so much the more of honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

an effect caused by the <hi>Queenes</hi> most grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
disposition.</p>
               <p>Eleuenthly, A fourth instance of the
<hi>Queenes</hi> gratious fauour to forraigne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
is <hi>Belgica</hi> the <hi>States</hi> of the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries<note place="margin">The States of the Low-Countries.</note>
where the <hi>Queene</hi> hath done so much as
hath made her famous in all the world,
receiuing those little pettie <hi>States</hi> into her

time the greatest Prince in Christendome,

King</hi> to assist his rebellious subiects against
him (for so they repute the States of the

For though I will not dispute the
title of the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> to these Countries,
being impertinent both to me, and to this
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:8990:163"/>
Historie,<note place="margin">The answer.</note> yet may it assuredly be concluded
that the <hi>Queene</hi> a godly and religious <hi>Ladie,</hi>
at that time ordered by as wise and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a Counsell as was in Christendome,
would not rashly haue entred into any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonourable
quarrell, or haue done ought
in the generall view of the world, that stood
not with the reputation of her princely

who best vnderstood the <hi>Queenes</hi> nature,<note place="margin">The queenes nature.</note>

               <p>13. And though it be iudged that the states
were <hi>Rebells</hi> to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A second reason of the Queenes doings.</note> yet consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the full opposition of that time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> it may seeme
reasonable in the <hi>Queene</hi> to take this aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
offered by the Low-Countries, and
to protect them for the security of her owne
peace, aswell because of their conformity in
Religion, as also for the better disinabling
of her mortall enemie, who by all contriue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
sought the detriment of her state.<note place="margin">Note.</note> And
besides there is a great difference in them,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:8990:164"/>
who moue Rebellion, and them, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
Rebells being moued to opportune
purposes, especially considering the enmity
of him against whom they Rebell.</p>
               <p>14. And this I write to answer the euill
rumors of such men, who are most ready
to traduce the Queenes most honourable
deseruings.<note place="margin">Euill men readie to traduce the Queene.</note> For neither do I condemne the
<hi>States</hi> for Rebells, neither do I acquite them
of that imputation, but onely answere for
the honour of <hi>Queene Elizabeth:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The offence betweene En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland and Spaine a sufficient reason for these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</note> that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer

Low Countries and <hi>Spaine,</hi> the offence was
so great betweene vs, and the Spaniard, as
may seeme to iustifie the <hi>Queene</hi> in her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.
And therefore they who calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate
and bite her name causelesse; doe like
<hi>Doggs,</hi> who barke against the Sunne, which
in despight of enuy and them, will for euer
shine vpon the face of the earth, and her

               </p>
               <p>15. Therefore I dare boldly conclude,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:8990:164"/>
that in this particular of the Low Countries
the <hi>Queen</hi> did that was very iustifiable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the circumstance of the Spannish
warres, and considering with what honour
it hath beene done, shee hath merited the
highest honour, that victorie and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
armes can deserue.<note place="margin">The Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards &amp; the States can both report the Queenes victories.</note> And this truth (no

them know her well) vnlesse that enuie, and
the remembrance of former quarrels
prompt them with false constructions.</p>
               <p>16. In these, and in many other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
hath the <hi>Queen</hi> declared her selfe a most

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST, It is most true, that they
who defend Gods quarrell, shall
in their iust quarrells bee defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by him, and they who denie
him in any seruice, them will he denie the
fauour of his protection. For as God is most
Iealous of his honour, and hateth to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded
of his Creature, so is he wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
contented in the faithfull seruices of
men, abhorring (in his diuine Nature) not
to double the recompence of such reward.<note place="margin">God the best recompencer of deserts.</note>
And therefore when God giueth comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:8990:166"/>
he giueth them with promise to
reward the obseruers of them,<note place="margin">God most as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured in his promises.</note> whereby ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men haue beene euer comforted with this
assurance, that God is most assured in his
promises, it being impossible to his diuine
Nature, to be either forgetfull or vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Na (rather) so delighted he is with obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
that (most carefully) he apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
euery little seruice of men,<note place="margin">Gods reward</note> to reward it
with infinite of benefits.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this truth is knowne both by
holy examples, and by testimonies most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">In the queens particular.</note>
it is knowne also in the Queenes parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
whom God did wonderfully protect
against all the power of <hi>Hell</hi> &amp; <hi>Earth.</hi> For I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly

so that there was no weapon, which in

the wisedome of diuellish art,<note place="margin">Gods speciall prouidence for the Queenes safetie.</note> might destroy
her, but it was brandished against her, yet did
God stand betweene her &amp; danger, and bare
off many times the blow of death, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
when the destroyers arme was heaued
against her; and such as haue bene solemnly
sworne to destroy her, and haue vowed their
resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by taking the Sacrament, &amp; though
the opportunities of time and place serued
them; yet in the very act haue they fainted,

themselues against her, withall their

God leade her thorow all those dangers, and
made her trauell an honourable length of
daies, and then giue vp her soule in peace to
his hands who had so wonderfully prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
her.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">It is in vaine to resist the power of God.</note> It was therefore fruitles and vaine
to contriue against her whom God would
defend, &amp; by whose mighty deliuerance he
had declared himself to fauour her; some of
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:8990:167"/>
which particulars I will remember, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall

the time of her Sisters gouernement is
common to euery mans knowledge; &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I need not report the manner of that,
nor the manner of her Christian suffering it:
yet this is worthy of obseruation that (at
that time) God did suffer her enemies to
preuaile far,<note place="margin">Her enemies could not preuaile to her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</note> but not to her destruction, and
it may seeme wonderful, that considering Q.
<hi>Marie</hi> did rule the <hi>State,</hi> and <hi>Stephen Gardiner</hi>
the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> did rule her, &amp; that
both of them did most perfectly hate Q <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth:</hi>
how the <hi>Queene</hi> could possibly auoid
their euill malice.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, And though it be obiected that
because of <hi>Queene Elizabeths</hi> innocence,<note place="margin">An obiection.</note>
                  <hi>Queene Mary</hi> and the <hi>Bishop</hi> could not haue
haue their purpose,<note place="margin">The answer.</note> it is otherwise: For the
displeasure of a Prince disposed to Reuenge,
can in the fairest life finde foule occasions.
And when authority hateth the person of
any one,<note place="margin">Note.</note> it is most easie to brand them with
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:8990:167"/>
offences. And this could <hi>Stephen Gardiner</hi>
well vnderstand, who had profited as much
and more in the learning of pollicie than in
piety, and holy wisedome. And therefore
though the <hi>Queenes</hi> innocence was a cause
of her safetie,<note place="margin">The queenes innocence was a cause, but not the onely cause of her safetie.</note> yet was there a greater cause
(the fauour of God) which did defend her
against the power of <hi>Pollicie,</hi> which her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
could not doe.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">After she was Queene.</note> after she was <hi>Queene,</hi> when the

againe with greater furie, the <hi>Pope</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

from their obedience: deposing the

of the fauour of <hi>Romish Religion,</hi> did some

raise Rebellious Armes against the <hi>Queene</hi>

Thirdly,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> and if any man obiect, that the
<hi>Queenes</hi> nominating the Kings Maiestie at
her death to inherit her kingdomes, was of
small merit in the <hi>Queene,</hi> and of no furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to the Kings cause, because (of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity)
the inheritance must haue discended
to the King, it being his Maiesties in <hi>Iustice,</hi>
and by the right of Law.<note place="margin">Answer.</note> I answer, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
it is most true of the Kings inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and that it could not rightfully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
to any other: yet considering the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
was had to the person of the <hi>Queene,</hi>
and the interest she had in the hearts of all
her subiects, it had bene dangerous if she had
nominated any other to succeed her; and it
was her speciall prouidence, that at that
time she named the King to this inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Another obiection.</note> againe, there are others who
haue blamed the <hi>Queene</hi> for not publishing
this her good purpose to the King in her life
time, and haue thought that the open ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
thereof, was necessarie
both to further the Kings peaceable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
and to giue satisfaction to the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
mindes of the <hi>Queenes</hi> subiects,<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:8990:173"/>
vnlearned people being the greater part
of the body of this Land, and seeing they
could not themselues satisfie this doubt, it
was needfull they should be instructed, in
the Kings lawfull title to the Crowne, and
that publike Proclamation should haue
bene made (in the <hi>Queenes</hi> life time) to that
end, lest the simplicity of the common
people (when occasion might need them)
should be abused by false vnderstanding, and
drawne from their dutifull seruice, which
could not haue bene, if the <hi>Queene</hi> before
hand, had declared the King her Successor,
and lawfull heyre.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">The answer.</note> I answer, these reasons are weake
and of little consideration, and that the
<hi>Queene</hi> and her Counsell, had many weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
reasons to diswade this publique proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the Kings right in the <hi>Queenes</hi> time.
And these reasons haue respect to the safetie
of the Queene and her state, and to the King
and his title. For by this meanes the King
himselfe had care, not to discontent the
Queene but to continue his Grace in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> estimation. Againe, it preuented
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:8990:173"/>
enuie, and the danger of conspiracies of such
who haue bene named for competitors.
Lastly, it was a meanes to preserue the
<hi>Queenes</hi> reputation among her subiects, a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
great part whereof, would haue bene giuen
the King before it was due, if he had bene
proclaimed heyre apparant to the <hi>Queene</hi>
and Crowne, which might haue proued
dangerous to his person, and dangerous to
the state of these kingdomes. For great men
and the great spirits of men being intitled
to much wealth and great dignities, haue not
many times the patience to attend their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
times, but preuent time and take it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand, the which though it was most false
in the kings particular, yet was it needfull
the wisedome of <hi>State</hi> should then regard
it. And therefore did <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> that
which was most reasonable in it selfe, most
considerable for the king and the <hi>State</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> and most conscionable for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge

this did God with such admirable demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of his fauour, as that his Maiestie and

cause to remember it for euer most thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully:
whose life God did wonderfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue,
and whose fortunes hee did highly

and this was done with such prosperity and
forward successe,<note place="margin">The Kings forward suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.</note> that the report of the Q.
death was scarce named in our neighbour
kingdomes, but this report of the kings
peaceable entrance, was farre off generally

outstripping the euill newes of the

men, and to the admiration of all men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:8990:178"/>
Seuenthly,<note place="margin">The King at his entring had no vse for weapon but to giue honour.</note> neither was there need (as it
was thought) that the King and his Subiects

themselues into the hazard of vncertaine

indured wrong, and <hi>Truth</hi> haue stood at the

for neither was there any to lift vp his

did or might deserue them.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, And thus did God giue vs life

there was little or no ground for any

               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The successe failed.</note> And howsoeuer the successe of
this came short of common expectation, yet
was this of much more likelihood then the
other, both because their controuersie was
not for the matter of <hi>Religion:</hi> but for order
and for the manner of Ceremonie and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance

                  <note place="margin">Church of Scotland.</note> had

his <hi>Maiestie</hi> finding the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
(as it was established) to be the meane

as both of them pretended, and

               <p>Fourthly, And this may worthily seeme

should both of them at one time, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

these who neuer consent in any little resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance,

one particular person.<note place="margin">The reason.</note> And the reason was
the seuerall perswations they had of the
truth of their cause, wherein the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

satisfaction in themselues, and hopefully
belieue to worke the King to that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement

so much of the wisdome of his Spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he was able to iudge and determine this

able to iudge betweene light and darknes,
Truth and falsehood, Order and disorder,

make particular choice,<note place="margin">The Kings choice.</note> confirming
the doctrine of true Religion, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable

                  <note place="margin">His Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> did declare

               <p>Sixthly, And the body of this kingdome,
hauing the disease of disobedience in the

               <p>Eleuenthly, I conclude then that the

and (with horror) affright the hearts
of tyrants and bloody practisers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and for <hi>Scotland</hi> first (to omit

to bee named both for the rarenesse of the

               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">At the Queenes death.</note> at the <hi>Queenes</hi> death also did
God wonderfully assist the King, and fauour
the prosperity of his fortunes, for at that
time, when the enemies of our <hi>State,</hi> and

the enemies of our <hi>Faith</hi> did hopefully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue

               <p>Fourthly, that neuer to be forgotten trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

               <p>Fifthly, By these particulers out of many,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:8990:189"/>
may appeare how God did wonderfully
protect the person of that King;<note place="margin">God wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the King.</note> suffering
him to enter so farre into danger, as that he

<pb n="365" facs="tcp:8990:189"/>
al diuersity, iudging such for propha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e
&amp; out of Gods protection, that conspire not
with them, in their opinion of Religion.<note place="margin">The names of Christian and heathen odious to one another.</note> And

odious to them, they iudging vs, and we
iudging the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Anathemates, &amp; cursed people.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians among themselues and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then among themselues deuided.</note> neither is this contention one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in these opposites of Christian and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then;
but the heathen among themselues,
and the Christians among themselues, are
deuided into many bitter differences, the
<hi>Turke</hi> against the <hi>Persian</hi> &amp; both against the
<hi>Iew,</hi> and so in many other particulars of the
barbarous people.<note place="margin">Among the Christians.</note> Among the <hi>Christians</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

against the <hi>Papist,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Puritan</hi> against
them both, besides many other subdiuisions.
So that the Christians in these times, haue as
many seuerall Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as the old heathen &amp;
Pagans had Gods,<note place="margin">Christians now haue as manie Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions as the Pagans had Gods.</note> and that Idolatrie which
the people of the old world committed by
hauing multiplicity of Gods did the people
of these times co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit by their multiplicity of
Religions. For it is al one to deny God, and
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:8990:190"/>
to denie his seruice, and Idolatrie is aswell
in false worship, as in no worship. For as
God is one &amp; but one,<note place="margin">One God, one Truth, one Religion.</note> so there is one Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and but one, whereto all creatures owe
their obedience. And that men might not
preuaricate or alter the forme of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,<note place="margin">God hath prescribed an order for his seruice.</note>
hath God himselfe prescribed vs a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
forme, how and in what forme wee
should serue him, damning all diuersity to
this his owne order, wherewith he is onely
pleased, and wherewith he is alway pleased.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The reason why Religion is so deuided.</note> the reason then why Religion is
thus deuided in the Christian world, is the
many seueral constructions of Gods Word,
whereby it is both diuersly and doubtfully
vnderstood; euery man adhering to that
sence of Scripture, as to his iudgement doth
seeme most resonable. And from hence it is
that these two maine diuisions of Religion,
the <hi>Protestant</hi> and the <hi>Papist,</hi> subdeuide
themselues againe into many differences,
especially the Religion of Poperie. For
proofe whereof, we may remember that the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath deuided itselfe into so
many quarrel some disputations, that searce
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:8990:190"/>
two <hi>Colledges</hi> conspire one truth after one
manner;<note place="margin">The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the learned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</note> Nay, and the best learned among
them, contradict, and haue damned the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of one another, this hath bene well
declared by many arguments of sufficient
proofe:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctor</hi> Morton.</note> in the Learned writings of a Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Doctor of this Church, and which is
now very lately declared by their own disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements,
concerning the lawfulnesse of
taking the Oath of Allegiance;<note place="margin">Bellarmine <hi>and</hi> Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</note> in which
Controuersie the <hi>Pope</hi> and his great Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> oppose against their Arch-Priest
Master <hi>Blackwell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is also worthie of memorie,
that diuers of them in <hi>Queene Elizabeths</hi> time
being prisoners at <hi>Wisbitch,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wisbitch.</note> were deuided
with so much hatred, as might seme impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
the quarrell being for superiority be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the <hi>Iesuites</hi> and <hi>Secular Priests,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iesuites and Secular Priests.</note> began
at <hi>Wisbitch,</hi> but sithence spread ouer all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,
neither doe I thinke, will euer
peaceably be compounded, a matter rare
that men professing one Religion and one
Faith,<note place="margin">Note.</note> prisoners in one place, and being by
the Law dead men, and onely continued
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:8990:191"/>
there by the mercie of a gratious Prince,
should thus bitterly contend about priority
and greatnesse of place. And therefore it is
most euident,<note place="margin">In the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity.</note> that in that Religion of
<hi>Poperie</hi> wherein they so much boast of
vniformity and generall consent, there
are many Sects and many bitter disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deuided.</note> and for the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi>
(whereof I esteeme most reuerently) that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
is full of much diuersity, the vaine glorious
spirits of men disturbing the peace of that
Church, which hath flourished with much
prosperity. And these diuersities like a ciuill
warre, (and therefore a dangerous
warre) haue more indammaged the cause of
Religion,<note place="margin">The hurts of diuided Religion.</note> then all the other enemies in the
world euer could doe, which by reason of
singularity and strange doctrine, (with which
the grosse numbers of people are wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contented) they haue got a false reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the world of holinesse, and thereby
draw from the vnity of the Church
numbers of the basest sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:8990:191"/>
Sixthly,<note place="margin">No meanes to reclaime these disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</note> It were needlesse to reckon
vp the seuerall names of these Scismes, they
are to well knowne in this Nation, whose
peeuish obstinacie hath bene such, as that
neither Law, nor mercy neuer yet could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime.<note place="margin">Obiections of the Papists.</note>
And whereas it is obiected by the
enemies of our Faith, that because of these
diuersities, therefore our Religion is not
good.<note place="margin">Answer. Diuersity in all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> I answer, the argument is sencelesse,
because (as I haue proued) this diuersity is
in all Religions, and in theirs most who
most obiect against vs.<note place="margin">Diuersity in the Iewish Church.</note> Againe, wee all
know that the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Iewes</hi> was the
true Church of God, yet in that <hi>Church</hi>
also was there much diuersity,<note place="margin">The doctrine of the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces.</note> for the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces</hi>
did denie the resurrection, which is a
fundamentall point of Religion, whereas
our greatest differences are onely for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
and order. And therefore this
their argument of diuersity, doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
against the truth of Religion, for the
corne may bee good, which lyeth
mingled with Chaffe, and so must the
<hi>Church</hi> of GOD lie vntill the day of
Iudgement; when as <hi>Christ</hi> shall come
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:8990:192"/>
with his Fanne, and Seauer the good &amp; bad,
which in the meane time must lie in one
heape, in one Church, and in one professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or name of <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seuenthly,<note place="margin">The Kings desert in this respect of vnity.</note> in this respect of vnity did the
King most noblely defende the <hi>Catholike
Faith,</hi> disclaiming the enemies on both
hands, the proud <hi>Papist</hi> and the peeuish
<hi>Puritan:</hi> and like a most Christian Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
King he directed himself to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
placed as hee was crucified, betweene
these two Thieues,<note place="margin">The true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is like Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two Thieues.</note> who (like two extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties)

And let it be the prayers of euery true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
