            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>FEw Authors do agree about the true definition of Marriage. <hi>Charron,</hi> in his book of Wiſdom, calls it a wiſe Bargain, and an honourable Contract; others, more Critical, tell us that it is a name importing noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but meer Slavery and Bondage, a Society of evils and troubles. I think it not worth the while to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſeveral Opinions about the right Definition of it, much leſs to paſs my cenſure upon the ſentiments of any man. I ſhall content my ſelf with the Definition commonly approved by all the judicious Civilians, which ſay that Marriage is no other thing than

an holy union of the man with the woman, which cannot be diſſolved, but by the death of the one or the other. <hi>Matrimonium eſt viri &amp; mulieris conjunctio, individuam vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae ſocietatem continens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the firſt and moſt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all other States and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the World, ſeeing it deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth its inſtitution from no other than from the the Supream Author of Nature. It is alſo the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſively profitable, ſeeing that it is the foundation of all humane ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the riſe of families, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the off-ſpring of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths and Kingdoms. <hi>Prima ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietas in coniugio eſt, quod prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium Urbis, ſeminarium Reipub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licae.</hi> And although the holy and truly Catholick Church never reckoned it in the number of Sacraments, yet was it ever eſteemed as a ſacred ordinance, ſeeing it was inſtituted by God himſelf, in the Paradiſe of <hi>Eden,</hi> and that the Second Perſon
<pb facs="tcp:108995:4"/>
of Deity, being manifeſted in the fleſh, did not only vouchſafe to honour it with his preſence, but alſo with his firſt miracle.</p>
            <p>But although Marriage be Common to all the Nations in the World, yet it is not regulated by the ſame Laws, nor celebrated in the ſame Forms and Ceremonies, they varying accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the diverſity of Religions and Nations. Amongſt Chriſtians Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is very ſtrict and ſevere, one man being allowed but one woman: But amongſt the greateſt part of other Religions, Polygamy and Divorce are commonly approved of and practiſed, to the end (as they ſay) that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage be leſs cumberſom, more free and more fruitful. But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great variety of Laws and Ceremonies uſed amongſt ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Nations, yet there is never a Nation under the Cope of Heaven, how barbarous ſoever it be, but cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brateth the ſolemnity of Wedlock, with more than ordinary Ceremonies and feſtival Jollities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:108995:5"/>
This hath induced me to make a diligent Inquiry, into the different Ceremonies, which are practiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Jews, Chriſtians, Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi> and <hi>Idolaters:</hi> Theſe four being the only Religions known in the World. As for the <hi>Jews,</hi> they being the moſt Ancient People, I ſhall begin this ſmall treatiſe with them, humbly ſubmitting my endeavours to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Curious Reader.</p>

               <head>CEREMONIES Obſerved at the MARRIAGES OF THE JEWS. CHAPTER I.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>Jews</hi> commonly marry their Sons at Eighteen years of Age, according to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of their <hi>Talmud,</hi> and ſometimes ſooner, to avoid Fornication; as for the Daughters, they may marry at Twelve years and a Day.</p>
               <p>When the Marriage of the two Parties is agreed upon, many <hi>Jews,</hi> both young and old, aſſemble themſelves in ſome cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed place, where the young <hi>Jews</hi> hold, every one of them, an Earthen Pot in their hands. One of them reads the Contract of Marriage, and gives notice of the day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixt for the Wedding, above all declaring
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108995:6"/>
that the party, who ſhall not ſtand to that which is agreed upon, ſhall pay to the other party, ſuch a Sum of Money, as the Parents of both parties have unanimouſly pitched upon. This being done, they wiſh one another all proſperity and happineſs, and in the mean while all the young <hi>Jews</hi> fling their Earthen Pots on the ground, and break them in pieces, believing this to be a token of great plenty, and future abundance. As they are going out of the ſaid place, there is alwayes one who ſtands at the Door, who gives every one of them a Glaſs of Wine, and ſometimes alſo ſome Sweet Meats. The Rabbi, whoſe Office it isto crave a bleſſing upon the Eſpouſals, takes a a Glaſs full of Wine, and after that he hath bleſſed it, and taſted of it, he imparts the remnant, to the new betrothed Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who, going to their Houſes, ought not to go out of Doors, within eight days after. But during this retreat, many young Bachellors daily reſort to the Houſe of the future Bridegroom, to divert him and make merry with him</p>
               <p>The betrothed Woman is bound to bath her ſelf in cold Water, the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her Marriage: And ſhe is conducted into that Bath, by ſome Women, which make a very great noiſe, to the end that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108995:6"/>
every body may take notice, that ſhe is a betrothed Woman, while ſhe is in the Bath, many of thoſe Women dance and ſing round about her.</p>
               <p>The future Bride-groom ſends to his betrothed Spouſe a Wedding Girdle, garniſhed with Plates of Gold; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed Spouſe doth the like to her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed Husband: But the Girdle, which ſhe muſt ſend him, ought only to be Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Plates of Silver.</p>
               <p>The Wedding day being come, the betrothed Bride make her ſelf as fine as her Husband and ability can permit her, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the faſhion of the <hi>Jews:</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhe is conducted by ſome Women, which ſing before her, into a Room whene they dreſs her head as neatly as they can, other Women in the while ſinging and dancing before her, for to recreate her, thinking by ſo doing, to render to God ſome very acceptable Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>When the Bride-groom muſt receive the Nuptial Bleſſing, four young Bachel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors carry a Canopy, which, being born up upon four ſticks at the four Corners of it, they carry into ſome open place or gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, where the ſolemnity of the Nuptials muſt be performed. The Bridegroom with his Relations, and the Bride with many
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108995:7"/>
Women, together with Muſicians playing on ſeveral Inſtruments, reſort under the ſaid Canopy, and then every one that is preſent at the ſolemnity crieth aloud, <hi>Bleſſed be he that is come.</hi> Then the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom goes three times round about his Bride, and having taken her by the hand, the people caſt ſome Corns of Wheat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them crying, <hi>Increaſe and multiply.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſome places, where People are more wealthy, they uſe to mingle with their Wheat ſome pieces of Silver, which the poorer ſort of <hi>Jews</hi> gather up. The Bride ſtands always at the right hand of her Bridegroom, and beſides it is requiſite that her face be always turned towards the South; for the Rabbins have left a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in their Talmud, that if any perſon place the Bed ſo as her face be towards the South, that then ſhe is like to be the Mother of many Children. The Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi, who joines them in Marriage, ſets, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of the Bride, the end of the hair-cloth, which the Bridegroom wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon his neck; that being done, he takes a Glaſs of Wine, and, ſaying the two prayers which are in the <hi>Mahzor,</hi> after that he hath taſted of it, he gives it to the young Couple to drink. Then, if the Bride be a Maid, they give her drink in a ſtrait
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108995:7"/>
narrow Glaſs; but if ſhe be a Widdow, then ſhe muſt drink in a broad one. Then the Rabbi receiving from the Bridegroom a Ring of Gold without any ſtone in it, he calls in ſome witneſſes, and ſhewing them the ſaid Ring, he enquires of them whether it be of fine pure Gold; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received an anſwer in the affirmative, he then ſets it about the ſecond Finger of the Bride; and having done that, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to read the Contract of Marriage with a loud and intelligible voice. After that he takes another Glaſs of Wine, and praiſing God that the two Parties have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken one another, he preſents them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time with drink; after that the Bridegroom hath drunk up his Glaſs, he with all his ſtrength caſts it againſt the Wall, or againſt the ground, to the end it be all broken in pieces: And this they do for a remembrance of the Deſtruction of the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> In ſome places they uſe to ſtrew aſhes upon the head of the Bridegroom for a Memorial of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which was burnt down; and for this ſame reaſon the Bridegroom weareth a black Hood upon his head, as thoſe are wont to do, who are in long Mourning.</p>
               <p>The Bride hath alſo her head covered with a black Cap, to the end that they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108995:8"/>
may ſhow that they retain ſome marks of ſorrow for the deſtruction of their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; even in their moſt Feſtival Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</p>
               <p>Being Married, they are conducted to the place of Feaſting, where all being ſat, the Bridegroom begins to ſing a very long Prayer; and in the mean while they ſet before the Bride a raw Egg, with a roaſted Hen. Then the Bridegroom carves a little piece of that Hen, which he preſenteth to his Bride; and immediately after the Gueſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well men as women, ſcuffling together, tear the remnant in pieces, and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can ſnatch away the biggeſt part of it is reputed the braveſt of all the company; they ſnatch away from one another, that which they hold in their hands, making fine ſport amongſt themſelves, to make the new married folks merry. As for the raw Egg they fling it at one anothers Faces, and if any Chriſtians be there to look on them, they are like to be finely dawbed with it: Now they ſet this Egg before the Bride, to the end that ſhe may hope to bring forth Children, as eaſily as the Hen lays her Eggs. After all this mirth they lay the Cloath, and cover the Table with Diſhes of all gallant meats, and then few of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member either <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or the Temple.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108995:8"/>
The feaſt being ended, they betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Dance a certain dance, which they call the Nuptial dance, ordained as they ſay by the Commandment of God: the chief and moſt conſiderable perſon of all the company, takes the Bridegroom by the hand, this takes another, this other takes the next, this another and ſo conſecutive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, until there be none left who may dance. The moſt conſiderable amongſt the Women takes alſo the Bride, and they do the ſame amongſt themſelves as the Men do: So that they carry on the work with an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Mirth and Jollity. The Wedding laſts ſometimes eight days: But their Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins ſtrictly forbid them from inviting any Chriſtians, for they think that the good Angels ſeeing them there, would forth with fly away, and the evil ones would preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceed and come in their place.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108995:9"/>
and conſequently incapable of Succeſſion, &amp; of challenging their Parents inheritance.</p>
               <p>The Ceremonies of Marriages amongſt Roman Catholicks are preſcribed by the Councils. The Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> for to prevent all abuſes in Marriages, declareth and pronounceth all Marriages invalid and void, which have not been celebrated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Parſon of the Pariſh of the one or of the other contracting parties. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to the decrees of the Romiſh Church, as ſoon as the contracting Parties are agreed, the Parſons of their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective Pariſhes are bound to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim three Banes on three Sundays, or three Holy days conſecutively, to the end that if any of the Pariſhoners know any lawful cauſe why they may not be joyned together, they may reveal it to the Parſon of the Pariſh. And in caſe no body can alledge any lawful impediment, then both the parties are conducted by their parents into the Parochial Church of the Woman, where they are betroathed by the Parſon of the ſaid Pariſh, who examines them whether they be well contented to be betroathed one to the other, and whether they be not already engaged by promiſe of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to any other perſon or perſons. This is the Ceremonie, which is called Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108995:10"/>
or betroathing, and is nothing proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but a Nuptial preparation, or an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to a future marriage, of which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement neither of the contracted par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties can be releaſed but by the Court of the ordinary, which condemneth him or her that violateth promiſe, to all damages, &amp; expenſces whatever, together with a Fine.</p>
               <p>There be ſome Biſhopricks where they uſe to betroth people as ſoon as they are agreed together, and before the publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the banes.</p>
               <p>The day of marriage being prefixt, the betrothed parties, after they have been at the auricular Confeſſion of their ſins, go to receive the Communion the day before their marriage. The next day they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by their friends to Church, where the parſon of the Pariſh, having asked them their names and ſirnames, asks them, one after another, whether they are content to take one another; He asketh them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides if they be not already engaged by any ſolemn vow, or any promiſe of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and whether they will engage to love and keep fidelity one to another. When to all theſe queſtions they anſwer affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, he then bleſſes a ring, and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen pieces of money, which he gives to the Bridegroom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:108995:10"/>
The Bridegroom ſets the Ring upon the fourth finger of the Brides Right Hand, in ſaying to her, with the Parſon, <hi>with this Ring I thee wed;</hi> then giving her ſome pieces of money, he goes on ſaying, <hi>and with this money I thee endow:</hi> The Bride anſwereth with a compliment ſet down in the Romiſh Ceremonial. Then preſently the Parſon takes the right hands of them both, ſaying; <hi>Et ego conjungo vos in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Patris, Filij &amp; Spiritus Sancti:</hi> He ſprinckleth them, and all the Aſſembly, with Holy Water.</p>
               <p>After the Nuptial Bleſſing, both the new married Folks are bound to hear Maſs with a lighted Taper in their hands, with which they go to kiſs the Offertory, and to preſent the Parſon with Bread and Wine.</p>
               <p>Then, if the new married Folks were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver married before, two of their near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Relations hold a Sheet over their heads, whilſt the Prieſt readeth ſome Prayers over them.</p>
               <p>The Maſs being ended, the Parſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth the Church Regiſter to the new married Couple and to their Relations, to the end that they may ſign and ſeal the Act of Marriage; after that then every one goes away, in the ſame order as they came.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:108995:11"/>
On that Evening before the new marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed folks betake themſelves to their bed, the Parſon, or ſome other Prieſt deputed by him, cometh to bleſs the Nuptial Bed, wherein the Marriage ought to be conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated.</p>
               <p>In the moſt part of <hi>Italy,</hi> they do not uſe to betroth people in the Church; but the contract of Marriage is made in the preſence of the Parſon, then the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Banes followeth, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Solemnization of Marriage, which is celebrated either at Noon, with all Pomp imaginable, or elſe before the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing without any noiſe at all: The Woman being conducted to Church by her Father if living, and if he be dead, by the neareſt of her Relations.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Venice</hi> when any Gentleman is to marry, as ſoon as the contract is made, all other Gentlemen reſort to the houſe of the future Bride, whom they call <hi>Novizza;</hi> the Bridegroom alſo, with his neareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions comes thither: He ſtands at the entry of the Houſe, receiving, with all demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Honour, all his Gueſts, giving them his right hand as a mark of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Affection; The Bride doth do the like to the Women. After the Celebration of Marriage, the Bride enters into a ſplendid
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108995:11"/>
Barge finely deckt, her Hair hanging about her ſhoulders, being ſett in the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent place, that is called, in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>Andar in Trafto;</hi> This they do to the end that every body may take notice that ſhe is a new married Bride, and the Wife of ſuch a Gentleman. But now adays they have left of ſomething of the ancient Cuſtome, for the <hi>Noviżza's</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in their Barges many days, with their Hair plaited very high, much like <hi>Engliſh</hi> Women's high Towers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sicilians</hi> did formerly betroth the Man and the Woman at home, and very often were not married till the Hour of Death, or at the extremity of the one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or of the other Parties: But this was for bidden by the order of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> The eſpouſed woman did alſo uſe to ride through the City with a great Company and Pomp, on horſe-back: But that is now quite left off, ſince the Invention of Coaches. But notwithſtanding the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the foreſaid Council even to this day, as ſoon as the Articles of the Contract are ſigned, the man enjoyes his Spouſe with all liberty, and reaps the ſweet Fruits of Marriage many years ſometimes before the celebration of it.</p>
               <p>At the Weddings of their Country-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108995:12"/>
there is very much dancing, and there is always a great number of Gueſts, as well of the Relations and others, who bring Preſents, after that the Bridegroom hath regaled them three times. Their Feaſts uſually conſiſt of Meats baked in the Oven, and of Kettles full of Rice boiled in Milk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>France</hi> when any one is married, the betrothed man, accompanied with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Friends and other Gueſts, which he hath invited, and as well Men as Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, goes to fetch the Bride to conduct her to Church. The Bridegroom goes firſt in the middle of his neareſt Relations, the young Bachellors, going two by two, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after him, then the married men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their nearneſs of Kin: The Bride follows dreſſed as neatly as her ability and condition can permit, wearing on the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of her Head a little Crown of white Flowers, or Diamonds, &amp; ſometimes of Oriental Pearls. Two of her near Kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men lead her by the Hand, then the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maidens, wearing every one of them a Crown like that of the Bride, march after in the ſame order as the Bachellors. The married Women come in, after all the Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial pomp is ſhut up by the Servants of the Bridegroom, or of the Bride; which come the laſt, carrying the Bread and Wine,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108995:12"/>
which ought to be preſented to the Prieſt! They come from Church in the ſame order as they went, excepting only that the Bachellors conduct the Bride, and the Maidens the Bridegroom.</p>
               <p>In ſome places as ſoon as they are come from Church to the place where the Feaſt is prepared, all the Relations, Friends and Gueſts come thither bringing their Preſents, which they depoſite in a great Charger ſett before the new married Couple for that purpoſe; the Violins, and other Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, playing all the while: In ſome certain places they offer their Preſents the next day after the wedding, and in others they make none at all.</p>
               <p>The Bridegroom never ſits down with others at Table, but the Bride ſitting at the moſt honourable place, he ſtands al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways behind her, taking care to ſerve her, and to order the diſhes upon the Table.</p>
               <p>After the feaſt, the Bridegroom leads his Bride to dance, the Bachellors and Maids continue the Ball: as for the married men and women, they conduct the new married Couple into their Bed Chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is made ready for them to lay down. The Bride makes her ſelf ſomewhat ſhy &amp; unwilling to be undreſt, but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding her forced reſiſtance, ſhe is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108995:13"/>
conſtrained to yield to the force of them that have undreſt her, and reſign her ſelf into the arms of her Bridegroom, for to conſummate the Marriage, and (as they ſay) for to gain the Dowry, which hath been allowed her.</p>
               <p>The next Day Morning, the new Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried People receive the Complements of all their Friends and Relations, and even from their Neighbours, and commonly the Bridegroom makes them ſome Preſents.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Paris</hi> the new married Woman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth her viſits in her Chamber, attired with all her Nuptial Ornaments, ſitting on a Bed of State, all the Windows of her Chamber being ſhut up, ſo that there is no Light at all in it, but that which comes from Wax Tapers, and Flambeau's.</p>
               <p>At preſent the moſt part of Perſons, of any Quality, are married in the Night time, without any Ceremony or Pomp.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> differ very little from the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Italians,</hi> as to the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of their Nuptials, but only in this ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Cuſtom, which they have, as I conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, retained from the <hi>Moor's</hi> which were a long while Maſters of their Country. If, in that Amorous Duel between the loving Combatants, there happens any effuſion of Blood upon the Sheets, then they expoſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108995:13"/>
them at the Windows, as a Trophy of the Womans Virginity, which they call, <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginita de la moucher.</hi> But if by good chance, (as it befals very often<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) the Combat hath been harmleſs and bloodleſs, then they fairly ſupply that defect from elſe-where.</p>
               <p>Formerly the <hi>Germans</hi> never married Women of any other Nation, but their own; that they might avoid all confuſion in their Blood. And they never beſtowed their Daughters in Marriage too Young; Batchelors alſo did not go a wooing but very late: So that by that means, the Children which did proceed from two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of mature Age, of full Proportion, and of Vigorous ſtrength, were alſo tall, ſtrong and vigorous. They, even to this day, will never marry their Sons but to them Maids. which are of a ſtrong conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of body, tall, and moſt likely to bear ſtrong and luſty Children. Their Nuptial Ceremonies are m uch the ſame as of the other People in <hi>Europe;</hi> they differ only in this, that the Bride-Maids wear every one a Crown of Gold, or of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, at the Weddings of their fellow Maids, which is not lawful for others to do. All the Gueſts preſent the Bride with Jewells or Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gold &amp; Silver, which th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

Baſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is placed before the Bride, as ſhe ſitteth at Table in the middle of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of her near Relations, and they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company their Preſents with civil Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, and good wiſhes, of Proſperity and Happineſs, to the new married Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>There are amongſt them ſome free Weddings, in which Men of Honour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray all the charges; and there be ſome alſo, in which every one pays his Scot. Their Feaſts laſt at leaſt three days, during which the new married Folks are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a great number of People, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo-much that a common Handicrafts-man will have oftentimes above ſixty Perſons at his Wedding: For the more People they have about them, the more are they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded and eſteemed.</p>
               <p>As for their Gentlemen and Perſons of conſiderable note, they preſent their new married Wives with a Chain of Gold, or ſome Precious Jewel, on the next day morning, after the conſummation of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and this Preſent they call, in their Language, <hi>Morgengal,</hi> that is to ſay the Gift of the morning, becauſe they beſtow it upon the Bride, as ſoon as they are up, as it were to make her ſome recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for h<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

If any Maid amongſt them hath been ſo liquoriſh, as to have taſted of the Horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Radiſh before the time; if ſhe, by good fortune, doth not go away with the bag, but is ſo happy as to marry him, that hath already plaid upon her Fiddle, then the ſaid couple will go to Church very early in the morning, without any Inſtrum<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nts of Muſick: and, in ſome places, but eſpecially in Country-Towns, all the Neighbours, crowned with Garlands made of ſtraw, accompany them to Church.</p>
               <p>In many places they compel the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at the Marriages to renounce, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, all their Rights, as well Paternal as Maternal, and this they do, in caſting ſome ſtraw into their Fathers Houſes. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over if the Bride doth not ſhed ſome Tears, when ſhe goes before the Prieſt to be join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in marriage, then her Virginity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes very much ſuſpected, and for that purpoſe many of them Brides carry Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wrapt up in their Handkerchiefs, that they may force ſome tears out of their Eyes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Francons</hi> obſerve this order in their Marriages. The Bridegroom, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Trumpet<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108995:15"/>
Friends follow him, two by two, until they come to the Church Door; then they make a halt till the Bride be come to them: who being preceded by many, who play on Flutes, and being accompanied with many Maids, is followed by a great number of married Women, which wear very long Mantles of black cloth, plated, and faſtned to their necks, with Silver Claſps: and then the Marriage is celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the preſence of the Parſon of the Pariſh, according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Book.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Poland,</hi> but chiefly in the Country, of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> and <hi>Lithuania,</hi> Maids ſeldom marry under four and twenty Years of Age; and not ſo neither till they have firſt wrought, with their own hands, as much ſtuff, as is ſufficient to cloth every one, who muſt accompany their Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom to Church. Amongſt them when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Father ſeeks a Wife for his Son, he neither regards her Beauty nor Wealth, but only her good Morality, ripeneſs of Age, and ſtrong conſtitution of Body. The Women are never married till two of their future Bridegrooms near Relations have had a deep finger in their Pies, and then they uſe to crave their Fathers good conſent: thoſe People do ſtill retain many
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108995:15"/>
Dregs of the old Superſtition of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens: For when the Solemnity of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is celebrated, the Bride is led three times about a Fire, then they make her ſit down, they waſh her feet, and with that ſame water they beſprinckle the Nuptial Bed, and all the Utenſils of the Houſe. This done, they anoint her Mouth with Honey, they bind her Eyes with a Vail: Then ſhe is conducted towards all the Doors of the Houſe, which ſhe muſt kick with her right Foot; they afterwards ſtrew every Door with Wheat, Rye, Oats, Barley, Beans and Poppy, declaring that her Bridegroom ſhall ever enjoy a great abundance of all thoſe good things, if ſhe devoutly retain her Religion, and if ſhe be careful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious in ordering her Family. The evening being come when ſhe muſt bed with her Bridegroom, they uſe to cut her Hair, then the married Wom<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">

The Bride is at laſt conducted into her Bed-Chamber, whereafter they have ſhuffed and beaten her, they at length caſt her into the Bed, into her Bridegrooms armes.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108995:16"/>
And then inſtead of Sweet Meats or Sack Poſſets, they bring them a diſh of Rams or of Bears ſtones to eat; For they think that after they have eaten of that meat, they become very prolifick and fruitful, &amp; for this reaſon th<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the Iſland of <hi>Goa</hi> the perſon who intends to marry never ſees his Miſtriſs, but in her Pariſh Church where ſhe uſeth to reſort; if he liketh her he, taking a Prieſt along with him, goes to her houſe and then is betrothed to her: He may viſit her after this Ceremony, but they are never permitted to be alone together. Many men of that Country are not contented to ſee their Miſtreſſes as they are dreſſed in their beſt Cloths, but will alſo view them at Home, in the Market, and in their ordinary Habits, that they may the better diſcern whether they cover not ſome natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral defect, and whether they be not patched or painted.</p>
               <p>They generally marry in the afternoon, and they uſe to go to Church in great Pomp and Solemnity. The Bridegroom is oftentimes accompanied with 80 or an hundred Young Men, all on horſeback, richly attired &amp; clothed: The Relations &amp;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108995:16"/>
Friends of both Parties follow them. The Bride ſitting in a Sedan, and the Women, which are her Relations, are every one car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in their Sedans alſo; They being come near the Church, they all alight, and the Bridegroom, being conducted by two Men of his neareſt Relations, and the Bride alſo by two Women of her near Kinſwomen, into the Church, where they are joined in Marriage: They call the foreſaid perſons their four Goſſips. After the Solemnization of Marriage, they return home in the ſame order as they came, the Trumpets and other Muſical Inſtruments playing all the while before them, the People, as they paſs along, caſting ſweet Meats, Comfits, ſweet Waters, and Flowers in the ſtreet, which the Servants, ſcuffling one with another, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up. Being come to the houſe where the Feaſt is prepared, the neareſt Relations and their moſt intimate Friends go in, but as for the Young Men they remain without, making ſport, before the door, with the running and bouncing of their Horſes, and fighting with Reeds and Canes, which they throw one at another. The new married Folks, and their Friends, ſtanding in the Balconies, and others at the Windows, looking upon their Sports and Braveries. This Paſtime being over, they all ali<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

off their Horſes: And being conducted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a low Hall, they are preſented with all ſorts of Sweet Meats of Fruits, and with a kind of perfumed Aromatical water, called water of <hi>Bagulrim.</hi> Then the Bridegroom comes down to them, and diſmiſſes them with all Civility and Demonſtration of Thankfulneſs: Then he returns to his Parents and Relations, with whom he feaſteth: But they ſtay very little at Table, every one retiring into their Habitations. The new married couple go to bed, commonly before Sun ſet, without ſo many Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and Drolleries, as are practiſed among the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Sclavonians,</hi> of the Common-wealth of <hi>Raguſa,</hi> are never married but with Perſons of their Rank and Quality, that is to ſay, the Noble with the Noble, ſo that a Noble Perſon can not marry a Woman of the vulgar ſort, or a Stranger, for fear of introducing any ignoble Blood into his Family, which might blemiſh the luſtre of his Nobility; and for this cauſe the number of Noble Families is ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, that there is not above 20 or 25 now left among them, which have the Government and Adminiſtration of all the affairs of their Common-Wealth.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding if any Noble Perſon
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108995:17"/>
was willing, either for ſome private conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency or molument, to marry a Wife born out of his own Country, he may lawfully do it: Provided that ſhe be a Lady, born between <hi>Zare</hi> and <hi>Cattaro,</hi> but not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And beſides whoſoever ſhould marry ſuch a Lady, born in the Country afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, it is requiſite that he be worth, at leaſt, two Thouſand Ducats of Gold for a Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and for the ſecurity of the ſaid Lady.</p>
               <p>As for the Portions at the Marriages of their Sons, they are limited by the Law, at a Thouſand Ducats of Gold: But, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, they little regard that limitation; ſo that a Father will give his Son four, five or ſix Thouſand Ducats of Gold, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, according to the Means and Quality of the Woman. The Marriage Mony is paid before ever the Man ſee the Woman he muſt have; and when every thing is agreed upon, the Mony paid, and the Contract ſigned and ſealed, he may then with all liberty go to viſit her: For it is a conſtant cuſtom, amongſt the <hi>Ragu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> never to court and careſs their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but only after that they are made ſure with them, When a Maid is married, it is lawful for her to wear Silk Cloths a month after her Marriage, that ſhe may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from others, who wear Cloth
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108995:18"/>

               <p>As for the <hi>Flemings,</hi> and other Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Neighbouring Countrys, they have that particular Cuſtom, that they eaſily, and without any difficulty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract Marriage with Strangers; but it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted amongſt them very unſeemly, and a very filthy thing, for a Young Man to marry an Old Woman, or for an Old Woman to marry a Young Man. Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men never marry Gentlewomen, nor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen Tradeſmens Daughters; and it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen amongſt them, which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſed amongſt the <hi>French,</hi> for the Maſter to marry his Chamber-maid, and for the Miſtreſs to marry her Servant. In that Country, Gentlemen always prefer their Eldeſt Daughters before the Youngeſt, ſo that many times they will beſtow their Youngeſt upon them to whom they have refuſed the Eldeſt; becauſe they reſerve her for a better Match, and more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Fortune.</p>

Amongſt the <hi>Goths,</hi> the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and the <hi>Danes,</hi> they of the common ſort uſe many Ceremonies in their Marriages too tedious to rehearſe here, I ſhall therefore content my ſelf to mention the chief of them. The Maids Parents, being ſufficiently informed and ſatisfied about the Qualifications of her Suitor, her Father preſents his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him, ſpeaking theſe words; <hi>I give thee my Daughter for to honour thee, that ſhe may be thy Wife, for to have the half of thy Bed, the Key of thy Doors, with the third part of thy Mony, and other Goods moveable and immoveable.</hi> At the day aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, ſhe is conducted to Church with many Torches, done about with Silk ſtuffs of ſeveral Colours. The Solemnity being over, ſhe is handed Home by her Bridegroom: But before ſhe may bed with him, ſhe muſt go to the Stoves or hot Baths, many Maids going before her, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Married Women accompanying her; but before they come thither, they have made great Proviſion of Strong Beer, or of Wine in that place, for to refreſh the Women in the Bath, leſt being overcome with the Heat they ſhould faint: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they recruit their ſtrength, with eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toſted Bread dipt in ſome of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Liquors, which are ſweetned with Cinamon and Sugar.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:108995:20"/>
When they come out of their Baths, they wear every one of them a Garland of Rue upon their Heads, as for the Maids they go to Supper with the Bride.</p>
               <p>The Gentlemen uſually marry Women of their Rank and Quality. As for Tradeſmen and Mechanicks they commonly preſent the Bride with Swine, Sheep, or Cowes, but they preſent the Bridegroom with ſome Colt, Dog, Cat or Gooſe.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Livonia.</hi> when a Maid is led to Church to be married, they crown her with a very high Crown of Silver guilded, and all the Women and Maids march be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, covered with long plated red Mantles, which reach from their Heads to their very Heels.</p>

               <p>Having treated of the Ceremonies, which thoſe Proteſtants of <hi>Luthers</hi> perſwaſion do uſe at their Marriages, it now remaineth that I ſhould give ſome account of the Cuſtoms and Solemnities performed at the Weddings of <hi>Evangelical Proteſtants.</hi> And firſt I ſay that by <hi>Evangelical Proteſtants</hi> I mean the <hi>Engliſh, Dutch, Switzers,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other People, which do not pin their faith upon the Church's or Popes Sleeve, but rejecting all vain Traditions and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties ground their belief upon the Pillar of Truth and Goſpel verity.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> their Ceremonies are ſo generally practiſed throughout this Kingdom and conſequently ſo well known, that I will paſs them over in ſilence, leaſt I ſhould ſeem to light a Candle at Noon-day; wherefore I come to the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the parties are all agreed, then they ſend for the Miniſter who betrotheth them one to the other, and then they give
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108995:21"/>
them drink, every one in their Glaſs aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: He that fills the Drink, takes the two Glaſſes, and mingles the Wine of one with the other; he preſents the Glaſs of the Bridegroom to the Bride, and that of the Bride to the Bridegroom: After they have drunk, the future Bridegroom doth preſent his betrothed Bride a Ring. But before they may marry it is requiſite that the Miniſter make Publication of their Marriage three Sundays conſecutively, leſt there be amongſt them any Impediment or other Engagement: After which pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication they may lawfully marry. Then at the day appointed, the Bridegroom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts to the Church with his Parents and Relations, the Bride alſo, with a Garland of Flowers upon the hinder part of her Head, is conducted thither by two Men, or two Young Bachelors, of her near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, many Maids, with married Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Relations and Gueſts, following her thither. When ſhe comes out of the Church, ſhe is led to her Bridegrooms Houſe by the ſame Perſons. The Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, which marry again, may not wear a Garland upon their heads, but only a large Noſegay in their Boſoms; and are led to Church by two Widdows of their near Relations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:108995:21"/>
In <hi>Friezland,</hi> the men of that Country did not at all regard the Quality or Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Women, but only their Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs and good Morality; ſo that many Gentlemen and rich Merchants did marry vertuous comely Women, although they were never ſo poor. But now adays the caſe is altered, for they not only regard their Quality and Deſcent, but alſo expect a competency of Wealth, anſwerable to their Eſtates. The Bride wearing a Crown upon her head, and accompanied with a long train of Maids, goes to Church where the ſolemnity of Marriage being celebrated, they return to her Fathers houſe, where they are feaſted. The Gueſts ſeldom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Bride with any Money, But the Brides and Bridegrooms Relations come very liberally to offer her their Preſents, whereof the Bridegroom takes good no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
               <p>The Feaſt being ended, the Muſicians begin to play on ſeveral Inſtruments, and then every one dances in order. On the next day, all the Gueſts reſort to the ſame place, and the new married Woman, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting every one of them with a glaſs of the beſt Wine or of ſome other aromati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Liquor, ſhe diſmiſſes them with hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, thanking them for their Civility and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108995:22"/>
kindneſs. And this ſhe does, to the end that ſhe may make it appear that ſhe is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Houſhold Wife.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Hungary</hi> Bachellors never marry with Widdows, although never ſo rich, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are perſwaded that if any Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellor marries one, who is not a Virgin, he ſhall never enjoy any Proſperity in this World: wherefore if any amongſt them did diſcover that the Women, which they have married, have plaid any Legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with others before Marriage, they would put them to a cruel Death.</p>
               <p>As for the Lords of that Country they uſually marry their Children very young; and many times as they ly in their Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles: And this is done on purpoſe to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain good correſpondence and Friendſhip amongſt Honourable Families; and when the Children have attained to ripeneſs of Age, they are obliged to conſummate their Marriage, leſt by their refuſal they ſhould procure their Parents implacable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, the Sequels whereof might prove very dangerous and tragical.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Scotland</hi> formerly, and in the days of Popiſh Idolatry, the Brides did lay down their <hi>Propira Feminea</hi> before their Lairds of the Mannour, who did ſhake their Hair-bags on the firſt night after the Solemnization
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108995:22"/>
of the Marriage: But ſince the Light of the Goſpel did ſhine bright in that Kingdom, that Barbarous Cuſtome hath been explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; wherefore the Brides do not now pay their Marks <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> but only by way of Exchange, the Bridegroom paying half a Mark to his Landlord for that Right, and that Right is now called, <hi>the Womens Marks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> in their Marriages, I mean thoſe who are partakers of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Civility, uſe the ſame decent Nuptial Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do: But as for the Popiſh wild <hi>Iriſh,</hi> they are ſo Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Brutiſh that they do not deſerve to be mentioned here.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BEfore the <hi>Grecians</hi> Marriages, the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Bride doth openly ſhew what ſhe is able to bring to her future Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom; the Bridegroom alſo is to declare the full extent of his Eſtate, and that is done in a ſpacious Room upon a Table, the Men ſitting above the Women, as it were an Amphitheater. When the Bride receiveth the Preſents from her Relations and other Friends, ſhe is ſitting in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the <hi>Gyneconitide,</hi> or Chamber of Women, wearing a guilded Crown on her Head. All the Gueſts having drunk good ſtore of Metheglin, and ballaſted their Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies with variety of Sweet-meats they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to walking; and come back to Supper about the Evening. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after Supper, the new married Folks, without ſtaying for the three publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of their Banes as we do, go to bed together: The next day morning the married Women come to viſit them and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108995:23"/>
to ſearch their Sheet, to ſee whether, by good fortune, they can ſind any marks of a loſt Maiden-head; which if they find, they are extreamly jocund and Jovial, but, upon a <hi>Non inventus,</hi> they depart as mute as Fiſhes. As for the Bridegroom he fairly ſends away his tried Bride to her Parents; unleſs the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Magiſtrate, being a little greazed in the fiſt conſtrain him to keep her for better and for worſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Grecian</hi> Women, which beſtow themſelves upon <hi>Turks, Spaniards, French,</hi> or <hi>Italians,</hi> may be afterwards preſent at Divine Service: But they for ſome time are excommunicated, that is to ſay, they are for ſome time debarred from the Lords Table. Which kind of Excommunication Savoureth ſomewhat like the Spirit of Chriſtianity, and is nothing of Kin to the Popes <hi>brutum fulmen,</hi> which dare at ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cque the Sacred Heads of Crowned <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns;</hi> neither is it like the <hi>Anathemas</hi> of ſome high flown Eccleſiaſticks, who wear the Croſs-Keys at their girdle, with one of which they many times, for frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous cauſes, deliver the Souls of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſtians to Satan, and with the other they commit their Bodies to Jails. Is this the Spirit of God, or the Spirit of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial?</hi> But I muſt conclude this ſhort Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108995:24"/>
with this ſhorter Ejaculation: From the <hi>Spaniſh Don's</hi> fiery <hi>Inqueſto's;</hi> from the bloody <hi>Anathemas</hi> of the Popes; and from the cruel Mercies of all <hi>Reverendos, Domine, libera nos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Walachians</hi> of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> never marry any Women till they have got a ſnack with them before-hand, but they alſo put them away for very ſlight and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial Cauſes.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> when a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intends to beſtow his Daughter in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, all his care is to look for a Young Man to his own liking: Having found ſuch a one, he preſently proffers her to him as a Wife, with ſuch a Sum of Mony for her Portion as he is able to give. If the Young Man accept of his proffer, then the ſaid Father goes immediately to the Young Mans Parents, to whom he makes the ſame Offers: For in that Country, a Young Man may not ſee his future Bride until the very day of the Wedding; but his Mother, and other Women of her near Relations, go not only to viſit her but alſo diligently to ſearch her, to know whether or no ſhe doth not hide ſome bodily Infirmity: The Daughters Mother doth the ſame towards the Young Man. The Wedding Day being come,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108995:24"/>
before the Celebration of Marriage, the Bridegroom and the Bride, together with their Relations and the Parſon of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, make extraordinary great Cheer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and paint their Noſes with ſuch live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Colours, that they ſcarce go to Church till they be paſſingly well dipt. As ſoon as they are come there the Prieſt, according to the Cuſtom, demands ſome Loaves; which having received he deſires the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom to take his Bride by the hand: then drawing nigh to the Bridegroom, he asks him whether he be willing to be joined in Marriage with that Woman? If he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth to the Affirmative, then he again asks him, whether he will miſuſe or beat her? the Bridegroom anſwering Negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He doth then turn himſelf towards the Bride, &amp; likewiſe asketh her if ſhe be well contented to take that Man as her lawful Husband, to govern his Family, and to be faithful to him; ſhe anſwering yea, he then crowns them both with two Garlands of Rue, and gives them the Nuptial Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. That being done he takes ſome Wine in a gilded wooden Cup, and, having wiſht them all Proſperity and happineſs, he drinks to them, they alſo pledge him in the ſame Cup: But after that the Bride hath drunk, then the Bridegroom, ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108995:25"/>
the Cup from her hand, preſently with all his Force flings it on the ground, &amp; treads it under his feet till it be all broken in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and then he prays to God that all thoſe, who ſhould go about to bring any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion between them, may be likewiſe trodden upon and deſtroyed by his Infinite Power: He afterwards receives the Preſents of all that are there.</p>
               <p>So that in that Countrey no Man may have more than one Wife, but withal he keeps her no longer than ſhe pleaſeth him, for as ſoon as he begins to be diſpleaſed with her, he preſently puts her away, for the leaſt occaſion in the World. They may alſo put away their Wives, if they prove barren: And they may, after that divorce, warry ſix weeks after.</p>
               <p>It is lawful for Widdows to marry again the ſecond time: But if they ſhould marry three times, they are reputed very wanton and light heel'd Houſe-wives.</p>

The men of that Country are ſo far from receiving any Portion from their Wives, that on the contrary they muſt allow them a Dowry; which conſiſts in a Sum of Money, which is depoſited in ſome truſty hand of the Womens neerer Relations, who pays him the intereſt as long as the Woman lives: But in caſe ſhe dieth without iſſue he then may command the Principal, but if ſhe leave any Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then the Intereſt goes towards their Maintenance: And coming to Maturity of Age, they divide the Principal amongſt themſelves. Theſe are the Ceremonies which they obſerve in their Marriages. The Couple, that is to be married, are both ſett before the Church Door, and three

Prieſts, going three times round about them, ſing many <hi>Hallelujahs;</hi> then, cutting two Tuffs of the new married Folks Hair, they put them in Wine ſweetned with Honey.

The Prieſt doth, laſt of all, give them notice that they are both but one Fleſh. This Ceremony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, they all return home, where there is a great Feaſt prepared, and they make very great cheer. But the new mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Folks muſt not ſtir out of the Door, till a month after the Solemnization of their Marriage: After which time, the Bride muſt, when ſhe goes out of the Doors, wear a black Vail upon her Face, which ſhe ought not to lift up but at ſix months end after, unleſs ſhe doth prove with Child.</p>

This done the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom's Relations and Friends accompany him to Church, then they come again to the Bride and conduct her thither alſo, many Torches and Wax-Candles lighting them on the way they go along the Streets, ſinging Pſalms and Hymns in their <hi>Coptick</hi> Language, and with little wooden Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers knocking upon little Rulers of Ebony, which is inſtead of very Harmonious Muſick amongſt them; this Ceremony is performed immediately after Midnight.</p>

the Bridegroom into the Chancel, where uſually the Divine ſervice is celebrated: As for the Bride, ſhe is led to the Womens Apartment. Then the Prieſts, together with the people, begin ſome Prayers with Hymns which laſt a conſiderable time. The Divine ſervice being ended the Prieſt, who is to celebrate the Solemnity of Marriage, coming out of the Veſtry in his Robes, leads the Bridegroom into the middle of the Chancell, and, reading upon him three or four Prayers, doth ſign him with the Sign of the Croſs at the beginning and ending of every Prayer; This done, he cauſeth him to ſit down on the Ground, his face turned towards the <hi>Heikel,</hi> and holding a Silver Croſs upon his head behind him, he readeth many more Prayers.</p>
               <p>Whilſt that theſe things are done in the Chancell, the Sexton carrying a Seat out of the Chancell, places it at the Chancell-door; and ſpeaking to the Bride, deſires her to ſit down on it, with a Woman of her nearer Relations.

And although ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in the affirmative upon her Oath, yet notwithſtanding, that muſt not ſerve the turn, but the Prieſts Wife, with other married Women, muſt ſearch her: And in caſe they bring a Verdict conformable to what ſhe hath depoſed upon Oath, then the Prieſt baptizeth them both: Which being done, he bringeth them back to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108995:28"/>
back; and having read ſome Prayers, the Solemnity is ended. Then the new married Folks are conducted to the Brides or the Bridegrooms houſe for to feaſt, according to the Cuſtom of their Country.</p>
               <p>The Prieſts as well as Lay-men, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo marry two Wives, and their Children, if they be but Sixteen years of age, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them in their Prieſtly Office; but in caſe they leave no Children, then their neareſt Relation ſucceds them in their Places.</p>

               <p>THe Chriſtians of the States of <hi>Colchis, Georgia, Circaſſia,</hi> and other Places adjacent, as they little differ from the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beans</hi> in the Principles of Religion, ſo their Ceremonies are much alike, with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference only: That if any of them intends to marry, if the Biſhop or Curate of the Pariſh be abſent, then they chooſe what

            <p>ALL the <hi>Turks</hi> may, according to their Law, have four lawful Wives, and as many Slaves as they are able to maintain: But as ſoon as their Women Slaves have brought them a Child, they obtain their Liberty: Wherefore they may beſtow them away upon their Friends, but never ſell them. Their Church-men alſo may marry many Women, excepting the <hi>Derviſes,</hi> Monks, and other Religious Perſons. It is alſo lawful amongſt the <hi>Turks</hi> to put away their Wives, and to take them again, even to the fourth time. They may alſo marry not only Women of another Generation, but even of their ow n near Kindred, for they hold that by a double
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108995:30"/>
Tye, the Knot of Friendſhip and Love is the ſtronger.</p>
            <p>When they intend to contract Marriage, the neareſt Relations of the Man and of the Woman, gather themſelves together for to agree amongſt themſelves about the Dowry which the Young Man muſt allow his future Bride: For the Parents never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them any Portion at all; which thing is alſo practiſed amongſt the Eaſtern Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. This being done, the future Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom ſends to the Maids Father, or to her neareſt Relations, the Sum agreed upon, to the end that a part of the ſaid Sum be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed partly in Cloths, and partly upon Houſhold Goods, according to the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Perſons: As for the Remnant of the Mony, it muſt remain in the Hands of the future Bride, or elſe ſhe depoſites it into the Hand of one of her own Kindred, which ſhe can beſt confide in: But her future Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band may never call her to any account for it. Now a day's the Parents of both Parties contribute towards the Expences of the Wedding, for they do think it more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to do ſo. As for the future Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, he maketh choice of one of his beſt Friends to invite his Gueſts, and to take care of all the preparation of his Wedding, and this man is called amongſt them, <hi>Sagois.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:108995:30"/>
The future Bride is to remain always within doors, her face covered with a Vail eight days before the Celebration of the Marriage, and none of her future Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Relations may ſee her. As for her Bridegroom he, taking his <hi>Sagois</hi> along with him, goes about to invite his Gueſts: The Gueſts ſend every one their Preſents to the Bridegroom, the day before the Wedding. The day before the Celebration of the Marriage, the Bride is conducted by the Women to the Bath, two or three of them waſhing and rubbing all her Body, but eſpecially her Parſley-Garden. They alſo take a certain Powder, called amongſt them <hi>Elcana,</hi> whereby they cauſe her Hair, her Nails, the inward parts of her Hands and Feet, to become Red. This Bathing is reputed ſo Holy a Ceremony amongſt them, that when the Bride goes to the Bath, ſhe is accompanied with many Women of her Relations and Friends, who march two by two before her, every one of them holding a lighted Wax-Candle in their Hand.</p>
            <p>The Wedding day being come, the Bridegroom ſends Preſents to the <hi>Cady,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating him to draw an Inſtrument in writing concerning the Dowry, which by Agreement he ought to allow his Bride. This being done, his <hi>Sagois,</hi> accompanied with
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:108995:31"/>
all the Gueſts go to the Brides Houſe, many Drums, Trumpets, Fifes, and other Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſounding before them. They all ſtay in the lower Court of the Houſe, then the Brides Father coming down with her, delivers her into the cuſtody of the <hi>Sagois,</hi> who preſently mounts her on Horſe-back, &amp; conducts her to her Bridegrooms Houſe. All the Relations and Friends of both Parties go afoot after her, the Carts and Horſes, which carry her Goods and Houſhold-ſtuff, following in the Rear: The Bride rides up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Horſe richly trapped, her face being covered with a thin Vail, and an Umbrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo carried over their Head: She is alſo waited upon by her Servants, Chamber-maids and her Nurſe, who going a foot at her ſide, ſhed tears for Joy, bewailing her Virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is reduced to the laſt Extremity of being loſt In the mean while, as ſhe rides along, ſhe with a little bowing of her Head ſalutes them, whom ſhe meets in the Streets, Which thing no Woman dare do but upon her wedding Day. Being come to her Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms Door, the <hi>Sagois</hi> helps her down and her Bridegroom, waiting for her at the Door, conducts her to the Womens Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment: And, after they have feaſted plentifully, they begin to dance merrily. The ball being ended and the Gueſts retired
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108995:31"/>
to their reſpective Habitations the <hi>Sagois,</hi> taking the Bride by the Hand, leadeth her to the Nuptial Chamber and commits her to the cuſtody of her Bridegrooms Eunuchs, until he himſelf comes. As ſoon as he is come, after their mutual Civil Salutations, he takes away her Veil, and all her Cloths, one after another, but when he comes to unbutton and take down her Linnen-Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, there will be a little fumbling and ſcuffling; for ſhe will be ſure to ſhew ſome little willing Reſiſtance. The next day the <hi>Sagois</hi> comes to pay his Civilities, &amp; makes them many drolling and frollick Queſtions. As ſoon as the new-married Wife is up ſhe, taking ſome Women of her near Relations with her Chamber-maids, goes to the Bath and having ſufficiently duckt her ſelf, ſhe returns to her Husbands Houſe. Theſe are the Ceremonies which are practiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them of the better Quality. It is a Common Cuſtom, amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> to marry three Siſters one after another, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that they have married the Eldeſt at firſt, but if they began at the Youngeſt, they may never marry her Eldeſt Siſter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Arabians</hi> did formerly contract Marriage onely for a time prefixt and limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by mutual conſent of both Parties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And to the end that they might make ſome
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:108995:32"/>
ſhew of Matrimonial Convention, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man did preſent her Bridegroom with a Tent and a Dart for her Portion: But the limited time being expired, ſhe fairly went her way looking for a freſher Cuſtomer. Which Cuſtome proceeded from the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and natural Looſeneſs in both Sexes, which loved change and variety, in ſuch a a manner, that a Woman was married in one place, brought forth in another, and bred up her Children in anothet, without remaining long in any place all her life time. The people of <hi>Arabia Felix</hi> had the Women common in every Houſe: The Man that came home at night firſt, having ſett a ſtick before the Door, went to Bed with the Woman: So that amongſt them, they never reputed any to commit Adultery, but thoſe who had to do with them of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation.</p>
            <p>Now adays the <hi>Arabians</hi> take as many Wives as they pleaſe, but they never put them away as the <hi>Turks</hi> do. They alſo buy them with ready Money, but they are very ſtrict in not coupling themſelves with any Women, but them of their own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or Alliance. As for their Formalities of Nuptial Ceremonies, they are the ſame with them of the <hi>Turks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Perſians</hi> go a wooing, if they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108995:32"/>
intend to ſignalize themſelves for their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and paſſion towards their Miſtreſſes, they uſe to burn themſelves in many places of their Bodies with ſome kind of Linnen, which they ſett on fire, much like our Chyrurgeon's Cauſticks. And being ſo burnt, they come in this manner into their Miſtreſſes Preſence, who have a care of ſending them ſome Linnen, or Pieces of Silk, to bind and heal their Wounds: And he that hath moſt Burnings on his Body, is moſt eſteemed amongſt the Ladies, and will ſooner purchaſe their favourable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance. They may marry many Women; the Mechanicks may have ſeven and no more, but their Nobles may have as many as they are able to maintain.</p>
            <p>When a Perſon of Quality is to marry, his Parents, Relations, and intimate Friends, without Invitation, reſort to his Houſe, wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Liveries: But if they be neither Relations, nor Familiar Friends, they may not then be permitted to wear them, they only appear in their beſt Equipage. The Bride comes out of her Houſe riding on Horſe-back, accompanied with the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of her Relations and Friends gallantly mounted: Many Inſtruments of Muſick playing before them, they go towards the the Bridegrooms Houſe; who alſo coming
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:108995:33"/>
to meet them with his Friends on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, theſe two Squadrons joined together go back to the Brides Houſe, where they begin the Ball. The Ball being well begun, two Gentlemen conduct the Bridegroom into the Brides Bed-chamber, two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women lead the Bride to her Bridegroom and reſign her into his Armes. About Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night ſome old Women come down, and bring a Linnen which they preſent to the Bridegroom's Relations, if it appear bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Beauty-Spots of a loſt Maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, then they hug it as a precious Relick, but in caſe it be, <hi>Facies miris modis pallida,</hi> then thoſe ſame old Women bring away the Bride, and the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom divorceth himſelf from her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole Aſſembly; and having paid a very ſmall Sum of Money to her Relations, they preſently carry her away,</p>
            <p>Amongſt the people of <hi>Cambaya, Palan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dura</hi> and <hi>Maldivia,</hi> this particular Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is obſerved in their Marriages. Both Parties being agreed, the future Bride dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates a Man of her Fathers near Relations, who hath power to repreſent her Perſon; this Man goes with the future Bridegroom before the <hi>Pandiar,</hi> or Prieſt, and taking the Bridegroom by the Hand, asks him whether he be willing to take his Kinf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:108995:33"/>
for his lawful Wife, upon ſuch Terms and Conditions as have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and concluded. The Prieſt ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Womans Kinſman the ſame Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and both anſwering affirmatively, then the Prieſt proceeds to the other Solemnities of Marriage, the Relations of both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being preſent as witneſſes of the Coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Knot. This Solemnity being ended they all reſort to the Brides Houſe where ſhe waiting for them, receives them with all poſſible Civility and Demonſtrations of Reſpect. Then they are regaled, many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Muſick playing all the while they are feaſting; many Perſons come to compliment the new-married Couple, the Bride preſenting them with Boxes of <hi>Betel.</hi> They alſo ſend to the <hi>Pandiar</hi> two Larrins, a Diſh of the beſt Meat, with a Box of <hi>Betel.</hi> The new married Folks are obliged to ſend their Preſents to their King and Queen, according to their Ability: But when the King himſelf is married, all his Subjects are bound to ſend him their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents: Some ſend them Cloths, ſome Robes, others ſend him Turbans, and others again only Fruits and Flowers.</p>
            <p>The Men of the fore-ſaid Countries may have three lawful Wives at one time, if they be able to maintain them; and if they live
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:108995:34"/>
in the ſame Iſland, he is bound by the law to divide amongſt them the duty of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence equally: But this Law is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obſerved amongſt them.</p>
            <p>The Women never bring their Husbands any Portion at all, on the contrary the Husband muſt not only defray all the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Wedding, and provide them all things neceſſary, but alſo ſettle upon them a Dowry, which in their own Language is called <hi>Rans.</hi> The Bachellours Marry when they pleaſe, but as for the Maids, their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents beſtow them upon the firſt that offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any reaſonable Terms, when they have attained to ten or twelve Years of Age. But in caſe their Fathers be dead, they then are accounted Orphans. and they may not marry till they be fifteen. When they preſent themſelves before their <hi>Pandiar</hi> to be joined in Marriage, he makes a ſtrict ſcrutiny whether the perſons be any way related to one another in Blood, or in Milk. So that if he find that they uſed to call one another Brother or Siſter, only for love ſake, or elſe that they have ſucked the ſame Nurſe, it is a lawful Impediment to obſtruct their Marriage, and their Prieſt dares pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further. The Husband puts away his Wife when he pleaſes, provided that the Woman give her conſent to it, but if
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:108995:34"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> refuſes to agree to it, he notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may put her away, if he firſt pay her down her Dowry promiſed upon Marriage.</p>
            <p>Through all the Iſland of <hi>Ceilan</hi> men may marry as many Women as they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to maintain, and Maids are commonly married as ſoon as they come to be ten or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven: Even as in the Iſlands of <hi>Cambaya, Palandura,</hi> and <hi>Maldivia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Mahometans</hi> of the Iſland of <hi>Javan</hi> may not have above four or five lawful Wives, but they may take as many Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines as they can maintain. On their Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Day their Friends, Slaves, and other Menial Servants appear richly clad before the doors of the Bride and Bridegroom, where they have ſet up many Pikes adorned with Fringes of white and red Cotton: They alſo diſcharge ſeveral Volleys of Shot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Door. After twelve of the Clock, the Bridegroom goes out to fetch his Bride with this following Pomp. Firſt there are five or ſix men which carry five or ſix Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons hanging upon poles; theſe men are accompanied with as many men which, holding in their hands little Coco-ſticks, beat upon the ſaid Baſons. After theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low four or five other men which carry long Drums, which they beat with Switch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or elſe with their Hands; After theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:108995:35"/>
a great Train of Men, which, having ſome Baſons hung to their Necks beat upon them continually as they march along. Theſe are followed with a great Number of Men which carry long Mattocks coloured with Red, and adorned with Peacock's and Horſes Tails; Then come thirty or forty other Men armed with Darts, Swords, and Bucklers, in their Buff-coats; theſe armed Men march with great Pomp, and many times making a Halt fight amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſometimes dance for to divert the Spectators. Theſe laſt are followed with other Drummers, immediately after theſe come a great company of Maids richly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned, ſome of which carry Baskets full of Flowers, and rich Pictures, others little gilded Boxes, others carry little Coffers for to keep their <hi>Betel.</hi> The married Women, which follow the Maids, do not come emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but march every one carrying all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Houſhold-Stuff; all which things are Preſents which they bring to the Bride. The Bridegroom comes out at laſt, riding on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back and richly attired, having his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons round about him well mounted on Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freys. This Nuptial Pomp is ſhut up with all the Gueſts which are invited to the Wedding, all of them gallantly mounted. This Cavalcade being come near the Brides
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108995:35"/>
Houſe, all the Drummers ſtand before he Door playing merrily; but as for thoſe which carry their Swords, Bucklers and long Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks, they order themſelves on both ſides of the Street making a Lane till this pompous Train be paſt. The Bridegroom being come to the Brides door, ſhe ſtands ready to wait upon him, who lighting off his Horſe, ſhe having a Veſſel full of Sweet Water, and caſting her ſelf upon her knees doth waſh his feet, which being done ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently riſing up takes him by the hand, and conducts him into her own Appartment; where having ſtaid a little while to pay their mutual Civilitys, the Bridegroom help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Bride on her Palfrey, they return to the Bridegrooms Dwelling in the ſame Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as they came. Being come near the Bridegrooms Houſe, they all alight, and the Bridegroom taking his Bride by the Hand goes in firſt, and all their Gueſts following them, they remain with them three days feaſting, dancing, and making extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Cheer. The Inhabitants of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of <hi>Moluccos,</hi> retain yet ſome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Idolatry, with the <hi>Mahometaniſm</hi> which the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> have brought in amongſt them. Thoſe People may have as many Wives as they are handſomely able to maintain, but withal
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108995:36"/>
they are ſo exceeding jealous of them, that they can in no wiſe ſuffer that any Man ſhould ſo much as caſt an Eye upon them. They are notwithſtanding very Liquoriſh, and let their Husbands uſe never ſo great Precaution, yet they will be ſure to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Gallants and Paramours, and get a Lick of the Horſe-Radiſh with them in a corner. When any Man amongſt them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to marry, he may never go to viſit his Miſtreſs, till the Parents of both Parties are agreed amongſt themſelves, but after the ſaid Agreement then he is introduced into her preſence, and ſhe is obliged to accept of him, although ſhe never ſaw his Face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>The people of <hi>Barbary,</hi> but thoſe eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the better ſort, marry many Wives al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; but they do not buy them. They only allow them Dowries anſwerable to their Quality, as the Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> did uſe to do. They retain yet ſome old Cuſtoms and Ceremonies which the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> have left amongſt them. They are alſo ſo extreamly Jealous of their Wives that they will, by no means, allow them to appea<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

Concubines allowed them by their <hi>Alcoran.</hi> Some few days before the Marriage the Bridegroom goes to the <hi>Caccis,</hi> and having with him the Relations of both Parties as witneſſes, they ſend for a Notary who, having received his Inſtructions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dowry, which the ſaid Bridegroom is to give to his future Bride, the Notary draws a publick Inſtrument of it, which is, in their own Language, called <hi>Codaca;</hi> So that although they may divorce their Wives afterwards, they may not put them away till they have paid them the full Sum mentioned in the Contract of Marriage. They are very joviall at their weddings, and ſo extraordinarily profuſe, that it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Proverb amongſt them, That <hi>the Chriſtians ſpend moſt in Suits at Law, the Jews in their Paſſovers, and the Moors at their Weddings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the Wedding Day the Bride, being gallantly mounted upon a Mule richly trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and adorned, and having a Canopy of Turky Carpets over her Head, with a thin Vail over her Face; She is led in Pomp about Town, &amp; immediately after her follow many Mules carrying her Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture and other Preſents, which her Friends have beſtowed upon her. After the Mules come all the Men and the Women
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:108995:37"/>
of her Friends and Relations; but the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as they march along, make hideous Outcries which, together with their <hi>Mooriſh</hi> double Drums, make a horrible Noiſe. After this Cavalcade, they betake themſelves to their Dinner, which being ended they go to the Market place; and if the Bridegroom be a Military Perſon, then all his Friends appear there on Horſeback playing and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing themſelves with their Lances, and Javelins, on purpoſe for to divert the whole Aſſembly; after which Recreation every one withdraws to their reſpective Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>But amongſt Perſons of eminent Quality, the Bride is mounted upon a Camel ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly fett out, and charged with a little Turret (called amongſt them <hi>Gaiola)</hi> her Head covered with a thin <hi>Taffeta,</hi> ſo thin, that although none can ſee her Face, yet ſhe eaſily can ſee all them that are about her. She is accompanied with many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women and Knights which ride along with her, and after the Cavalcade ſhe is again conducted to her Fathers Houſe, and from thence to her Bridegrooms Habitation; where, the Feaſt being ſumptuouſly prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all the Aſſembly reſort to feaſt, to ſing and to dance. After which Jollities the Bridegroom begins a new Courant with

Bride, but in caſe he find that ſhe hath been vers'd in it before, and her caſe ſo plain and open, that no Tokens of Virginity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, then he preſently ſurrenders her to her Parents, who have her away with all her Furniture and Houſhold-Stuff; But if, on the contrary, her Clothes appear dyed with the Roſe and Lilly, then he hugs her as a pure Virgin, and her Linnen Drawers are carried in Triumph thorough all the City, as an honourable Teſtimony of the unqueſtionable Virginity of his new tried Bride.

            <p>They of the Kingdom of <hi>Fez</hi> practiſe this particular Cuſtom at their Marriages, that as ſoon as a Father hath promiſed his Daughter in Marriage, then the Parents of both Parties gather themſelves in ſome aſſigned place; going aſterwards to the <hi>Moſque</hi> with two Notaries, who write down the Conditions of the Contract.

               </gap>es to Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner them, which have accompanied him and have been witneſſes of the Contract: The Brides Father doth likewiſe feaſt his own Relations. When the Bridegroom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to bring his Bride, he then ſends a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108995:38"/>
Litter covered all over with rich Silks; ſhe is carried in it to the publick Place of the city with all her own and her Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms kindred together with many Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau's, Fifes, Drums and Trumpets; the Bridegrooms Friends goe before the Bride with their Flambeaus, and his Fathers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars follow after her. As ſoon as they are come to that publick place, then the Bridegroom comes to ſalute her Father and Relations; which Duty of Civility being performed, he then, without any more Ceremony, betakes himſelf to his own Habitation, waiting there for his Bride, who as ſoon as ſhe is come thither, her Father and neareſt Relations accompany her even to her Nuptial Chamber Door, and reſign her into the Hands of her Bridegroom: who as ſhe comes into the Chamber ſets his Foot upon one of hers, and having ſhut the Door upon themſelves, every one withdraw, ſome few Women only excepted which, remaining at their Doors till the conſummation of Marriage, come down afterwards bringing the lower Sheet all bedewed with the Tokens of her loſt Virginity. But in caſe no ſuch Tokens appear, then ſhe is fairly diſmiſt, as a Crackt piece and ſurrendred to her Parents: As for the Gueſts they go their ways with a

Peck full of trouble, and their Bellies full of <hi>Vacuum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe People uſe to make three ſeverall Feaſts at the Solemnity of their Marriages: The firſt is made on the day of the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; the Second is made the next day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but this is only for the Women: And the Third is prepared on the Seventh day after the Celebration of Marriage, and this chiefly concerns the Brides Relations and intimate Friends, who are all feaſted that Day. Her Father ſends his Son in Law ſome Sweet-Meats and ſome whole Muttons on that day for a Preſent. But as ſoon as the Bridegroom goes out of Doors, which happens ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily but at ſeven days end, he then goes forthwith to buy ſome Fiſhes, and bringing them Home, he delivers them into the hands of his Mother, or of ſome other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who immediately fling them all on the young married Womans feet, as a fortunate Emblem of her future fruitfulneſs.</p>
            <p>A Month after the Marriage the new married Womans beſt Friends ſend her great Pots full of Bread fried in Oil, and whole Muttons ready roſted; and the new marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man, to retaliate their kindneſs, invites them to a Feaſt.</p>
            <p>If a Widdow be married again, the nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Pomp is not ſo magnificent, the Gueſts
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:108995:39"/>
muſt then be contented with roſt Mutton, Beef, and ſome boiled H<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns: They alſo ſett before them a great wooden Platter charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Porringers of Broth. As for the poorer ſort of people they ſett before their Gueſts a great wooden Charger of Broth thickned with Bread grated very ſmall, with thick Gobbets of Beef, but they make uſe of no Spoons, every one helps himſelf with his Hands.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of the Kingdoms of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> and <hi>Algier,</hi> marry but very few Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for they are bound by their Religion not only to divide the duty of Benevolence equally amongſt them, but alſo to allow e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them a Chamber private to themſelves. The Husband doth alſo aſſign his Wife a Dowry, and when the Man and the future Brides Relations are agreed about it, then the Bridegroom ſends her ſome Box<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Sweet-Meats. On the Wedding Day the Bridegroom, Bride, their Relations and Friends, feaſt together in the Bridegrooms Houſe: They do not ſit down upon Seats as we do, at Table, but lay along upon <hi>Turkey</hi> Carpets; after the Feaſt they begin to danceafter the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Faſhion: then the Bride mounts upon a Theater, erected for that purpoſe, and there makes a ſhew of her Bravery, having ſometimes her face all
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:108995:39"/>
ſhining with Diamonds and other precious Stones. About the Evening the Bride is conducted to her Nuptial Bed, many Drums and Trumpets ſounding before her; then her Bridegroom follows, who ſhutting the Door after him doth conſummate the Marriage; All the Women waiting at the Chamber Door for the Brides Linnen-Drawers, which the Bridegroom brings them, and having faſtned them upon a Pole they carry them in great Triumph dancing and making great cheer. The Woman, after her Marriage, keeps ſeven days within Doors, but as for the Man, he muſt go to bath himſelf, which thing they ought always to do after Coition.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Aegypt</hi> have many Wives which they keep in one <hi>Seraglio,</hi> as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nuns in a Nunnery, every one enjoying her private Room. But as for the <hi>Morisques</hi> or <hi>Granadins,</hi> expelled out of <hi>Spain,</hi> called <hi>Moros Francos,</hi> they have but one. When the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> are paſſionately affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards any Woman, they uſe to teſtify their zealous Paſſion by ſlitting their Skin in ſeveral parts of their Bodies, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves before their beloved Object. Iſ ſhe, by good fortune, chance to kiſs her Hand at the ſight of them, they then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently conclude ſhe hath hung out her white

            <p>The Negroes of <hi>Jaloffa</hi> and <hi>Senega</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many Women, but they have more reſpect for them that are better deſcended. They are ſo civil towards their Women, that they never overcharge their Ship, but ha ving given them their ſufficient Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, never load them again till they be ſafe ly arrived to the Harbour, which we call, <hi>Safe Delivery.</hi>

            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Tartaria Deſerta,</hi> which are Subjects of the great Duke of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> may have as many Wives as they can get, and he that hath moſt of that kind of Cattel, is reputed amongſt them the moſt honourable Man, and the moſt eminent <hi>Vir gregis.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Cherſoneſus,</hi> otherwiſe called little <hi>Tartars,</hi> may marry as many Women as their Law allowes them: They moſt an end buy them of the <hi>Perigorts,</hi> or <hi>Circaſſians.</hi> They maintain them ſplendidly and are very courteous to them, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to them that have brought them any Children. They little regard Beauty or Riches in their Women, but only their Fidelity and good Manners: If they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:108995:40"/>
their Slaves to be duely moralized, they do not diſdain to take them as their Wives. From thence it comes to paſs that their Wives are always very faithful and dutiful, cautious of giving their Husbands any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, living with them with ſingular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Concord. If any amongſt them, having promiſed Marriage to a Woman, chance to fall ſick unto Death, he then ſends for his betrothed Bride, who is married with him by his Bed-ſide. He alſo allows her a competent Dowry, with all Houſhold ſtuff fit for Houſe-keeping, and this they do upon the proſpect of a future Life, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſhall enjoy one another in the World to come.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Indians</hi> are either <hi>Pagans, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> but as they obſerve the Ceremonies of Marriage pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Religion which they profeſs, we will treat in this following Treatiſe only of thoſe which remain, even to this Day, plunged in the woful Labyrinth of blind <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> and <hi>Paganiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the <hi>Indians</hi> in generall, whether they be <hi>Chriſtians</hi> or <hi>Idolaters,</hi> make exceeding merry at their Weddings, paſſing many Day's and Nights in feaſting, ſinging and dancing. As ſoon as the Inſtruments of Muſick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to play, they dance round with little painted ſwitches in their hands. But as for the <hi>Pagans,</hi> they are ſo exceedingly Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:108995:41"/>
that they bind their Women by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe upon Marriage, that in caſe they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live them, they ſhall caſt themſelves head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into their Funeral Pile, there to be conſumed to Aſhes.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of the Kingdom of <hi>Kun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kam</hi> and <hi>Ballagatt</hi> contract Marriage, when they are hardly come to the ſeventh Year of their Age, but they uſe not to conſummate it, till they be eighteen. They are very cautious of marrying below their Rank and Quality, but their Women bring them little ſtore of Riches; For, beſides a few Jewels of inconſiderable value, they bring them their dainty Marigold, but not a Dram of Silver nor Gold.</p>
            <p>The People of the Kingdom of <hi>Biſnagar</hi> marry as many Women as they pleaſe, but in caſe any of their Women be not pleaſed with their Husbands, for want of their ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Doſe, or any other reaſon, they then go to their King and preſenting him with a piece of Gold, he laying his Sword upon their Right Shoulder ſets them at Liberty; ſo that being divorced in that manner, they may lawfully ſeek to mend their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>There be ſome in that Kingdom, which conſecrate their Daughters Virginity to a certain Idol, ſo that as ſoon as they have
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108995:42"/>
attained to the tenth Year of their Age, they are conducted with great Pomp, by their Parents, to the Temple, and being come there the young Damſells Mother, with ſome other grave Matrons, go up with her to a Turret, where is erected a Statue about a Cubit high: They kneel down before it and perform their Idolatrous Devotions. After which the young Maid muſt embrace the ſaid Statue three times; which being done, ſhe muſt remain, all her life time, as pure a Veſtal Virgin as ever ſerved ſeven years Apprenticeſhip in our <hi>Whet-Stone Park.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe of <hi>Canara</hi> obſerve the ſame Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Ceremonies as thoſe of <hi>Kunkan</hi> and <hi>Ballagatt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Malabar,</hi> are divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into three Ranks viz into <hi>Bramins, Naires</hi> and <hi>Moucois:</hi> The Race of the <hi>Bramins</hi> is the moſt eminent and honourable amongſt them; They alſo differ in their manner of Living, and enjoy conſiderable Prerogatives above the reſt. They may marry two Wives, but never any which be inferiour to them in Quality: They marry very young when they are yet but ſeven or eight years of Age.</p>
            <p>As for their <hi>Naires</hi> which are the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-peaſants they may not match with any
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108995:42"/>
Women ſuperiour to their Order and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, neither is it lawful for them to marry more than one Woman at one time; But as for their Women, the caſe is altered, for they may, if they pleaſe, enjoy three Husbands at once, all which are bound to contribute equally towards her and her Childrens maintenance. The firſt that comes in, leaving his Arms at the Door, enjoys her company, and they that come in after, are ſo civil as to withdraw and not to go in to her, untill the Coaſt be clear: So that there happens no Debate nor Quarrel, but they live amicably, every one of them Husbands having his Finger in her Pye Succeſſively.</p>
            <p>The Maids of <hi>Malabar</hi> are naturally very wanton and leacherous; wherefore the Noblemen of that Country are very careful to marry their Daughters betimes, leſt for want of ſufficient Toying and Riggling they ſhould unhappily ſpring a leak: So that very few remain unmarried after fourteen Years of Age. But if they prove ſo unfortunate as to keep their Maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads after that time, then they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail their Virginity all the Days of their Life, for young Men look upon them to as be uſeleſs as old Almanacks.</p>
            <p>They are very Jovial at their Weddings:
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:108995:43"/>
as ſoon as both Parties are agreed, they go to their <hi>Pagodes</hi> Temple, where they uſe to ſay ſome Prayers before their Prieſts. Fifteen days before the Wedding the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of both Parties conduct the future Bride every Day to the Bridegrooms houſe for ſeveral Days together; Who every one of thoſe times treating them, conducts her back to her Parents Houſe. All this is done with great Magnificence (according to the Abilities of the Parties) great ſtore of that Countrey-Muſicians attending, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this whole Nuptial Feſtival. When the time of conſummating the Marriage is come, the Virginity of the Bride is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to an Idol, or <hi>Pagode,</hi> (ſeated on a brazen Throne, of an horrid frightful Form,) which hath a ſharp Bodkin of Gold or Silver faſtned to his Privy-parts: On this the Bride is forcibly ſett, and it, by reaſon of its ſharpneſs, forceth great ſtore of Blood to come. And if, though by her Husband, ſhe proves with Child the firſt Year, they believe this Idol got it, and more highly eſteem it: But, by reaſon of the Pain, the Prieſts, by enjoying them firſt, quit them from this Ceremony; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one of theſe two none are marryed. Their <hi>Samoryn's,</hi> or Kings, themſelves not being exempted: Who, on this account, order
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:108995:43"/>
heir Siſters Children to ſucceed, as being more certainly of the Blood Royal. In theſe Countreys they change their Wives as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as they pleaſe, nor ſeem the Women diſpleaſed at it, Poligamy is ſo tolerable or rather acceptable: And as the Men are allowed many Wives, ſo one Woman is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed many Husbands, and the Iſſue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed as ſhe nominates, The World affords not more obſcene luſtful Perſons than the <hi>Naire's,</hi> uſing Provocatives to ſtir up the decaying heat of Nature: And as our <hi>European</hi> Gallants, by making the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands drunk, ſometimes attain their amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ends, ſo theſe <hi>Naire's</hi> act their Amours by the help of a certain herb, or Drug, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Deutroa</hi> (which infuſed, or otherwiſe taken, infatuates the Intellect,) the Poor Cuckolds being in ſuch a Pickle as not to be ſenſible, though he ſees before his Eyes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plowing with his H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In <hi>Nepapata</hi> (a Town upon the River <hi>Nega)</hi> the manner of their Marriages is extraordinary. For many times the Prieſt with a Cow, and the Man and Woman, go together to the Water-ſide, where the <hi>Bramyn</hi> firſt mutters a ſhort Prayer, and then, linking their Hands about the Cows Tail, pours upon them all his hallowed Oil; and laſtly forces the Beaſt into the River,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:108995:44"/>
whereinto ſhe goes willingly ſo far as till they be up to the middle in Water: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther returns ſhe, nor do they diſunite, till the Waves adviſe them. Being come on ſhore they looſe their hands; and hold that myſterious Tye forcible and ſacred ever after.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Cochin-China</hi> Polygamy is forbidden; the Women are modeſt, and differ not in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell; all of them wearing over them a Veil of White Linnen: and indeed they are the civilleſt of all the Idolaters of thoſe Countries, which, to ſay the truth, have no Wives, all Women being common amongſt them.</p>
            <p>They of the Kingdom of <hi>Bengala</hi> marry as many Women as they can maintain, but they are extreamly Jealous of them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they keep them as cloſe as our <hi>Euclio's</hi> do their Precious Jewels.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Pegu</hi> have extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Manners. Theſe People, neglecting the natural uſe of Women, were formerly much addicted to the deteſtable Abominations of <hi>Sodom;</hi> wherefore, to obviate this Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, one of their Queens was conſtrained to enact a Law that whoſoever ſhould be Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally convicted of that Crime, he ſhould be burned alive. She alſo ordained that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould go with naked Neck and Breaſts,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108995:44"/>
to the end that, expoſing a Samplar of their Wares, they might the ſooner allure Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomers. The Men of that Country are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhy in their matching, and very fearful leſt they ſhould light upon a Crack-piece; for, to ſay the Truth, their Maids are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally all Fire and Toe. They are ſcarce out of the Shell but their quick Oiſter will be gaping, wherefore their Mothers, knowing by Experience the common frailty of their Sex, (which is never found ſure till it be ſure bound,) When their Daughters are yet young, they uſe to ſtitch their lower Lips, leaving nothing but a ſmall Orifice juſt fit to evacuate their natural <hi>Effluvium's.</hi> On the day of their Marriage their Mothers unſtitch them in their Bridegrooms Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and rubbing them with ſome kind of Oil, they are well enough diſpoſed to play at <hi>Putt,</hi> or elſe at <hi>Ombre.</hi> The Nobles, and other Perſons of Gentile Extraction, repute it a diſgrace to beat upon their Brides Anvils the firſt night of their Wedding: They hire ſome of their Friends for that Drudgery. Nay their King is ſo magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, that he will liberally reward the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Champion, who hath couragiouſly demeaned himſelf in the firſt Onſet, and planted his Artillery in his Queens Breach.</p>
            <p>The People of the Kingdom of <hi>Siam</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:108995:45"/>
may marry as many Women as they pleaſe. They commonly buy them of their Parents; they may alſo ſend them packing at their pleaſure but they muſt maintain the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which they have had by them. The Womens Parents may alſo recal their Daughters to their own Houſes, provided they pay back again the Mony which they have received of their Husbands. They that are Idolaters have the ſame Cuſtoms as thoſe of the Kingdom of <hi>Pegu,</hi> but thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, which profeſs the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> principles, are better civilized and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralized.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chineſe</hi> beſtow their Children in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage when they are very young, and their Fathers contract them oftentimes when they are yet in their Mothers Womb. When any of them is to marry he appoints his future Bride ſuch a Dowry as he is able to give her; the Day appointed for the Wedding being come, the Brides Father makes a ſumptuous Feaſt, to which all his Son-in-Law's Parents and Friends are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited: The Day following, the Bridegrooms Father doth do the ſame towards his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-in-Law's Relations. This Feaſt being ended the Husband, bringing the foreſaid Dowry before the whole Aſſembly, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to his Bride, who preſently ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:108995:45"/>
it into the hand of her Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which thing is done for to make them a part of amends for the Charges, they have been at in her bringing up and Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and, for this reaſon, they that have moſt Daughters are commonly the wealthieſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. For the Parents make uſe of their Daughters Dowry, and improve it not only for their own profit, but alſo for the good of their Daughters, becauſe after their deceaſe all the Dowry, together with the Improvement, returns to their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for their and their Childrens Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chineſe</hi> may have as many Women as they pleaſe, but their firſt Love is lookt upon as the only lawful Wife, the others being reputed amongſt them no better than Paramours or Concubines. Wherefore they always live with the firſt, but as for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they maintain them in ſeveral other Places, and in caſe they be Merchants, they ſend them as Factors into their ſeveral places of Traffick. They are forbidden by their Law to marry within any degree of Conſanguinity, and they are ſo ſtrict as not to marry any Woman who beareth the ſame Sirname as themſelves, although ſhe were of no Kin at all. They eſteem Beauty in Women far above their Extraction, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:108995:46"/>
an handſome Woman, although like a Muſhrom born upon a Dunghil, is a dainty Diſh for their palates. As for the common ſort of People amongſt them, they buy their Wives with ready Money, and ſell them again as ſoon as their Appetite longs for Variety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mendoza</hi> doth write that, in ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces next adjacent to <hi>Tartary,</hi> the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roys do prefix a certain limited time, within which both Men and Maids are obliged to marry, or elſe to confine themſelves within the Walls of a Cloyſter. When the ſaid prefixt time is come, all that deſire to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and to be married, come to a certain City appointed to them by their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours for that purpoſe. As ſoon as they are come thither they preſent themſelves before twelve Commiſſioners elected by their King: Theſe Commiſſioners are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grave and the moſt ancient perſons of the ſaid City: They take the Names and Sirnames of all Bachellors and Maids which come before them; they enquire alſo into their Qualities, and the Dowries which the Men are able to beſtow upon their Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: This being done, they examine their Catalogue and finding more Men than Women, or more Women than Men, they cauſe them to draw Lots, and by this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:108995:46"/>
means the ſupernumerary ones are caſt back till the following Year. Six of them twelve Commiſſioners divide the Men into three Companies: Setting aſide the Rich in the firſt, the Middle ſort of them, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and the Pooreſt in the third. Whilſt that theſe ſix are making this Separation amongſt the Men, the other ſix are buſy in making alſo a diſtinction amongſt the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, diſtributing them into three Bands: In the Firſt they place them that are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently Handſome; In the Second, them that are indifferently Comely; And in the Third, the Deformed and Hard-favoured by Nature. This Diviſion being made, they beſtow the Faireſt upon the Rich men who, in regard of that, pay a certain Sum of Money limited by the Judges; they then give the leſs Handſome to them of the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ability, without paying any thing at all. As for the Hard-favoured they become the portion of the Pooreſt ſort of Men, but withal they receive ſome Money with them: for the Money which the Rich men have paid and depoſited in the Judges Hands, is diſtributed equally amongſt them. The Men being thus coupled with the Women, they reſort to ſome publick Houſes, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King in every City for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which Houſes are furniſhed with Beds,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:108995:47"/>
and all things neceſſary for the new married Folks, who remain there fifty days feaſting, dancing and making exceeding merry. After which time all the Men, inſtead of Cloak-bags, carrying proviſion for their Cod-piece, betake themſelves to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Habitations.</p>
            <p>The Nobles of that Country are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to obſerve the Laws aforeſaid, but they marry when and whom they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>The People of <hi>Javan</hi> marry uſually but one Woman, but they ſend her packing when they liſt, and marry another. As for their Women they may not leave their Husbands and take others, unleſs they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow themſelves upon ſome great Lord, who is willing to accept of them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tartars,</hi> which are Idolaters, have many Wives which, notwithſtanding their Number, live amongſt themſelves peaceably. The Firſt is always accounted the moſt honourable, and her Children are preferred before any others. If a Father chances to dye, his Son may marry all the Women he leaves behind him, his own Mother and Siſters only excepted. They commonly marry their Siſters-in-Law after their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Deceaſe, and they are very Jovial at every one of their Weddings.</p>

               <hi>Tanguth,</hi> together with thoſe of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Catay,</hi> may have as many Women as they are able to maintain. Theſe People are great admirers of Beauty, and if they be never ſo rich they will purchaſe a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Woman at any rate, although ſhe be of never ſo mean Parentage. They have ſometimes to the Number of thirty Wives, more or leſs according to their Abilities, but the firſt is always the moſt regarded. If any of their Women be moroſe, or troubled with any other intolerable Qualities, they preſently pack her away to learn better Manners: they marry their Kinſwomen e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as the <hi>Tartars</hi> do, their own Mothers and Siſters onely excepted.</p>
            <p>The People of <hi>Caindu</hi> have extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cuſtoms amongſt themſelves: On their Wedding Day they will invite all ſorts of Strangers which ſojourn amongſt them, and leave them, without any diſturbance, to ſolace themſelves with their Brides. And their Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men like the Sport ſo well, that they ſet a Token at their Doors, and never take it down till they are all departed, and then their ſottiſh Cuckolds may have free Acceſs.</p>
            <p>They of <hi>Caſcar</hi> are as much given to that ſilly piece of Hoſpitality towards Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as thoſe of <hi>Caindu,</hi> for they are never jealous, if Strangers partake never ſo largely
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:108995:48"/>
of their Pyes; ſo that they may have a Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in it in due ſeaſon. If a man be abſent from his Habitation twenty days the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may marry another Husband: The Men may likewiſe do ſo in their Wives Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Canarins,</hi> which inhabit the Iſland of <hi>Goa,</hi> worſhip a certain Idol like a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man all naked: When they have a mind to beſtow their Daughters in Marriage, upon any Man, the Parents uſe to conduct their Daughters towards that Idol, where they perform their antick Devotions, after which they are beſtowed upon them that promiſe the moſt. As for their Nuptial Rites and Ceremonies of Marriage, we have made mention of them before, when we treated of the Solemnities of the Marriages uſed amongſt the Chriſtians of the City of <hi>Goa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Negroes</hi> of <hi>Africa,</hi> Inhabitants of the Kingdom of <hi>Serroliana</hi> have, in every Town and City, a large Houſe, like a Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, appointed for young Maids to dwell in together, and to be inſtructed in all manner of Civil Deportment, and good Houſewifery. They have there ſeveral grave Matrons, with a Venerable old Man, who is Preſident over all, that have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care of theſe Probationers. At the Years end theſe young Maids come out together,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:108995:48"/>
as fine as their Hands can make them, and coming to the moſt publick Place of the City they dance there at the Sound of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sorts of Inſtruments. Their Parents are there preſent, and the young Bachel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors reſort thither as to a Fair; every one making his choice of her he liketh beſt, but he muſt pay ſomething to her Father before he can have her away. He muſt alſo beſtow ſome Gratuity upon the Preſident of the ſaid Place, in conſideration of his Care for her Entertainment and Education: Which being done, without any more Complements, every one carrieth away his own Bride to his Lodging, where they make very mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>In the Kingdom of <hi>Guinney,</hi> as ſoon as their Sons are come to Maturity of Age, the Parents go a Wooing for them and bring them Women, which their Children are obliged to accept of, although they never ſaw their Faces before. The Maids Parents give her fourteen ounces of Gold for her Portion; And this Cuſtom is ſo ſtrictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved amongſt them, that even their petty Kings allow no larger Portion to their own Daughters, excepting only that they allow them ſome Slaves to wait upon them E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Maid, that is to be married amongſt them, muſt take her Oath that ſhe ſhall be
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108995:49"/>
dutiful to her future Husband, and that ſhe ſhall never violate her Conjugal Fidelity: As for the Men they never uſe to require any ſuch Oath from them.</p>
            <p>Moreover if, after their Marriage, the Man hath been ſo thrifty a Husband as to have got Wealth ſufficient for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of another Wife, he may take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, provided that the former give her Conſent to it. He muſt alſo allow her a certain weight of Gold for her Good will: So that he may afterwards marry another, but ſhe is reputed rather as his Concubine, than as his lawful Wife; and when this ſecond Wife begins to grow in Years, he caſts her off, as an Almanack out of Date, and marries another. He notwithſtanding is obliged to keep always the Firſt, who is the only Miſtreſs, having the Command over all his Family.</p>
            <p>The People of the Empire of <hi>Monomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapa</hi> in the lower <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> marry as many Wives as they can maintain, but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is always lookt upon as the moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and her Children only may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge every one a part of their Parents In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance: As for the other Women they are bound to wait upon her and obſerve her Directions and Commands. No man may marry a Maid until ſhe be capable of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception:
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108995:49"/>
Wherefore as ſoon as the Parents perceive any ſuch Marks by their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they make very merry in their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. The Maids go naked till almoſt that time, but when they are to marry, they then put on thin Cloths made of fine Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; and afterwards, when they have bore any Children, they cover their Breaſts with a Piece of Woollen Cloth.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of the Iſland of <hi>Zocotora</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi> marry as many Women as they pleaſe, and when they have their Belly-full of them, they drive them to the Market, where they truck them for others, as we do our Cattel.</p>
            <p>The People of <hi>Canada</hi> may, if they pleaſe, take many Wives, they notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding are well contented with one only.</p>
            <p>As for them of <hi>Samaya</hi> they have many, not ſo much for to ſatiate their appetite, as for to increaſe their Grandeur; for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it honourable to have many Friends, Allies and Children. The Fathers beſtow nothing upon their Daughters: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary he that will have any of them, muſt make ſome Preſents to the Maids Parents, according to her Quality and Beauty. They make great Solemnities at their Weddings: For beſides Feaſting, Balling and Dancing, they make Nuptial Harangues &amp; <hi>Epithala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums,</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:108995:50"/>
if any married Woman be ſurpriſed in Adultery, both ſhe and her <hi>Ruffian</hi> are in great Jeopardy of their Lives. But as for their Maids, they are very favourable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; for they repute their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments never the more jarring, or the leſs Muſical, although their jolly Gallants have plaid never ſo many Courants upon their Fiddles before Marriage.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the People of <hi>Florida</hi> no man is permitted to marry above one Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, their Kings and Nobles only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; who may have two or three Wives, but upon this condition, that the Firſt ſhall be always eſteemed as the Lady-paramount amongſt the other, and that her Children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſhall challenge their Parents Honours and Inheritances. Their Women are very thrifty Houſwives, very careful to improve every thing to the beſt advantage of their Families, and never uſe to lie with their Husbands after Conception.</p>
            <p>As for the Iſlanders of <hi>Cuba,</hi> before their Iſland was depopulated, they married ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Women, but they did uſe to leave their Wives at pleaſure, the Women alſo uſing the ſame Liberty. Their <hi>Caciques</hi> marry as many Women as they liſt, but they have this Cuſtom altogether extraordinary, which is, that when any of them is married, all
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:108995:50"/>
the Men that are invited to this Wedding, are obliged to try their Manhoods upon the Bride<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This Cuſtom is obſerved not only amongſt the common Sort of People, but alſo amongſt them of the beſt Quality.</p>
            <p>The People of <hi>Mexico,</hi> before they had embraced the Chriſtian Faith, were married in this manner. The Bridegroom and Bride went together to their Idol Temple, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves before the Prieſt who, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them both by the hand, did deſire them to let him know their pleaſure; which having known, he preſently took a Corner of the Vail, wherewith the Brides Head was cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and faſtned it to the Corner of the Bridegrooms Gown; and being ſo bound to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether conducted them to the Brides Houſe, where a great Fire was made ready; &amp; being come near that Fire, the ſaid Prieſt led them ſeven times about it. After which Ceremony the Marriage was ended, and then they betook themſelves to Feaſting.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Civola,</hi> otherwiſe called New <hi>Granada,</hi> never marry but one Woman at once, but they take the liberty to ſend her away at pleaſure, and marry another; the Women alſo enjoy the ſame Priviledge, for in caſe their Husbands be not ſo liberal and kind-hearted, as to ſpare from their own Bellies to put it into theirs, then all the Fat is in the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:108995:51"/>
Fire, &amp; they will preſently ſeek better Maſters.</p>
            <p>The People of <hi>Cumana</hi> uſe to ſend their young Daughters to their <hi>Piaces,</hi> or Prieſts, to be inſtructed by them, and to learn their Duty towards their future Husbands. The Nobles of that Country take as many Wives as they pleaſe, &amp; are ſo extraordinary Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous towards Strangers that they, ſtanding at their Doors, will invite Paſſengers, whom they not only delight to regale at their Tables, but will beſtow their faireſt Women upon them alſo to ſolace them at Night.</p>
            <p>They of <hi>Paria,</hi> may alſo have many Wives, but the Firſt married is always the Chief among them. They of the meaneſt Sort have commonly three or four, but when they begin to be old, they turn them off, and take others more young: The Prieſts afterwards inſtruct them, according to the cuſtoms of thoſe of <hi>Cumana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Caribe</hi> marry after the ſame faſhion, only, the day of the Marriage and ſome days after, they bring out the new married Bride into the Woods with a mighty Noiſe, driving and killing all they meet.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Topinanboes,</hi> Inhabitants of <hi>Braſil,</hi> in the South parts of <hi>America,</hi> when they marry, reſpect only the firſt degree of Father, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Brother, Siſter, Son and Daughter; for there the Uncle may freely marry his own
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108995:51"/>
Niece. They take ſo many Wives as they pleaſe, and the more they have, the more valiant and vigorous are they eſteemed. Though they have one they chiefly love, yet the reſt are not at all Jealous, or at leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it not, for they labour in their Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and live together in Peace. As for Ceremonies, they have none, ſave that he who comes to ſee a Maid, or other Woman, deſires her of her Father, or neareſt Relation and (after having diſcovered their Suit, and got their Conſent) takes her along with him as his Wife. It's ordinary amongſt them, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe of Quality, to promiſe their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Marriage, when they are very young; and afterwards give them to thoſe, to whom they are promiſed, who take them according to the Cuſtom of the Country. The Husband may repudiate, and put away, his Wife at pleaſure, when ſhe offends him: And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when the Wife deſigns to part from her Husband ſhe tells him (in their Tongue) <hi>I'll have no more to do with thee, I'll go ſearch for another.</hi> The Husband (without troubling himſelf) anſwers, <hi>Escoain, go where thou wilt.</hi> The Woman may give her ſelf imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to another Man, having the ſame Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to put away her ſecond Husband.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Peru,</hi> before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Catholick, have many Wives, but of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:108995:52"/>
thoſe there is but one whom they reckon the Lawful Wife. The Bridegroom on the day of Marriage went to her Houſe and, bringing her to his own Habitation, he did put on her Feet ſome kind of open Shoes made with a ſort of Ruſhes, which be called, in their own Language, <hi>Ottoya;</hi> which being done, ſhe was honoured as the Miſtriſs-paramount, all the other Women Concubines obeying and ſerving her, and the Iſſue of her Body was onely capable of Inheritance.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Itatins</hi> and <hi>Varack's,</hi> inhabiting the Country of <hi>Sancta Cruz,</hi> did likewiſe marry as many Women as they could maintain: An Uncle doth oftentimes marry his own Neece. When their Daughters are yet but twelve Months old, their Parents look for Husbands for them, they alſo chooſe him that is next of Kin in the ſecond degree. The Parents hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus made choice of a Husband for their Daughter, they go to his Habitation, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with a Bow and Arrows, and a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Pledges of the Matrimonial Contract; If the ſaid Perſon accepted of them, he is looket upon as the Son-in-law, and is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conducted to his Father-in-Laws houſe, there to remain and manage the buſineſſes of his Family, until his future Bride hath at attained to Maturity of Age. But in caſe that a young Man hath any Affection for a Maid
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:108995:52"/>
which never was offered to him, he then makes his application to her Parents, and preſenteth them with a bundle of Sticks: If they receive it, it is an evident token that they are well pleaſed with his motion, and preſently they admit him into their own Houſe. As ſoon as a Woman is married a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, her firſt care is to make two winding Sheets, one for her Husband and the other for her ſelf: A commendable Example for all Chriſtians to follow; the remembrance of our Mortality being a prevalent Antidote againſt all peſtilential Diſeaſes of the Soul.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Guiana</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Nova Andalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> the common Sort of People muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with one Diſh, but as for their Nobles they may enjoy Variety of Women; they have the ſame Marriage-Ceremonies, as thoſe of <hi>Peru.</hi> But, as <hi>England</hi> is eſteemed the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of Women, ſo on the contrary that Country is their Purgatory; for Women are put to all manner of Drudgery, their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being little better than our common Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, or Chamber-Maids.</p>
            <p>There is a kind of People in <hi>Syria</hi> called <hi>Druſes,</hi> which ſome Authors have reckon'd amongſt Chriſtians, but which are neither <hi>Jews</hi> nor Chriſtians, but rather a Crew of Barbarous Mongrels; for they marry their Mothers Daughters and Siſters without any
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:108995:53"/>
regard at all: The reaſon they alledge for this Barbarous brutality is, that they have begotten Children for their own uſe, and not for others, and that no body ought to forbid them the enjoyment of that which is Naturally their own. They have ſome Holy Days in the year, wherein their Men and Women aſſemble themſelves in a publick place, where they are extreamly Jovial, for after their Feaſting and Balling, they begin another kind of Dance, borrowing one anothers Wives.</p>
            <p>The Eaſtern <hi>Japannois,</hi> otherwiſe called Wild <hi>Lopps,</hi> contract Marriage in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: The day of the Wedding being come, all the Bridegrooms Friends, and Relations, reſort to his Tent, and being gathered together, the Bridegroom goes to his Brides Tent, and brings her to his own; where being come, he in the preſence of all the aſſembly, taking a Steel with a Flint, ſtrikes Fire with all his force, and the more Fire appears, the more fortunate they judge him, looking upon that as a happy Preſage of his future Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: This Ceremony ended, the Marriage is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. Then they cauſe the Bride, clothed with <hi>Zibellins</hi> and <hi>Hermines,</hi> to be ſett upon a tamed Boar; the Bridegroom, being clothed with Bear Skins, goes a foot by her ſide, all their Relations following with joyful Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, wiſhing them all Proſperity, and a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:108995:53"/>
numerous Off-Spring. Being come to their Tent they feaſt and dance, which being done, they begin to ſing the <hi>Elogium's</hi> of their deceaſed <hi>Hero's,</hi> and eminent Captains, renowned amongſt them for their valorous Atchievements in Warlike affairs. As ſoon as they have made an end of their Songs, the Bridegroom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bride, and all their Gueſts, caſt themſelves on the ground, in a pitiful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, weeping, ſobbing and lamenting the frailty of their Nature and Mortality. About half an hour after, the Inſtruments begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to play, and every one riſe up to renew the Dance.</p>
            <p>In the South part of the World, commonly called <hi>Magellanica,</hi> when a Man hath Affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion for a Woman, he goes to her Relations, to ask them their good will; which having obtained he, without any further Ceremony, takes her along with him, and they Cohabit together like Husband and Wife. Their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations aſſemble themſelves the next day for to feaſt and make merry; after that the Brides Relations offer her ſome Preſents, which the Bridegroom receiveth with thankfulneſs: The Women amongſt them practiſe the ſame Trade as their Husbands. If any of them chance to ring Changes, and play foul with another Man; then her Husband ſends her away to her Parents, who preſently ſhave off all the Hair
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:108995:54"/>
of her Head; and in caſe ſhe, turning a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, will return to her Husband, he not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding never will vouchſaſe to honour her with his Bed, but ſhe muſt reſt contented to ſerve him, and do all manner of Drudgery.</p>
            <p>Having performed my task <hi>(gentle Reader)</hi> and, as I hope, in part contented thy Curoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty about theſe Nuptial Ceremonies; a part of which Ihave been a Witneſs to, &amp; of others have received credible Informations from ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry grave Authors and Travellers: Nothing remaineth, but that I Pray the God of all U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Concord, in Mercy to heal all our Breaches, to the end that our Church may appear like a Bride, all Glorious within, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to attend upon Chriſt her Bridegroom, to whom with the Father, and Holy Spirit, be all Honour and Glory, World without End.</p>
