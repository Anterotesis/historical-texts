         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DECLARATION TO ALL THE WORLD OF Our Faith, and what we Believe. And this is written that all people upon earth may know by whom, and how we are saved, and hopes for eternal life; &amp; what we believe concerning God, Christ, &amp; the Spirit, and of the things that are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, appertaining to all mankind to know &amp; believe.</head>
            <head type="sub">Concerning God, Christ, and the Spirit, this we believe.</head>
            <p>FIrst, That there is onely one true God, who is a Spirit, and his presence filleth heaven and earth, and he is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Everlasting, the Creator and Preserver of all things, and Heaven and Earth, and all things therein, by him were framed and brought forth, and all things remain unto this day by his Power, and whatsoever he will in Heaven and Earth, he brings to passe by his Word and Power. And we believe that this God onely is, and ought to be feared, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, obeyed and worshipped by all creatures, and no other thing besides him in Heaven or Earth; and we believe, That his Worship, and Obedience, and Fear, and Love, is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in spirit, even in what his own Spirit moveth and leadeth his people unto. And we believe his true Worship, required and accepted of him, is not by the Traditions of men, in outward observances, or set-dayes, or places, but is worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped only in spirit &amp; truth, without respect of time, places, or things; and that none can worship him in righteousnesse but his children who are born of his spirit, and are led and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereby. And we believe that this God hath given his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40392:2"/>
Son Christ Jesus into the Word, a free-gift unto the whole World, and that every man that cometh into the World is lightned by him, that every man might believe, and be saved. And we believe that he is given into the World, and no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Countrey, or People excepted, but unto all mankind is he given of God, and hath lightned them, and every man through the World, that believeth in, and receiveth Christ, who is the VVisdom and Power of the Father, shall be saved with eternal salvation; and every one that believeth not in him, shall be damned, and shall possesse everlasting misery. And we believe that <hi>Salvation, Iustification,</hi> and <hi>Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> is onely in him, and wrought by him, and no other; for there is no other Name given under Heaven, but him alone, by which salvation is. And we believe all that receives him, and believes in him are reconciled to God, and are made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live to God, to live to him in all things, and doth receive the forgivenesse of sins, and are set free from all unrighteousness, and from the body of sin and death, and hath the VVitnesse of the Spirit in them; and the Spirit of the Father they have received, and it witnesseth in them of the Father and of the Son, and of the things that belong unto their peace; and it is the earnest of the Inheritance, and the Seal of the promise of eternal life; and by it are the deep things of God reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to mankind; and by it the Father and the Son dwells in the Saints; and by it have they fellowship one with another; and the Father, Son, and Spirit are one: And this we faithfully believe.</p>
            <p>Again, Concerning Christ, VVe believe that he is one with the Father, and was with him before the VVorld was; and what the Father worketh, it is by the Son, for he is the Arm of Gods <hi>Salvation,</hi> and the very <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the Creator, and was, is, and is to come, without beginning or end. And we believe that all the Prophets gave testimony of him, and that he was made manifest in <hi>Iudea</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and did the VVork of the Father, and was persecuted of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and was crucified by his enemies, and that he was bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp; rose again, according to the Scriptures. And we believe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40392:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he is now ascended on High, and exalted at the right hand of the Father for evermore; &amp; that he is glorified with the same glory that he had before the VVorld was; and that even the same that came down from Heaven, is ascended up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and the same that descended, is he that ascended.</p>
            <p>And we believe even he that was dead, is alive, and lives for evermore; and that he cometh, and shall come again to judge the whole VVorld with righteousnesse, and all people with equity, and shall give to every man according to his deeds at the day of Judgement, when all shall arise to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or justification, he that hath done good shall receive life, and he that hath done evil, everlasting condemnation. And we believe he is to be waited for in spirit, to be known after the Spirit, as he was before the VVorld was, and that is the knowledge unto eternal life; which all that believe in him doth receive; and he subdues death, and destroyes him that hath the power of it, and restoreth from death to life, and quickneth by his Spirit all that the Father hath given him; and we believe such he justifieth and sanctifieth, and such are taught of him; but he condemns all that believe not, but continues in unbelief, and are not taught of him: And this vve faithfully believe.</p>
            <p>And vve believe that unto all people upon the face of the vvhole earth, is a time and day of visitation given, that they may return and be saved by Christ Jesus, vvho is given of the Father to call the vvorst of men to repentance, and the most ungodly of sinners are convinced by him of their ungodly deeds, that they might believe, and be converted, and saved. And vve believe herein is the love of God manifested to all mankind, and that none is shut out by him before they vvere born into the VVorld; but unto all men is a Visitation given, and they that do perish, it is because they do not believe in Christ; &amp; destruction is of a mans self, but salvation is of God, through believing in his Son, vvho takes avvay sin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevveth into his ovvn Image, that they may become Heirs vvith him. And vve believe that there is a Crovvn of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory, and an Inheritance of eternal life to be injoyed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40392:3"/>
for evermore by all that believe and are chosen of God, and that there is everlasting misery and destruction to be possessed by all that believe not, but continues in the stare of reprobation, and are not changed from the Wayes of sin and death, but walks after the wayes of their own hearts lusts, fulfilling the Will of the flesh, in the evil of this World, and follows not Christ the Light of the World, that they may be saved; and we believe upon all such the Wrath of God abideth, and that they have no part in the Inheritance of God. And we believe that it is onely he that is born again of the Spirit, and that walks after the Spirit, who is changed from death to life, and who is redeemed out of the World and all its Wayes, such onely must inherit the kingdom of God, and they onely have right thereunto, and none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, even they that are washed and clensed from all unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse by the blood of Jesus, by which their sins are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, for his blood clenseth from all unrighteousness and sin, they that walk in the light which Christ Jesus hath light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the World withall.</p>
            <p>And we believe that the Saints upon Earth may receive forgiveness of sins, and may be perfectly freed from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of sin and death, and in Christ may be perfect, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sin, and may have Victory over all temptations by faith in Christ Jesus. And we believe every Saint that is called of God, ought to press after perfection, and to overcome the Devil and all his temptations upon earth; and we believe they that wait for it shall obtain it, and shall be presented without sin in the Image of the Father, and such walks not after the flesh, but after the spirit, and are in covenant with God, &amp; their sins are blotted out &amp; remembred no more, for they cease to commit sin, being born of the seed of God. And we believe the Gospel of Christ is the Power of God unto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, &amp; that it ought to be preached freely unto all people, and Christ to be held forth to all mankind by the Ministry sent of him. And we believe this Ministry is received by the gift of the Holy Ghost, and all they that receive it, are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called to the Ministry, and they may preach the Gospel
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40392:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Christ freely, as they have received it freely; and this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry is not of man, but of God, and is made powerful to the converting of sinners, and to the bringing of people to God, and to the knowledge of his Wayes. And we do not believe that any man is a Minister of Christ without the gift of the Holy Ghost, or that the Gospel can be received by natural learning or education. And we believe such as preach for hire, and hath hire for preaching, are not the lawful called Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Gospel of Christ, such as are proud, and high minded, and covetous men, who doth not profit the people at all, such have run, and were never sent of Christ, who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth by his spirit into the Work of the Ministry; and as every one hath received the gift of that his Spirit, so he may admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister to others.</p>
            <p>Concerning Rulers and Governors; We believe that there ought to be Rulers and Governors in every Nation, City, Countrey, or Town, and they ought to be such men as fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God, and hateth every evil Way, who will judge for God, and not for man, and will judge righteously, equally, and justly, and will give true and sound judgement unto all men, without bribery, or respect of persons, not regarding the rich above the poor, but being a praise unto all that do well, and a terror to all evil-doers whatsoever, having knowledge in the pure Law of God, and themselves continually exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed therein. And we believe that every Law of man ought to be grounded upon the Law of God, pure Reason and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity being the foundation thereof, that Gods Witness in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man may answer to it; and the Law ought to be known unto all people before transgression be charged or punished in any man. And we believe that every Transgression ought to be punished according to its nature, and that the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment exceed not the greatnesse of the transgression; neither ought any Transgressor to escape unpunished; neither ought any upon false suspition or jealousies to be caused to suffer without the testimony of true men, or the confession of the party. And we believe that the Executors of the Law ought to be just men, and not given to pride, drunkenness, or any
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40392:4"/>
other evil whatsoever, and ought to be chosen every year, or otherwise, by the common consent of all people, and that no man be stopped of his free choice. And we believe that all Governors and Rulers ought to be accountable to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to the next proceeding Rulers, for all their actions, which may be inquired into upon occasion; and that the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Rulers be subject under the Law, and punishable by it if they be transgressors, as well as the poorest of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: And thus true Judgement and Justice will be brought forth in the earth, and all that do well will have praise, and live in rest and peace and all evil-doers whatsoever may stand in awe, and be afraid of God, and just men, and the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of good Laws.</p>
            <p>Concerning Religion; We believe that it is onely the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord that makes men truly religious, and that no man ought to be compelled to, or from any exercise or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise in Religion, by any outward Law, or Power, but every man ought to be left free, as the Lord shall perswade his own mind in doing, or leaving undone this, or the other practise in Religion; and every man of what profession in Religion soever, ought to be protected in peace, provided himself be a man of peace, not seeking the wrong of any mans person or Estate.</p>
            <p>And we believe that to reprove false Opinions, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound Doctrines and Principles, seeking to convince them that oppose themselves, by exhortation, or sharp reproof, by Word or Writing, ought not to be counted a breach of the Peace; or to strive about the things of the Kingdom of God, by men of contrary minds or judgements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this ought not to be punishable by the Magistrates and their Laws; for we believe that the outward <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Powers</hi> of the earth is onely to preserve mens persons &amp; estates, and not to preserve men in Opinions; neither ought the Law of the Nation to be laid upon mens consciences, to bind them to, or from such a judgement or practise in Religion. And we believe that Christ is, and ought onely to be Lord and Exerciser of mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and his Spirit onely must lead into all truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:40392:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>And we believe that obedience and subjection in the Lord belongs to Superiors and that Subjects ought to obey them in the Lord that have Rule over them; and that children ought to obey their Parents, and Wives their Husbands, and Servants their Masters in all things, which is according to God, which stands in the exercise of a pure conscience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God: But where Rulers, Parents, or Masters, or any other, commandeth or requireth subjection in any thing which is contrary to God, or not according to him, in such causes all people are free, and ought to obey God rather then man; and we believe that herein God will justifie them, being guided and led by his spirit in all that which is good, and out of all that which is evil.</p>
            <p>Again, We believe concerning Election and Reprobation, that there is a state of Election, and a state of Reprobation; a state chosen of God, and a state rejected of God, and that all mankind is in one of these states; all that are elected, are elected in Christ, and all that are out of him are in the state reprobate, bringing forth fruits of death and darkness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a child of wrath and disobedience, in the alienation and separation from God, in the transgression, unreconciled to God, the enmity ruling in the heart, being in the fall, and not restored to God again, but ignorant of his power, and of his Wisdom, having his understanding darkned that he cannot see nor perceive the things that are eternal; and in this condition his best Works are sin, and in whatsoever he doth he cannot be accepted with God, for he is dead to God, and alive to all evil, bringing forth all his Works out of that ground which is cursed. This is the condition of all mankind upon the face of the Earth, in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and this is the state of Reprobation, and all that abide herein are rejected of God, and shall never inherit eternal life, but goes into perdition; yet have all such a day of Visitation, that they may return out of the state of Reprobation; but hating knowledge, and despising the love of God, they continue in the state reprobate, and the Wrath of God abides upon them: But they that are chosen of God are delivered from Wrath,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40392:5"/>
for they believe in the light, and becomes children of the light, and are renewed in mind and heart, and receiveth the love of the Father, and becometh planted into Christ the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> and are chosen in him to bring forth fruit unto the Father, and all their fruit springeth from that ground which is blessed; for they are led by the Spirit of the Father, and such are in the estate of election, who is made Heirs w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th Christ of the everlasting Inheritance that never fades away: And this we faithfully believe, That mercy is not shewed to the reprobate, nor judgement to them that are chosen of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this is to go abroad in the world that all people may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what we believe, and what we have received of God; and they that believe this, and walk therein, by the Spirit of the Fa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her shall be saved; but they that believe not, but are disobedient to the truth, shall be condemned because they do not believe.
