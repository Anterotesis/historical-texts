            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7352:3"/>
The next <hi>Plaintife,</hi> is <hi>Gods Glory, Grace, Gospell,</hi> complaining they are vndermined, ouerturned, by an <hi>Appeale:</hi> wherein <hi>Gods foundation of his free grace and mercy in electing vs in his Son to saluation,</hi> is laid vpon the <hi>sandy ground</hi> of <hi>Mans freewill.</hi> his eternall and vnrepentant loue to his Elect, made to depend vpon the haire of humaine mutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, standing on its owne vnsteddy bottome to fall <hi>totally, finally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third <hi>Plaintife,</hi> is the <hi>Sacred Ashes</hi> of Your <hi>Royall</hi> Father of famous memory, complaining His honor is polluted, prophaned in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree by <hi>An Appeale,</hi> so much depressing the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> which His Maiestie so much graced, and exalting <hi>Arminianisme,</hi> which His sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie so much detested.</p>
            <p>The fourth <hi>Plaintife,</hi> is <hi>Gods Church,</hi> especially our Mother Church of <hi>England,</hi> iustly complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how impiously she is abused, and her Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines traduced, by an <hi>Appeale,</hi> as if in the very <hi>Fundamentalls,</hi> (as <hi>Praedestination, Election, Freewill, Iustification, Faith, Perseuerance in sauing grace, Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of saluation,</hi> and the like) shee iumped with the Apostatized Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate <hi>Arminians:</hi> as if her Doctrines were not the same with the holy Scriptures: as if they must
<pb facs="tcp:7352:4"/>
be rated by a few priuate spirits, ingrossing, as by a <hi>Monopoly,</hi> the name of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> reducing <hi>Ecclesia Romana</hi> to <hi>Curia Romana:</hi> as if her Doctrines were as mutable, as their vniust Iudges, who <hi>Cameleon</hi> like will change colour with euery obiect of time.</p>
            <p>The fifth <hi>Plaintife</hi> is the <hi>State,</hi> complaining of a ruefull distraction and rent it suffereth, by a most factious and seditious <hi>Appeale,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very vnseasonably, like a disastrous Comet, portendeth vniuersall ruine both to Church and <hi>State,</hi> if the vast breach made thereby, for the grand enemy to enter, bee not all the sooner and surer (if possible) made vp againe.</p>
            <p>The sixth <hi>Plaintife</hi> is the <hi>Ghost</hi> of some of the <hi>Reuerend forefathers</hi> of our Church, as Doctor <hi>Bancroft,</hi> once Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and Doctor <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall,</hi> once Deane of <hi>Pauls,</hi> and Bishop of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> complaining, that their speeches in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference at Hampton Court</hi> (Ianua. 14. 1603.) now lately printed, the one about <hi>Praedestination,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Perseuerance</hi> in grace, are pitifully and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably peruerted in <hi>An Appeale,</hi> to the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of their owne Credits, and in them, the scandall of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The seuenth <hi>Plaintife</hi> is the <hi>Communion of
<pb facs="tcp:7352:4"/>
Saints</hi> militant, in this Church, and elswhere (yea some, now Triumphant in heauen) complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that notwithstanding they striue both in faith and practise to come as neere, as is possible for humaine frailtie, to Christ and his Apostles, yet for that very cause they are persecuted and reproached in An <hi>Appeale,</hi> with the odious name of <hi>Puritan,</hi> and what not?</p>
            <p>Now all these <hi>Plaintifes,</hi> most noble King, do as by speciall interest, craue <hi>iustice</hi> at Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties hands. Truth claimes it, as You are <hi>King of England, Defender of the faith;</hi> that as <hi>It makes</hi> You <hi>free,</hi> so You would it, with full <hi>priuiledge</hi> to plead its owne cause. <hi>Gods glory</hi> claimes it of You, as whom (aboue all Princes in Christendome) He hath put such a rich crowne of grace and glory vpon, that thereby Your Maiestie might learne how highly to prize His infinite glory, which the more You stand for against its enemies, the more firmely it shall make You to stand against all Your Aduersaries. The <hi>Sacred Ashes</hi> of Your royall <hi>Father</hi> of pious memory require justice of You, not onely as you are a King, but as the most pious Son of such a Father, that as by An <hi>Appeale,</hi> You are called to be an <hi>vmpire,</hi> You would accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly determine, whither in Your judgement
<pb facs="tcp:7352:5"/>
the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> with the Decrees of it, be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be reiected, and set at nought, for the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealers</hi> vilifying and disclaming of it: or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously maintained by Your Maiestie, at least for the incomparable judgement of King IAMES, who both sent thither a learned select represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiue Church of <hi>England,</hi> and Himselfe also gaue His royall assent to all the conclusions of it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all points consonant to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The Church of <hi>England,</hi> with the State (like <hi>Hipocrates twinnes,</hi> mutually affected with each others weale or woe, both liu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, both dying together) with one heart and voyce humbly craue justice of Your Maiestie, as being <hi>next vnder Christ ouer both, in all causes, ouer all persons, the onely supreme Gouernour;</hi> that You would chastise their contumacious children, who fasten reproaches, and hasten ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines to both. The fame of our Forefathers cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth justice of Your Maiestie, to free them from the false aspersion of blasphemy, and from the opinion of being <hi>Arminians.</hi> All Gods children, co-heires with Your Maiestie of the same King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory, implore Your iustice, to rescue their innocency from the reproach of <hi>Puritanis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi> the very name, being enough to cause Truth
<pb facs="tcp:7352:5"/>
to be taken for Heresie; sincerity, for hypocrisy; a peaceable Conformitant, for a seditious Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke; a loyall subiect, for a traitor; an honest man, for a varlet.</p>
            <p>Thus by <hi>iustice,</hi> shall Your Maiesties <hi>throne</hi> be <hi>established.</hi> Thus may fearefull consequents bee preuented, if the causes be timely remoued. I reade but of two maine things, which wrought <hi>Ierusalems</hi> wracke: the one, Idolatry, causing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten desolations, and miseries vpon that Church and state: the other, Heresy, in reiecting of Christ, and his righteousnesse, seeking iustification by workes. This later alone, euen without the other (for in Christs time, and after, not an Idol, or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage was found in <hi>Iudea)</hi> caused that fatall and finall irreparable ruine, once for all.</p>
            <p>Parallel to these two, are <hi>Pontifician</hi> Idolatry, and <hi>Arminian</hi> Heresy, the summe whereof is to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish the true, and to establish a new Religion. For the first, it is grosse enough to bewray it selfe, and to deserue to bee cast out, least such lading not onely cause, but conspire with the storme to drowne the ship it is carried in. For the second (because it is somewhat more refined, and hath learned to goe vailed vnder the Maske of the
<pb facs="tcp:7352:6"/>
Church of <hi>England;</hi> the more dangerous both for seducement and sedition; as a poyson, the more subtile, the more mortall) be your Maiestie pleased to take aduertisment of the more proper markes of an <hi>Arminian.</hi> An <hi>Arminian</hi> is in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall qualities, just like his Religion. First, he is no lesse ambitious of head-ship ouer men, then his Religion is of copartnership (at least) with God, in His glory. Secondly, as his Religion flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters him, so he men; very officious in soothlesse soothings, the Spaniels, that finde his ambition game. Thirdly, as his religion is contrary, so hee cannot away with <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> and their learnedest and foundest writers, as <hi>Caluin</hi> special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beyond the Seas. Fourthly, as he <hi>hates to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,</hi> so one peece of his Sermon must be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uectiue against a reformed Christian, his <hi>Puritan.</hi> Fifthly, sith his Religion complies so well with <hi>Popery,</hi> he will therefore euer preferre the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> before any, yea, all <hi>Reformed Churches.</hi> Sixthly though he loue to be a droane, yet brings he a kinde of honey to Preferments hiue.

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian</hi> Reader, <hi>I present thee here with a</hi> Plea <hi>to an</hi> Appeale. <hi>That</hi> Appeale <hi>I meane styled,</hi> An Appeale to Cesar. <hi>Which is such, as I confesse (sauing for the Titles, wherein I find the Sacred name</hi> of Cesar) <hi>I had filed my feete, rather then my hands with it, if after my long frustrate expectation of seeing it burned, I had not, to my great wonderment, seene the contrary, namely, that it found so many friends and favorites. Besides sundry things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which at first might haue passed onely for errours, as fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from some distemper of hastie passion: being now stoutly and stiffly, in cold blood, defended, they grow to be flat</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, <hi>and so no further to be tollerated, as</hi> S. Augustine <hi>spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. For my owne part, when I perused the booke, my spirit was not a little stirred in me, to see Gods glory defaced, our Salvation vndermined, our Church scandalized, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish</hi> Arminianisme <hi>triumphing, even vpon the open Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Faine would I haue beene dealing with it, but both the consciousnes of my many both naturall disabilities, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall infirmities, as also the hope I had of so many my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and able elder brethren (who I trusted would, and still hope will, vindicate at least their deare Mothers credit, the Church of</hi> England) <hi>held me backe. Notwithstanding at last (though the least of all) I gaue the on-set</hi> (nec tardum oppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riens, nec praecedentibus instans) <hi>as, well knowing, that</hi> Hosanna <hi>is accepted of Christ, as well from the mouthes of little children, as of others; Yea, and sometimes, (if those</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:7352:8"/>
should hold their peace, the very stones would cry. <hi>And where as not only my personall imperfections, but my naturall corruptions also stood vp to disswade me from such a Taske: yet even from them also, did I draw motiues vnto it. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I thought my example of shewing willingnesse to my weaknesse, might provoke the more able, to be the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to supply my wants. Secondly, out of the sense and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of my many corruptions, that</hi> Law in my members, leading me <hi>(miserable!)</hi> captiue to the law of sinne; <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving such abundant experience of that</hi> superabundant grace <hi>of God, which hath mightily borne me vp even against the streame of rebellious nature, so that</hi> when my foote slipped, his mercy held me vp: <hi>I have learned hereby how deepely I am bound to expresse my thankfulnes to God, in setting forth to the vttermost of my power,</hi> the praise of the glory of his Grace, sufficient <hi>for me, against those</hi> thornes <hi>in my</hi> flesh, <hi>against those</hi> buffering messengers of Satan, <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to overthrow me, if the Lords never fayling grace had not made me to stand. Yea how many stormes of temptations hath my brittle barke indured, yet blessed be God, it is not wracked. Those Reliques of rebellious</hi> Canaanites <hi>dwelling in me, as</hi> thornes in my side, <hi>and</hi> pricks in myne eyes, <hi>by Gods grace humble me onely, overcome me not. So that God having put in my hand, such a tryed weapon of infallible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of his saving grace: I should be very ingratefull to let it lie rusting in the sheath, and not to use it with my best strength, courage and skill, against the adversary of this grace, who saith, that the Child of God ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:7352:8"/>
Predestinating vs in Christ to Grace and Glory, those</hi> gifts and calling of God without repentance; <hi>it revineth (directly in part, and by consequence, altogether) that wicked heresy of the</hi> Pelagians, <hi>noted by the Reverend Bishop of</hi> Chichester, <hi>and the worshipfull</hi> M. Francis Rovs, <hi>two noble champions of Gods Truth; it comes close vp also to make a league with the Councel of</hi> Trent, <hi>to truck with</hi> Rome, <hi>in all that fard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And having the Treatise by me, already finished, and priviledged also, (while the season served) for the Presse, onely prvented by the last visitation: I haue ben the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take this new occasion to borrow at least some Artillery from that greater worke, to encounter these fresh Assaults, made against the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And see, how the same motiue, that put me vpon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer worke, hath drawne me also to this. Shall I tell the plaine truth? Why not? But I must name Doctor</hi> Francis White <hi>then, and discover something, which passed betweene him and me in private. But this I hope shall not violate the Law of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, sith I shall say no more, but what himselfe, in his</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation <hi>prefixed to the</hi> Appeale, <hi>hath not stuck to make open profession of to the world. It is this, I having about foure yeares agoe, taken a thorow survey of the sixt Session of the Councel of</hi> Trent, <hi>and finding therein</hi> Romes <hi>Apostacy from the faith of Christ cunningly couched: I tooke occasion (simply suspecting nothing, as then) to goe to the said Doctor, wishing

he would vndertake so worthy a Taske, as to declare fully the true difference betweene vs and the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>in the doctrine of</hi> Iustification, <hi>according to the Councel of</hi> Trent. <hi>But his answer was, that the difference was but small between vs. I wondring at his answere, No Sir, said I, then let vs shake hands with them, and be good friends. For on this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation stands the maine fabrick of</hi> Romes <hi>Religion, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in humaine satisfactions and merits, all devised to fill vp the vast emptines of their</hi> Iustification, <hi>from which Roote they all, as branches, doe receiue life and growth. Yet to be sure, another time I propounded the same question vnto him; his answere was the same; and so was my reply.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hereupon, farre aboue my strength, I tooke courage to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt that taske my selfe, leuelled against</hi> Pontifician <hi>and</hi> Arminian <hi>Doctrines ioyntly all along: and now againe am I no lesse, if not much more, iustly prouoked, to reuiew and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue something of that former worke, being spurred thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, more (I confesse) by Doctor</hi> Whites Approbation, <hi>then Master</hi> Mountagues Appeale. <hi>Nor, in such a Cause, am I a whit moued with the name and fame of Doctor</hi> White. <hi>He is a learned man, I confesse; but Truth is better learned.

               <p>Sir I thanke you for your last good company at the Ordinary; and especially for your both merry and learned discourse; wherein, among other passages, you wittilie disciphered the nature of a <hi>Puritan,</hi> that common opposite to vs both. I was much delighted to heare you, and haue often thought of you since, and shall loue you the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for it: for of all men I cannot away with these <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> a precise sect, crosse and contrary to all other men. A man may not sweare an oath (forsooth) nor play the good fellow a little, in drinking a cup or two more then needs, for good fellowship-sake, nor loue a wench, and the like, but wee must passe their most sharpe censure. Nay, hauing deeply waighed the matter, I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that were it not for these <hi>Puritans,</hi> wee and you should agree together, as louing brethren, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen.</p>

you haue hit the very nayle on the head; and herein you discouer your wisdome, and judgement. For it were no hard matter (I wis) to reconcile you and mee, and such as wee are, as well in Religion and opinion, as we are already in affection, were it not for these make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate <hi>Puritans.</hi> And you haue well said, in saying, we and you: for, howsoeuer, the <hi>Puritans,</hi> both in <hi>England</hi> and beyond the seas (I meane, the <hi>Caluinists</hi> and <hi>Hugenots)</hi> are called <hi>Protestants;</hi> yet betweene them and vs Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Catholicks, there is <hi>a great Gulfe set, so that</hi> there is no hope of reconciliation betweene vs. And indeed; for those ciuill and good fellow <hi>Protestants</hi> (whom I know you meane) that hold of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> for the prop and piller of their Faith; there is great hope, that they will, ere long, be reconciled to the <hi>holy mother Church of Rome:</hi> for, <hi>he that beleeueth as the Church beleeueth, is not farre from the kingdome of God.</hi> But these <hi>Puritans,</hi> they will not acknowledge any <hi>rule of faith</hi> from the <hi>Church,</hi> but are all for <hi>Scriptures, Scriptures:</hi> so that so long as they are of that minde, there is no hope of reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs and them; vnlesse they will yeeld to this <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime,</hi> That the <hi>Church</hi> is the <hi>Iudge</hi> and <hi>interpreter</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> which they most obstinately deny.</p>

               <p>But, by your leaue, Master <hi>Babylonius;</hi> I neuer vnderstood, but that the <hi>Doctrine of the Church of England,</hi> was all one with the Doctrine of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi> as I euer haue ben taught.</p>

               <p>You say well, I thinke neuer a whit the worse of the booke, for the <hi>Puritans</hi> taxing of it; nor the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor the lesse learned, when you Master <hi>Babylonius</hi> sticke not so to commend him.</p>

               <p>I must needs ingenuously confesse, that I like the booke the better, because it plagues the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi> and plots a reconciliation betweene vs and you.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Asotus.</speaker>
               <p>Wee agree in that; But, sith you so much commend the booke, and so much rumor runnes of it, I will goe cast away one couple of shillings vpon it.</p>

               <p>Yea, but you must know Master <hi>Asotus,</hi> it is one thing what a man saith in publicke, for popular applause, and salary; and another, what he thinketh in his owne priuate opinion and conscience. As the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician cited by Saint <hi>Aug:</hi> said to his wife, disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plining

               <speaker>Babylonius.</speaker>
               <p>True; but here the case is different. For say, the booke containes matter vnapprouoble to many, yet Doctor <hi>White</hi> if he se occasion, may easily winde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe out of the snare; as I heare he doth already, saying, That the Copie printed varieth from that which hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued. Blame him not, till the booke (as happily, and hopefully it will) get better footing in the worlds affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and good will. In the meanetime, it is good pollicy a little to pull in the hornes: For it is obiected by the <hi>Puritan</hi> faction, that Master <hi>Mountagues</hi> former booke, called his <hi>Gag,</hi> which his <hi>Appeale</hi> defendeth, doth in many particulars containe expresse contrarieties to <hi>the Doctrine of the Church of England:</hi> and consequently his <hi>Appeale,</hi> with the factors and abettors, as <hi>Accessaries</hi> at least, come within the compasse of a <hi>Premunire.</hi> But you know these pestilent <hi>Puritans</hi> will say, and make the worst of things; and they are a strong faction. And perhaps the buzze may somewhat possesse the good old man with a panicke feare, least not onely hee loose what hee hath, but which is much more, what his many merits may hope for, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that Saints merits are not so high flowne in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> but they are easily ouersoared by <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> flying to the top of euery pinnacle of the highest Temple, vpon Angels wings. But for the booke, I doe not hold it so greatly blame worthy, as finding it a faire and towardly beginning, to produce in time most
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7352:15"/>
hopefull consequents; (as they say, <hi>Rome.</hi> was not built in one day) but let me a little excuse the good old man And the rather, because the <hi>Puritans</hi> sticke not to cast him in the teeth with <hi>White dyed blacke:</hi> which colour (say they) comming from the fatt of a <hi>Romane Catholick</hi> Dyer, would not haue holden soe sure, if it had not found the ground of a selfe-woading, to make it the more permanent. Yet the <hi>Appealer</hi> (I can tell you) hath faire <hi>Cards</hi> on his sides, and almost all the <hi>Helps;</hi> for the fiue-fingers being the Club-trump turnd vp. The first <hi>Card</hi> dealt him; is the best help but one. Yea all the <hi>Cards</hi> in his hand are <hi>blacke,</hi> and hee hath a faire pull to <hi>rubbe,</hi> for his <hi>ase</hi> colours for it, puting his <hi>Appello</hi> in good hope. But the mischiefe is, after much hard drawing, his <hi>Ase</hi> proues a <hi>Spade.</hi> Well: yet he hath a strong hand of the best <hi>Coates;</hi> and what hee cannot doe by strong hand with <hi>Clubbs,</hi> hee hopes to play his part with the vndermining <hi>Spade,</hi> whereof he is well stored. Onely he misseth the <hi>Ase of Hearts,</hi> which some make an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of <hi>truth,</hi> being alwaies a <hi>Helpe</hi> whatsoeuer is <hi>trumpe;</hi> nor hath he any of that colour.

               <p>Nay pardon me for that; I doe not take vpon mee to be a censurer of bookes, much lesse of <hi>an Appeale to Caesar:</hi> if the Author haue any just cause for which to <hi>Appeal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the points you seeme to propose to me, are matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> wherein the Author seemeth too suspicious of his owne cause, that (like to fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Merchants, who haue run themselues into many mens debt, and danger) hee <hi>appeales</hi> to <hi>Caesar</hi> to haue a <hi>protection</hi> for his person. But blessed be <hi>God,</hi> wee haue a <hi>Caesar, The Defender of the Faith;</hi> not a protector of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugners and vnderminers of the Faith. And for matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> our <hi>Caesar</hi> knowes they ought to be <hi>pleaded</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at <hi>Gods barre,</hi> and <hi>tryed</hi> at the <hi>Common Law</hi> of the <hi>holy Land,</hi> the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Nor will hee giue way for any <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition</hi> out of any <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Chancery,</hi> or <hi>conscience,</hi> which may inhibite the proceeding of <hi>Gods cause,</hi> in <hi>Gods Court,</hi> by any <hi>prerogatiue</hi> whatsoeuer. Therefore in such cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, (causes of <hi>Faith</hi> I say) to <hi>appeale</hi> to <hi>Caesar;</hi> giues (to speake plainly) a strong suspition of the weakenesse at least of the <hi>cause.</hi> For so did <hi>Heretickes</hi> in times past; to maintaine their heresies, they had no other way, but to patronize themselues vnder <hi>Caesars</hi> wings.

The fire raked vp close vnder the ashes, though you neither see nor feele it, yet so it is preserued till the morning, to feede vpon new fewell. A man in a deepe or dead sleepe may seeme dead, but awakening, hee feeles himselfe the more refreshed after his sounder sleepe. So is faith. It is a <hi>seede,</hi> (though but as a <hi>graine</hi> of <hi>mustard seede)</hi> well may it lye hid for a time, yet the while, it is but fastning the root the more firmely to bring forth the better and more abundant fruite. It is the sappe, which in time of winte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry persecutions and afflictions, coucheth close to the heart roote, but the sommer of Gods comforts returning, it displayeth it selfe in leaues and fruits, shewing plainly it was not dead, though to our sense it seemed so. It is the Sun inlightning the soule, which though ecclipsed from our sense, by some interposition of transitory temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, yet retaines his full light, holding on his insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble course, and when this <hi>nubecula pertransibit,</hi> when this cloud is ouer, it sends forth new rayes of grace. It is the soule of the soule, which euen in the middest of extream fainting of the soule, yet remaines intire, without dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution, &amp; by the <hi>aqua caelestis</hi> of Gods neuer failing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, actuates euery faculty of the soule afresh, to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuing of greater workes. It is the ship of good hope, which when couered with waues, sets prayers to awaken Christ asleepe in it, who by and by <hi>stilleth the storme,</hi> or sends his Angel, as to <hi>Paul,</hi> to assure him, that none in this little barke of ours shall perish, but safely arriue vpon <note place="margin">Act: 27 &amp; 28.</note> the hony hauen of <hi>Melita,</hi> euen that true hony-flowing land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> It is a fire, which while raked vp vnder the dead ashes of deepe contrition, though it seeme dead, yeelding neither light nor warmth, to our weake senses, yet it is but fostered for a new fire, that though <hi>heauinesse</hi> for sinne <hi>may indure for a night, yet ioy</hi> of faith <hi>commeth in the morning,</hi> feeding it selfe with the fewell of new works of obedience, flaming forth in a holy conuersation.

faithfull man, as <hi>Dauid,</hi> as <hi>Peter,</hi> may be ouertaken with a dead sleepe of faith: but awakened by grace, his soule is inlightned, that hee sleepes not in death, but as the Sunne arising, <hi>reioyceth as a gyant to runne his course</hi> with greater alacritie and vigor. Thus wee see the fruite of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing faith may be for a time suppressed, yet the roote not supplanted: the act of it may be suspended, yet the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit not lost: it may be ecclipsed to our sense, yet his light not lessened, or his course stayed: it may bee in a <hi>dead sleepe,</hi> yet <hi>liue: faint,</hi> yet not <hi>faile: sicke,</hi> yet <hi>not to death: weather beaton,</hi> yet <hi>not wracked: languish,</hi> yet <hi>not perish.</hi>

               <p>True it is, that without faith and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, there is no saluation; and a man dying impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, is damned. But, we must know, that as faith and repentance are conditions, which God hath ordained, and so requires on our part, though himselfe giue them, and worke them in vs; so they are a part of those meanes, which God hath appointed to attaine the <hi>end of our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And the meanes are such, so fixed and established of God, as they shall alwaies attend vpon his purpose and <note place="margin">The meanes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d God Decree of our saluation, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inseperable God Decreed the meanes, as well as the end.</note> pleasure, in our election to grace and glory. So that as God hath in his eternall decree preordained vs vnto glorie, hee hath also preordained the meanes in time, as the way vnto that glory; so that none of his Elect shall fall through infirmitie into any sinne, as <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> did; but Gods grace, which neuer faileth his, shall raise them vp againe, by the renouation of their faith and repentance, before that any sodaine death shall be able to preuent them, or so, to take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of Christs, and his Fathers hands.

of Gods Praedestination, producing all the meanes and conditions requisite to the end; as the roote of the tree doth the branches and fruits. And this is the expresse Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> most sweetly set downe in the 17. Article, of Praedestination, and Election.</p>

               <p>But this Doctrine, howsoever it may seeme to be true, yet it tendeth to presumption, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall securitie, to commit and continue in sinne. Also <hi>Dauids</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> sinne, if it were not a <hi>totall falling,</hi> it giues too much encouragement to others, to commit the like, or at least, lesse sinnes, boldly.</p>

               <p>No, this doctrine appertaines properly to the faithfull penitent, that if through frailty they haue sinned, they may not bee without hope of mercy, vpon their repentance. So that this doctrine is an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote against desperation, when Gods childe through hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine frailtie is ouercome with a temptation; it is a cordiall of comfort, quickning his hope vnto a godly sorrow. But if it be, or seeme to be a Doctrine of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, it is so to none of Gods Saints, who pray with <hi>Dauid,</hi> as to be <hi>cleansed</hi> from their <hi>secrets faults,</hi> so to be <hi>kept backe from presumptuous sinnes.</hi> And where St. <hi>Iohn</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 19. 1 Ioh. 2. 1.</note> saith, <hi>If any man sinne, we haue an Aduocate, &amp;c.</hi> There hee sets a barracado against presumption in the frontire of it: <hi>My little children, these things write I vnto you, that you sin not.</hi> And God hath his rod likewise, to scare his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from sinning, by presuming on his mercy; for hee saith, <hi>If they sinne, I will visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquitie with stripes.</hi> Yea Gods holy feare is in their hearts, that they shall not by presumption de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from God, as <hi>Ieremy</hi> speakes.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Dauids</hi> sand <hi>Peters</hi> sinne, while we defend it, not to be a totall alling away; we doe not any way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate. it; for they were notwithstanding great and fearefull sinnes, neither of them exemplarie to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, but rather to be auoided.

                  <hi>The Lord Bishop of London, Doctor Bancroft, in publicke audience, with much vehemency, without any checke, dislike, distast, dissent, to stile praedestination a desperate Doctrine?</hi> Is it possible, a Bishop of <hi>the Church of England</hi> should say so? to call <hi>praedestination a desperate Doctrine?</hi> And if he did so, is it credible, that such a speech, so vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoucht in a publike assembly, should passe without hissing? And in what assembly? surely, where were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the most wise, learned, judicious, pious King in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> or in the whole World, the most renowned King IAMES: with many reuerend and learned Diuines.

The <hi>Appealers</hi> wits are too nimble, out-running his his reason by many degrees. Wee must put a clog vpon his heeles, setting downe the whole passage of that vpon <q>this occasion: The Bishop of <hi>London</hi> tooke occasion <note place="margin">Summe of the Conference. pag. 29. line 1.</note> to signifie to his Maiestie, how very many in these dayes, neglecting holinesse of life, presumed too much of persisting of grace, laying all their religion, vpon Praedestination, if I shall bee saued, I shall bee saued; which he tearmed a desperate Doctrine, shewing it to be contrary to good Diuinitie, and the true Doctrine of Praedestination, wherein we should reason rather <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendendo,</hi> then <hi>descendendo,</hi> thus: I liue in obedience to God, in loue with my neighbour, I follow my voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp;c. therefore I trust, that God hath elected me, and praedestinated me to saluation; not thus, which is the vsuall course of argument, God hath praedestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and chosen me to life, therefore though I sinne ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so grieuously, <hi>yet I shall not be damned.</hi>

Let the truth be spoken, especially, where any question doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it to be spoken, that they may receiue it, who are capable of it; least haply, while it is concealed, in regard of those that are not able to receiue it, they who are capable of the truth, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by falshhood may bee detected, bee not onely defrauded of the truth, but may be ouertaken with falshood.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Nonne potius est dicendum verum, &amp;c. Is not the truth rather to be spoken, that he which can receiue, may receiue it: than to be suppressed, that not onely neither can receiue it; but also he that is more intelligent, may be made worse? The enemy of grace is importunate, and vrgeth by all meanes, that it might be beleeued, that it is giuen vnto vs according to our merits, and so grace should now be no more grace; and yet we will not speake that, which by the testimonie of the Scriptures, wee may speake; for we feare, forsooth, lest if wee speake, hee that cannot receiue the truth, be offended: and we feare not, lest while we are silent, he which is able to receiue the truth, may be deceiued by error.

               <p>This place, in my simple judgment, doth not conclude necessarily, and such opinion, as he is charged withall. For, it proveth not, that God in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall decree, had no respect to the corrupt masse in <hi>Adams</hi> fall; <hi>Euery man is created to that end, to which God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained him.</hi> True. For God doth nothing, but for a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

end. But is this <hi>creation</hi> meant of <hi>Adams</hi> first <hi>creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> That is not necessary. For although all men might be said to be created in <hi>Adams</hi> loynes, yet it is onely <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially,</hi> and <hi>seminally.</hi> So that, if <hi>Caluin</hi> may as well bee vnderstood to speake of the particular <hi>creation</hi> of euery man in his generation, as of his generall <hi>creation</hi> in <hi>Adams</hi> loynes before his fall, charity should induce a Christian, to interpret in the better part, where there is not eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the contrary. But what if <hi>Caluin</hi> doe in expresse wordes otherwhere acquit himselfe of what the <hi>Appealer</hi> thus calumniously chargeth him with all in this point? As indeede he doth in sundry places, where he saith. That Gods Election and Praedestination, was not without spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall respect, and reference to <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt masse: as is euident in the 22. chap. of the alledged booke, and seuenth section, saying, <hi>Quaeritur an natura (elects): imò qui alieni erant, trahendo suos facit.</hi> It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <note place="margin">Calu.

And a little after in the same section, <hi>Si quis roget, vnde elegerit, alibi, respondet Christus, Ex mundo, quem à preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus suis excludit, vbi Discipulos Patri commendat. If any aske, whence he chose them, Christ answereth elsewhere, Out of the world, which he excludeth from his prayers, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends his Disciples to his Father.</hi> If then they be chosen out of the world, and the world be meant of all the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as heere; then what else can <hi>Caluin</hi> meane hereby, but that <hi>Gods eternall election</hi> had a <hi>speciall reference</hi> to that world of wickedness packt vp in <hi>Adams</hi> sinfull loynes after his fall, out of which hee made his Election?

And this he did according to the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his will, that no man should glory of his owne, but of Gods good will towards him Out of this purpose of God, is that calling, which is proper to the Elect, to whom all things coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate for good, because, according to his purpose, not their owne, they are called to be Saints, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>And the Apostles next words doe ouerthrow this <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagian</hi> opinion, that God foreknowing mans freewill, did accordingly praedestinate.

               <p>Sir there is the same reason of <hi>reprobation,</hi> that is of <hi>Election,</hi> for both were out of the corrupt mafle wherein all men were equally condemned: whereof some God called, and chose out to life, the rest hee left as hee found them, guiltie of eternall death, and vpon whom the sentence of death had now passed &amp; seazed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17 So that for God to leaue some, whom he would, <hi>wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their blood,</hi> it is an act of his justice: as to free others, an act of his mercie. Which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> very preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly exemplifieth by a Creditor, in whose power it is to acquit some of his Debtors, and to exact of the rest to the vttermost, as we noted afore. This is setforth also in the types of the elect and reprobate, <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> who being yet in the wombe, <hi>before they had done good or euill, that the purpose of God, according to election might stand, not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom 9. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>of workes, but of him that calleth, It was said to her, the elder shall serue the yonger. As it is written, Iacob haue I loued, but Esau haue I hated:</hi> Yet both <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> were equally culpable in the wombe, of originall sinne, and so were children of death, as all were, in the wombe of our first Parents: but the election comes, and that makes a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and puts a difference, mercifully louing one, and justly hating another, and that before they had actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done good or euill, that the purpose of God might stand according to election, not of workes, but of him that calleth. So that the disproportion, alledged by the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7352:41"/>
                  <hi>Appealer,</hi> was not betweene the <hi>elect</hi> and <hi>reprobate,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>act</hi> of <hi>election,</hi> but the <hi>election</hi> caused the <hi>dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,</hi> not through any foreknowledge, or foresight of any good or euill actually to bee done of either (as the <hi>Appealer</hi> would inferre) but Gods meere mercie on the one side, and his justice on the other, caused the <hi>dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</hi> And euen that place quoted by the <hi>Appealer</hi> out of <hi>Ezechiell,</hi> makes altogether against himselfe, though <note place="margin">Ezech. 16.

he is neuer but justly condemned and punished for all his actuall sinnes, springing from that cursed roote.

But as the Apostle saith, <hi>God makes some, vessels of his mercy, to make knowne the riches of his glory; leauing the rest to be vessels of wrath, sitted for destruction, to make knowne his iustice and power.</hi> In a word, if Gods election be an act of meere mercy, then it excludes all respect to any good, that hee could fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see to be in vs: for (as the Apostle saith) <hi>There is at</hi>

               <p>Therefore we must not measure the wisdome of God in his word, by the last or model of our owne braine. Indeede mans reason, when it stands alone, seemeth very selfe-wise. But if it bee compared, and set by Gods wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then the folly of it is by and by discouered. The <hi>Pontificians</hi> haue a plausible reason for their <hi>iustification by workes:</hi> because (say they) it is a meanes to stirre vp men to <hi>good workes.</hi> The <hi>Vniuersalists</hi> haue their plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reason also for their <hi>vniuersality</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> as indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renly offered to all men alike, if they will but receiue it: because (say they) all men may hereby bee won to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the grace offered, and so be saued. But we know, that neither the externall ordinary meanes are equally offered to all. For many thousands haue not the meanes at all, much lesse, in an equall measure. Againe, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes doe of themselues worke no more, but ordinary grace, as illumination, and temporary faith, &amp;c. But the effectual sauing grace, though it be not wrought simply by the ordinary meanes, but by the especiall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7352:43"/>
of Gods Spirit in and by the meanes, yet we know that the ordinary meanes are to bee diligently and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently attended of all men, wheresoeuer God affordeth them.

               <p>Well, how then come wee to bee made partakers of Christ? Namely by the free gift of Christ. It is of Gods free fauour and mercy, that Christ is giuen, not onely for vs, but to vs: that Christ is not onely appointed of

the Father to be a glorious garment to couer our shame, but also the <hi>hand of faith</hi> is giuen vs by the same <hi>grace of God,</hi> whereby we put him on, as the Father in the Gospell commanded the <hi>best robe</hi> to be fecht, and to bee put vpon his conuert <hi>prodigall sonne;</hi> by the same grace our eyes are opened, to behold the glorious sonne of righteousnesse, risen in our horison, bringing life and health vnto vs. And as Christ came vnto vs, so wee must come vnto him: But how? by the same grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that he came vnto vs, wee come vnto him.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7352:45"/>
and man of saluation: seeing not onely for the Father to appoint his Sonnes, to be the Mediatour and Redeemer of mankinde, but also effectually to giue him to all his elect, giuing them grace and faith whereby to receiue him, are two noble inseparable branches growing from one and the same roote of Gods free mercy. Neither can the one stand without the other; for take away this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter act of Gods mercy, inabling vs to receiue Christ, and the former, of appointing Christ to bee the deliuerer, would be altogether frustrate, as depending vpon mans will to receiue, or reiect him, as the <hi>Vniuersalists</hi> falsly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme. Therefore giue God his whole glory, or else yee rob and strip him of all. So that I may say of the <hi>Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> dealing herein, as our learned Master <hi>Hooker</hi> in his tract of <hi>Iustification,</hi> saith of the <hi>Romish Church</hi> in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Redemption by Christ. <hi>They grant</hi> (saith he) <hi>that Christ alone hath performed the worke of Redemption suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently for the saluation of the whole world; but in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this inestimable treasure, that it may be effectuall to their saluation: how demurely soeuer they confesse, that they seeke remission of sins, no otherwise then by the blood of Christ, vsing humbly the meanes appointed by him, to apply the benefit of holy blood; they teach indeede so many things pernicious in Christian faith, in setting downe the meanes, whereof they speake, that the very foundation of faith, which they hold, is thereby plainely ouerthrowne, and the force of the blood of Iesus Christ extinguished.</hi> So he. The very like may be applyed to the <hi>Appealer.</hi> For he, with his <hi>Arminians,</hi> howsoeuer they acknowledge the <hi>meere mercy of God,</hi> in prouiding such an all-sufficient Sauiour to redeeme mankinde; yet they marre all in their applying this plaister of mercy, while they would doe it with the hand of <hi>freewill,</hi> the <hi>foresight</hi> whereof was (forsooth) the first mouer of <hi>Gods meere mercy.</hi> Sure if so, they must needes abate no small part from <hi>meere mercy.</hi> For how is it <hi>meere mercy,</hi> if any good in vs <hi>foreseene,</hi> first caused it, that it should offer a Sauiour to vs?</p>

as naturall men, a naturall freewill still; it is no more lost, then other naturall faculties, the poore reliques of <hi>Adams</hi> perfections: but this will is but naturall, it reacheth no higher, then to naturall obiects.

But the case is plaine, all that their Doctrine driueth at, is to aduance mans naturall freewill vnto grace, as much as is possible. Therefore they say, that these <hi>remaines</hi> of <hi>freewill</hi> in man, though much lessened, and sore bruised with <hi>Adams</hi> fall, yet neede but a kinde of stirring vp, and awakning as it were, oriogging on the elbow, or helping vp being downe.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7352:55"/>
                  <hi>Iames:</hi> it is too commonly abused. For marke, first, hee saith not, <hi>As the body without the soule is dead;</hi> but, <hi>as the body without the spirit, is dead.</hi> The <hi>spirit</hi> is the <hi>breath,</hi> by which the <hi>body</hi> is knowne to <hi>liue.</hi> So that the <hi>body</hi> receiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>life</hi> from the <hi>soule,</hi> but sheweth it by the <hi>spirit,</hi> which it breatheth. The <hi>spirit</hi> then is an <hi>effect</hi> and <hi>signe,</hi> not a <hi>cause</hi> of the <hi>life</hi> of the <hi>body.</hi> So <hi>charity,</hi> and the workes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, are a <hi>fruite</hi> and <hi>effect breathing</hi> from <hi>sauing faith, testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> that it is a <hi>liuing faith,</hi> not <hi>causing</hi> it so to be; for that were to turne the <hi>tree</hi> vpside downe, as if the <hi>roote,</hi> which is <hi>faith,</hi> should receiue <hi>life, sap,</hi> and <hi>groweth</hi> from the <hi>branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</hi> And it is plaine, by the whole analogy and tenure of the chapter, that the Apostle speakes of <hi>good workes,</hi> as they are <hi>demonstratiue signes</hi> and <hi>fruits</hi> of a <hi>liuing faith,</hi> not as <hi>causes</hi> of it. Againe, he putteth a distinct difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the <hi>true sauing faith,</hi> which alwaies shewes it selfe to <hi>liue,</hi> by the <hi>fruits</hi> of it; for it is that <hi>faith,</hi> euer work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by loue: and betweene a <hi>false counterfeit faith,</hi> such as is <hi>dead,</hi> and <hi>knowne</hi> to bee so, by the not <hi>breathing</hi> out of <hi>good workes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the true <hi>sauing iustifying faith,</hi> is that, <hi>which worketh by loue.</hi> So the Apostle saith. But how by loue? as by the <hi>efficient mouing cause</hi> of the <hi>working</hi> of it, or rather as the <hi>instrumentall cause, moued</hi> by the <hi>hand</hi> of <hi>faith? Loue</hi> is <hi>faiths instrument,</hi> whereby it worketh. Yea it is an <hi>insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable quality of sauing faith,</hi> whereby <hi>faith</hi> workes: as the <hi>heat</hi> is the inseperable quality of the <hi>fire,</hi> whereby the fire worketh. This is the Doctrine also of the ancient Fathers. They so make <hi>faith</hi> the <hi>roote,</hi> as that all other <hi>graces</hi> are <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically</hi> in <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>spring</hi> from it. They make all other holy <hi>graces</hi> to be <hi>inherent</hi> in <hi>sauing faith,</hi> as the <hi>natiue qualities</hi> of it, <hi>essentiall</hi> and <hi>inseparable,</hi> not as <hi>accidents</hi> which are <hi>seperable.</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>What is it to beleeue in him?
